  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MOLASSES MIXTURE ===
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1                cup  dark molasses
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
                        === APRICOT AND APPLE ===
  1                cup  dried apricots - (6-oz pkg) -- julienned
  1 1/2           cups  apple cider
     3/4           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
  8                     Granny Smith, Braeburn, or pippin apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
                        === CAKE LAYER ===
  3 1/4           cups  flour
  2          teaspoons  ground ginger
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  1              large  egg
                        Whipped cream -- for serving

To make the Molasses Mixture:  In a tall 6-quart pan, bring the water and molasses to a boil.  Remove from heat and stir in the baking soda.  The mixture will foam up.  Set aside to cool.

In a small saucepan, bring the apricots and 1 cup of the apple cider to a boil.  Remove from heat and let the apricots plump for about 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spray a 9- by 13-inch baking dish with vegetable oil cooking spray.

In a medium saucepan, blend the brown sugar and cornstarch.  Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup apple cider, the butter, cinnamon, salt, and cloves.  Cook over medium heat until clear and thickened.  Stir in all but 1/4 cup of the plumped apricots.  Stir in all but 3/4 cup of the apples.  Pour the mixture into the prepared dish; set aside.

To make the Cake Layer:  Sift the flour, ginger, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, pepper, and salt together into a medium bowl; set aside.

In a mixer bowl, using the mixer on high speed, cream the brown sugar and butter until light and fluffy.  Add the egg, beating until creamy.  On low speed, alternately blend in the dry ingredients and the molasses mixture.  The batter will be thin.  Stir in the reserved apricots and apples.  Pour the cake batter over the fruit layer in the baking dish.  Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted just into the cake layer comes out clean.  Let cool slightly and serve with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4         pound  butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  freshly-grated orange zest -- plus
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated orange zest
  2              large  eggs
     2/3           cup  orange juice
     2/3           cup  milk
     2/3           cup  finely-chopped apricots
     2/3           cup  chopped walnuts
  3               cups  cranberries -- picked over, and
                        chopped in a food processor

Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Cream the butter and sugar in a large bowl.  Beat in the orange zest and eggs, 1 at a time.  Add the orange juice and milk and beat until mixed thoroughly.  It will appear curdled.

Add the flour mixture and beat until it is just moistened.  Stir in the apricots, walnuts, and cranberries.

Place baking rack in middle of the oven.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour 5 (5 3/4- by 2 1/4-inch) loaf pans.

Pour the batter into the pans.  Bake for 45 minutes.  Test for doneness with a toothpick -- it should come out clean.  Remove the bread from the pans, transfer to a wire rack, and let them cool on their sides.

This recipe yields 5 small loaves.

Comments:  These breads, wrapped well in aluminum oil and plastic wrap, keep for 1 week in the refrigerator or frozen for a month.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PRALINE ===
     1/3           cup  pecans -- coarsely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper -- or more to taste
  3        tablespoons  sugar
                        === FOR THE DRESSING ===
     1/2      teaspoon  grainy Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === FOR THE SALAD ===
  8               cups  arugula - (loosely packed)
     3/4           cup  coarsely-grated aged Gouda, Manchego,
                        Asiago, or Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/3           cup  dried cherries

To make the praline, lightly oil a large baking sheet.  Toss the pecans with the salt and cayenne in a small bowl.  Place the sugar in a heavy skillet or saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring gently, until the sugar starts to melt.  Stop stirring and continue cooking, swirling the skillet or pan often, until the sugar cooks to a dark golden caramel.  Add the pecan mixture and carefully stir to coat the nuts with caramel.  Pour onto the baking sheet and spread evenly with a knife.  Cool completely.  Crack the praline into pieces, then finely chop on a cutting board.

To prepare the dressing, whisk the mustard, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.  Slowly whisk in the olive oil to form a smooth dressing.

Arrange the arugula in the center of a large serving bowl.  Sprinkle on the cheese, cherries, and praline.  Toss with just enough of the dressing to thoroughly coat the leaves.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Spring/Summer Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (2" long) -- peeled, minced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                     boneless pork chop - (1/2 lb) -- cut thin strips
  2                     scallions -- white and 1" of
                        green parts, thinly sliced
  1                     carrot -- julienned
  1              large  red bell pepper -- julienned
  1                cup  thinly-sliced Napa cabbage
     1/4           cup  chicken stock
                        = (preferably homemade)
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  30            square  wonton wrappers
                        === SOY SESAME DIPPING SAUCE ===
  6        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Asian (toasted) sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  sugar

To make the egg roll, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat.  Add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring until slightly softened, about 2 minutes.  Add the pork and stir until it turns white, about 2 minutes.  Transfer the pork to a plate and set aside.

Add the scallions, carrot, and red pepper to the skillet.  Cook, stirring, until slightly softened, about 2 minutes.  Add the cabbage, stock, and soy sauce.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the liquid has evaporated and the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.  Return the pork to the skillet and let the contents of the skillet cool to room temperature.  You should have about 2 cups.

Lay the wrappers flat on a work surface.  Brush the edges lightly with water.  Top with about 1 tablespoon of the filling and roll into a cylinder, tucking in the sides and pressing the edges to seal.  (The egg rolls can be frozen at this point.)

Heat the remaining olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until almost smoking.  Working in batches, add the rolls and cook, turning often with tongs, until golden brown on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes.  Cool slightly before serving.

Soy Sesame Dipping Sauce:  To make the dipping sauce, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, and sugar in a small bowl.  Stir well and serve on the side with the rolls.  (Makes 1/2 cup)

This recipe yields 30 egg rolls.

     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  heavy cream
  3               cups  whole milk
     1/4           cup  cornstarch

Whisk about 1 cup hot caramel mixture into egg mixture until well blended, then whisk egg mixture back into caramel.  Continue whisking off the heat for 1 minute.

Whisk 1/2 cup hot caramel pudding into chopped chocolate, stirring until smooth.  Spoon chocolate pudding into 6 (8-ounce) parfait glasses, then top with caramel pudding.  Chill until set, at least 3 hours.

  4                     allspice berries
  1                     bay leaf
  3             pounds  well-marbled beef chuck -- cut 2 1/2" pieces
  1                     slab bacon - (8 oz)
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  1         tablespoon  softened unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        All-purpose flour -- for dredging, plus
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1              pound  pearl onions -- blanched, and
                        carefully peeled
  1              pinch  sugar
  1              pound  small cremini or button mushrooms
  1         tablespoon  flour
                        === PARSLEY-RIMMED CROUTONS ===
  6             slices  firm white bread -- crusts removed,
                        and cut into 6 circles
  3        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  very finely-minced fresh parsley leaves

In a large bowl, combine the red wine, beef stock, brandy, onion, carrots, garlic, parsley sprigs, thyme, rosemary, peppercorns, cloves, allspice, and bay leaf and stir well.  Add the beef and stir.  Refrigerate, covered, overnight.

Drain the beef and reserve the marinade and vegetables separately.  Pat the beef dry with paper towels.  Set the beef and vegetables aside.

Preheat the oven to 275 degrees.

Remove the outer rind of the slab bacon.  Cut the bacon into lardons: 1 inch long strips about 1/4-inch thick.  In a small saucepan, cover the lardons and the rind with cold water and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat, and simmer for 3 minutes.  Drain the lardons and rind, pat them dry, and reserve both.

Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat.  Add the lardons and cook, stirring, until crisp and their fat has rendered.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the lardons to paper towels to drain.

Season the beef with salt and pepper, dredge in the flour, and shake off any excess.

Raise the heat to high and, working in batches, brown the beef.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beef to a plate.  Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat and return to high heat.  Add the reserved vegetable mixture and tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned, about 5 minutes.

Return all of the browned beef to the pot.  Add the reserved marinade liquid, and reserved bacon rind.  Bring to a boil and season with salt and pepper.  Transfer the stew to the oven and cook, covered, until the beef is very tender, about 3 hours.

Remove the stew from the oven.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beef to a plate.  Strain the liquid and discard the solids.  Return the beef and strained broth to the Dutch oven with the lardons.

Put the pearl onions in a skillet with 1 tablespoon of butter and the sugar.  Cover the onions with water and season with salt and pepper.  Simmer the onions over medium-high heat until almost tender.  Raise heat to high, and reduce the cooking liquid to about 2 tablespoons.  Continue to cook the onions, shaking the pan over the heat, until the onions are golden brown and glazed.  Transfer the onions to the stew.

Heat 3 tablespoons of butter in another skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper.  Cook the mushrooms, tossing often, until golden brown, about 7 minutes.  Transfer the mushrooms to the stew.

In a small bowl, cream together the tablespoon of softened butter with the tablespoon of flour.  Roll the mixture into pea-sized pieces.

Bring the stew to a simmer and, while stirring gently, add enough beurre manie, bit by bit, to lightly thicken the sauce.

Divide the stew among 6 shallow soup plates and garnish each with a crouton.  Serve immediately with pasta or boiled potatoes.

For the Parsley-Rimmed Croutons:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Brush both sides of the bread with the butter and arrange them on a baking sheet.  Bake the croutons until golden brown.  Dip the edges of the bread in the stew to moisten; then in parsley to lightly coat the edges.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

     1/2           cup  manioc flour*
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2              large  eggs -- beaten

  1                     orange -- cut into wedges

* Note:  Manioc flour, also called cassava or tapioca flour, is available from specialty food stores.

Make the Beans:  In a large bowl, add the beans and cover with cold water by 2 inches.  Let the beans soak in the refrigerator overnight.  Drain.

Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Adobo:  In small bowl, whisk together cumin, coriander, salt, cayenne, and adobo seasoning.

Add the garlic and bay leaves to the onion and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the beans, water, ham hocks, and half of the adobo.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the beans are very tender, about 2 hours.  Remove the ham hocks and pull and shred the meat.  Add the meat back to the stew and discard the bones.  (The stew can be made up to this point up to 3 days ahead.)

Make the Meat:  In a large bowl, toss the sausages with the remaining adobo.

Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat.  Working in batches, brown the sausages and transfer them to a plate.  Roughly chop the sausages and stir them into the stew.  Return the skillet to high heat and, working in batches, brown the beef and pork and add them to the stew.

Return the stew to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes more.

When ready to serve, arrange a mound of rice in the center of 8 plates and spoon some of the stew over the top of each.  Spoon some of the pico de gallo and greens on opposite sides of the stew.  Sprinkle with the farofa and chopped scallion and garnish with orange wedges.

For the Pico de Gallo:  In a large bowl, mix together all the ingredients.  Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.  (Makes about 4 cups)

For the Sauteed Greens:  Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the greens and wine and cook, stirring, until wilted.  Lower the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Makes 8 side-dish servings)

For the Farofa:  Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the bacon and cook, stirring, until its fat has rendered.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Add manioc flour and cook, stirring, until golden brown and toasted.  Add the butter and cook, stirring, until absorbed.  Add the eggs and scallion and cook, stirring, until scrambled.  Season with salt, to taste.  Transfer to the farofa to a bowl and let cool slightly.  (Makes about 2 cups)

This recipe yields 8 main-course servings.

<DirS>
<DirT>
* Note:  Manioc flour, also called cassava or tapioca flour, is available from specialty food stores.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the Beans:  In a large bowl, add the beans and cover with cold water by 2 inches.  Let the beans soak in the refrigerator overnight.  Drain.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 8 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, make the Adobo:  In small bowl, whisk together cumin, coriander, salt, cayenne, and adobo seasoning.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the garlic and bay leaves to the onion and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the beans, water, ham hocks, and half of the adobo.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the beans are very tender, about 2 hours.  Remove the ham hocks and pull and shred the meat.  Add the meat back to the stew and discard the bones.  (The stew can be made up to this point up to 3 days ahead.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the Meat:  In a large bowl, toss the sausages with the remaining adobo.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat.  Working in batches, brown the sausages and transfer them to a plate.  Roughly chop the sausages and stir them into the stew.  Return the skillet to high heat and, working in batches, brown the beef and pork and add them to the stew.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the stew to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes more.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, arrange a mound of rice in the center of 8 plates and spoon some of the stew over the top of each.  Spoon some of the pico de gallo and greens on opposite sides of the stew.  Sprinkle with the farofa and chopped scallion and garnish with orange wedges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Pico de Gallo:  In a large bowl, mix together all the ingredients.  Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.  (Makes about 4 cups)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Sauteed Greens:  Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the greens and wine and cook, stirring, until wilted.  Lower the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Makes 8 side-dish servings)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Farofa:  Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the bacon and cook, stirring, until its fat has rendered.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Add manioc flour and cook, stirring, until golden brown and toasted.  Add the butter and cook, stirring, until absorbed.  Add the eggs and scallion and cook, stirring, until scrambled.  Season with salt, to taste.  Transfer to the farofa to a bowl and let cool slightly.  (Makes about 2 cups)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 main-course servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  2 1/4           cups  warm water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  6               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 7)
                        Cornmeal -- as needed
                        White distilled vinegar -- as needed

In a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook combine the yeast and water, mixing slowly until yeast is dissolved.  Stir in salt and sugar.  Mix well.  Set aside for 5 minutes.

Beat for 5 minutes, gradually adding flour until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.

Turn out on a lightly floured surface.  Knead for 8 to 10 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic, adding flour as necessary to prevent stickiness.

Lightly oil a large bowl.  Place dough in bowl and turn to coat on all sides.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.  Alternatively, cover with plastic wrap and let rise slowly in the refrigerator for 10 to 12 hours or overnight.

Line a baking sheet with kitchen parchment or sprinkle with cornmeal.

Punch down the dough.  Divide in half, shape into 2 round loaves, and place on the baking sheet.  Carve an X in the top of the loaf and spray with vinegar.  Place in a cold oven and turn the oven on to 400 degrees for 45 minutes.  Transfer to wire rack to cool.

This recipe yields 2 loaves.

Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  leeks, white and pale green parts only
                        = (abt 2 bunches)
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/4      teaspoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  white vermouth
  3 1/2           cups  chicken broth
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4          teaspoons  finely-sliced fresh chives -- for garnish
                        === RACLETTE CHEESE TOASTS ===
  1                     whole-grain baguette or
                        other whole-grain country-style loaf
  8             ounces  cold raclette
  4          teaspoons  whole-grain mustard

Halve leeks lengthwise and thinly slice crosswise.  In a large bowl of cold, water wash leeks well and lift from water into a large sieve to drain.

In a 6-quart heavy soup pot, cook leeks in butter over moderately-low heat, stirring occasionally, until some begin to turn golden, about 40 minutes.  Stir in sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes.  Stir in vermouth and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is evaporated and most leeks are golden, 10 to 15 minutes.

Deglaze pot with 1/2 cup broth and cook, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes more, until liquid is evaporated and leeks are deep golden.  Add remaining 3 cups broth and bring soup just to a boil.  Season soup with salt and pepper.

For the Raclette Cheese Toasts:  Diagonally cut 8 (1/2-inch thick) slices from the bread, reserving remainder for another use.  On a baking sheet toast 1 side of bread slices under broiler about 4 inches from heat and leave broiler on.

Using a cheese plane, thinly slice raclette.  Turn the bread over and spread 1/2 teaspoon mustard on untoasted side of each slice.  Top toasts with cheese and broil until cheese is just melted, about 2 minutes.  (Makes 8 toasts)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Remove pans from oven and divide remaining 2 tablespoons butter among cornstick molds.  Quickly divide batter among molds (about 3 tablespoons each) and bake until a tester comes out clean and tops are golden, 12 to 15 minutes.

Cool cornsticks in pans 3 to 5 minutes before removing from molds.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 14 corn sticks.

Comments:  If using a cast iron skillet, pour all of batter into it and bake 15 to 20 minutes.

  1                cup  morel or small crimini mushrooms
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  white wine

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN AND MARINADE ===
  2              whole  skinless boneless chicken breasts - -- (abt 1 1/4 lbs)
     3/4           cup  sweetened flaked coconut
  2          teaspoons  chopped peeled fresh gingerroot
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
     1/2           cup  hot water
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3                     scallions -- chopped fine
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped fine
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated peeled fresh gingerroot
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  creamy or chunky peanut butter
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  distilled white vinegar
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/4      teaspoon  dried hot red pepper flakes
  32                    bamboo skewers - (7" long)

Make the Chicken And Marinade:  Cut the chicken lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices, and season them with salt and pepper.

In a blender, blend together the coconut, the gingerroot, the curry powder, the lime juice, and the hot water until the mixture is smooth, strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on the solids, and let the marinade cool.  The marinade may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled.

In a large shallow dish, pour the marinade over the chicken, coating the chicken well, and let the chicken marinate, covered and chilled, for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.  (Do not let the chicken marinate longer or the meat will break down.)

Soak the bamboo skewers in water to cover for 15 minutes.  Thread the chicken onto the skewers.

Make the Sauce:  In a saucepan heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook scallions, garlic and ginger, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Stir in remaining ingredients and bring to a simmer, stirring.  Simmer sauce, stirring, until smooth and cool to room temperature.  Sauce may be made up to 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.  If sauce is too thick after chilling, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons hot water until sauce reaches desired consistency.

Grill the chicken with the marinade clinging to it on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or until it is cooked through, and serve the sates with the dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 32 sates.

Make the Chicken And Marinade:  Cut the chicken lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices, and season them with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a blender, blend together the coconut, the gingerroot, the curry powder, the lime juice, and the hot water until the mixture is smooth, strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on the solids, and let the marinade cool.  The marinade may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large shallow dish, pour the marinade over the chicken, coating the chicken well, and let the chicken marinate, covered and chilled, for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.  (Do not let the chicken marinate longer or the meat will break down.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Soak the bamboo skewers in water to cover for 15 minutes.  Thread the chicken onto the skewers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the Sauce:  In a saucepan heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook scallions, garlic and ginger, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Stir in remaining ingredients and bring to a simmer, stirring.  Simmer sauce, stirring, until smooth and cool to room temperature.  Sauce may be made up to 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.  If sauce is too thick after chilling, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons hot water until sauce reaches desired consistency.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grill the chicken with the marinade clinging to it on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or until it is cooked through, and serve the sates with the dipping sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 32 sates.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves - -- (abt 6 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt -- plus
                        extra as needed
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- plus
                        extra as needed
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              small  shallot -- minced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2             medium  fresh tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
                        = (or 2 cups store-bought fresh salsa)
  1                cup  chicken stock

Add the shallot and garlic to the skillet.  Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the tomatoes or salsa, stir in the stock, and simmer for 8 minutes.

Return the chicken to the skillet and simmer, turning often, until the chicken is warmed through and the sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes.  Transfer the chicken to warm serving plates.

Stir in the basil and season the sauce with salt and pepper.  Spoon over the chicken and serve at once.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PARSNIPS ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying
  1                     parsnip -- peeled, and
                        cut into thin strips
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        === MASHED POTATOES ===
     3/4         pound  Yukon Gold potatoes -- whole, if small,
                        halved if large, peeled
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
  2             medium  shallots -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  well-shaken low-fat buttermilk
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BASIL OIL ===
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves - (packed) -- blanched
     1/4                olive oil
  1              pinch  kosher salt
                        === ESCAROLE ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1               head  escarole - (abt 1 lb) -- cut 1" pieces
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CHICKEN ===
  4                     chicken scaloppini - (6 oz ea)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        === EQUIPMENT ===
                        An empty 15- to 16-oz can -- opened on both sides

Parsnips:  In a heavy saucepan, pour enough oil to reach a depth of 1 inch and heat to 360 degrees on a deep-fat thermometer.  Fry parsnip strips in batches until golden brown, transferring with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.  Season frizzled parsnip with salt.

Mashed potatoes:  Combine the potatoes with enough salted water to cover by 1 inch in a saucepan and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.  While the potatoes are simmering, cook the shallots in butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, stirring, until softened and deep golden, about 8 minutes.  Drain potatoes, return to saucepan, and coarsely mash with a potato masher.  Stir shallots into potatoes with buttermilk and season with salt and pepper.  Place the pot over low heat, with a lid slightly ajar, to keep warm.

Meanwhile, make the Basil Oil:  In a blender, puree the basil, oil, and salt.  Using a fine-meshed sieve, strain the basil oil and transfer it to a squeeze bottle.  Set aside.

Escarole:  Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the escarole in 3 batches, tossing each batch with tongs until wilted before adding the next, and season with salt and pepper.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, until tender, about 3 minutes.  Raise the heat to high, remove the lid, and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes more.  Transfer the escarole to a kitchen towel and wring out excess liquid.  Return the escarole to the skillet and set aside covered to keep warm.

Chicken:  Season the scaloppini with salt and pepper.  Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the scaloppini and cook, turning once, until lightly browned and just cooked through, about 4 minutes.  Transfer the scaloppini to a cutting board and cut them in into 3-inch wide pieces.

Place the empty can on a plate and spoon in some of the mashed potato, top with some of the chicken, and then some of the greens.  Repeat to make 3 more layers and press down gently to compact them.  Carefully remove the can and make 3 more "towers".  Top each tower with some of the frizzled parsnips and drizzle some the basil oil around.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  mixed raspberries and
                        quartered strawberries - (to 5)
     1/2           cup  sugar -- divided
  2        tablespoons  amaretto -- or to taste
  3              large  egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  dry Marsala
     1/2           cup  chilled heavy cream

In a large bowl, mix together the berries, 1/4 cup sugar, and amaretto.  Set aside to macerate for 15 minutes or up to 1 hour at room temperature.

Meanwhile, make the zabaglione:  Set an instant-read thermometer in a cup of hot water.  In a metal bowl, with a whisk or a hand-held electric mixer, beat together the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, egg yolks, and Marsala until well combined.  Set bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water and beat mixture until tripled in volume and thermometer registers 140 degrees, about 5 minutes.  To ensure that eggs are cooked, beat mixture 3 minutes more.  Set the bowl in a bowl of ice water and continue beating until chilled.

In another bowl, beat the heavy cream to stiff peaks.  In 3 additions, fold the whipped cream into the zabaglione and store in the refrigerator.

When ready to serve, divide the fruit among stemmed glasses or bowls and spoon the chilled zabaglione over the top.  Serve.

In a large bowl, mix together the berries, 1/4 cup sugar, and amaretto.  Set aside to macerate for 15 minutes or up to 1 hour at room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, make the zabaglione:  Set an instant-read thermometer in a cup of hot water.  In a metal bowl, with a whisk or a hand-held electric mixer, beat together the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, egg yolks, and Marsala until well combined.  Set bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water and beat mixture until tripled in volume and thermometer registers 140 degrees, about 5 minutes.  To ensure that eggs are cooked, beat mixture 3 minutes more.  Set the bowl in a bowl of ice water and continue beating until chilled.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In another bowl, beat the heavy cream to stiff peaks.  In 3 additions, fold the whipped cream into the zabaglione and store in the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, divide the fruit among stemmed glasses or bowls and spoon the chilled zabaglione over the top.  Serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     dates - (abt 3 oz) -- chopped
                        = (preferably Medjool)
     1/4           cup  cognac
     1/2           cup  whole skinned almonds - (slightly heaping) -- toasted and ground
     1/3           cup  shredded unsweetened coconut -- toasted
  4             ounces  bittersweet chocolate
  4              large  egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  fine salt
  12       tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cocoa powder -- plus
  2          teaspoons  cocoa powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
                        Butter -- for greasing
                        ramekins
                        === CHOCOLATE-ALMOND WAFER ===
  16            ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped small pieces
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
  1                cup  whole skinned almonds -- toasted and ground
                        === COCONUT-COGNAC SAUCE ===
  3               cups  coconut milk
  6        tablespoons  cognac
  6        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Combine the dates and cognac in a bowl and let macerate about 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a medium bowl, combine the macerated dates, almonds, and coconut.  Mix until the ingredients come together into a paste.

Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a saucepan of simmering water.  Stir the melted chocolate into the date mixture and set aside.

In another bowl, whip together the egg whites and salt until they just begin to form soft peaks.  While slowly adding the sugar, continue whipping the whites until they form firm peaks.  Fold in the cocoa, cardamom, and ginger until just combined.  Working in 3 batches, gently fold the whipped egg whites into the date-chocolate mixture until just combined.

Scoop chocolate batter into buttered ramekins or molds.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cake comes out dry, about 12 minutes.  Lower the oven to 325 degrees.

To serve, unmold the cakes onto a baking sheet and top each with a chilled chocolate-almond wafer.  Put the cakes into the oven and bake until the wafer just melts, about 15 seconds.  Spoon a small pool of sauce onto plates, and gently place the cakes into the sauce.  Serve.

For the Chocolate-Almond Wafer:  Put the chocolate into a bowl.  Bring the cream to a gentle simmer, pour over the chocolate, and stir with a rubber spatula until smooth.  Fold in the spices and nuts.  Spread the chocolate batter evenly onto a silicone mat or wax paper-lined baking sheet and chill until firm, about 30 minutes.  Using a round cookie cutter, cut the wafer into discs that are slightly larger than the top of the cakes.  (Makes about 12 wafers)

For the Coconut-Cognac Sauce:  Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan.  Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently, reduced and thickened.  (Makes about 3 cups)

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Candies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  20            ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped small pieces
     3/4           cup  heavy cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
  6        tablespoons  corn syrup
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  6        tablespoons  raspberry liqueur - (to 7)
                        = (such as framboise)
                        Cocoa powder -- for dusting

Put 12 ounces of the chocolate in a bowl.  Whisk together the cream and corn syrup in a saucepan and bring to a simmer.  Pour over the chocolate and whisk until thoroughly combined and smooth.  Whisk in butter until smooth and glossy.  Add the raspberry liqueur and mix well.

Pour the chocolate into a deep pan and chill.  When the chocolate is firm, scoop out small truffle balls, using a melon baller or other small scoop.  (Dip scoop in very hot water before each scoop, patting each time onto a towel to avoid getting water into the chocolate mixture.)  Chill truffles slightly, and then perfect the circular shape by rolling quickly in palms of your hands.  Store the truffles in the refrigerator until ready to finish.

To finish the truffles:  Melt the remaining 8 ounces of chocolate in a bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, stirring occasionally.  Set the bowl aside and let cool slightly, stirring occasionally, until just cooler than body temperature.

Put enough cocoa powder in a bowl to form a small pile.  Wearing rubber gloves and working with 1 truffle at a time, rub some of the melted chocolate all over the truffles and roll quickly in your hands until smooth.  Drop the truffles into the cocoa powder, roll to coat completely, and transfer to a platter.  Store in a cool, dry place.

This recipe yields about 6 to 8 servings.

  1            package  frozen puff pastry - (17 1/4 oz) -- thawed
  1              large  egg -- beaten

Quarter and thinly slice the mushrooms.  Heat the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and any liquid mushrooms give off has evaporated.  Add broth and cream and simmer 15 minutes.

In a blender, puree half of mixture (use caution when blending hot liquids).  Stir puree and Sherry into the soup remaining in pan.  Heat soup until hot, season with salt and pepper, and set aside to cool.

Divide the soup among 4 (1 1/2- to 2-cup) deep, oven-safe bowls about 5 to 6 inches in diameter, and stir some of the chives into each.

Using a pizza cutter, cut out discs from the puff pastry about 1/2-inch larger in diameter than the width of the soup bowls.  Brush the inner edges of the pastry disks with some of the beaten egg.  Invert the pastry discs (egg washed-side down) over the soup bowls and press the edges onto the sides to seal.  Brush the tops with some of the beaten egg.  Refrigerate for 1 hour or up to a day in advance.

When ready to serve:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Put the soup bowls on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, puffed, and steaming, about 30 minutes.  Serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

        Crispy Roast Duck With Mustard And Green Peppercorn Sauce

Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Long Island (Pekin) ducks - (5 lbs ea)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2              small  onions -- coarsely chopped
  2              small  carrots -- coarsely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- smashed with the
                        side of a knife
  1                cup  dry red wine
  2              small  celery ribs -- coarsely chopped
  4                     fresh thyme sprigs
                        = (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme)
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns
  1                     bay leaf, preferably Turkish -- broken in half
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2              quart  chicken stock
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  4        tablespoons  bottled green peppercorns -- drained
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity of the ducks and reserve.  Cut the wings off the ducks and reserve.  Rinse the ducks under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels.  Using the tip of a sharp paring knife, prick the ducks all over, inserting knife at an angle to pierce just the skin, not the flesh.

Season the ducks well with salt and pepper.  Place them on a rack in a shallow roasting pan and roast until browned and crisp, 1 1/4 hours.  Remove the roasting pan at 30 minute intervals, drain off the fat, and again prick the skin.

While the ducks are roasting, rinse the neck, giblets, and wings and pat dry.  Cut the wings and the neck into several pieces.  Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the neck, giblets, and wings.  Cook, stirring often, until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.  Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion, carrot, and garlic.  Cook until the vegetables are lightly browned and softened, 5 to 8 minutes.

Increase the heat to medium-high and pour in the wine.  Bring to a boil, stirring to pick up any browned bits on the bottom.  Boil until almost all of the liquid has evaporated.  Add the celery, thyme, black peppercorns, bay leaf, tomato paste, and stock.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, skimming off any scum that rises to the surface, until the ducks are ready to come out of the oven.

When the ducks are done, transfer to a carving board, cover loosely with foil, and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes.

While the ducks are resting, strain the stock and discard the solids.  Measure the liquid.  If there is less than 2 cups, add water to measure this amount and pour into a small saucepan.  If there is more than 2 cups, return to the saucepan and boil until reduced to this amount.

Bring the liquid back to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Combine the flour and butter in a small heatproof bowl and use a fork to work it into a smooth paste.  Add a little of the stock to the paste and whisk until smooth.  Pour the flour mixture into the saucepan and simmer, whisking, until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the green peppercorns.

Remove the saucepan from the heat, stir in the mustard, and season the sauce with salt and pepper.  Cut the ducks into serving pieces.  Spoon a small amount of the sauce over the duck and serve warm with any remaining sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Halloween                       Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  trimmed beets (without tops) -- unpeeled
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  12                    oranges -- rind and pith cut
                        free with a serrated knife and sections
                        cut away from the membranes
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated orange zest
     1/3           cup  fresh orange juice
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  distilled vinegar
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     red onions -- thinly sliced
                        Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley -- for garnish

In a pot, combine the beets with the red wine vinegar and enough cold water to cover them by 2 inches.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer until tender, about 40 minutes.  Drain the beets and let them cool.  (The beets may be cooked 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.)  Peel the beets and cut them into 1-inch wedges.

In a small saucepan, combine zest, orange juice, sugar, and vinegar and boil the mixture until it is reduced to about 1/4 cup.  Let the mixture cool.

In a large bowl, whisk together the orange mixture, oil, and salt and pepper to form a smooth dressing.  Add the beet slices, orange segments, and onion and mix until well combined.  Let stand at room temperature, or refrigerate for up to 6 hours, to let the flavors come together.  Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with the parsley.

This recipe yields about 8 servings.

In a pot, combine the beets with the red wine vinegar and enough cold water to cover them by 2 inches.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer until tender, about 40 minutes.  Drain the beets and let them cool.  (The beets may be cooked 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.)  Peel the beets and cut them into 1-inch wedges.

<DirT>
In a small saucepan, combine zest, orange juice, sugar, and vinegar and boil the mixture until it is reduced to about 1/4 cup.  Let the mixture cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, whisk together the orange mixture, oil, and salt and pepper to form a smooth dressing.  Add the beet slices, orange segments, and onion and mix until well combined.  Let stand at room temperature, or refrigerate for up to 6 hours, to let the flavors come together.  Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with the parsley.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN WINGS ===
  3             pounds  chicken wings - (12 to 14)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === GAI YANG SAUCE ===
  2              small  fresh hot red chiles - (abt 2" long)
                        = (such as Thai or serrano)

     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
     2/3           cup  white wine vinegar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt

Cut off wing tips, reserving for another use, and halve wings at joint.  In a bowl whisk together oil, lemon juice, and salt, to taste.  Add wings and stir to coat.  Marinate wings, covered and chilled, at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours.

To make Gai Yang Sauce:  Wearing protective gloves, mince chiles.  Mince garlic and in a small saucepan simmer with chiles and remaining ingredients, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes.  Cool sauce to room temperature.  The gai yang sauce may be made 1 day ahead, covered and chilled.  Bring sauce to room temperature before serving.

Prepare grill.  Drain wings in a colander and pat dry.  Grill wings on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until cooked through and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes on each side.  Serve wings with sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2                     lemongrass stalks -- outer leaves and
                        tops removed, root ends trimmed, stalks
                        finely grated
  1              large  shallot -- finely chopped
  2              large  garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1              pound  pork tenderloin -- thinly sliced
  16                    bamboo skewers -- soaked 20 minutes,
                        and drained
                        Rice Vermicelli - {Bun Thit} -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  chopped unsalted roasted peanuts
                        Fish Dipping Sauce - {Nuoc Cham} -- (see recipe)

Stir together the fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and oil until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Add the lemongrass, shallot, garlic and pork and mix to coat the meat evenly.  Allow to marinate at room temperature for 20 minutes or refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.

Slide 2 to 4 slices of pork onto each skewer so the meat is flat with the skewer going through the slices several times.  Grill over a barbecue (make sure that the flames have subsided and the coals are red with white ashes).  Alternatively, heat a well-oiled grill pan or non-stick skillet over high heat and, working in batches, cook the skewers until the edges crisp, about 1 minute per side.  Remove the skewers from the grilled pork.

Divide the grilled pork among the bowls of rice vermicelli.  Sprinkle peanuts and drizzle nuoc cham over each serving.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  baguette - (abt 3/4 lb)
  2             ounces  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
  2                     onions -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pound  cooked ham -- cut 1/2" cubes
  4              large  eggs
  4               cups  whole milk
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6               cups  spinach leaves - (abt 1 bunch) -- coarsely chopped
     3/4         pound  fontina -- grated

Preheat broiler.

Diagonally cut baguette crosswise into 3/4-inch thick slices and brush both sides with butter.  Toast on a baking sheet under broiler 3 inches from heat until golden, about 30 seconds on each side.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cook onions in oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately-high heat, stirring occasionally, until golden.  Add ham and cook, stirring occasionally, until ham is lightly browned.

Whisk eggs in a large bowl and whisk in milk, salt, nutmeg, and pepper.  Add toasted bread and toss gently.  When the bread is saturated, transfer it to a shallow 3-quart casserole, slightly overlapping slices.  Add any remaining egg mixture.

Tuck spinach and ham between slices, reserving a little ham to sprinkle over top.  Sprinkle cheese over pudding, lifting slices with a spatula to allow some to fall between them.  Sprinkle reserved ham over pudding and bake in middle of oven until puffed and edges of bread are golden and custard is set in middle, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Bread pudding can be assembled 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Increase baking time to 1 hour and 10 minutes if bread pudding is cold when put in oven, and cover top with foil after 45 minutes to prevent over-browning.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TAMALES ===
  24                    dried corn husks
                        Boiling water -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             pounds  chicken thighs -- with skin and bone
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  1                cup  shredded Monterey Jack cheese - (4 oz)
                        === SALSA ROJA ===
  1              pound  tomatillos -- husks removed
  10                    dried chiles de arbol
  1                can  tomato sauce - (8 oz)
     1/2        medium  white onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed
                        === CLASSIC SOUTHERN CORNBREAD ===
  2               cups  yellow or white cornmeal
                        = (preferably stoneground)
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  buttermilk
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil -- plus
                        additional for the pan
                        = (preferably sunflower)

To make the Tamales:  Place the corn husks in a large bowl and add enough boiling water to cover.  Submerge in the water by weighting down with another bowl.  Let stand until the husks soften, about 1 hour.  Drain well and pat dry.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and cook, turning once, until browned, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to a plate.

Add the onion to the fat in the skillet and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Stir in the cilantro, chili powder, cumin, salt, and cayenne.  Return the chicken to the skillet and add enough cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover.  Cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 45 minutes.

Transfer the chicken to a plate.  Cool until easy to handle.  Discard the skin and bones and coarsely chop the meat.  Transfer to a medium bowl.

Meanwhile, let the cooking liquid stand off the heat for 5 minutes.  Skim off and discard the fat on the surface.  Return the skillet to the stove and bring to a boil over high heat.  Cook until the liquid is reduced to a thick glaze, about 20 minutes.  Scrape the glaze onto the chicken, then add the cheese.

To make the tamales, place a corn husk on the work surface.  Spread about 3 tablespoons of the Classic Cornbread batter in a 2- to 3-inch square area in the center of the husk.  Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the chicken in the center of the batter and top with about 1 tablespoon of the batter.  Fold the sides of the husk to enclose the batter (the tamale is now about 2 1/2 inches wide).  Fold over the ends of the husk so the tamale is about 3 inches long.  Place the tamale, smooth-side up, on the work surface.  Using kitchen twine, tie up the tamale gift-box fashion.  Repeat with the remaining husks, batter and chicken.  (You may have some husks left over since you soaked more than you needed, in case some got torn.)

Stand the tamales up, side by side, in a steamer inserted in a large pot.  Add enough water to the pot to barely reach the bottom of the steamer.  Cover tightly and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low.  Steam the tamales until the batter is firm (open a tamale to check), about 1 hour.  (The tamales can be made up to 8 hours ahead, cooled, and refrigerated.  Steam over boiling water for 15 minutes to reheat.)

Serve hot, with the Salsa Roja passed on the side.

For the Salsa Roja:  Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over high heat.  Add the tomatillos and cook just until softened, about 10 minutes.  Drain.

Heat a heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over high heat until very hot.  Cook the chiles, turning frequently, until they turn a darker shade, about 3 minutes.  Do not burn them.  Transfer to a plate and cool.  Cut open and discard the seeds and stems.  (Wear plastic gloves if your hands are sensitive, and do not touch your eyes or other delicate parts of your body until you wash your hands well.)

Puree the tomatillos, chiles, tomato sauce, onion, and garlic in a blender or food processor.  Season, to taste, with salt.  Cool completely.  (The salsa can be prepared up to 3 days ahead, covered, and refrigerated.)

For the Classic Southern Cornbread Batter:  Whisk the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl to combine.  Make a well in the center.  Whisk the buttermilk, eggs, and oil in another bowl until the eggs are well combined.  Pour into the well and stir just until the batter is moistened -- do not overbeat.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

To make the Tamales:  Place the corn husks in a large bowl and add enough boiling water to cover.  Submerge in the water by weighting down with another bowl.  Let stand until the husks soften, about 1 hour.  Drain well and pat dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and cook, turning once, until browned, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to a plate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the onion to the fat in the skillet and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Stir in the cilantro, chili powder, cumin, salt, and cayenne.  Return the chicken to the skillet and add enough cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover.  Cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 45 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the chicken to a plate.  Cool until easy to handle.  Discard the skin and bones and coarsely chop the meat.  Transfer to a medium bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, let the cooking liquid stand off the heat for 5 minutes.  Skim off and discard the fat on the surface.  Return the skillet to the stove and bring to a boil over high heat.  Cook until the liquid is reduced to a thick glaze, about 20 minutes.  Scrape the glaze onto the chicken, then add the cheese.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the tamales, place a corn husk on the work surface.  Spread about 3 tablespoons of the Classic Cornbread batter in a 2- to 3-inch square area in the center of the husk.  Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the chicken in the center of the batter and top with about 1 tablespoon of the batter.  Fold the sides of the husk to enclose the batter (the tamale is now about 2 1/2 inches wide).  Fold over the ends of the husk so the tamale is about 3 inches long.  Place the tamale, smooth-side up, on the work surface.  Using kitchen twine, tie up the tamale gift-box fashion.  Repeat with the remaining husks, batter and chicken.  (You may have some husks left over since you soaked more than you needed, in case some got torn.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stand the tamales up, side by side, in a steamer inserted in a large pot.  Add enough water to the pot to barely reach the bottom of the steamer.  Cover tightly and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low.  Steam the tamales until the batter is firm (open a tamale to check), about 1 hour.  (The tamales can be made up to 8 hours ahead, cooled, and refrigerated.  Steam over boiling water for 15 minutes to reheat.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve hot, with the Salsa Roja passed on the side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Salsa Roja:  Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over high heat.  Add the tomatillos and cook just until softened, about 10 minutes.  Drain.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over high heat until very hot.  Cook the chiles, turning frequently, until they turn a darker shade, about 3 minutes.  Do not burn them.  Transfer to a plate and cool.  Cut open and discard the seeds and stems.  (Wear plastic gloves if your hands are sensitive, and do not touch your eyes or other delicate parts of your body until you wash your hands well.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Puree the tomatillos, chiles, tomato sauce, onion, and garlic in a blender or food processor.  Season, to taste, with salt.  Cool completely.  (The salsa can be prepared up to 3 days ahead, covered, and refrigerated.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Classic Southern Cornbread Batter:  Whisk the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl to combine.  Make a well in the center.  Whisk the buttermilk, eggs, and oil in another bowl until the eggs are well combined.  Pour into the well and stir just until the batter is moistened -- do not overbeat.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PANEER ===
  10              cups  whole milk
  2          teaspoons  fine salt
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
                        === SPINACH ===
  2            bunches  spinach (abt 1 lb) -- coarse stems
                        discarded
     1/2           cup  water -- plus
  2        tablespoons  water
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1              piece  peeled fresh ginger - (2" long)
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  coriander seeds
  1           teaspoon  cumin seeds
  4                     whole cloves
  2                     allspice berries
  1                     cinnamon stick - (3" long)
  2                     onions -- thinly sliced
  4                     plum tomatoes -- peeled and chopped
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        === SERVING SUGGESTION ===
                        Basmati rice
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Cheesecloth

Make the Paneer:  Bring milk to a full boil in a 6-quart heavy pot, stirring occasionally.  Add the salt, and lemon juice and remove from the heat.  Gently stir around the edges as the milk separates and the curd forms in the center.  Let sit for about 2 minutes.

Pour mixture into a colander lined with a triple layer of dampened cheesecloth.  Gather up edges of cheesecloth, twisting gently to squeeze out as much liquid as possible.  Wrap the cheese tightly in the cheesecloth and wrap in a kitchen towel.  Transfer the package to a bowl and weigh down with a bowl filled with water or a large can.  Let stand at room temperature until firm, about 1 hour.  Pour off any liquid that has accumulated in the bowl and cut the paneer into 1/2-inch cubes.

Make the Spinach:  Cook spinach in 1/2 cup water in a large saucepan, covered, over moderately-high heat until wilted and tender, about 2 minutes.  Coarsely puree spinach, without draining, in a food processor.  Set aside.

In a mini-chopper, puree the garlic and ginger into a paste with the remaining 2 tablespoons water.  Set aside.

Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown paneer in 2 batches, gently turning to avoid breaking up.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the paneer to paper towel-lined plate, leaving the oil behind in the skillet.

Add the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cloves, allspice, and cinnamon stick to the skillet and cook, stirring, until fragrant and the cinnamon stick unfurls, about 30 seconds.  Add the onions and cook stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.

Add garlic-ginger paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant and almost dry, about 2 minutes.  Add tomatoes and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 to 6 minutes.

Add spinach puree and simmer sauce, stirring occasionally, until thickened and almost all of liquid is evaporated, 2 to 4 minutes.  Add cream and simmer, stirring, occasionally, until thickened.

Gently stir in paneer and salt and simmer about 30 seconds more.  Divide among plates and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Paneer keeps, wrapped well in plastic wrap and chilled, for 3 days.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  dry Sherry
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE SKEWER ===
  8                     skinless boneless chicken thighs -- cut into
                        thirty-six pieces, abt 1 1/2 " ea
  2            bunches  scallions - (abt 10) -- white and pale
                        green parts cut into 24 (1 1/2") lengths
  24                    canned whole water chestnuts -- rinsed, drained
                        Lemon wedges -- as needed
                        Mustard, preferably Chinese-style -- as needed

                        chicken and vegetables

To make the Marinade:  In a saucepan whisk together the soy sauce, Sherry, sugar, ginger, and garlic and season with salt and pepper.  Bring the mixture to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Let the marinade cool.  (The marinade can be made in advance, and refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.)

To make the Skewers:  On each skewer alternate 3 pieces of chicken with 2 scallion lengths and 2 water chestnuts.  (Skewer the water chestnuts carefully so they don't split; and begin and end with the chicken.)  Arrange the skewers in a large shallow baking dish and pour the marinade over the chicken and vegetables.  Marinate at room temperature, turning once, for 30 minutes.  (The skewers can be marinated up to overnight.)

Arrange an oven rack about 4 inches from the broiler and preheat.

Arrange the skewers on a foil-lined baking sheet, reserving the marinade.  Broil the skewers, basting occasionally for the first 6 minutes.  Continue broil, turning occasionally, until the chicken is just cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Discard any remaining marinade.  Transfer the skewers to a platter and serve with the lemon wedges and mustard.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

To prepare Venison:  In a spice grinder or food processor, grind the peppercorns, juniper berries, fennel seeds, and thyme together.  Mix with 4 tablespoons of the olive oil and rub on the venison.  Cover and let stand in the refrigerator for 4 to 12 hours.  Remove the venison from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to come to room temperature.

To make the Cranberry Sauce:  In a food processor or spice grinder, coarsely grind the cinnamon, fennel seeds, cloves, peppercorns, and juniper berries together.  Place in a cheesecloth square and tie closed with a string.

In a heavy medium saucepan, combine the cranberries, wine, vinegar, sugar, and orange juice concentrate.  Add the spice bundle and bring the liquid to a boil.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the cranberries are very soft.  Remove the spice bundle, pour the sauce into a bowl, and let cool.  Use now, or cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days.  Bring to room temperature before serving.

While the cranberry sauce cools, make the Baked Apples:  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  In a medium saucepan, cook the cider, vinegar, star anise, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and butter for 5 minutes.  Place the apples, cut-side down, in a baking pan.  Pour the cider mixture over the apples.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until semisoft; set aside and keep warm, or reheat just before serving.

To make the Venison:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a large skillet, heat the remaining 4 tablespoons oil and brown the venison on all sides.  Place on a rack in a roasting pan and roast in the oven for about 50 minutes for medium-rare.  For medium-done, roast 6 to 7 minutes longer.  Remove the venison from the oven, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let stand for 5 minutes before slicing.

To make the Chard:  In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the chard and apple cider and saute for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Season with salt and pepper.

To serve, transfer the venison to a platter and arrange the apples beside it.  Divide the chard and cranberry sauce between bowls.  Serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     grey sole fillets - (6 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  chopped green olives
  3        tablespoons  drained capers
  4                     strips cooked bacon -- crumbled
  1         tablespoon  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        === BEURRE BLANC ===
     1/4           cup  white wine
  1                     shallot -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- cut into cubes,
                        and chilled
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SERVING SUGGESTION ===
                        Jasmine rice

Dredge the fillets in the flour and season with salt and pepper.  Preheat a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the oil and butter and heat until hot.  Add the fillets and cook, turning once, until just cooked through, about 4 minutes.  Divide the fillets among warm plates.

Remove the skillet from the heat, add the olives, capers, and bacon, and stir, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom, until the mixture has warmed through.  Add the Beurre Blanc and parsley and stir to combine.  Spoon the sauce over the fillets and serve immediately with rice.

For the Beurre Blanc:  Combine the wine and shallot in a medium saucepan, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by half.  Add the cream and continue reducing until just thickened.  Reduce the heat to low.  While whisking constantly, add the butter, little by little, waiting for each addition to be incorporated before adding more, to make a smooth sauce.  Whisk in the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.  Set aside in a warm area.  (The sauce may break if it's too hot or too cold.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  chili garlic sauce
  2          teaspoons  black bean garlic sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  lobster meat -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped bamboo shoots
  1              large  egg white
  1         tablespoon  shredded basil
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  2          teaspoons  finely-minced ginger
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === TO ASSEMBLE ===
  30                    potsticker wrappers
  3        tablespoons  cooking oil
     2/3           cup  water
                        Basil sprigs -- for garnish

Combine the dipping sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.

Combine filling ingredients in a medium bowl; mix well.  To shape each potsticker, place 1 teaspoon of filling in center of a potsticker wrapper.  Brush edges of wrapper with water; fold wrapper in half, crimping 1 side, to form a semicircle.  Pinch edges together to seal.  Cover potstickers with a dry towel to prevent drying.

Place a wide frying pan over medium heat until hot.  Add 1 to 1/2 tablespoons cooking oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add potstickers, half at a time, seam-side up.  Cook until bottoms are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add 1/3 cup water; reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until liquid is absorbed, 4 to 5 minutes.  Place potstickers, browned-side up, on a serving plate; keep warm.  Cook remaining potstickers with remaining oil and water.

Garnish potstickers with basil.  Serve with dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 30 dumplings.

     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh orange juice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger

Trim the tenderloins of all fat and silverskin.  Place them in a shallow baking dish large enough to hold them without crowding.

Combine the soy sauce, sherry, honey, vinegar, oil, and orange juice in a medium bowl, whisking until well blended.  Stir in the rosemary, shallots, and ginger.  Pour the mixture over the tenderloins.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow to marinate at room temperature for 2 hours.

Preheat an outdoor grill or indoor grill pan.

Remove the pork from the marinade, shaking off any excess.  Place the tenderloins on the grill and cook, turning frequently, for about 18 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 155 degrees.  Transfer to a platter and allow the meat to rest for 10 minutes before carving.

Meanwhile, place the marinade in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer.  Simmer for 10 minutes, or until slightly thickened.

Slice the pork into 1/4 inch-thick slices, spoon the hot marinade over the pork.  Serve with a tossed salad.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

           Mesclun And Ricotta Salata On Grilled Garlic Toasts

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  lemons
  4          teaspoons  honey
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  olive oil
  4             slices  country-style bread, 1/2" thick -- halved diagonally
  1              large  garlic clove -- halved crosswise
  8             ounces  mesclun - (abt 8 cups)
  1                cup  mixed torn herb leaves
                        = (such as basil, parsley, tarragon,
                        chives, and mint)
     3/4         pound  grape tomatoes -- halved
  6             ounces  ricotta salata -- thinly sliced

Remove zest from lemons in large strips with a vegetable peeler and cut any white pith from strips with a sharp knife.  Cut enough zest into julienne strips to measure 1/4 cup.  Blanch zest in boiling water 1 minute, then drain in a sieve and plunge into a bowl of cold water to stop cooking.  Drain and pat dry.

Squeeze enough juice from lemons to measure 6 tablespoons.  Whisk together lemon juice, honey, salt, and pepper, then add 1/2 cup oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified.

Prepare charcoal or gas grill for cooking.

Brush both sides of bread slices with remaining 1/4 cup oil and season with salt and pepper.

When fire is hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 1 to 2 seconds), grill bread on lightly oiled grill rack, turning once, until golden, about 3 minutes total.  Immediately rub 1 side of each slice with garlic.

Toss mesclun and herbs with tomatoes, half of zest, and enough dressing to coat, then season with salt and pepper.

Put toasts on salad plates and spoon some of remaining dressing over each.  Layer cheese and salad alternately on each toast and sprinkle with remaining zest.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Zest can be blanched (and dried) 1 day ahead and chilled, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap.

          Mixed Greens With Dried Cranberries And Toasted Pecans

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Jeanne Lemlin
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  pecans
  4               cups  romaine lettuce -- torn small pieces
  4               cups  mesclun -- washed, spun dry
                        = (mixed baby greens)
     1/2           cup  slivered red onion
     1/3           cup  Lemon-Soy Dressing -- (listed below)
  4        tablespoons  dried cranberries
                        === LEMON-SOY DRESSING ===
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  tamari soy sauce
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        Generous seasoning freshly-ground pepper
     1/2           cup  mild-flavored olive oil

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Toast the pecans in a shallow pan until they begin to get fragrant, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Let cool completely.

Combine the lettuce, mesclun, and onion in a salad bowl.  Just before serving, pour on the dressing and toss well.  Check to see if you need to add more dressing; you don't want to make the greens too wet.  Serve on individual salad plates with the pecans and the cranberries sprinkled on each portion.

Lemon-Soy Dressing:  Place all the ingredients in a jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake vigorously.  (Makes 3/4 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Combine the lettuce, mesclun, and onion in a salad bowl.  Just before serving, pour on the dressing and toss well.  Check to see if you need to add more dressing; you don&apos;t want to make the greens too wet.  Serve on individual salad plates with the pecans and the cranberries sprinkled on each portion.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE SHRIMP PASTE ===
  6             ounces  uncooked shrimp -- shelled, deveined
  1              large  egg white
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onion
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === TO FINISH ===
  3             slices  day-old white sandwich bread
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  3                     sheets Japanese seaweed (Nori)
  1         tablespoon  black sesame seeds
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

Make the Shrimp Paste:  Combine the shrimp, egg white, green onion, cornstarch, rice wine, ginger, salt, sesame oil and pepper in the workbowl of a food processor.  Process until the mixture is smooth, stopping once or twice to scrape down the sides.

Trim the crusts from the bread.  Brush 1 side of 1 of the bread slices with the beaten egg and lightly press the nori sheet over the egg.  Place the bread on a cutting board, nori-side down, and trim any of the nori that extends past the edge of the bread.  Spread about 1/3 of the shrimp paste over the bare side of the bread, mounding it slightly in the center.  Sprinkle 1/3 of the black sesame seeds over the shrimp paste.  With a chef's knife, cut each slice into 4 triangles.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Pour enough oil into a wok or a high-sided frying pan to come to a depth of 2 inches and heat over medium-heat to 350 degrees.  Slide 3 or 4 toasts, shrimp-side down, into the oil.  Cook for about 1 minute, turn over and continue cooking until edges are golden brown, about 1 minute longer.  Scoop the toasts from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with remaining shrimp toasts.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 12 toasts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  mixed dried fruit
                        = (peaches, pears, prunes, apples,
                        figs, and/or apricots)
     1/2           cup  raisins
  2               cups  dry white wine
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
  10                    cloves
  4                     star anise
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1                cup  walnut halves, hazelnuts, or pine nuts
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === CARAMEL SAUCE ===
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1                cup  cold water
     1/4           cup  corn syrup
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  pure vanilla extract
  1 3/4           cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Place the dried fruit and raisins in a heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water.  Allow to stand for 30 minutes, or until the fruit has plumped.  Drain off all the soaking liquid, reserving 1 cup.

Place the fruit and the reserved soaking liquid in a large saucepan.  Add the wine, ginger, cloves, star anise, and cinnamon stick, place over medium heat, and bring to a boil.  Immediately lower the heat to a low simmer, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the fruit is quite soft.  Remove from the heat and drain well, discarding the spices.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Lightly butter a baking sheet.  Spread the poached fruit and the nuts out on the baking sheet, leaving space between the fruit.  Brush the tops with the melted butter.  Roast for 10 minutes, or until the fruit is just beginning to color.  Serve in individual bowls, drizzled with caramel sauce.

For the Caramel Sauce:  Combine the brown and granulated sugars with 1 cup cold water in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil.  Boil for 12 minutes, or until the syrup is a rich caramel color, brushing down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush from time to time to dissolve any sugar crystals that form.

Taking care as the syrup may bubble over, whisk in the corn syrup, lemon juice, and vanilla and bring to a simmer.  Carefully whisk in the cream, bring to a boil, and boil gently for 10 minutes, or until the sauce is thick.  Whisk in the butter and serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  creme fraiche or sour cream
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh tarragon
  1                     lemon -- zest grated
  1 1/2      teaspoons  undiluted orange juice concentrate
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  turkey breast cutlets -- halved crosswise,
                        if they are large
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  finely-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano - -- (1 1/2 oz)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley or basil
                        All-purpose flour -- for dredging
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Lemon wedges -- for accompaniment

Serve with lemon wedges.

  1              piece  fresh gingerroot - (4 1/2" long)
  9               cups  water
  6                     firm-ripe Bartlett, Anjou, or
                        Comice pears -- with stems intact
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  tawny port
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
     3/4           cup  mascarpone cheese
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated orange zest

Peel gingerroot and slice thin; cut the slices into thin strips.  Cook the gingerroot in a saucepan of simmering water for 10 minutes.  Drain gingerroot and discard water.

In a saucepan large enough to hold pears lying on their sides, bring 9 cups water to boil with gingerroot, sugar, Port, and lemon juice, stirring until sugar is dissolved.

Peel pears, leaving stems intact, and cut a thin slice from bottom of each if necessary to enable pears to stand upright when served.  Arrange pears on their sides in poaching liquid, adding water as necessary to just cover.  Simmer pears, turning them occasionally, until tender, 20 to 40 minutes depending on ripeness.  Carefully transfer pears with a slotted spoon to a bowl and boil poaching liquid until reduced and slightly syrupy.

In a small bowl, whisk together the mascarpone and orange zest.

Pour sauce over pears.  Pears may be made 1 day ahead and cooled in sauce before being chilled, covered.  Serve pears warm or chilled, with dollops of the mascarpone.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  cumin seeds
  2                     dried red chiles - (to 3)
                        = (such as arbol)
  2             medium  onions -- sliced
  3        tablespoons  ground coriander
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  turmeric
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             medium  plum tomatoes -- diced
  1 1/2         pounds  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1                cup  whole-milk yogurt -- divided
                        Cilantro leaves -- for garnish
                        Chopped fresh green chiles -- for garnish

Heat the oil in a large straight-sided skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the cumin seeds and red chiles and cook, stirring, until they are fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Add the coriander, ginger, garlic, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne and season with salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until dark and fragrant, about 3 minutes more.  Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until somewhat soft, about 3 minutes.  (You can make the sauce up to this point a day ahead.)

When ready to serve, heat the sauce over high heat.  As soon as it starts to bubble on the edges, add the shrimp and cook, stirring, until the shrimp turns opaque.  Lower the heat, gradually stir in the yogurt, and gently heat it through.  (Don't bring it to a boil or the yogurt may separate.)  Season with salt and pepper, transfer to a serving platter, and sprinkle with the cilantro and green chiles.  Serve.

Heat the oil in a large straight-sided skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the cumin seeds and red chiles and cook, stirring, until they are fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Add the coriander, ginger, garlic, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne and season with salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until dark and fragrant, about 3 minutes more.  Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until somewhat soft, about 3 minutes.  (You can make the sauce up to this point a day ahead.)

When ready to serve, heat the sauce over high heat.  As soon as it starts to bubble on the edges, add the shrimp and cook, stirring, until the shrimp turns opaque.  Lower the heat, gradually stir in the yogurt, and gently heat it through.  (Don&apos;t bring it to a boil or the yogurt may separate.)  Season with salt and pepper, transfer to a serving platter, and sprinkle with the cilantro and green chiles.  Serve.

  1              pinch  saffron threads -- crushed
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
                        Salt -- to taste

  30                    endive spears

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  red kidney beans - (15 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  coconut milk
  3                     spring onion stalks -- chopped
  1              sprig  fresh thyme

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  dried rice vermicelli
                        = (or 1 pound fresh bun)
  8                     romaine lettuce leaves -- ribs removed,

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     dried black mushrooms - (to 6)
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  oyster-flavored sauce
  2          teaspoons  dark soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/4         pound  ground pork
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped smoked ham
  2               cups  cooked glutinous rice -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped bamboo shoots
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped water chestnuts
  1                     green onion -- trimmed, chopped
                        fine
                        === TO ASSEMBLE ===
  1            package  siu mai wrappers - (16 oz)
     1/4           cup  frozen peas -- thawed
                        Cabbage leaves -- (optional)

Pour enough warm water over the mushrooms in a medium bowl to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain.  Discard the stems and chop the caps finely.

To prepare the Seasonings:  Stir the soy sauce, oyster-flavored sauce, dark soy sauce, sesame oil and sugar together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.

To make the Filling:  Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the ground pork and ham and stir-fry until the pork is crumbly and cooked through, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Add the rice, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, green onion, seasonings, and reserved mushrooms.  Cook, stirring, until heated through, for about 1 minute.  Remove the filling from the wok and let cool.

To make the Dumplings:  Place 1 tablespoon of the rice mixture in the center of a wrapper.  (Keep remaining wrappers covered with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out).  Gather up the wrapper around the filling, pleating it as you go to form an open-topped pouch.  Carefully squeeze the sides of the dumpling about half way up to give the dumpling a 'waist.'  Center a pea over the top of the dumpling.  Repeat with the remaining dumplings, keeping the formed dumplings covered with a damp cloth while filling the remaining wrappers.

Pour enough water into a wok to reach about 2 inches up the sides and bring to a boil.  Line the inside of a bamboo steamer with cabbage leaves or parchment paper and set it over the water (the steamer shouldn't touch the water).  Place as many dumplings in the steamer as will fit without touching each other.  Steam the dumplings until the wrapper is cooked and tender to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes.  Serve with classic dim sum accoutrements like hot mustard, chili paste and soy sauce.

This recipe yields 60 pieces.

To make the Filling:  Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the ground pork and ham and stir-fry until the pork is crumbly and cooked through, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Add the rice, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, green onion, seasonings, and reserved mushrooms.  Cook, stirring, until heated through, for about 1 minute.  Remove the filling from the wok and let cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Dumplings:  Place 1 tablespoon of the rice mixture in the center of a wrapper.  (Keep remaining wrappers covered with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out).  Gather up the wrapper around the filling, pleating it as you go to form an open-topped pouch.  Carefully squeeze the sides of the dumpling about half way up to give the dumpling a &apos;waist.&apos;  Center a pea over the top of the dumpling.  Repeat with the remaining dumplings, keeping the formed dumplings covered with a damp cloth while filling the remaining wrappers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour enough water into a wok to reach about 2 inches up the sides and bring to a boil.  Line the inside of a bamboo steamer with cabbage leaves or parchment paper and set it over the water (the steamer shouldn&apos;t touch the water).  Place as many dumplings in the steamer as will fit without touching each other.  Steam the dumplings until the wrapper is cooked and tender to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes.  Serve with classic dim sum accoutrements like hot mustard, chili paste and soy sauce.

        Skirt Steak Fajitas With Lime, Chili, And Tomatillo Salsa

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  onions -- peeled, and cut
                        lengthwise into wedges/ root ends intact
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/3           cup  fresh lime juice
  3             pounds  skirt steak
  1         tablespoon  ancho chili powder
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  ground coriander
  24                    flour tortillas
  1 1/2           cups  fresh cilantro
                        Roasted Tomatillo Salsa -- (see recipe)
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Metal skewers or a grill basket

Prepare grill for cooking.

Thread onions onto skewers (or put in grill basket), then brush with 1 tablespoon oil and season with salt and pepper.  When fire is medium-hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds), grill onions, turning occasionally, until tender, 16 to 20 minutes.  Transfer to a cutting board.  When just cool enough to handle, cut onions into 1-inch pieces and toss with vinegar in a bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.

While onions are grilling, stir together the lime juice and remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a shallow dish, then add steak and marinate at room temperature, turning once, 10 minutes.

Pat steak dry, then rub with chili powder, cumin, and coriander and season with salt and pepper.  Grill steak on lightly oiled grill rack, turning once, 6 to 10 minutes total for medium-rare.  Transfer to cutting board, then let stand 5 minutes before cutting diagonally into thin slices.

While steak is standing, toast tortillas directly on grill rack, turning once, until puffed slightly and browned in spots, about 1 minute total.  Serve steak, onions, cilantro, and salsa all wrapped in tortillas.

This recipe yields about 8 servings.

Comments:  If you aren't able to grill, onions (no need to skewer) and steak can be cooked in a lightly oiled well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately-high heat and tortillas can be toasted over gas (hold with tongs) or directly on top of electric burners.  Cut skirt steak into pieces to fit in grill pan and grill in batches without crowding.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  baking potatoes
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1                cup  creme fraiche
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  grated fresh or
                        drained bottled horseradish
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             ounces  smoked salmon -- julienned
  2        tablespoons  caviar or salmon roe
  1                cup  Pickled Red Onions -- (listed below)
                        === PICKLED RED ONIONS ===
  4             medium  red onions -- sliced 1/4" thick
  3               cups  cider vinegar
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled and halved
     1/3           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  pickling spice
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt

Peel and coarsely grate the potatoes.  Working in batches, heat 2 teaspoons of the butter with 2 teaspoons of the vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until very hot.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the potatoes into the pan, pressing into a 3-inch diameter with a spatula to create lacy, flat rounds of potato.  Don't be concerned if you can see the bottom of the pan through gaps in the potatoes.  Cook until well browned on each side, pressing down firmly.  Season with salt while hot.  (The cakes can be made several hours in advance and crisped in a hot oven before serving.)

Combine the creme fraiche, lemon juice, and horseradish in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Arrange 3 pancakes per serving on small plates.  Top the pancakes with equal amounts of smoked salmon, a spoonful of horseradish cream, and a spoonful of caviar.  Top with a few pickled onions and serve.

To make the Pickled Red Onions:  Combine the onions, vinegar, garlic, sugar, pickling spice, and salt in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool to room temperature before serving.  Chop fine.

This recipe yields about 24 pieces.

  1              large  green bell pepper -- finely chopped,
                        reserving about 1 tspn for garnish
  1              small  red onion -- finely chopped,
                        reserving about 1 tspn for garnish
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     plum tomato -- finely chopped
  1              small  red chile -- finely chopped
                        Fresh cilantro leaves -- for garnish
                        Dollop sour cream -- for garnish
                        === SERVING SUGGESTION ===
                        Tortilla chips

In a large saucepan, let the beans soak in enough cold water to cover for 1 hour and drain.  Return the beans to the pan with the 8 cups of water and garlic.  Bring the water to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer until tender, about 1 hour.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over moderate heat.  Add the pepper, onion, and cumin and cook, stirring, until softened.

Drain the beans and reserve 1/2 cup of them.  Add the remaining beans to the pepper mixture with the remaining 1/4 cup water, and simmer, covered, until very tender, about 15 minutes.

In a food processor, blend bean mixture with the vinegar and pulse until well combined but not pureed smooth.  Season the dip with salt, pepper, and vinegar.  Transfer to a serving bowl, and stir in the reserved 1/2 cup beans.  Let the dip cool to room temperature or chill.

When to serve, garnish the dip with the reserved bell pepper, onion, tomato, chile, cilantro leaves, and sour cream.  Serve with the tortilla chips.

This recipe yields about 3 cups.

Comments:  This dip may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled.

  2          teaspoons  paprika
  2               cups  long-grain white rice
  1 1/4           cups  dry white wine
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 oz) -- including juice
  1 3/4           cups  chicken broth
     3/4      teaspoon  crumbled saffron threads

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Charlie Palmer
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  canola oil
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
     1/4           cup  minced celery
  2        tablespoons  instant flour
  1 1/2           cups  half-and-half -- heated
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  mascarpone cheese
     3/4           cup  grated sharp white cheddar
     1/2           cup  grated Fontina
     3/4         pound  elbow or tube macaroni -- cooked, well drained
                        Hot sauce -- to taste
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan -- (optional)
     3/4           cup  bread crumbs

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously grease a 2-quart casserole; set aside.

Heat the oil in a large nonstick saucepan over medium heat.  Add the shallots and celery and saute for 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are very soft.  Lower the heat and stir in the flour until well incorporated.  Whisk in the hot half-and-half and then the wine.  Cook, stirring constantly, for about 4 minutes, or until the mixture has begun to thicken.  Remove from the heat and beat in the cheeses, stirring until they have melted into the sauce.

Stir in the macaroni and season, to taste, with hot sauce and salt.  Pour the mixture into the prepared casserole.

If using the Parmesan, combine it with the bread crumbs in a small bowl.  Sprinkle the bread crumbs over the macaroni.  Bake for 15 minutes, or until the edges are bubbling and the top is golden.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  To lower the fat in this recipe, replace the half-and-half with 1 1/2 cups nonfat milk plus 1/4 cup nonfat yogurt and the cheeses with reduced-fat cheese.  When lowering fat in a cheese-based recipe, you will often lose flavor, but flavor can be enhanced with the addition of finely minced fresh herbs or chili peppers.

            Sweet-Potato, Pumpkin Seed And Chickpea Party Mix

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Snacks

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  canned chickpeas -- rinsed, drained,
                        and patted dry
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  3              small  sweet potatoes -- peeled
  1 1/2           cups  hulled (green) pumpkin seeds
  8                     fresh hot red chiles - (4" long) -- cut crosswise
                        into 3/4"-thick slices
     3/4           cup  raisins
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  cayenne -- (optional)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Deep-fat thermometer

Arrange chickpeas in 1 layer on paper towels and allow to air-dry while frying other ingredients.  In a large saucepan, pour enough oil to reach a depth of 2 inches.  Heat over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer inserted in the oil registers 365 degrees.

Using a peeler (preferably Y-shaped), shave enough thin strips of the sweet potato to measure 6 cups (reserve remaining sweet potato for another use).

Fry sweet potato shavings, 1/2 cup at a time, until golden and just crisp, about 1 minute, then transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.  (Return oil to 365 degrees between batches.)  Cool oil to 340 degrees.

Fry pumpkin seeds in batches, covered (seeds will pop and splatter), until puffed (but not brown), 30 seconds to 1 minute, then transfer with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.  (Return oil to 340 degrees between batches.)

Fry chiles until crisp but still red, about 1 minute, then transfer with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.

Fry chickpeas in batches until golden and crisp throughout, 5 to 10 minutes, then transfer with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.

Toss sweet-potato crisps, pumpkin seeds, chiles, chickpeas, and raisins with sugar, cayenne, if using, and salt.

This recipe yields about 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  cubed (1") pitted peeled ripe mango
                        = (abt 2 mangoes)
  1 1/2           cups  cubed (1") peeled cored ripe pineapple
                        = (abt 1/2 small pineapple)
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
  2               cups  cake flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     3/4           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  coarsely chopped pecans - (2 oz) -- toasted
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Generously butter a 13- by 9-inch baking pan.

Heat 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the mango, pineapple, brown sugar, and rum.  Cook, stirring often, until the sugar is melted and bubbling.  Cool until tepid.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, ginger, and salt and set aside.  Beat the remaining 8 tablespoons of butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a hand-held electric mixer at high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, then the vanilla.  On low speed, add the flour in 3 additions, alternating with 2 additions of the milk, and beat until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl often with a rubber spatula.

Arrange the fruit in a single layer in the pan, and pour the syrup over all.  Sprinkle with the pecans.  Spread the batter evenly over the fruit.

Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 35 minutes.  Cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack.  Invert and unmold onto a large serving platter.  (If any pieces of fruit stay in the pan, just remove them and arrange them in their place on the cake.)  Pour any juices in the pan over the cake.  Serve warm or completely cooled, with the ice cream.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 35 minutes.  Cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack.  Invert and unmold onto a large serving platter.  (If any pieces of fruit stay in the pan, just remove them and arrange them in their place on the cake.)  Pour any juices in the pan over the cake.  Serve warm or completely cooled, with the ice cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  chopped onion
  3        tablespoons  vegetables oil
     1/2      teaspoon  coriander seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  aniseed
  3        tablespoons  chili powder
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
  2        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2        tablespoons  peanut butter
  2               cups  chicken broth - (to 3)
  1                can  tomatoes - (16 oz) -- drained, chopped
  2        tablespoons  raisins
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced, and
                        mashed to a paste with
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  2             pounds  turkey wings - (abt 10)
                        Cooked rice -- as an accompaniment
  1           teaspoon  sesame seeds

In a large heavy skillet saute the onion in the oil over moderately-high heat, stirring, until it is golden brown.

In a mortar with a pestle crush the coriander seeds and the aniseed, stir them into the onion mixture with the chili powder, the sugar, the cinnamon, and the cloves, and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, for 1 minute.  Stir in the cocoa powder, the peanut butter, 2 cups of the broth, the tomatoes, the raisins, the garlic paste, and salt, to taste, and simmer the sauce, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.

While the sauce is cooking cut off the wing tips, reserving them for another use such as stock if desired, and halve the wings at the joint.  Pat the wings dry, season them with salt and pepper.  On the oiled rack of a broiler pan, broil them, skin-side up, under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 10 minutes, or until they are golden.  Turn the wings and broil them for 10 minutes more, or until they are golden.

In a blender or food processor puree the sauce in batches, adding the remaining broth as necessary to thin it to the desired consistency.  Transfer the sauce to the skillet, add the wings, and simmer the mixture, uncovered, for 30 minutes.  Serve the wings with the mole sauce over the rice, sprinkled with the sesame seeds.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

               Twice-Baked Goat Cheese Souffles With Salad

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  aged (firm) goat cheese
  4              large  eggs
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
                        extra for baking sheet
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/3           cups  whole milk
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh thyme leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
                        === ACCOMPANIMENT ===
                        Salad greens -- tossed with
                        Your favorite vinaigrette

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Butter six (3/4-cup) ramekins (3 3/4 by 2 inches).  Crumble goat cheese and separate eggs.

In a saucepan melt butter over moderately-low heat and whisk in flour.  Cook roux, whisking, 3 minutes and whisk in milk.  Bring mixture to a boil, whisking constantly, and simmer, whisking occasionally, 3 minutes.  Remove pan from heat and add yolks, mustard, 1 teaspoon thyme, 2/3 cheese, and salt and pepper, to taste, whisking until cheese is melted.  Transfer yolk mixture to a large bowl.

In another large bowl with an electric mixer beat whites with a pinch salt until they just hold stiff peaks.  Stir 1/4 whites into yolk mixture to lighten and fold in remaining whites and remaining cheese gently but thoroughly.

Divide souffle mixture among ramekins and arrange in a large baking pan just large enough to hold them.  Add enough hot water to baking pan to reach halfway up sides of ramekins.  Bake souffles in middle of oven until slightly puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes, and transfer to a rack.  Let souffles stand, uncovered, 30 minutes (souffles will fall slightly).

Lightly butter a baking sheet.  Run a thin knife around edges of souffles.  Invert each souffle onto palm of your hand and carefully put, right-side up, onto baking sheet.  Souffles may be made up to this point 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.

Increase temperature to 425 degrees.

In a small saucepan bring cream with remaining teaspoon thyme, salt and pepper, to taste, to a boil.  Remove pan from heat and keep cream warm, covered.  Bake souffles in middle of oven until slightly puffed and heated through, about 5 minutes.

Transfer souffles to plates.  Spoon 2 tablespoons cream over each souffle and arrange salad decoratively alongside.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9             slices  commercial whole-wheat bread - (abt 8 oz)
  2               cups  walnuts - (abt 8 oz)
  3              large  eggs
  3             medium  onions -- diced
  1              small  green bell pepper -- diced
  1              small  celery rib -- minced
  1                     small bunch parsley -- stems discarded,
                        and leaves chopped
     2/3           cup  canned crushed tomatoes
                        = (or one 16-oz can diced tomatoes,
                        drained very well)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  canola oil
  1           teaspoon  poultry seasoning
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Generous grinding black pepper
                        === MUSHROOM GRAVY ===
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  2               cups  thinly-sliced mushrooms - (8 oz)
     1/4           cup  unbleached flour
  2 1/2           cups  vegetable stock
                        = (store-bought or homemade)
     1/4           cup  dry red wine
  2        tablespoons  tamari soy sauce
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Toast the bread slices either in the toaster or on a baking sheet placed under the broiler.  Let cool.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Generously butter a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan, then line the bottom with waxed paper and butter the paper.

Tear up the toasted bread slices and make crumbs out of them in a food processor.  Place in a large bowl.

Process the walnuts until finely ground and mix into the bread crumbs.  Combine the eggs and onions in the processor and process until fine but not liquefied.  Stir into the bread crumbs.  Place the green pepper, celery, parsley, tomatoes, and oil in the processor and grind until fine but still with some texture.  Stir into the loaf mixture along with the poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper.  Mix this all very well until evenly moistened.  (The mixture may be prepared to this point and refrigerated up to 8 hours in advance.)  Scrape it into the prepared loaf pan and smooth over the top.  Cover the loaf with foil.

Bake 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center of the loaf comes out dry.  Let sit 5 minutes, then run a knife all along the sides of the loaf to help loosen it.  Unmold the loaf onto a platter and remove the waxed paper.  Let the loaf cool 20 minutes or so before slicing it.  It's best to serve the loaf warm and the gravy hot.

For the Mushroom Gravy:  Melt the butter in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and saute until brown, about 7 minutes.  Stir in the flour; it will become very pasty.  Cook this roux for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  It will stick to the bottom of the pan a little bit; that's okay.

Stir in the stock, wine, soy sauce, and pepper, and bring to a boil.  Cook the sauce at a lively simmer for 5 minutes, stirring almost constantly and scraping any crusty bits that adhere to the bottom of the pan.  Serve in a sauceboat.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  water
  2               cups  wild rice
  2          teaspoons  salt -- plus more to taste
  1                     bay leaf
  12            sprigs  thyme
  4          teaspoons  grapeseed or canola oil
  2             pounds  chanterelle or portobello mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and chopped
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  6        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  4              large  shallots -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  fennel seeds -- toasted and cracked
  2          teaspoons  cumin seeds -- toasted and cracked
  2          teaspoons  coarsely-chopped fresh thyme leaves
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  mixed dried fruits
                        = (such as cherries, cranberries,
                        raisins, chopped figs, or chopped
                        apricots)
  1                cup  chopped walnuts -- toasted
  1              pound  stemmed arugula or watercress
  8             ounces  fresh white goat cheese -- crumbled

To prepare the Rice:  Wash the rice under cold water for 2 minutes.  Bring 8 cups of water to a boil and add the salt, bay leaf, and thyme.  Add the washed rice to the boiling water and simmer for 40 minutes, or until tender.  Drain the rice and remove the bay leaf and thyme; let cool.  (This can be done 1 day ahead of time and refrigerated.)  You should have 7 cups cooked rice.

In a large skillet, heat the grapeseed or canola oil over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 6 minutes, or until lightly browned.  Remove from heat, drain well, and set aside.

To make the Vinaigrette:  In a small bowl whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, shallots, fennel, cumin, thyme, and pepper and season with salt.  Add the dried fruits.

In a salad bowl, combine the cooled wild rice, cooked mushrooms, and walnuts.  Toss with the vinaigrette and fruits.

To serve, portion the salad onto a large platter, top with the greens, and sprinkle with the goat cheese.
