                        Asian Seared Chicken Salad

Recipe By     :Jay Bentley
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     boneless skinless chicken breasts - (to 4)
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/3           cup  oil
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  granulated garlic
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried ginger powder
  1           teaspoon  five spice powder
                        = (available in most Asian markets)
                        === SALAD OPTIONS ===
                        Mixed greens or mesclun mix
                        Fresh bean spouts
                        Shredded carrots
                        Shredded green onions
                        Crushed peanuts
                        Dry Chinese noodles
                        Sesame dressing

Pound the chicken breasts to an equal thickness of about 3/4 of an inch and toss into the marinade.  Place in a ziplock bag for at least two hours before cooking.

For the Salad:  Use approximately one good handful of mixed greens per person.  You can use mesclun mix -- a blend of various young lettuces, arugula, and other greens, available in most markets, which have been washed and are ready to use.  Other items that work well with this mix are: fresh bean spouts, shredded carrots, shredded green onions, crushed peanuts, and dry Chinese noodles.  Or create your own favorite mix!

Cooking the Chicken:  Preheat the contact grill for 5 minutes.  Add the chicken and cook over high heat for 1 minute or until you get a good grill color on one side.  After one minute, lower the heat to medium and turn the chicken.  Cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is completely cooked all of the way through.  Remove from the grill and allow it to cool to room temperature.

Before serving, cut into 1-inch slices and toss with all of the greens and other ingredients in the sesame dressing.  Put onto plates and garnish with toasted noodles, crushed peanuts, or both.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  The chicken is seared and allowed to cool to room temperature before using with mixed greens.  You can also grill the chicken in advance and keep it refrigerated, but allow it to return to room temperature before adding it to the salad.

                BBQ Boneless Pork Loin With Apricot Glaze

Recipe By     :Jay Bentley

Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Boneless pork loin
                        === RUB ===
  4        tablespoons  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  paprika
  1         tablespoon  granulated garlic
  1         tablespoon  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  cumin
  1           teaspoon  allspice
  1           teaspoon  ground cloves
                        === APRICOT GLAZE ===
  3               cups  apricot preserves
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar
  1           teaspoon  cumin
  2        tablespoons  cracked black pepper
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
                        Water -- if needed

Rub the mixture into the pork and store overnight in a Ziplock bag.

Cook the pork over low fire for 1 to 2 hours, turning occasionally.  When the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees, begin basting the pork with the Apricot Glaze.  By keeping the heat low enough and by turning frequently, you can keep the glaze from burning.  Cook for another 30 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees.  Let the pork rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.  Serve with lots of extra sauce.

For the Apricot Glaze:  Mix everything together.  Bring to a boil and simmer for about 1/2 hour.  Thin slightly with water if needed.  Serve over or alongside of the pork.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Pork loin is a great value these days.  Its mild flavor is especially great for grilling and it lends itself very well to different kinds of fruit glazes.  Rub a pork loin with the spice mixture above, slow cook it over a fire, and serve it with a delicious apricot sauce.

Rub the mixture into the pork and store overnight in a Ziplock bag.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the pork over low fire for 1 to 2 hours, turning occasionally.  When the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees, begin basting the pork with the Apricot Glaze.  By keeping the heat low enough and by turning frequently, you can keep the glaze from burning.  Cook for another 30 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees.  Let the pork rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.  Serve with lots of extra sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Apricot Glaze:  Mix everything together.  Bring to a boil and simmer for about 1/2 hour.  Thin slightly with water if needed.  Serve over or alongside of the pork.

Comments:  Pork loin is a great value these days.  Its mild flavor is especially great for grilling and it lends itself very well to different kinds of fruit glazes.  Rub a pork loin with the spice mixture above, slow cook it over a fire, and serve it with a delicious apricot sauce.

                   BBQ Ham And French Brie Quesadillas

Recipe By     :Jay Bentley
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling
                Ham

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     ham steak approximately 1/2" thick
  1                     wedge Brie cheese - (8 oz) -- thinly sliced
  4              large  burrito-size flour tortillas - (to 6)
  1           teaspoon  BBQ sauce

Take the ham steak and brown it on your grill until the edges begin to blacken.  Brush it very lightly with some BBQ sauce, and continue to cook it for another couple of minutes.

Be careful to not burn the sauce -- the idea is to slightly grill, then glaze the ham.  Remove the steak from the heat and after it has cooled, coarsely chop it.

When you are ready to make the quesadillas, cover the bottom tortilla with some of the chopped ham and some thin slices of Brie.  Top with another flour tortilla and place the quesadillas on the grill.

Cook on one side until the cheese begins to melt, and the tortilla begins to get crisp.  Do the other side the same way.  When both sides are nicely browned and slightly crisp, cut into pie-shaped pieces and serve.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Try this French variation on the classic Mexican quesadilla.  It's best if you can get some true French Bayonne ham, Smithfield style ham, or even prosciutto, but it still tastes great with your garden variety smoked ham from the grocery store.

Categories    : Beef                            Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        New York strip steaks/ 1 3/4" to 2" thk
                        = (or filets or other comparable cut)
                        Melted Butter or oil -- as needed
                        === SPICE MIXTURE ===
  2        tablespoons  paprika
  2        tablespoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  onion powder
  3        tablespoons  granulated garlic
  3        tablespoons  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  oregano

Blend all spice mixture ingredients together in a small bowl.

Place some of the spice mixture on a plate large enough to accommodate the meat.

Dip the meat in butter or oil on both sides and push one side into the spice covered plate.  Place the seasoned side down on the hot grill.  If you don't see lots of smoke and maybe even some flames you probably didn't preheat your grill enough.  Don't worry about the fire and smoke, it's all part of the process.

Cook the seasoned side for 3 to 5 minutes, long enough to form a good crust, then turn and cook the other side as well.

Finish cooking the steak for a period of between 5 to 15 minutes, depending on your preferred degree of doneness and serve hot with lemon wedges on the side.  Use your instant read meat thermometer to determine the approximate internal temperature.

This recipe yields ?? servins.

Comments:  When blackening, remember the key to success is high heat, so be sure that your grill is beyond the smoking stage.  The idea is to char and mellow the flavors of the seasoning and use them to form a crust that will seal in the moisture.

                       Brazilian Style Mixed Grill

Recipe By     :Jay Bentley
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MEAT ===
  2             pounds  beef tri-tips - (to 3) -- well trimmed
  2             pounds  turkey tenderloins - (to 3)
  8                     Polish sausages
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  cumin
  3        tablespoons  black pepper
  2        tablespoons  granulated garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === FOR SERVING ===
                        Brazilian Salsa Verde -- (see recipe)

Marinate the beef and poultry in a large Ziplock bag for at least 2 hours before cooking.

Place the beef and turkey on skewers and cook over a hot fire, basting frequently with the marinade.  Start with the turkey (it takes the longest.)

After 6 to 8 minutes, add the beef, cook for another 5 to 8 minutes, and then add the sausage.  Be sure to keep some water available in case of flare-ups.

The turkey is done when the it reads 160 degrees, and the beef should be 125 to 130 degrees for medium-rare to medium.

Serve with Brazilian Salsa Verde.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Here is an example of a Brazilian mixed grill.  The whole thing is based on a vinegar and oil marinade, and the object is to provide a variety of grilled meats at the same time.  In this case, use some beef tri-tip, turkey tenderloins, and some smoky links of Polish sausage.  If using bamboo skewers, soak them in water for an hour before use.  Have your meat thermometer handy -- especially for the poultry.

Marinate the beef and poultry in a large Ziplock bag for at least 2 hours before cooking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the beef and turkey on skewers and cook over a hot fire, basting frequently with the marinade.  Start with the turkey (it takes the longest.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
After 6 to 8 minutes, add the beef, cook for another 5 to 8 minutes, and then add the sausage.  Be sure to keep some water available in case of flare-ups.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The turkey is done when the it reads 160 degrees, and the beef should be 125 to 130 degrees for medium-rare to medium.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve with Brazilian Salsa Verde.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Here is an example of a Brazilian mixed grill.  The whole thing is based on a vinegar and oil marinade, and the object is to provide a variety of grilled meats at the same time.  In this case, use some beef tri-tip, turkey tenderloins, and some smoky links of Polish sausage.  If using bamboo skewers, soak them in water for an hour before use.  Have your meat thermometer handy -- especially for the poultry.

                               Cajun Onions

Recipe By     :George Hirsch
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  onions -- sliced 1/4" thick
  1              piece  heavy-duty aluminum foil - (12" by 24")
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce

Place the onion slices in the center of the foil.  Combine the remaining ingredients and stir until well combined.  Dot the onions with the seasoned butter and wrap in foil, folding the edges over twice.  Place the packets on a hot grill for 3 to 5 minutes on each side; move them to low heat for 10 minutes longer.

These onions can also be cooked in a cast-iron skillet.  Melt the butter in a skillet and stir in the spices.  Add the onions and cook over high heat until the onions are limp; move the skillet to lower heat.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Cajun food is flavorful, but it should not be so hot that it overpowers your taste buds or burns your mouth.  For those who want their food extra hot, leave a bottle of hot sauce on the table.  Serve these onions with steaks or pork chops as an alternative to fried onions.  For a low-cholesterol version, substitute 2 tablespoons of olive oil for the butter.

  1                cup  sugar

     1/4           cup  heavy cream
                        Juice and zest of 1/2 orange -- (optional)

In a cast-iron sauce pot, heat the sugar over the grill at a medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until it melts and becomes liquid.

This recipe yields about 1 cup.

Comments:  This is a lovely dressing for many desserts -- ice cream, cake, bread pudding or fruit.  Try it, you might find your own idea for what it could top.

  1                     twelve-inch square aluminum foil

Slice off 1/4 inch from the bottom of each head of garlic.  (This makes it easier to remove the garlic after it has been caramelized.)

Rub the garlic with olive oil and place on the grill, cut-side down.  Cook very slowly at a low heat, allowing the natural sugars to caramelize.  (The total cooking time should be between 45 and 60 minutes.)  Halfway through, cover the garlic with the foil.

Comments:  Using caramelized garlic instead of butter on bread saves lots of calories -- it also tastes delicious.  Add a few heads of garlic whenever there's room for them on the grill.  You can cover any leftover heads with a little olive oil and refrigerate them for later use.

           Charred Tomato Soup With Corn, Peppers And Tortillas

Categories    : Grilling                        Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  olive oil
  4             pounds  ripe red tomatoes -- halved
  2                     green peppers -- charred, diced
  2               cups  chopped onions
  2               cups  frozen or fresh corn
  5                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  6               cups  chicken stock
     1/2          cups  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/2          cups  dry red wine
  1           teaspoon  finely-diced jalapeÒo pepper
  4               cups  crumbled corn or flour tortilla chips -- (optional)

Preheat your gas or charcoal grill for a few minutes on high heat.  Dip the tomato halves in olive oil and place in a grill basket or put directly on a greased grill.  Allow them to smoke and burn for as long as it takes them to become slightly charred.  Using a metal spatula, remove, cool and chop them in a coarse dice and set aside.

Cut the green peppers into halves lengthwise, and remove the pulp and seeds.  Rub with oil and char like the tomatoes.  Remove and dice.

In a large soup pot, add the olive oil and sautÈ the onions and garlic over high heat until transparent.  Add the stock, tomatoes, peppers, wine, pepper and sugar.  Cook over medium heat for 30 minutes until reduced, add the corn, cook for 5 more minutes, add the cilantro, stir in the tortilla chips and serve.  You can also serve the chips on the side or not at all.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  The quality of the tomatoes is essential.  Good, ripe homegrown or hothouse tomatoes are the only way to go.  Forget the gassed, pale and petroleum coated orb that passes as your average grocery store tomato.

                            Chicken Florentine

                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fresh spinach leaves - (tightly packed)
                        = (or 1/2 cup thawed frozen spinach)
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
                        Puree from 8 cloves Caramelized Garlic -- (see recipe)
  6                     fresh basil leaves -- chopped
  1                cup  fresh bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  Tabasco
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     chicken cutlets - (3 to 4 oz ea) -- pounded lightly
                        on both sides
                        Lemon slices -- for garnish

Place the spinach in a food processor with the onion, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and basil leaves.  Blend until smooth.  Place the mixture in a small bowl and add the bread crumbs, mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, Tabasco, salt, and pepper.

Put the chicken cutlets on a flat surface and place an equal amount of stuffing in the center of each one.  Fold in the sides of the chicken cutlets; beginning at the bottom, roll them tight and secure each with a toothpick.

Preheat the grill to a medium heat.

Brush the chicken with some of the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and grill 4 to 5 minutes on each side.  Use any remaining olive oil to brush the chicken occasionally.  Serve with lemon slices.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  When a dish is prepared Florentine style, it means that spinach is included somewhere.  Funny enough, the connection between Florence, Italy, and spinach has never been discovered and the Florentines don't prefer spinach any more than other Italians.  Regardless, this is a wonderful recipe that can be served with pasta made on your side burner, all at the same time!

                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless chicken breasts - (to 2) -- pounded 3/4" thick
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh garlic
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  3        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  cumin
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === PEANUT SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  rice vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  hot chili paste
                        = (from Asian section in grocery stores)
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  2                     garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  fresh cilantro leaves -- (optional)
     3/4           cup  roasted peanuts
                        Salt -- to taste

Throw all marinade ingredients into a food processor and make a paste.

Take pounded chicken breasts and cut them lengthwise into strips about 1-inch wide.  Marinate for 1 to 4 hours.

When you are ready to cook, thread the chicken on pre-moistened skewers.  Be sure to oil the grate on your grill before preheating on high heat.  Grill the chicken for approximately 5 to 6 minutes, turning when necessary.  Serve on the skewers or wrapped in lettuce leaves.

For the Peanut Sauce:  Blend everything together in a food processor.  Use water if needed to thin the sauce.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This recipe works just as well for beef, pork, or just about any meat, even fish.  Just keep whatever it is you are cooking to a maximum of 3/4" in thickness, so it will cook thoroughly on the inside.  Be sure to soak the bamboo skewers (available in most grocery stores) for at least 30 minutes before use.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  chicken breasts -- cut 8 pieces

Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  pineapple juice
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     Scotch bonnet pepper - (to 2) -- chopped
                        = (or substitute jalapeÒos)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  ice
  12                    chicken wings

To make the marinade, combine the pineapple juice, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, peppers, allspice, salt, and pepper in a small cast-iron sauce pot on your side burner, and boil 2 minutes.  Add the ice and set aside until cool.

Cut the wings into 3 pieces each and discard the small wing tip (or save for soup).  Place the chicken wings and the marinade in a bowl and refrigerate a minimum of 2 hours (or overnight).

Preheat the grill to a medium-high heat.

Remove the wings from the marinade and cook slowly on the grill for 15 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally.

This recipe yields 24 pieces.

Comments:  This version is sweet and hot.  Scotch bonnets are small peppers, but don't let their size fool you.  They're one of the hottest peppers around.

                Croque Monsieur - {Toasted Ham And Cheese}

Recipe By     :Jay Bentley

Categories    : Grilling                        Ham
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  shaved Vermont cheddar cheese
                        = (you can also use Velveeta!)
  8                     thin slices country ham
                        = (or other good-quality ham)
  8             slices  sourdough bread
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- softened

Preheat your grill to medium.

Build the sandwiches by placing a thin layer of cheese followed by a slice of ham, and then another layer of cheese.  Place another piece of bread on top.  Trim the edges, cutting off any excess crust.

Butter both sides well and place as close to the burners as you can.  Grill until well browned on both sides.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Leave it to the French to come up with the best toasted ham and cheese sandwich in the world.  We here in America have a pretty good version of the Croque Monsieur that has thin slices of smoked country ham and shavings of good Vermont cheddar between slices of good sourdough bread.  It's even better when you do it on the grill.

  1                cup  water

Cut the pork loin into small steaks/medallions about 3/4- to 1-inch thick, allowing one or two per person.  Trim any outside fat and place, along with the marinade, in a plastic container or Ziplock bag between four hours and one day.  Another option is to reserve 2 slices of pineapple fresh or canned per person.

For the Sauce:  When you are ready to cook the meat, preheat your grill on high heat covered, for about 20 minutes.  While the grill is heating start sautÈing the onions in a pan on your side burner (or on your stove) with the oil and sugar over medium/high heat until some of them begin to turn brown or caramelize.  Once this has happened, turn the heat down to low and add the rest of the ingredients and allow them to simmer while you grill the meat.

Grilling The Meat:  Place the meat on the grill and cook on one side until the outside begins to turn a nice shade of brown (don't burn).  Place the pineapple slices on the warming rack.  When the meat has reached the desired color, usually in 6 or 7 minutes, turn the steaks over and turn down the heat to the lowest setting and close the cover.

Finishing The Dish:  While the meat is finishing, add the remaining marinade to the sauce, stir, and reduce until the mixture has thickened to the consistency of thin syrup.  Remove the steaks and pineapples, arrange with rice on warm plates, add the sauce and serve.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Pork loin is a great deal.  Low in fat and mild in flavor, this versatile cut allows you to prepare it in a number of different styles.  Serve this dish with or over Basmati rice, which is a fragrant and flavorful variety of rice that originated in the foothills of the Himalayas and can be found in most supermarkets.

                  Fillet Of Beef With Horseradish Sauce

Recipe By     :George Hirsch
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             pounds  beef tenderloin - (to 10)
  1         tablespoon  Tabasco sauce
                        Beef Rub -- (see below)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Horseradish Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        === BEEF RUB ===
  2        tablespoons  sweet paprika
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  dried thyme
  1         tablespoon  dried basil
  1         tablespoon  dried parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg

Combine the Beef Rub ingredients in a small bowl and mix well.

Trim all the fat from the tenderloin and slice off the silver skin.  Fold the thin end under so the tenderloin is the same thickness on both ends.  Tie the tenderloin with butcher's twine every 2 to 3 inches (or have your butcher do it).  Rub the meat with the Tabasco and dry rub and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Preheat the grill to a medium heat.

Thread the beef with a long skewer from a rotisserie and secure with the forks.  Place the meat on the grill and baste with olive oil.  Cook 35 to 40 minutes or until desired doneness.  Remove and let the meat rest 10 minutes before slicing.  Serve with Horseradish Sauce.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Beef fillet is the boneless tenderloin, which is extremely tender.  It is always cooked quickly and never eaten well done.  Fillet is expensive, especially around the holidays, so find one on sale, buy it, and freeze it.  You'll be glad you did.  If that jar of horseradish in the refrigerator is more than a few months old, it's time to buy a new one.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     turkey breast -- thawed if frozen
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Herbed Mayonnaise -- (see recipe)
                        === DRY RUB ===
  5        tablespoons  sea salt
                        = (or kosher salt)
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  thyme
  3        tablespoons  crumbled rosemary leaves
  3        tablespoons  granulated garlic

Combine dry rub ingredients; mix well.  Rub the thawed turkey breast inside and out with olive oil and coat with the dry rub mixture.

With a two-burner grill:  Use only one side and place the turkey over a drip pan.  If you want to add wood chips, presoak them for at least an hour, and place them in a small metal container (I use an old 6-inch sautÈ pan) over the active burner.

Preheat on medium, put the turkey in and check every 10 minutes during the first half hour of cooking to see if the skin is getting burned.  If you see some signs of this, lower the heat level or place some heavy-duty foil under the bird and/or over the area that is affected.  The bird is finished when a meat thermometer inserted in the deepest part of the breast reads 160 degrees.

Three Burner Grill:  Follow the same procedure as the two-burner, but place the bird and the drip pan in the middle.

Serve with Herbed Mayonnaise.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  A meat thermometer is a great inexpensive investment that will give you safe and consistent results every time.

                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        === MARINADE ===
  2                     lemons -- juiced
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2 1/2    tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  sherry vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse salt
  18                    baby artichokes
                        Soaked bamboo skewers
  1                cup  pitted briny black olives

Remove the toughest outer leaves from the artichokes.

For the Sauce:  Prepare mayonnaise sauce, whisking together ingredients in a small bowl.  Refrigerate covered for at least 1 hour.  Reblend sauce if it separates.

For the Marinade:  Prepare marinade, combining ingredients in a broad, shallow dish.  Trim any remaining tough edges from artichoke leaves and slice them in half vertically.  Using a small spoon, remove the tiny fuzzy choke near the base of each half.  Place each artichoke in the marinade promptly to avoid discoloration.  Cover loosely and let sit at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes.

Fire up the grill, bringing the temperature to medium (4 to 5 five seconds with the hand test).

While grill heats, drain artichokes, reserving marinade.  Thread an artichoke half on a skewer, followed by 2 olives and then another artichoke half, avoiding crowding.  Repeat with remaining ingredients and skewers.

Grill kebabs uncovered over medium heat for 15 to 18 minutes, turning to cook on all sides and brushing with reserved marinade at the same time.  When done, artichokes should be tender and darkened with a few crisp edges.  If grilling covered, cook for 12 to 15 minutes, turning once midway and brushing then with marinade.

Serve kebabs hot accompanied by mayonnaise sauce.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 dozen kebabs.

  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     anchovies -- (optional)
                        = (or 1 tbspn anchovy paste)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
                        Water -- if needed to thin

The traditional way to mix these ingredients is to mash them with a wooden spoon against the sides of a wooden bowl to make a thin paste.  You can mix them with a whisk if you prefer.

Wash the lettuce well, and remove any bad outside leaves, then pour dressing all through the inside and outside of the lettuce, making sure that the dressing is throughout.

Place lettuce on the grill, on medium-heat, turning often.  Cook about 5 to 10 minutes until it is wilted on the outside and smoky tasting.

To serve, cut length-wise in wedges.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

                    Grilled Coriander Chicken Breasts

Recipe By     :Jay Bentley
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                cup  olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely diced
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  1         tablespoon  ground coriander seeds
  1         tablespoon  granulated garlic
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt

Flatten the chicken breasts to approximately 1-inch thick and place in a Ziplock bag with the marinade ingredients for 4 hours.

Preheat your grill for 5 minutes and place the chicken over the hottest part.  Let the flames come in contact with the meat to brown but not burn.  Cook for 5 minutes and turn.

Do the same with the other side.  Check for doneness.  If the chicken needs to cook some more, turn the heat down to low or move the chicken to a warming rack.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  We are used to the taste of coriander (cilantro) in Mexican food where the leaves are often used to season and garnish a multitude of dishes, but the seeds can also be ground to produce a pungent and wonderful flavor.  Here is a simple coriander grilled chicken breast to serve as a sandwich on toasted pita bread, or as an entrÈe with stir-fried vegetables and basmati rice.

Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     eggplant
  2             sticks  butter -- melted
  3        tablespoons  fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Slice the eggplant lengthwise (top to bottom) about 3/4" thick.  You can leave the skin on.  Brush with some of the melted butter and grill approximately 2 minutes per side over a hot fire.

In a sautÈ pan, heat the rest of the butter and cook until it begins to turn brown and foam.  Remove from the heat and add the fresh thyme.  Add a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper.

Arrange the eggplant on a plate, and spoon some of the hot butter over it.  Serve with any red meat.

This recipe yields ?? servings of one slice per person.

Comments:  Eggplants are great grilled over an open fire.  Here is a simple recipe for a side dish that will go with any red meat.  If you have a side burner on your grill, you can make the sauce while the eggplant is cooking.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Sandwiches                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  firm-fleshed white fish -- cut 1" chunks
                        === FISH MARINADE ===
  1                cup  olive oil
  4        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1           teaspoon  granulated garlic
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  2          teaspoons  paprika
  2          teaspoons  lemon-pepper seasoning
  1           teaspoon  seasoned salt
                        === FRESH SALSA ===
  1                can  tomatoes drained
  1                     onion quartered
  1              bunch  cilantro leaves -- stems removed
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  3                     fresh garlic cloves
  1         tablespoon  mild chili powder
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === FOR ASSEMBLY ===
  1              dozen  whole-wheat flour tortillas
  3                     tomatoes -- seeded, diced fine
  1              large  sweet yellow onion -- finely diced
     1/2          head  iceberg lettuce -- shredded
  2               cups  fresh cilantro leaves

For the Fish Marinade:  Mix everything together and marinate the fish for about an hour before cooking.  The lime juice will help firm up the fish and help keep it from breaking up when you wrap it in the taco.  While the fish is marinating, prepare the other items you want to use to finish the dish.

For the Fresh Salsa:  Put everything into a food processor and pulse until all of the ingredients appear to be finely chopped.  Set aside and refrigerate.

Preheat your grill to high.  Place the fish in a foil "boat" with the top open, so the smoke can penetrate and flavor the fish.  Cook for about 10 minutes, testing the fish for doneness.

While the fish is cooking, very lightly brush the taco shells with olive oil and warm them quickly over the fire.  You want to toast them slightly, but not to the point of becoming brittle.  If you have a warming rack, that's the place to do it.

When the fish is done, put everything on platters and let people serve themselves.

This recipe yields 12 tacos.

Comments:  Grilled fish tacos using fresh ingredients and low fat, whole wheat tortillas are a great way to get that "south of the border" taste and still be able to knock off some of the calories.  Any firm white fleshed fish will work -- Sea Bass and Halibut work particularly well.  Their flesh is firm enough to hold together when you wrap it inside of a tortilla, and the taste is fabulous.  Also included is a recipe for fresh salsa that not only goes great with fish tacos, but also makes a wonderful dipping sauce for tortilla chips.

                   Grilled Flank Steak Argentine Style

Recipe By     :Jay Bentley
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  flank steak or other red meat
                        = (meat should be of uniform thickness,
                        no more than 1 1/2")
                        Chimichurra Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        === MARINADE ===
  1 1/2           cups  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  granulated garlic
  1                     fresh lemon squeezed
  2        tablespoons  cracked black pepper
  1         tablespoon  sea salt

Combine the meat and the marinade ingredients in a plastic Ziplock bag for at least 48 hours.

Cook over a very hot charcoal or gas fire as close to the flames as you can.  You can even use a grill basket and rest it on top of the flames.  Cook for about 3 to 4 minutes per side allowing the heat to form a crust on the outside of the steaks.

Do not overcook.  If you aren't sure of the doneness, take a test slice to check.  Remember, you can always put it back on, but if it's overcooked, it's history!

Serve thinly sliced across the grain and accompany with Chimichurra sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This is an Argentine specialty.  Our favorite cut is flank steak, but beef tri-tips trimmed of excess fat work well, as do various types of game, including elk, moose and deer.

Cook over a very hot charcoal or gas fire as close to the flames as you can.  You can even use a grill basket and rest it on top of the flames.  Cook for about 3 to 4 minutes per side allowing the heat to form a crust on the outside of the steaks.

<DirT>
Do not overcook.  If you aren&apos;t sure of the doneness, take a test slice to check.  Remember, you can always put it back on, but if it&apos;s overcooked, it&apos;s history!
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve thinly sliced across the grain and accompany with Chimichurra sauce.

Comments:  This is an Argentine specialty.  Our favorite cut is flank steak, but beef tri-tips trimmed of excess fat work well, as do various types of game, including elk, moose and deer.

             Grilled Ham Steak With Mustard-Ginger Ale Sauce

Recipe By     :George Hirsch
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Ham
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  ham steak -- 1/2" to 3/4" thick
  12            ounces  ginger ale
  2        tablespoons  honey
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh mint
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
  1              pinch  ground coriander

Rinse the ham steak in cold water.  In a medium bowl, combine the remaining ingredients and mix well.

Grill the ham steak on one side at a medium heat and turn it after 4 to 5 minutes (it will turn light brown).  Baste with half the sauce.

Move the ham to a cooler edge of the grill and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, basting occasionally.  Serve the remaining sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Grilled ham steak is the perfect choice for a very simple and quick meal.  The ham steak is rinsed first to wash off any excess salt.  Adding ginger ale to the sauce gives it an elusive tang.  This recipe is a natural with "Sweet Potato Home-Fries" (see recipe).

                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Boneless skinless chicken breasts
                        === JERK SPICE MIX ===
  2        tablespoons  ground ginger
  2        tablespoons  paprika
  1         tablespoon  granulated garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  allspice
  1           teaspoon  nutmeg
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === CHICKEN MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  Jerk Spice Mix -- (see above)

Combine the Jerk Spice ingredients together.  Store remainder in a sealed bottle in a dry place for future use.  (Makes about 1/2 cup)

Cut the chicken breasts into strips about 1/2-inch thick and 3 inches long.  Marinate for 3 to 4 hours or longer.

Thread on the skewers and cook over a hot fire for approximately 8 to 10 minutes until done in the middle.  Serve as an appetizer or over rice as a main course.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Here is a spicy, low fat summer treat that calls for Jamaican style jerked marinated boneless chicken breasts on bamboo skewers.  Remember to soak the skewers for at least an hour before you use them to keep them from burning during use.  This dish can serve as an appetizer, or you can serve it over rice with vegetables as a main course.

Note:  This jerk spice recipe goes well with any kind of meat you wish to use.

          Grilled Leg Of Lamb With Tarragon And Balsamic Vinegar

Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Boneless leg of lamb -- cut serving size
                        = (7 to 8 oz ea - 1 3/4" to 2 1/2" thk)
                        reserving bone and trim for stock
                        === MARINADE ===
  2               cups  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  granulated garlic
  2        tablespoons  unseasoned meat tenderizer
  3        tablespoons  dry rosemary
  3        tablespoons  cracked pepper
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  marinade into sauce
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/2           cup  fresh tarragon
     1/2           cup  Balsamic vinegar
     1/2           cup  apple/mint jelly
     1/2           cup  port wine
  2               cups  reduced lamb stock
  1         tablespoon  freshly-cracked black pepper

The best way to marinate this amount of meat is to put everything into a 2 gallon Ziplock bag and shake it up.  Every day or so, move the meat around in the mixture to be sure all the pieces get covered.

Remove the meat from the refrigerator and allow it to reach room temperature about an hour before cooking.

For the Sauce:  In a pot, cover all the bones and trim from the lamb with water and cook on low heat overnight.  In the morning strain the remaining water into a smaller sauce pan and reduce to about 2 cups of liquid.

Refrigerate the demi-glace and skim the fat off the top.  Save the rest for your final procedure.

Heat the marinade over high heat until sizzling, add garlic, tarragon and pepper.  Cook for 1 minute.

Deglaze with the port, and add the remaining ingredients, reduce to 1/3 of the original volume and reserve for use with the lamb.

Cooking and Service:  When the fire is ready, start with the thicker pieces of lamb and cook as closely to the fire as possible.  The oil will cause the fire to flare up and engulf the outside of the meat, which is exactly what you want to happen.

The idea is to create a crust that will add another dimension of texture and seal the juices and marinade inside.  After a few minutes, add the thinner pieces as well.  Do not turn the meat more than is necessary to keep it from burning.

When you think the meat is done to your liking, remove it from the fire and cut off a thin slice to check doneness.  When all of the meat is cooked, cut the various chunks across the grain into slices about 1/2-inch thick.  Arrange on plates and pour a small amount of sauce over the lamb.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  The preparation on this recipe takes a little advance planning but it is well worth it; especially when you become a food hero to your friends!  Boneless is the only way to go because the meat is ready to cut into serving size pieces of 7 to 8 ounces (1 3/4 and 2 1/2 inches in thickness).  This also gives you better control over the degree of doneness of each piece -- you can turn and/or remove each piece individually rather than have to contend with a whole butterflied leg.

The idea is to create a crust that will add another dimension of texture and seal the juices and marinade inside.  After a few minutes, add the thinner pieces as well.  Do not turn the meat more than is necessary to keep it from burning.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When you think the meat is done to your liking, remove it from the fire and cut off a thin slice to check doneness.  When all of the meat is cooked, cut the various chunks across the grain into slices about 1/2-inch thick.  Arrange on plates and pour a small amount of sauce over the lamb.

Comments:  The preparation on this recipe takes a little advance planning but it is well worth it; especially when you become a food hero to your friends!  Boneless is the only way to go because the meat is ready to cut into serving size pieces of 7 to 8 ounces (1 3/4 and 2 1/2 inches in thickness).  This also gives you better control over the degree of doneness of each piece -- you can turn and/or remove each piece individually rather than have to contend with a whole butterflied leg.

                    Grilled Lobster With Dijon Mustard

Recipe By     :George Hirsch
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  unsalted butter - (4 sticks) -- melted
     1/2           cup  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
                        Juice of 2 lemons
  8                     lobsters - (1 lb ea) -- split, cleaned

Combine the butter, mustard, parsley, Tabasco, and lemon juice in a medium bowl.  Turn the lobsters over and brush the cavities and tail meat with the butter mixture.

Place the lobsters on a hot grill, cavity-sides down, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on high heat.  Turn the lobsters right-side up, brush again with the butter sauce, and move them to the cooler edges of the grill.  Cook for 5 to 6 minutes.  Serve with the remaining warm butter mixture.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Have your lobsters split and cleaned at the fish market, grill them immediately and serve with a nice white wine!  It's quick and easy to make and nothing is more luxurious for a dinner party or special gathering than serving fresh, grilled lobster.

Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  asparagus -- trimmed, blanched
  1              pound  Portobello mushrooms -- sliced, cleaned,
                        rinsed, and patted dry
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  lemon pepper seasoning
  1           teaspoon  sea salt -- (optional)

Blanch the trimmed asparagus in boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the water and stop the cooking process by immersing in cold water.  The asparagus should still be firm in the middle.  Drain and set aside.

Slice the mushrooms, being careful not to break them.  Toss the asparagus and the sliced mushrooms in olive oil and sprinkle lightly with lemon pepper seasoning and set aside to marinate for 1/2 hour.

During that period, preheat on high both your grill and also a GrillMaster porcelain grill topper.  Cook over high heat for around 5 to 10 minutes until finished.  Serve either hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  A great accessory for this recipe is the GrillMaster porcelain grill topper.  You will want the surface of the topper to be very hot so as to mark the vegetables.

                    Grilled Mushrooms With Lemon Sauce

Recipe By     :Ken Hom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling
                Mushrooms

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  large button mushrooms
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sake
                        = (or rice wine or dry sherry)
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped scallions

Sprinkle the mushrooms with the salt and mix well.  Put the mushrooms into a colander and let drain for 20 minutes.  When the mushrooms have drained, rinse them in water and blot dry with paper towel.

Heat the sauce ingredients together in a small saucepan until the sugar dissolves.  Let cool.

Soak some wooden skewers in cold water for 5 minutes.  Thread 3 or 4 mushrooms on each skewer and cook under a broiler or on a barbecue.  When they are cooked, remove from the skewers, mix them with the sauce and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe is of Japanese origin, simple but unusual and quite delicious.  it offers a different way to enjoy fresh mushrooms and is a perfect side dish to enliven a barbecue or as an accompaniment to grilled meats or poultry.  The mushrooms may also be cooked using your oven broiler, so the dish may be savored indoors during the winter as well, missing only the smoky barbecue flavor.  For an authentic taste, try to obtain Japanese sake for the sauce; if it cannot be had, rice wine or dry sherry are acceptable substitutes.  The lemon sauce may be made beforehand.

Categories    : Grilling                        Pizza


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PESTO ===
  3               cups  fresh basil leaves
  1                cup  olive oil
  1                cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2           cup  pine nuts
     1/2           cup  peeled fresh garlic cloves
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        === ROASTED GARLIC ===
                        Garlic cloves -- peeled
                        === PIZZA ===
  1                     Boboli precooked pizza crust
                        = (or similar type crust)
     1/2           cup  Roasted Garlic -- sprinkled evenly
  1                     good tomato -- thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- drizzled lightly
                        over the toppings
                        A few twists of fresh black pepper

For the Pesto:  In a food processor blend all ingredients together until somewhat smooth but not totally pureed.

For the Roasted Garlic:  Put some peeled garlic cloves in an ovenproof container and roast them in your oven at 350 degrees until they turn a light brown color.

For the Pizza:  Spread some of the pesto over the shell followed by the garlic and tomatoes, olive oil and black pepper.

Preheat your gas grill on high for 25 to 30 minutes.  Sometimes I will use wood chips to enhance the flavor, but that step is optional.

Place on a pizza stone or on your warming rack and cook until the crust is a golden brown and the top is beginning to brown as well.  Slice and serve.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Roasting garlic really mellows out the flavor.  You can do a batch on the side when roasting something else like chicken or prime rib, which require the same kind of heat.  You can store it for quite a while in your refrigerator, or even preserved in olive oil.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     burrito-size flour tortillas
  3               cups  mixed shredded Monterrey Jack
                        and Cheddar cheese
  1                cup  chopped green chilis
                        Olive oil -- as needed

Place 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese along with 3 tablespoons of the chilis on half of the flour tortilla.  Fold it over and seal with a little water in a pastry 1/2 circle.

Preheat your gas grill on high heat for about 15 minutes.  Brush the tortilla with a little olive oil, place in the grill to cook on a pizza stone or the warming rack until the outside is crispy and beginning to turn brown and the cheese is melting on the inside.

Place on a cutting board, cut into four pieces, and serve as an appetizer.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  The original versions of this dish were cooked in Old Mexico over charcoal fires.  We have gone full circle now and this classic is at its best cooked on your gas grill.  You can do all kinds of variations on this recipe, with grilled slices of chicken, beef, or fish.  Use your imagination.

Comments:  The original versions of this dish were cooked in Old Mexico over charcoal fires.  We have gone full circle now and this classic is at its best cooked on your gas grill.  You can do all kinds of variations on this recipe, with grilled slices of chicken, beef, or fish.  Use your imagination.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Lemon-pepper seasoning -- to taste
                        === CARMELIZED ONION AND ORANGE SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  5        tablespoons  concentrated frozen orange juice
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  orange zest -- (optional)
     1/2           cup  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === RASPBERRY SAUCE MINT BAR STYLE ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  raspberry preserves
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  beef base -- dissolved in
     1/4           cup  water
                        = (or substitute 1/2 cup beef stock)
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        === SEARED TOMATO - CARMELIZED ONION ===
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  butter
  2               cups  canned tomatoes -- drained
  1           teaspoon  sugar -- (optional)
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  fresh whole basil leaves
     1/4           cup  red wine
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Salt -- to taste

Rub the fillets in olive oil approximately 1 hour prior to cooking, and give them a very light dusting of lemon pepper seasoning.  Rub your gas or charcoal grill with oil and/or spray the cooking surface with Pam or a similar non-stick product before preheating on a medium-high setting.  If you are using skinless fillets, put a piece of foil underneath before cooking; otherwise start the cooking process skin-side down.

Cook the salmon on medium-high heat for 10 minutes.  Just before turning, put a little more olive oil on the uncooked side to prevent sticking.  With a spatula, gently turn the fillets and cook for around 4 minutes on the other side.  If you are using foil, discard it after turning.

Remove the salmon from the grill and serve over one of the following three sauces on heated plates.

For the Caramelized Onion And Orange Sauce:  In a sautÈ pan, melt the butter and add the sliced onions.  Cook over high heat for 1 minute and add the brown sugar.  Cook the onions until they begin to turn brown but not burned.

Add the rest of the ingredients, except the salt, and turn down the heat to medium.  Allow the mixture to reduce to a consistency slightly thinner than the orange concentrate.  Add salt to taste.

When ready to serve, place several spoonfuls on warm plates in equal portions.  Gently cover with the cooked fillets.

For the Raspberry Sauce Mint Bar Style:  Follow the same process in caramelizing the onions as above.  Add the rest of the ingredients and reduce, following the same process.  Check for salt at the end although the beef base will probably provide an adequate amount.  Serve in the same manner as with the previous sauce.

For the Seared Tomatoes And Caramelized Onions:  Preheat a sautÈ pan over high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Drain and flatten the tomatoes.  Carefully place them in the hot oil and cook until they begin to burn slightly, adding oil when necessary.  If you have a splatter screen, use it, as there will be a lot of popping and splattering.  When the tomatoes are done, set them aside, being careful to keep them intact.

To caramelize the onions, melt the butter and cook the onions over high heat until they begin to brown.  You can add a little sugar, if necessary, to help the caramelizing process.  When the onions are finished, set them aside.

To finish the sauce, add a little more oil, add the basil leaves, followed by the red wine and onions.  Cook the sauce for 30 seconds, then add the tomatoes.  Salt and pepper to taste, and portion the sauce over the salmon filets.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Be sure to begin with boneless fillets.  The meat around the bone can sometimes have a strong flavor.  On thinner pieces, leave the skin on to keep the salmon from drying out during the grilling process.  The best size is a boneless fillet between 7 and 8 ounces, approximately 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick.

       Grilled Sea Bass In "Foil Boats" With Maitre D' Hotel Butter

Recipe By     :Jay Bentley
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     sea bass filets - (7 to 8 oz ea)
                        === MAITRE D' HOTEL BUTTER ===
  1              pound  butter - room temperature
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juices
  1         tablespoon  fresh cracked pepper

For the Maitre d' Hotel Butter:  Mix butter with the other ingredients and in wax or parchment paper, form a cylinder approximately 1 to 2 inches in diameter.  Refrigerate until the butter is hard.  To use, slice the butter into 1/2" rounds and place over the fish.

Select one fish filet per person.  Form a foil boat about the size of the filet with enough room on the sides so the foil will almost cover the fish.  Place a couple of small pieces of plain butter on the bottom, then place the fish in the boat.  Loosely cover the fish and cook over a hot fire for approximately 5 minutes.

Open the foil and place two pieces of the Maitre d' Hotel butter on top.  Cook for 3 more minutes until the butter has partially melted, covering the fish.  Garnish with a wedge of lemon and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Bonus Tip:  This sauce is great to put over a steak.  Just place the butter on top before serving and let the heat of the steak melt it.

Comments:  Chilean Sea Bass has become the second most popular fish behind Salmon.  Like Salmon, it has become one of the major products of aquaculture, particularly in South America.  The meat is firm, white and very tasty, and it's perfect for the grilling process.  The foil boats help prevent sticking or breaking apart on the grill.

  1                cup  grated Romano cheese

  1         tablespoon  capers
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs

Scoop out the insides of the tomatoes into a medium sized bowl, then add olive oil, olives, garlic, onion, lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Toss in a skillet and sautÈ until onion is translucent.

           Grilling And Serving Pork Ribs With A Dry Spice Rub

Recipe By     :Jay Bentley
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Spareribs or baby back ribs
                        === DRY RUB MIX ===
  2               cups  sugar
  2               cups  paprika
  1                cup  salt
     1/2           cup  chili powder
     1/2           cup  curry powder
     1/2           cup  onion powder
     1/2           cup  lemon pepper
     1/4           cup  granulated garlic
                        === RIB BASTING SAUCE ===
  2               cups  apple cider vinegar
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  Dry Rub Mix -- (see above)
  2               cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  liquid smoke

For the Dry Rub:  Mix ingredients together and store in a dry place.

Using either spareribs or baby backs, generously sprinkle the rub mix over both sides of the ribs and store them in large 2-gallon Ziplock bags for 3 or 4 days.  Less time is acceptable, but the longer the better.

Grilling The Ribs:  Some people boil ribs to render the fat out of them, and others prefer to do the whole process, from start to finish on the grill.  In this recipe we suggest that you cook the ribs in a very low oven at 200 degrees for about two hours, and then transfer them to the grill and smoke them for another 3 to 3 1/2 hours.

The idea is to simulate a "real" pit BBQ, which ideally uses low heat and creates lots of smoke.  Your gas grill is ideal because you can use the lowest settings and assure yourself of a steady and even heat source.  The "smoky" side of the equation is easy.  Using your smoker box accessory or even an old 6 inch frying pan over one of the burners, fill with presoaked wood chips, the flavor of your choice and let nature take its course.  One method is to use only the one burner under your wood chips.  The heat setting should be set at medium to low.  A handful of chips will produce as much smoke as a small bag of charcoal.  Add more as needed.

To cook the ribs, place them on the warming rack, as far away from the heat as you can, and forget them for 3 hours.  If you feel the need, you can turn them every hour or so, but you don't have to do anything until the last hour.

For the Rib Basting Sauce:  Mix everything together and paint the upper side of the ribs.  Turn the ribs every 20 minutes and repeat the process during the last hour or hour and a half of cooking.  The idea of using a thin sauce is to moisten and add color to the ribs without burning them.  Save your regular sauce until later.

Serving The Ribs:  You can tell when the ribs are done by tearing away one of the little ribs on the small end and eating it.  If it tears away very easily and it tastes good, the ribs are ready to eat.  The texture should be moist and tender.

Cut the ribs into serving portions.  Cut the ribs into 3 or 4 bone portions depending on whether you're cutting from the small end or the large end.  Baby backs are usually served in half slab portions.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  No matter what type of ribs you prefer, the secret to great flavor is a great rub!  The right mix of salt, sugar and spices will create a built-in flavor that will complement the smokiness you get from the grill.  Rubs will also add color and help create a bronze and crusty exterior to your ribs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     egg yolks
  1              whole  egg
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sea salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2               cups  canola oil
  1                cup  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped fresh herbs

Blend together the first 7 ingredients.  With the food processor running, slowly drizzle canola oil and olive oil.  If it's too thick, thin with water -- too thin, add more oil until you achieve the right consistency.  (You can also use a good quality mayonnaise like Hellmann's or Best Foods.)

Mix in the chopped fresh herbs.

This recipe yields ?? cups.

Comments:  You can make your own mayonnaise in a food processor with this recipe.  For the herb flavor, thyme, rosemary and tarragon are our favorites, but just about any kind will work.

                Iron Seared New York Steaks Mint Bar Style

Recipe By     :Jay Bentley
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     New York Steak, 1 3/4" to 2" thick
                        Chimichurra Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        === MARINADE ===
  2               cups  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  granulated garlic
  1         tablespoon  unseasoned meat tenderizer
  3        tablespoons  freshly-cracked black pepper
  1         tablespoon  dried granulated lemon peel
                        = (you can substitute lemon-pepper
                        without salt for the last two items)

Combine all the marinade ingredients with the meat in a plastic Ziplock bag for at least 48 hours.  (Preferably 3 to 4 days)

Preheat your grill so that it is very hot.  When ready, sear the steak(s) on either side for 2 to 3 minutes per side or until charred (but not burned).  You may need to finish in the oven until the desired doneness.  (Sometimes the steaks have cold centers when straight from the grill.)

Serve on heated plates with several tablespoons of Chimichurra Sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  This will work with any size piece of meat up to 2 1/2 inches in thickness -- the important idea is that the grill be very hot.  Essentially, we are blackening the meat without using blackening spices.  The oil and seasoning from the marinade adds texture and flavor during the searing process.

  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried basil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  sweet or hot paprika
  1           teaspoon  dried coriander
  1           teaspoon  Tabasco
  4                     plum tomatoes -- split, grilled,
                        and chopped
  1                cup  tomato puree
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  long-grain rice
  1                cup  sliced fresh or frozen okra

Preheat the grill and side burner to a high heat.  Grill the pork chops, ham steak, smoked pork sausage, onions, bell peppers and scallions.  (Do the vegetables on the cooler edges of the grill.)

Place the grilled pork chops, ham, sausage and bacon in a large, heavy stockpot and, stirring constantly, cook over high heat for 5 minutes.

Add the onions, bell peppers, celery, scallions, garlic, bay leaves, parsley, basil, thyme, paprika, coriander, and Tabasco.  Lower the heat to medium and cook 5 minutes, stirring constantly.

Add the plum tomatoes and puree and cook 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the stock and bring to a boil.  Add the rice and okra, lower the heat, cover, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Louisiana Cajuns differ on the proper consistency of the rice in a jambalaya.  If you prefer your jambalaya to have a drier consistency, uncover the pot for the last 5 minutes.  If you like it with more liquid, add a little more stock at the end.  You can add some grilled shrimp, if you like, or a few shucked oysters about 5 minutes before the stew is ready.

                   Jay's Favorite: Grilled Pesto Pizza

Recipe By     :Jay Bentley
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Pizza


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Pre-made or homemade pizza shell
                        Thinly-sliced fresh ripe tomatoes
                        Pine nuts
                        Red pepper flakes
                        === PESTO SAUCE ===
  6               cups  fresh basil leaves
  2               cups  olive oil
     3/4          cups  pine nuts or walnuts
     3/4          cups  grated Parmesan cheese
  10                    fresh garlic cloves
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Salt -- to taste

For the Pesto Sauce:  Put all the ingredients into a food processor and blend well together. Refrigerate until needed.

When you are ready to have one of the world's greatest pizzas, this is how you build it.  On top of a pre-made (or homemade) pizza shell, place:

     1st - A generous layer of Pesto Sauce 
     2nd - Thinly sliced fresh ripe tomatoes 
     3rd - A handful of pine nuts 
     4th - 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Cook it on a hot grill.  Bake the pizza lid-down, away from the flames for about 15 minutes.  If you have a warming rack, that is the best place to do it.  The pizza is ready when the pine nuts have browned and the oil in the pesto is slightly sizzling.

Don't put too much topping on the shell -- the idea is to create a balance between the crisp shell and the fragrant toppings.  The flavors and textures should work in harmony.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Here is an absolutely fabulous pizza, and you can do it on the grill!  The sauce is a classic pesto, which, of course, makes everything taste good.  To be honest, if you feel entirely too lazy to do your own pizza shells you can go with a ready-made brand found in most grocery stores.  Make a lot of pesto sauce.  You can use it many different ways and it freezes well.

                   Mahi-Mahi With Fresh Ginger And Lime

Recipe By     :George Hirsch
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     mahi-mahi fillets - (8 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  Mahi-Mahi Marinade -- (see below)
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  finely chopped scallions
  1         tablespoon  cracked black peppercorns
                        === MAHI-MAHI MARINADE ===
                        Juice and zest of 3 limes
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  Tabasco

Mahi-Mahi Marinade:  Combine all ingredients and mix well.  Marinate the fillets in the marinade for 30 minutes.

Preheat the grill to a high heat.

Place the fillets on the hot grill and sear 2 minutes.

Remove the fillets and place in an oiled skillet or grill pan.  Pour the remaining marinade and wine over the fish, dot with butter, and scatter the scallions and peppercorns on top.

Put the skillet back on the grill for 4 to 5 minutes or until the fish turns white, indicating it's cooked.  Remove the fillets to a serving dish, reduce the sauce to a glaze, and pour it over the fish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Mahi-mahi, or dolphinfish, is not a marine mammal and should not be confused with the dolphin.  Its weight averages 6 to 14 pounds and its flesh is lean with a sweet taste and a firm texture, making it ideal for smoking and grilling.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  jumbo shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1              large  garlic clove
  1         tablespoon  coarse salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  2         tablespoon  olive oil
  2           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  6                     lemons -- for garnish
                        === CAJUN SPRINKLE ===
  4        tablespoons  paprika
  2        tablespoons  granulated garlic
  1         tablespoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1         tablespoon  thyme
  1           teaspoon  oregano
  2         tablespoon  sea salt
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Mince garlic with salt, mix it with cayenne and paprika, then make into a paste with olive oil and lemon juice.

In a bowl, toss the shrimp in the spice mixture and marinate for at least one hour and up to three before using.

Preheat the grill to very high heat and place the shrimp individually or on skewers over the hot fire.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side or until the shrimp have lost their translucency. Remember -- do not overcook, as they will become tough.

For the Cajun Sprinkle:  Mix and set aside.  Just before the shrimp is finished cooking, sprinkle a light dusting of this spice blend over the shrimp.  Don't use too much or it will overwhelm the flavor of the shrimp.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This is a great recipe for doing shrimp on your backyard gas grill.  It's also a great way to do lobster tails!

Categories    : Grilling                        Salads/Dressings
                Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  honey
  1                cup  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  powdered ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper
     1/2    tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2    tablespoon  granulated garlic
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1                cup  rice vinegar
  1                cup  Canola oil
     1/4           cup  sesame oil
     1/2           cup  sesame seeds

In a food processor or blender, mix everything except the oil together, then drizzle in the oil and refrigerate.  If the dressing is too thick, you can thin it with water.

This recipe yields ?? cups.

Comments:  This dressing has a tangy, sweet and sour flavor that is great on all kinds of salads from straight greens, to entrÈe salads containing grilled beef, salmon and chicken.  We also recommend using it as a marinade, or even as a sauce for cold Asian noodles.

While the beans are cooking, sautÈ the onions until transparent, cook the diced ham until crisp, and then mix everything together in a large ovenproof pot.

Bake in the oven at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours until the top has browned and formed a crust.

Cook them on the grill for several hours along with the meat, stirring occasionally so that they absorb some of the smoke flavor from the cooking.  If they get too dry, add some water.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This is a typical BBQ bean recipe, which can be started in the oven and finished on the grill.  It is particularly good with ribs or beef brisket and other smoked meats.

                Pork Chops With Honey, Chipotles And Limes

Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     pork chops
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  granulated garlic
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
                        === CHIPOTLE SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  water
  4        tablespoons  mustard
  1         tablespoon  minced Chipotles
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1         tablespoon  granulated garlic
  1           teaspoon  allspice
     1/2           cup  cilantro chopped
                        Salt -- to taste

Combine all marinade ingredients.  Marinate the chops in a Ziplock bag for several hours before cooking.

To cook, place the chops over medium heat for around 10 minutes per side or until a meat thermometer reads 150 degrees.

For the Chipotle Sauce:  Place everything in a saucepan and cook over low heat for 15 minutes.  Stir and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Pork goes with just about anything, so here is a little Southwestern twist for something different for that summer afternoon BBQ.  Chipotles are jalapeÒo peppers that have been smoked. They are available in cans in most large grocery stores or you can smoke them yourself on your backyard grill.

                 Portobello Mushrooms With Belgian Endive

Recipe By     :George Hirsch
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling
                Mushrooms

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Portobello mushrooms
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2                     lemons -- sliced thin
  4              heads  Belgian endive
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cut the stems from the mushrooms.  Wipe the caps with a dampened paper towel.  (Or rinse them quickly under water and pat dry if they're very dirty.)

Brush both sides of the mushrooms with some of the olive oil.  Place the mushrooms on the grill, gill-sides up, and cook at a medium-high heat for 4 to 5 minutes.

Turn the mushrooms over, placing them on the cooler edges of the grill, and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, or until tender.  At the same time, grill the lemon slices.

Separate the leaves of the endive and arrange them on four serving dishes.  Place a mushroom, gill-side down, in the center of each dish, and top with grilled lemon slices.  Drizzle with the remaining olive oil and sprinkle with pepper.

This recipe yields 4 appetizer servings.

Comments:  Portobello mushrooms are the largest of all the cultivated mushrooms, with caps often reaching 6 to 7 inches across.  They're so meaty, eating one is almost like cutting into a piece of steak.  Other bitter greens, such as escarole or chicory, can be used instead of endive.

This recipe yields 5 to 6 servings.

                  Rice Pilaf - {Standard French Recipe}

Recipe By     :Jay Bentley
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  long-grain white rice
  1                     onion finely diced
  4               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or water with 4 tbspns chicken base or
                        bouillon cubes)
     1/2           cup  butter or olive oil
  2        tablespoons  thyme
  1                     bay leaf

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place the stock in a saucepot and bring to a boil.  In a braising pan or casserole, heat the oil and sautÈ the onions and rice for several minutes until the rice turns opaque.

Add the boiling stock, cover and braise in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes.  When the rice is finished, toss with a fork to separate, and serve.

Pilaf can be held in a hot water bath for a long time.  It can also be re-heated in a microwave.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Make rice pilaf the way Julia Child does it, in an oven.  Oven pilaf is generally foolproof and very easy.  This method gives you a great deal of flexibility when it comes to recipe specific flavoring.  An example of this would be to add some oregano, rosemary and garlic to enhance a Greek recipe or chili powder and garlic for the southwestern recipe.  Try some of your own ideas and see what happens.

                   Roast Loin Of Pork On The Rotisserie

Recipe By     :George Hirsch
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     boneless pork loin - (3 to 4 lbs)
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  dried rosemary -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  dried parsley
                        === PORK BASTE ===
     1/4           cup  margarine - (1/2 stick) -- melted
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
                        Zest of 1 lemon
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  Tabasco
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Pork Baste:  Combine all ingredients.  Mix well.

Tie the pork loin at 1-inch intervals with butcher's twine or have the butcher do it.  Rub the pork on all sides with the garlic, rosemary, and parsley.

Thread the meat onto the rotisserie rod, set it in place, and put a drip pan beneath the meat.  Cook for approximately 40 minutes per pound.

After the first hour, brush the pork every 10 to 15 minutes with the Pork Baste.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  The rotisserie is one of our favorite ways to cook.  It's reduces the overall fat content of meats and gives everything a succulent flavor that is truly mouth-watering.  Loin of pork is an excellent meat for the rotisserie.  Grilling the roast indirectly means that there is less chance of a flare-up charring the meat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  eggplants - (to 3)
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                can  chickpeas - (16 oz) -- drained
                        Puree from 2 heads Caramelized Garlic -- (see recipe)
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh cilantro
  1           teaspoon  Oriental sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  Tabasco
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  8                     scallions - (to 10) -- grilled, chopped

Brush the eggplants with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and place on grill.  When the eggplants are slightly charred, 12 to 15 minutes, remove and split them open.  Scrape out the pulp, discarding the seeds and skin.

Puree the chickpeas in a blender or food processor.  Place in a medium bowl with the eggplant pulp, remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, cilantro, sesame oil, cumin, and Tabasco and mix well.

Stir in the sour cream and drizzle with remaining olive oil.  Sprinkle on the grilled scallions.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Both chickpeas and eggplant are Middle Eastern favorites, especially for dips.  This one combines both and can be served on toasted pita bread triangles.

  1              pound  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1                cup  shredded mozzarella
  12            cloves  Caramelized Garlic -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese

                        Skewered Lamb Greek Style

Recipe By     :Jay Bentley
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  boneless lamb -- cut 1 1/2" cubes
                        Rice Pilaf -- (see recipe)
                        Assorted vegetables -- see * Note
                        === MARINADE ===
     3/4           cup  olive oil
  4        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  whole oregano
                        = (or 3 tbspns chopped fresh oregano)
  1         tablespoon  granulated garlic -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt

* Note:  While there are no rules as to what vegetables to use, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, peppers and various other fresh vegetables add color and texture.

Marinate the lamb for about an hour while the coals are getting ready or while you are preheating your gas grill or broiler.

When the fire is ready, thread the meat and vegetables (if you are using them) on skewers and cook for about 10 to 12 minutes, turning once.

Serve with Rice Pilaf.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Cubed lamb cooked over an open fire, on skewers, has been a universal favorite throughout the world for centuries.  This dish should be done over hot coals, or on a very hot gas grill as close to the flame as you can get it.

              Smoked Pork Shoulder A.K.A. Carolina Barbecue

Recipe By     :George Hirsch
Serving Size  : 20    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Pork
                Sandwiches                      Smoking


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pork shoulder - (9 to 11 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  sea salt
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  paprika
                        Soft white hamburger rolls
                        Carolina Barbecue Sauce -- (see recipe)

Prepare a smoker.  Season the pork shoulder with sea salt, pepper, and paprika, and smoke for 6 hours at 195 degrees.

After 2 hours, add chunks of soaked hickory wood chips to the smoker.  When the meat is cooked, remove it from the smoker and let it sit for about an hour.

Slice the meat off the bone, then chop it into shreds.  Serve on hamburger buns with Carolina Barbecue Sauce.

This recipe yields about 20 to 25 servings!

Comments:  We have many different types of barbecue in our country.  Shredded pork barbecue takes hours to smoke and is mindless cooking, a good thing to make during the colder weather.  Carolina-style vinegar barbecue sauce is slightly sour compared to the molasses and sugar based red barbecue sauces of the North and Southwest.  It can serve quite a crowd, which makes it an excellent dish to serve for large parties!

Prepare a smoker.  Season the pork shoulder with sea salt, pepper, and paprika, and smoke for 6 hours at 195 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
After 2 hours, add chunks of soaked hickory wood chips to the smoker.  When the meat is cooked, remove it from the smoker and let it sit for about an hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Slice the meat off the bone, then chop it into shreds.  Serve on hamburger buns with Carolina Barbecue Sauce.

<DirT>
This recipe yields about 20 to 25 servings!
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  We have many different types of barbecue in our country.  Shredded pork barbecue takes hours to smoke and is mindless cooking, a good thing to make during the colder weather.  Carolina-style vinegar barbecue sauce is slightly sour compared to the molasses and sugar based red barbecue sauces of the North and Southwest.  It can serve quite a crowd, which makes it an excellent dish to serve for large parties!

                 Split Leg Of Lamb With Pepper And Lemon

Recipe By     :George Hirsch
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     garlic head -- cloves separated,
                        and peeled
                        Juice and zest of 2 lemons
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1                     leg of lamb - (6 to 7 lbs) -- boned , split
                        === LAMB BASTING SAUCE ===
  1                cup  honey
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh mint
  1           teaspoon  sea salt

With a large chef's knife, smash the garlic cloves and combine with the lemon juice, lemon zest and black pepper.  Rub this mixture onto both sides of the lamb and marinate for 24 hours in the refrigerator.

Preheat the grill.  Place the marinated lamb on the grill with a disposable aluminum drip pan beneath the grate to catch the drippings.  Baste the lamb with the basting sauce every 5 to 10 minutes.  Cook approximately 30 minutes for medium-rare, 40 to 45 minutes for well-done.

Cover the lamb and allow to stand 15 to 20 minutes before slicing so that the meat will reabsorb the juices.

Lamb Basting Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix well.

This recipe yields 8 Servings.

Comments:  Many people think of lamb as a springtime meat, but it's abundant all seasons of the year and makes a great choice when inviting a crowd because it very easily feeds a lot of people.  If you like your lamb with a crispy crust, place the meat directly over the fire for the last ten minutes of cooking.

                         Sweet Potato Home-Fries

Recipe By     :George Hirsch
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  sweet potatoes
  2                     onions -- sliced thin
  4        tablespoons  butter -- (1/2 stick)
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Wash the sweet potatoes and wrap them in heavy-duty aluminum foil.  Place them on the grill at a medium-high heat for 30 to 40 minutes, depending on their size, turning them occasionally.

Remove them when they're still a bit firm when pierced with a sharp knife.  Allow them to cool.  Unwrap the potatoes and discard the foil.  Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1/4-inch slices.

Place the sweet potatoes in a large nonstick skillet or a cast-iron skillet and add the onion, butter, nutmeg, salt and pepper.  Place on high heat and cook, stirring frequently, until the potatoes are tender and slightly brown.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  As the natural sugars in sweet potatoes and onions caramelize on the grill, the flavor of each vegetable improves, resulting in a dish that is greater than the sum of its parts.  These home-fries are great as a side dish with steak, or even as an appetizer.

          Texas Brisket With Chef George Hirsch's Seasoning Dust

Recipe By     :George Hirsch
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SEASONING DUST ===
     1/4           cup  sweet paprika
  2        tablespoons  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  dried thyme
  1         tablespoon  dried basil
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  1         tablespoon  dried parsley
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        === BRISKET ===
  1                     fresh beef brisket - (5 lbs or larger)
  2        tablespoons  Tabasco sauce
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
                        === TEXAS BARBECUE SAUCE ===
  1                cup  canned beef bouillon
     1/4           cup  catsup
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
  1                cup  fresh or canned whole plum tomatoes -- chopped
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  diced white onion
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce

Seasoning Dust:  In a medium bowl, combine the paprika, garlic powder, thyme, basil, oregano, parsley, black pepper, cayenne, and nutmeg.

Brisket:  Dry the meat very well and rub it with the Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce.  Cover the meat with 1/4 inch of the seasoning dust on all sides.  Place it in a bowl and loosely cover with foil.  Refrigerate for 3 to 5 days.  (The larger the piece of meat, the longer it will take for the seasonings to penetrate the flesh.)

Place the brisket on the grill at a low temperature for approximately 6 hours, with the fat side on top.  (Or smoke the meat for 8 to 9 hours at 195 degrees.)  Place a pan below the meat filled with water or other liquid to keep it moist and juicy.

When the meat is cooked, take it off the grill and let it rest for 1 hour.  Trim off the fat and slice the meat into thin pieces on an angle against the grain.  Serve with Texas Barbecue Sauce.

Texas Barbecue Sauce:  In a cast-iron sauce pot on your side burner, combine all the ingredients and simmer 4 to 5 minutes.  Serve warm over brisket.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  You can't come home from work and decide to make Texas brisket for dinner.  It's simple to make, but it takes patience and slow cooking at a low temperature.  In a smoker, it will take 8 to 9 hours at 195 degrees, on the grill it requires 5 to 6 hours.  The seasoning dust is rubbed into the meat, this is then aged for 3 to 5 days in the refrigerator.  Don't cut off the excess fat from the brisket because it will help baste the meat while it's cooking.  An hour after the meat has finished cooking, cut off the fat, and the meat will almost fall apart.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  sirloin
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  oil
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  granulated garlic
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried ginger powder
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  basil
  1           teaspoon  dried mint -- if available

Pound the sirloin into an even thickness of about 1/2- to 3/4-inch then cut into 1-inch strips.  Toss into the marinade.  Place in a Ziplock bag for at least 2 hours before cooking.

For the Salad:  Plan on using one handful of greens per person for a first course and two for an entrÈe salad.  You can use mesclun mix, a blend of various young lettuces, arugula, and other greens, available in most markets, which have been washed and are ready to use.  Other items that work well with this mix are fresh bean spouts, shredded carrots, shredded green onions and crushed peanuts.  Be sure to add fresh basil, and even mint, if you can find it.  Create your own favorite mix

Cooking the Beef:  Preheat your grill on its highest setting for 5 minutes.  Cut the marinated beef into 1/4-inch strips, place on the hot grill, and cook over high heat for 3 to 4 minutes, tossing occasionally.  When the meat has reached your desired state of doneness, remove it from the grill.

Taste a piece to see if it is cooked to your liking.  Allow it to cool slightly before using, so it doesn't wilt the greens.  When serving, toss everything together in the dressing.  Put onto plates, garnish with crushed peanuts and finely shredded carrots and serve.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Grill the beef and allowed it to cool slightly before being tossed with the mixed greens.  You can grill the beef well in advance, but plan on using it soon -- refrigeration will dry it out and make it tough.  The meat is best grilled rare, but you can cook it to the exact degree of doneness you prefer.

  1                     ripe pineapple
  1                cup  light corn syrup

Preheat the grill.  In a small cast-iron sauce pan on your side burner combine the syrup, brown sugar, rum and orange juice.  Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer 2 to 3 minutes.  Cool slightly.

                Poultry                         Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  fresh or frozen turkey -- see * Note
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  3                     bay leaves
                        === DRY RUB ===
  5        tablespoons  sea salt
                        = (or kosher salt)
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  thyme
  3        tablespoons  crumbled rosemary leaves
  3        tablespoons  granulated garlic

* Note:  If your turkey is frozen, plan on spending 3 days thawing it in the refrigerator.

Combine dry rub ingredients; mix well.  Rub the fresh or thawed bird inside and out with olive oil and coat with the dry rub mixture.

Place 3 bay leaves in the cavity, and start cooking.  Cooking the bird without stuffing, allows the bird to cook faster and should result in a more juicy and succulent bird.

With a two-burner gas grill:  Use only one side and place the turkey over a drip pan.

If you want to add wood chips, presoak them for at least an hour, and place them in a small metal container (I use an old 6-inch sautÈ pan) over the active burner.

Preheat on high, put the turkey in and check every 10 minutes during the first half hour of cooking to see if the skin is getting burned.  If you see some signs of this, lower the heat level or place some heavy-duty foil under the bird and/or over the area that is affected.  The bird is finished when a meat thermometer inserted in the deepest part of the breast reads 160 degrees.

With a three-burner gas grill:  Follow the same procedure as the two-burner, but place the bird and the drip pan in the middle.

With a charcoal grill:  Ignite 40 or 50 briquettes.  When they begin to show a lot of gray, spread them to each side of the grill and put the turkey and the drip pan in the middle.  (Obviously you won't need wood chips.)  Follow the same procedure as above, and add 5 briquettes to either pile when needed, usually every half hour or so until the bird is finished.

Here are some approximate cooking times by size:

Size with giblets      Grill Temp       Internal Temp       Approx. Cooking Time
 10 to 13 lbs          325 degrees      160 degrees        1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours
 14 to 25 lbs          325 degrees      160 degrees        2 to 3 hours
 26 to 27 lbs          325 degrees      160 degrees        4 to 4 1/2 hours
 Over 28 lbs          325 degrees      160 degrees        4 1/2 hours to ??*

* Always use a meat thermometer to check for doneness.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Turkeys are always on sale during the holidays and it's a good time to buy 5 or 6 to use later.  Doing a turkey on your backyard grill is a whole lot easier than you think and it can produce wonderful results: a juicy, smoky, bird with that open fire flavor.  Here is a foolproof way of doing it.

* Note:  If your turkey is frozen, plan on spending 3 days thawing it in the refrigerator.

Combine dry rub ingredients; mix well.  Rub the fresh or thawed bird inside and out with olive oil and coat with the dry rub mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 3 bay leaves in the cavity, and start cooking.  Cooking the bird without stuffing, allows the bird to cook faster and should result in a more juicy and succulent bird.

With a two-burner gas grill:  Use only one side and place the turkey over a drip pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you want to add wood chips, presoak them for at least an hour, and place them in a small metal container (I use an old 6-inch sautÈ pan) over the active burner.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat on high, put the turkey in and check every 10 minutes during the first half hour of cooking to see if the skin is getting burned.  If you see some signs of this, lower the heat level or place some heavy-duty foil under the bird and/or over the area that is affected.  The bird is finished when a meat thermometer inserted in the deepest part of the breast reads 160 degrees.
