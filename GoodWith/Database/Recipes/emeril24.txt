  8              large  baking potatoes
                        Drizzle of olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cups  thinly-sliced onions
     1/2         pound  andouille sausage -- ground
  8        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  cream fr‚iche - (to 1 1/2 cups)
     1/2         pound  white Cheddar cheese -- grated
     1/4           cup  chopped chives
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Season the potatoes with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Place on a baking sheet and bake until tender, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and cool.

In a sautÈ pan, over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  When the oil is hot, add the onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cook until caramelized, about 8 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.

Meanwhile, in a sautÈ pan, over medium heat, add the 1 tablespoon of oil.  When the oil is hot, brown the sausage, about 6 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the sausage and drain on paper towels.  Set aside.

Using a sharp knife, remove the top 1/4 of each potato.  Using a spoon, remove the flesh from each potato, leaving about 1/4-inch border on each potato.  Set the hollowed potato shells, aside.

In a mixing bowl, combine the potato flesh, butter, and cream fr‚iche.  Season with salt and pepper.  Using a hand masher, mash until smooth.  Add half of the cheese, sausage, chives and parsley.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mix well.

Fill each hollow potato with the potato/sausage mixture.  Top each potato with the remaining cheese.  Place on a baking sheet and bake until the potatoes are warm and the cheese melts.  Remove from the oven and serve.

This recipe yields 8 stuffed potatoes.

  1              pinch  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        === MARINATED BERRIES ===
  2              pints  assorted berries -- rinsed and hulled
                        (such as strawberries, raspberries,
                        blueberries and blackberries)
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  chiffonade of fresh mint

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Using an electric mixer beat the egg whites on medium speed with the cream of tartar and the salt until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes.  Add the sugar and vanilla and beat until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes.  Add the flour and beat for 2 minutes, scrapping down the sides of the bowl as needed.

Pour the batter into an ungreased angel food cake pan.  Bake until golden brown and springy when touched, 30 to 35 minutes.  (The top of the cake may crack a little.)  Remove the pan from the oven and turn it upside down over the neck of a bottle.  Let cool completely.

Remove the cake from the pan and slice horizontally into three layers.  Place the bottom layer on a serving plate.  Spoon half of the curd over the cake.  Lay the middle layer on top of the curd.  Repeat with the remaining curd and top with the last layer of cake.  Set aside.

Ice the entire cake with the Boiled Icing.  At this point you can eat as is, or lightly brown the boiled icing, carefully with a crËme brulee torch.  Slice the cake into individual slices and place on serving plates.  Spoon some of the berries over the cake.

For the Lemon Curd:  Zest all of the lemons and set aside.  Juice the zested lemons and strain the juice, you should get about 3/4 cups of juice.  In a small mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and yolks until smooth.  Stir in the lemon juice.  Pour the mixture into a nonreactive saucepan.  Over medium heat, bring to a simmer.  Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon.  Remove from the heat and pour into a glass bowl.  Stir in the butter, one tablespoon at a time.  Cool to room temperature.  (Yields about 2 1/2 cups)

For the Boiled Icing:  In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the sugar and water.  Bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes.  Bring the sugar to 240 degrees.  If crystals appear on the side of a the pan, take a damp pastry brush and brush the sides down.  Meanwhile, combine the whites, salt and tartar in the bowl of an electric mixer, fitted with wire whip.  Beat on low speed until soft peaks form.  Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until stiff peaks form.  In a steady stream, add the sugar syrup to the whites and continue whipping until the icing is spreadable.  Whip in the vanilla.  (Yields about 2 1/2 cups)

For the Marinated Berries:  Combine the ingredients in a mixing bowl and mix well.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.  Just before serving, stir in the mint.  (Yields about 2 cups)

This recipe yields 1 cake for 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE DOUGH ===
  3               cups  bread flour
  1                     egg
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  cold water
                        Vegetable oil
                        Bread flour
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
     3/4          cups  coarse white bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  melted unsalted butter
  24            ounces  thinly-sliced peeled cored Granny Smith,
                        Pippin or other cooking apples
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
     3/4           cup  dark raisins
     3/4           cup  coarsely-crushed nuts
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  5             ounces  firm unsalted butter

To make the dough:  Place the flour, egg, soft butter and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer.  Mixing with the dough hook on low speed, add enough of the cold water to make a soft dough.  Knead the dough in the electric mixer at medium speed until it is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Form the dough into a ball and coat it with oil.  Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 1 hour.

For the filling:  To make the coarse bread crumbs, toast slices of white bread in the oven until crisp, about 10 minutes.  Break into pieces and place in a food processor.  Pulse the processor until the bread resembles large bread crumbs.

In a sautÈ pan, over medium heat, sautÈ the bread crumbs in 1/4 cup of the melted butter until they are golden brown.  Reserve the sauteed bread crumbs and the remaining melted butter separately.  Combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, raisins, nuts, ground cinnamon and about half of the bread crumbs.  Cut the firm butter into chunks and gently toss together with the apple mixture.

To Assemble:  Cover a work surface approximately 4 feet by 4 feet with a clean piece of cloth.  The cloth is used to facilitate stretching and rolling the dough.  Make sure that the cloth is securely fastened to the table.  Dust the cloth lightly with the flour.  Place the rested dough in the center of the cloth.  Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a large, thin rectangle.  When the dough is as thin as it will go with the rolling pin, it is time to begin stretching and pulling the dough.

To stretch and pull the dough, place your hands under the dough, and, using your thumbs and the back of your hand, gently begin pulling and stretching the dough.  Pull and stretch the dough until it is a rectangle approximately 3 1/2 feet by 2 1/2 feet.  Be very careful when you are pulling and stretching not to tear the dough.  After it is pulled to the proper size, let the dough relax on the table for a few minutes.  There will be a thick edge around the edges, trim this away.  You also want to trim off any parts of the dough that hang over the edges of the table.

Place the apple filling next to the long edge of the dough closest to you.  Form the filling into a thick log.  Brush some of the reserved melted butter generously over the remainder of the dough.  Sprinkle the remaining bread crumbs over the dough.  Using the cloth to help lift the dough, roll the strudel as you would a jelly roll, starting from the filling side.  Place the strudel, seam-side down, in a horseshoe shape on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.  Brush the strudel with the last of the melted butter.  Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for about 35 minutes.  Remove the pan from the oven and cool.  Slice the strudel and serve.

This recipe yields about 16 servings.

     1/2           cup  confectionersí sugar
  2             medium  ripe bananas -- peeled
  10                    flour tortillas (7" dia)
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2 1/2           cups  Caramel Sauce -- warm, (see recipe)
  4             medium  bananas
                        Whipped cream
                        Fresh mint sprigs

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the cheese until smooth.  Add the sugar and bananas, continue to beat until smooth.  Spread 1/4 cup of the filling over half of each tortilla.  Fold the other half over the filling and press slightly.  Place on a large plate and cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate until the filling sets, about 30 minutes.

In a large sautÈ pan, over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter.  Pan-fry the tortillas in batches, 3 at a time, until golden on each side, about 2 minutes per side.  Repeat the above process with the remaining butter and filled tortillas.

To serve, slice each filled tortilla into thirds.  Arrange the slices in the center of each serving plate.  Spoon a 1/4 cup of the warm Caramel Sauce over each plate.  Peel the bananas and slice 1/4-inch thick.  Garnish each plate with the sliced bananas, a dollop of whipped cream and a sprig of fresh mint.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  Almond And Sugar Powder -- (see recipe)
  3              large  egg whites -- at room temperature
     1/8      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1         tablespoon  superfine sugar -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  superfine sugar
  3             ounces  blanched almonds -- finely chopped
                        Confectionersí sugar
  5        tablespoons  strained apricot jam

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Sift the flour and toss it with the Almond And Sugar Powder.  Whip the egg whites in an electric mixer at low speed until they start to froth.  If you are not whipping the whites in a copper bowl, then add the cream of tartar at this point.

Gradually increase the whipping speed to medium-high, and continue whipping until the whites form very stiff peaks and just begin to slip and streak around the side of the bowl.  Add the superfine sugar and continue whipping at high speed for a few seconds longer to incorporate the sugar and tighten the meringue.  Gently fold in the almond and sugar powder and flour.

Scoop the batter into the pastry bag, and pipe the batter in domes 1-inch wide, arranging them on the baking sheets in staggered rows and separating them by about 1-inch.  Unless you have 2 ovens, pipe only 1 sheet of cookies at a time, and keep the remaining batter in the pastry bag until the first sheet is baked.

Dust chopped almonds over the piped batter.  Turn the baking sheet upside down and tap it with a wooden spatula to dislodge the excess almonds, then quickly turn the baking sheet right-side up again.  Dust with confectionersí sugar.  Let rest for about 1 minute to allow some of the confectionersí sugar to dissolve.

Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until the cookies are lightly browned on the bottom and dry and crusty on top, but still soft inside, about 15 to 18 minutes.  Place the baking sheet on a wire rack and let the cookies cool.  While they are still warm and before the batter sets, carefully transfer them to a wire rack with a metal spatula.  Then let them finish cooling on the wire rack.

Press the center of each dome on the flat side with your fingertip to make a slight depression.  Turn half the domes upside down and spoon about 1/2 teaspoon of apricot jam on the center of each.  Then place a second dome right-side up on top of each to make a sandwich.  Lightly dust the balls with confectionersí sugar, then turn them upside down and dust the other side as well.

Storage:  Covered airtight in a tin cookie box or a cookie jar for up to 4 to 6 days.  They look best if they are dusted with confectionersí sugar shortly before serving.

This recipe yields about 30 cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  yeast
  2               cups  warm water
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  molasses
  4 1/2           cups  flour
  1                cup  whole wheat flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  6             ounces  walnuts
  12            ounces  Stilton cheese

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip, combine the yeast, water, 1 tablespoon of the oil and molasses.  Mix on medium speed for 2 minutes.  Combine the flours and salt together.  Change the mixer attachment to a dough hook.  Add the flours and mix on low speed until the dough starts to come together.  Increase the speed to medium and beat until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl and climbs up the dough hook.

Grease a larger glass bowl with the remaining teaspoon of oil.  Place the dough in the bowl, turning once.  Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm-draft free area.  Allow the dough to rest until double in size, about 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Place the walnuts on a small baking sheet and place in the oven.  Toast until golden about 6 minutes.  Remove from the pan and cool.

Remove dough and turn on a floured surface.  Divide the dough in half.  Set one half aside.  Roll the dough out into a flat circle.  Sprinkle half of the nuts and 4 ounces of the cheese over the dough.  Fold the sides in towards the center and knead the dough several times.  Repeat with the remaining dough, 3 ounces of walnuts and 4 ounces of the cheese.

Form the dough into a small round.  Grease 2 (9-inch) round pans with the remaining oil.  Place the dough in the prepared pans, press the dough to form the pan.  Sprinkle the top with the remaining blue cheese.  Cover lightly with plastic wrap.  Let the dough rise again until double in size, about 1 hour.

Place the pans in the oven and bake for 15 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and continue to bake for 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool on a wire rack.  Sprinkle the tops of each loaf with 2 ounces of the remaining cheese.  Allow the bread to cool before slicing.

This recipe yields 2 loaves of bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  bacon -- chopped
  4                     eight-ounce filet mignons
  1                cup  crumbled Stilton cheese or
                        any type of blue-veined cheese
                        Creole seasoning -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              small  onion -- cut 1/8" thick rings
     1/2           cup  Crystal Hot Sauce
     1/2           cup  flour
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  1                cup  demi-glace
     1/2           cup  port wine
  1             recipe  Creamed Potatoes -- (see reicpe)
     1/2           cup  port wine
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley leaves

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  In a hot sautÈ pan, render the bacon until crispy, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.

On the side of each filet make a 2-inch slit forming a pocket.  Stuff each pocket with 2 tablespoons of the cheese.  Season the filets with Creole seasoning.

In oven-proof sautÈ pan, add the olive oil.  When the oil is hot, sear the filets for 2 minutes on each side.  Place the pan in the oven and roast the filets for 6 to 7 minutes for medium-rare.

Toss the onions with the hot sauce.  Season with salt.  Dredge the onions in the flour, tapping off any excess.  Heat the vegetable oil.  Fry the onions until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with Creole seasoning.

Remove the filets from the pan and set aside.  Place the sautÈ pan on the stove.  Over medium-high heat, deglaze the pan with the demi-glace and port wine.  Remove from the heat and keep warm.  Fold the bacon and bacon fat into the Creamed Potatoes.

To assemble, divide the potatoes by 4 and mound the potatoes in the center of each plate.  Lay each filet on top of the potatoes.  Spoon the pan sauce over each filet.  Garnish each plate with the remaining cheese, fried onions and parsley.

This recipe yields 4 main-course servings.

                        === EMPANADA DOUGH ===
  1                cup  masa harina
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  lard
  1                cup  warm water

For the Empanada dough:  In a mixing bowl combine the masa harina, flour, cornmeal and baking powder.  Season with the salt and pepper and mix thoroughly.  Cream in the lard and add the water a little at a time, working the mixture until all is completely incorporated.  Using your hands, form the dough into a log about 12 inches long by 3 inches across and refrigerate for about 20 minutes.

In a large sautÈ pan, over medium heat, add the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the onions.  Season with salt and crushed red pepper.  SautÈ for 2 minutes.  Add the chicken.  SautÈ for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and turn into a mixing bowl.  Add the garlic, green onions, olives, raisins and eggs.  Season with salt.  Mix well.

On a floured surface, roll the dough out to a circle, 1/8-inch thick.  Using a 4-inch round cutter, cut the dough into individual circles.  Press the remaining dough together and repeat the above process.

Preheat the fryer.  Place about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of each circle.  Lightly wet the edges of the dough with water.  Fold the dough over, forming a half-moon, using your fingers, seal the edges completely and crimp the sides of the dough.  Place the finished empanadas on a parchment-lined baking sheet.

Fry in batches until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt.  Serve warm on a large platter.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 dozen empanadas.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick) -- plus
  2          teaspoons  butter -- at room temperature
  1 3/4         pounds  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
  10             large  eggs -- separated
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  toasted pecan pieces
  2 1/2           cups  White Chocolate Mocha Sauce -- (see below)
  1                cup  heavy cream -- sweetened and whippe
     1/4           cup  chocolate-covered coffee beans
                        Shaker of confectionersí sugar
                        Fresh mint sprigs
                        === WHITE CHOCOLATE MOCHA SAUCE ===
  1                cup  strong brewed coffee
  2               cups  heavy cream
  8             ounces  white chocolate pieces

Grease a 10-inch cake pan with 2 teaspoons of the butter.  In a metal bowl set over a simmering pot of water, melt the chocolate with the remaining 8 tablespoons butter and stir occasionally until smooth and creamy.  Remove from the heat.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, add the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of the sugar, beat on medium-high speed until pale and thick.  In a large stainless steel bowl, whip the egg whites with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar until stiff peaks form.  Slowly beat the chocolate into the egg yolk mixture (if the mixture "seizes" or curdles, add cold cream and whisk until smooth), then gently fold in the egg whites.

Spread 1 cup of the pecans in the prepared pan and pour the chocolate mixture over them.  Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup pecans over the top and refrigerate overnight.  Remove the pan from the refrigerator and turn onto a serving platter.  Using a warm knife, slice the cake into 12 equal slices.

For the White Chocolate Mocha Sauce:  In a saucepan over high heat, combine the coffee and cream and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium.  Stir in the chocolate, whisking as it melts, and simmer for 20 minutes.  Serve immediately or store, refrigerated, in an airtight container for up to 24 hours.  Reheat in a double boiler.  (Yields about 2 1/2 cups)

To serve, spoon the sauce in the center of each serving plate.  Lay a piece of the cake in the center of sauce.  Garnish with a dollop of whipped cream, several coffee beans, confectionersí sugar and mint.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  butter -- plus
  2          teaspoons  butter
  8                     eggs
  2               cups  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     3/4           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  cocoa powder
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  vanilla

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a small saucepan, heat the milk and 2 tablespoons butter together.  Using an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip, combine the eggs and 2 cups sugar together.  Beat on medium-high speed for about 8 minutes, or until the mixture is pale yellow, thick and has tripled in volume.  With the machine running slowly add the heated milk.

In a mixing bowl sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together.  Fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture and mix thoroughly so that there are no lumps and the mixture is smooth.  Fold in the vanilla.

Grease a 1/2 sheet pan with 2 teaspoons of butter.  Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of sugar.  Pour the cake batter evenly into the pan and bake for about 25 minutes, or until the cake springs back when touched.  Cool for about 2 minutes.  Using a thin knife, loosen the edges of the cake, then flip onto a wire rack and cool completely.

This recipe yields 1/2 sheet cake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  blanched almonds
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  1 1/2           cups  confectionersí sugar
  4              large  egg whites -- at room temperature
     1/8      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1         tablespoon  freeze-dried coffee -- dissolved in
  1           teaspoon  boiling water
  1                cup  Chocolate Ganache -- at room temperature
                        === CHOCOLATE GANACHE ===
  2 1/4         ounces  bittersweet chocolate
  3        tablespoons  heavy cream -- plus
  1           teaspoon  heavy cream

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  In a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, combine the almonds and brown sugar.  Process until completely ground.

Using an electric mixer, fitted with a whip attachment, whip the egg whites and cream of tartar on low speed until frothy.  Add 1 1/2 cups of confectioners' sugar.  Increase the speed to medium-high and continue whipping until very stiff peaks and the whites just begin to slip and streak around the side of the bowl.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and fold in the almond and sugar mixture.  When almost completely incorporated, add the 2 teaspoons of coffee and continue folding until mixed.  The batter must be smooth and shiny, and it should spread easily without being runny.  If it is dull and firm, fold it a little longer to deflate it slightly and get the required consistency.  But do not deflate it too much or the batter will spread too much and the tops of the cookies will crack when baked.

Fill a large pastry bag, fitted with a 3/4-inch plain pastry tube, with the batter.  Line two half-sheet pans with parchment paper.  Pipe the domes in staggering rows 1-inch wide and 1-inch apart.  Unless you have 2 ovens, pipe only 1 sheet of cookies at a time.  Bake for 1 minute.  Place an empty baking sheet underneath the sheet of cookies, and continue baking, using a wooden spatula to hold the oven door ajar, until the tops of the cookies are very lightly browned and dry to the touch white the insides are still soft and the bottoms still pale, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Lift the baking sheet of cookies off the empty baking sheet and take it to the sink.  Pour cold water, about 1/2 cup, between the paper and the baking sheet (tilting the baking sheet so that the water runs over the entire surface and drains thoroughly into the sink) to steam the cookies off the paper.  Then place the baking sheet on a wire rack and cool.  Spread the bottoms of half the cookies with some of the Ganache.  Place the remaining cookies, right-side up, on top of the Ganache, pressing slightly to form a sandwich.  Place the filled macaroons on a serving plate.

For the Chocolate Ganache:  Chop the chocolate and put it in a small stainless steel bowl.  Bring the cream just to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring constantly with a wire whisk.  Gradually stir the cream into the chocolate with the whisk and continue stirring until the chocolate is completely melted.  Then, allow it to cool, stirring occasionally with a wooden spatula, until it starts to thicken.

This recipe yields about 3 1/2 dozen filled macaroons.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  vegetable shortening
  1 1/4           cups  warm milk -- (110 degrees)
  1                     egg -- beaten
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  chestnut flour
  1              pinch  salt
                        Oil -- for frying
  1                cup  honey

Preheat the fryer to 360 degrees.  In the bowl of an electric mixer, fitted with a dough hook, add the yeast, sugar, shortening, and milk, mix for 2 minutes.  Add the egg.  Mix well.  Add 2 cups of the flour, the chestnut flour and salt.  Beat at low speed until all of the flour is incorporated, about 1 minute.  Then beat at medium speed until the mixture forms a ball, leaves the sides of the bowl, and climbs up the dough hook. 

Remove the dough from the bowl.  Using your hands, form the dough into a smooth ball.  Lightly oil a bowl.  Place the dough in the bowl and turn it to oil all sides.  Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm, draft-free place until it doubles in size, about 2 hours. 

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and pat the dough into a rectangle about 1-inch thick.  Lightly dust the surface of the dough.  Roll out the rectangle to 12 1/2 inches long by 10 inches wide and about 1/4-inch thick.  With a sharp knife, cut the dough into 20 (2 1/2-inch) square beignets. 

Fry the beignets, a couple at a time until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove and drain on a paper towels.  Drizzle with the honey and serve. 

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  4             pieces  round steak - (4 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg -- beaten
  3               cups  milk -- plus
  3        tablespoons  milk
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

Heat the oil in a heavy 9-inch cast-iron skillet, to 360 degrees.  Using a meat mallet, pound out the meat.  Season the steak with salt and pepper.

Combine the egg with 3 tablespoons of the milk.  Put 1 1/2 cups of the flour in a shallow pan and season with salt and pepper.  Dredge the steaks in the flour, coating each piece evenly and tapping off any excess.  Dip the steak in the egg wash, coating it completely and letting the excess drip off.  Dredge again in the flour, shaking off any excess.

Fry the steaks in the hot oil, until golden brown on each side, about 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt and pepper.

Carefully pour off the oil, leaving behind about 1/4 cup of the oil along with the brown bits.  Over medium heat, add the remaining 3 tablespoons flour and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, whisking constantly.

Add the remaining 3 cups milk, 1/2 cup at a time, whisking constantly.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low.  Season with salt and plenty of pepper.  Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, whisking constantly.  The gravy should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  If it is too thick, add a little water to thin it.

Serve the fried steak and gravy with mashed potatoes and green beans.

Heat the oil in a heavy 9-inch cast-iron skillet, to 360 degrees.  Using a meat mallet, pound out the meat.  Season the steak with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the egg with 3 tablespoons of the milk.  Put 1 1/2 cups of the flour in a shallow pan and season with salt and pepper.  Dredge the steaks in the flour, coating each piece evenly and tapping off any excess.  Dip the steak in the egg wash, coating it completely and letting the excess drip off.  Dredge again in the flour, shaking off any excess.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fry the steaks in the hot oil, until golden brown on each side, about 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Carefully pour off the oil, leaving behind about 1/4 cup of the oil along with the brown bits.  Over medium heat, add the remaining 3 tablespoons flour and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, whisking constantly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the remaining 3 cups milk, 1/2 cup at a time, whisking constantly.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low.  Season with salt and plenty of pepper.  Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, whisking constantly.  The gravy should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  If it is too thick, add a little water to thin it.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve the fried steak and gravy with mashed potatoes and green beans.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     vanilla bean
  4               cups  half-and-half
  1                cup  sugar
  1              pinch  salt

        Creole Mustard, Rosemary And Garlic Crusted Veal Rib Roast

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  salt
     1/2           cup  cracked black pepper
  1                     bone-in veal rib roast - (abt 20 lbs) -- trimmed
  1                cup  chopped onions
  10                    garlic cloves -- peeled
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary - (to 3) -- leaves removed,
                        and stems discarded
  1                cup  Creole or other whole-grain mustard
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heavily season the entire roast with kosher salt and pepper.  Wrap the roast tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Remove the roast from the refrigerator, rinse off the salt and pat dry.  Set aside.

In a blender, combine the onions, garlic, rosemary, mustard and oil.  Blend until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  Using a pairing knife, make several slits in the veal roast.  Stuff the slits and rub the entire veal roast with the mustard mixture.  Place on a rack in a roasting pan and cover tightly with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for 24 hours.

Remove the roast from the refrigerator and discard the plastic wrap.  Bring the roast to room temperature.  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place in the oven and roast for 30 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and continue cooking for about 3 hours for medium-rare.

During the last half-hour of cooking, check the roast occasionally with a meat thermometer, when the temperature reaches 135 degrees, remove from the oven.  Allow the roast to rest for about 20 to 25 minutes for the perfect medium-rare.  The cooking times may vary because one oven may cook differently then the other.  Also if using a convection oven, the cooking time will be less.  So that is why it is important to invest in a good meat thermometer instead of relying on cooking times.

Carve the roast into individual servings and serve with the potatoes.

This recipe yields about 10 to 12 servings.

Recipe By     :Daniel Boulud
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh sardine fillets
                        (you can also use salmon fillets)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  8                     sage leaves
  6                     thyme sprigs
  4                     rosemary sprigs
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled, crushed
  3             pounds  eggplant -- trimmed, peeled,
                        and cut 1/2" thick slices on the bias
  40            pieces  Tomato Confit -- (see recipe)
  12            ounces  piquillo or roasted red bell peppers

Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the sardines or salmon in a single layer on the pan.  Season the fillets on both sides with salt and pepper and one quarter of the olive oil.  Scatter half the sage, thyme, rosemary, and garlic over the fillets and slide the pan into the oven.  Roast the sardines for 7 minutes, or until theyíre just cooked through.  Remove the sardines from the baking pan, cool, and then chill in the refrigerator.

Re-line the baking sheet with clean parchment paper and arrange the eggplant on the sheet.  Season the eggplant slices with salt and pepper as well as the remaining oil and herbs.  Bake the eggplant for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender.  Cool and then transfer to the refrigerator to chill.

Line an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2- by 2 1/2-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, allowing it to extend over the sides.  The terrine will be built with the eggplant, peppers, sardines, and tomatoes in layers, starting with the eggplant.

To begin, cut the eggplant slices to fit the terrine and lay a layer of eggplant over the bottom and up the sides of the terrine, allow the slices to overlap a little and overhang the edges.  Top with peppers, then sardines, then tomatoes.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients, finishing by folding the overhanging eggplant over the top of the terrine and leveling the top with an additional layer of eggplant slices.  Cover the top with the plastic wrap thatís hanging over the sides and press another piece of plastic wrap against the top for good measure.

Cut a piece of corrugated cardboard to fit inside the top of the terrine and press it down firmly against the plastic wrap.  Place a weight, such as a 1-pound can, on top of the cardboard, put the terrine on a parchment-lined tray (to catch any drips that result from the weighting), and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, or overnight.

To serve:  If you have an electric knife, nowís the time to use it, if not, choose a long thin serrated knife and work with a sawing motion.  Remove the weight, the cardboard, and the sheet of plastic wrap.  Carefully cut the loaf into slices, each no less than 1-inch thick (thinner slices will fall apart.)  If youíd like, serve the terrine with a small green salad dressed with lemon juice and olive oil.

To drink:  A Spanish white Ruede, rich, oaky and, even though itís white berryish.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  2               cups  corn flour
  1           teaspoon  salt

Using your hands, flatten the dough and form into a flat circle.  Place a piece of plastic wrap over the circle.  Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a 6 1/2- to 7-inch circle and 1/8-inch thick.

In a medium non-stick skillet, over medium heat, brown the tortillas for 1 to 2 minutes on each side.  Remove and place between 2 sheets of parchment paper.  Repeat the above process with the remaining dough.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 12 tortillas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter -- at room temperature
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted, and
                        slightly cooled
  2          teaspoons  all-purpose flour -- plus
  1                cup  bleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced orange zest
     1/4         pound  semi-sweet chocolate -- melted

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour 24 madeline molds using the teaspoon of the butter and the 2 teaspoons of the flour.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, sugar and vanilla.  With an electric mixer set on high speed, cream the mixture until pale and fluffy, about 10 minutes.

In a small mixing bowl, combine the flour and baking powder.  Add the zest and half of the flour mixture and beat on medium speed until incorporated.  Add the remaining flour mixture and beat again until incorporated.  Add the butter in a steady stream and continue beating until well blended.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

Spoon the batter into the molds so that they are two thirds full.  Bake until lightly golden, 18 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and using a thin knife, pop them out of the pans onto a wire rack.  The cookies can be served either warm or cooled and dipped in the chocolate.

To dip in the chocolate, dip half of each cookie in the chocolate, letting the excess drip and place on parchment-lined baking sheet.  Allow the cookies sit until the chocolate sets.  Serve on a serving platter.

This recipe yields 24 cookies.

  3                     eggs -- beaten
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  2          teaspoons  baking powder

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  3        tablespoons  water
  1              ounce  light corn syrup
  3             ounces  blanched almonds
  1 3/4         ounces  confectionersí sugar
                        Kirsch, dark Jamaican rum or curacao
                        Green food coloring

Combine the sugar, 3 tablespoons of water and corn syrup in a small saucepan or caramel pot and stir to thoroughly moisten the sugar.  Bring to a boil over medium heat.  Wash down the walls of the pot with a moistened pastry brush to dissolve any sugar crystals that form there.  Then continue boiling until the sugar reaches the firm-ball stage, or about 245 degrees.

Meanwhile, combine the almonds and confectionersí sugar in your food processor.  When the syrup is ready, turn on the food processor and pour in the syrup.  Continue process until the almonds paste is completely smooth.  It will be hot.  Transfer the almond paste to a stainless-steel bowl, cover it with a damp kitchen towel to prevent it from drying out, and let rest to room temperature.

Place the almond paste on your countertop and gradually work in the liqueur by kneading it with the heel of your hand.  Add sufficient liqueur to make the almond paste soft enough to pipe from a pastry bag, but not runny.  Tint the almond paste green by kneading in 1 or 2 drops of green food coloring.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  milk
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  4              large  eggs -- separated
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
                        === CARAMEL SAUCE ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
  1                cup  heavy cream

In a large nonreactive saucepan, combine 2 1/2 cups of the milk, 1/2 cup of the sugar, and the vanilla over medium heat and whisk to dissolve the sugar.  Bring to a gentle boil.

In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form.  With a wooden spoon, scoop 2 balls of the meringue into the simmering milk mixture.  Poach the balls for 2 to 3 minutes, rolling them over with the spoon and basting them with the milk.  When all sides are cooked (they are slightly firm to the touch), lift them out with a slotted spoon and set aside on a platter.

Scoop 2 more balls from the remaining meringue and repeat the process.  The meringues can be stored for about 1 hour, loosely covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator until ready to use.

In a small mixing bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 cup milk, the egg yolks, and cornstarch and whisk together.  Slowly whisk 1/2 cup of the warm milk mixture that the meringues were cooked in, into the egg mixture, then pour back into the warm milk mixture in the saucepan.  Whisking constantly, bring the mixture to a gentle boil and cook until it thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, about 2 minutes.

Remove from the heat, pour into a glass bowl, and let cool to room temperature.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap down against the surface of the custard to keep a skin from forming.  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 8 hours.

To serve, gently stir the custard and spoon equal amounts into four dessert bowls.  Set a meringue ball on top of each and drizzle with the Caramel Sauce.

For the Caramel Sauce:  In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil, stirring often.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is a deep caramel color and has the consistency of a thick syrup, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in the cream, return the saucepan to high heat, and boil the sauce until regains the consistency of a thick syrup, about 2 minutes.  Let cool.  The sauce can be refrigerated until ready to use.  Allow it to reach room temperature before using it.  (Yields about 3/4 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
  1                cup  water
  4               cups  fresh blueberries -- stemmed, rinsed
  1         tablespoon  butter
                        === PASTRY ===
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  6        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  1              large  egg
     3/4           cup  milk
                        Shortening -- for frying
                        Creole Cream Cheese And Cherry Ice Cream -- (see recipe)

In a large saucepan, over medium heat, combine the sugar and cornstarch.  Mix until blended.  Stir in the water and bring to a boil.  Cook for 2 minutes or until thick and bubbly.  Remove from the heat and pour over the blueberries.  Add the butter and mix well.  Cool completely.

Sift the flour, 1/4 cup of the sugar, baking powder and salt into a large mixing bowl.  Add the shortening and with your hands or a fork, mix until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  In a small bowl, whisk the egg and milk together.  Gradually add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and mix until a smooth ball forms.  Cover the ball of dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Remove from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature.  Divide the dough into 12 equal portions.  On a lightly floured work surface, roll out each dough piece into a thin round about 5 inches in diameter.  Put about 1/4 cup of the blueberry mixture in the center of each round, fold the dough over, and crimp the edges together with a fork.

Preheat the oil to 360 degrees.  Fry the pies in batches, 2 to 3 at a time, until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar.  Serve each pie on a serving plate with a scoop of ice cream

This recipe yields 12 pies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  solid vegetable shortening
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  6        tablespoons  ice cold water - (to 7 tbspns)
                        === FILLING ===
  3             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
  1              pinch  salt
  3               cups  milk
  3                     eggs -- separated
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  butter

In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt.  Mix well.  Add the shortening and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the water and let sit 1 minute.  Either using a fork or your hands, carefully press the mixture together to form a soft ball.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured surface.  Roll out the dough on the floured surface into a circle about 12 inches in diameter and 1/8 of an inch thick.  Gently fold the circle of dough in half and then in half again so that you can lift it without tearing it, and unfold into a 9-inch by 2-inch deep-dish pie pan.  Crimp the edges and place in the oven.  Bake until golden, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool completely.

In a saucepan, combine the chocolate, 1 cup sugar, cornstarch and salt.  Mix well.  Stir in the milk.  Place the pan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle boil, stirring occasionally.  Cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly.

Beat the egg yolks.  Add 1/2 cup of the hot mixture to the egg yolks and mix well.  Add the mixture back to the saucepan and continue to cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla and butter.  Pour the filling into the prepared pie shell and cool completely.  Cover with plastic and refrigerate until chilled.

Beat the egg whites, on medium speed, until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes.  Add the remaining sugar and continue to beat until stiff peaks form.  Spread the meringue evenly over the pie.  Place in a preheated 350 degree oven, on the top rack and bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Remove and cut into individual servings

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2             pounds  boneless beef shank -- trimmed of fat
  2              pound  boneless lamb shoulder -- trimmed of fat
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             medium  onions -- quartered
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1             medium  fresh hot red pepper -- quartered
                        Water -- to cover
  1              whole  chicken or hen - (3 to 4 lbs) -- cut into 8 pieces
  2               cups  chopped onions
  2               cups  medium-diced carrots
  1                cup  medium-diced green bell peppers
  1              pound  Idaho potatoes -- peeled, medium diced
  2               cups  chopped peeled, seeded tomatoes
     1/2         pound  fresh green beans -- strings removed,
                        and cut into 2" pieces
  2               cups  fresh corn kernels
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
  8                     fresh cornbread muffins -- hot
  8                     fresh biscuits -- hot

In a large, heavy pot, over medium heat, add the oil.  Season the beef and lamb with salt and pepper.  When the oil is hot, sear the meat, in batches, for a couple of minutes on all sides.  Add the quartered onions, garlic cloves, and pepper.  Cover with water (about 3 to 4 quarts).  Bring to boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 3 hours.

Season the chicken with salt and pepper.  During the last 1 1/2 hours of cooking add the chicken.  Remove the meat, chicken and vegetables from the pan, set aside and cool.  Discard the vegetables.

Add the remaining vegetables and brown sugar to the pot of hot liquid.  Continue to cook for 1 hour.  After the meat has cooled, cube the beef and lamb into 1-inch pieces.  Remove the skin and bones from the chicken and discard.  Dice the chicken into 1-inch pieces.  Add the cubed meat and chicken to the vegetables, continue to cook for 30 minutes.  Reseason if necessary.

Ladle the stew into serving bowls.  Serve with hot cornbread or biscuits.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields about 6 to 8 servings.

            Lamb Stuffed Ravioli With A Gorgonzola Cream Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  lamb stew meat
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              quart  duck fat
  3                     garlic cloves
  3             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  1                cup  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1              pound  Basic Pasta -- (see recipe)
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1              pound  Gorgonzola cheese -- crumbled
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Season the meat with salt and pepper.  Place the meat in an oven proof pan and cover with the duck fat.  Add the garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs to the pan and season with salt and pepper.  Cover the pan with aluminum foil and place in the oven.  Slow cook the meat for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until the meat is very tender.

Remove from the oven and strain.  Reserve the lamb fat for future use.  Discard the rosemary.  Place the meat in a mixing bowl, and using 2 forks begin to separate the meat into strands.  This is called pulling the meat.  Stir in 1/4 cup of the reserved lamb fat, shallots, garlic, and parsley.  Season with salt and black pepper.  If the rillette is not moist enough, add another 1/4 cup of the lamb fat.  Cover the rillette and store in the refrigerator.  The rillette will keep for up to 2 weeks.

Using a pasta machine, roll out the pasta to the thinnest setting and then cut the sheets into 3-inch squares.  Place a heaping spoonful of the filling in the center of half of the squares.  Lightly wet the edges of the pasta squares with water.  Place the remaining squares over the filled squares and press the edges together firmly to seal the ravioli completely.  Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the pasta and cook until tender, about 4 to 5 minutes.

For the Sauce:  Place the cream in a saucepan, over medium heat.  Bring to a simmer.  Whisk in the cheese, a little at a time.  Season with salt and pepper.

Remove the pasta and drain.  Toss the pasta with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Arrange the ravioli on serving plates.  Spoon the sauce over the pasta and garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        Creole seasoning -- to taste
  2 1/2         quarts  shrimp stock - (chicken stock
                        or water can be used)
  1              dozen  frozen gumbo crabs -- thawed
  2             pounds  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  2             pounds  Louisiana crawfish tails
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions (green part only)

Serving Size  : 32    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CAKE ===
  1         tablespoon  butter -- plus
  1 1/2         sticks  butter -- at room temperature
  3 1/2           cups  sugar
  2              large  oranges
  3              large  eggs -- at room temperature
  2 3/4           cups  cake flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
                        === TO ASSEMBLE ===
  1                cup  Almond Pastry Cream -- cold, (see recipe)
  4               cups  confectionersí sugar
     1/2           cup  fresh orange juice
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds -- toasted, crushed

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line a half sheet pan with parchment paper.  Butter the entire pan with 1 tablespoon of the butter.

Using an electric mixer, fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the remaining 1 1/2 sticks of butter and 2 1/2 cups sugar together.  Zest the oranges over the bowl and mix thoroughly, reserving the oranges.  Add the eggs 1 at a time, and mix well.  Sift the flour, salt and baking powder.  Add the flour alternately with the milk.  Mix well.  Add the vanilla.

Pour into the prepared pan.  Place in the oven on the middle rack.  Bake until the top is golden and the cake springs back, about 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool for 5 minutes in the pan.  Place a piece of parchment paper over the rack and carefully invert the cake onto a wire rack.  Allow the cake to cool completely.

For the orange syrup:  In a saucepan, combine the juice of the oranges (about 1/2 cup) and the remaining 1 cup of sugar.  Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.  Brush the top of the cake with the orange syrup.  Let the cake sit for 10 minutes.

To assemble, cut the cake in half, crosswise.  Spread the Almond Cream, evenly over one cake.  Place the other cake on top of the pastry cream and slightly press the layers together.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until the filling has set, about 2 hours.

Using a serrated knife, trim off the edges of the cake and cut the cake into an even rectangle.  Cut into individual cakes, 1 1/2 by 2 inches.  Place the individual cakes on a 2 wire racks, over a half sheet pan lined with parchment paper, about 2 inches apart from each other.

In a mixing bowl, combine the powdered sugar, orange juice and some of the milk.  Whisk until smooth.  Pour the frosting over each cake letting the excess drip down the sides of the cake.  Using a knife, spread the frosting evenly over the sides of the cakes.  Sprinkle the top of each cake with the crushed almonds.  Place the cakes back in the refrigerator and allow the frosting to set, about 1 hour.

Serve the petite fours on a serving platter.

This recipe yields about 32 petite fours.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  2 1/2           cups  tepid water -- (80 to 90 degrees)
  2 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 3 1/2 c

For the sponge, in a large bowl, combine the yeast and water, mix well.  Using a wooden spoon, stir in 1 cup of the wheat flour at a time.  Stir until the mixture is smooth and silky.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest for 1 hour.

Sprinkle the sponge with the salt.  Stir in the olive oil.  Stir in 1 cup of the flour at a time and mix until the dough is too stiff to stir with the spoon.  Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until it is smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes.

Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Set the dough in a draft-free area and allow to rise until double in size, about 2 to 3 hours.

Line the bottom rack of the oven with baking stones.  Leaving a 1-inch border free around the tiles so that the heat can circulate properly.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough a couple of times and divide in half.  Cover one half of the dough with plastic wrap while working with the other dough.  Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and roll into 8 balls.

Using a rolling pin, roll each ball of dough into a circle 8 to 9 inches in diameter and less than 1/4-inch thick.  Place each circle of dough next to each other on a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap.  Repeat the above process with the remaining dough.

Bake the circles of dough in batches, about 4 to 6 rounds at a time.  Bake for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the breads look like blown-up balloons.  Remove from the oven and cover with a kitchen towel until the remaining rounds are baked.

To Store:  Pita bread is best is used the day it is made, but it can be wrapped airtight and frozen for 1 month.  Thaw and reheat on a baking sheet in a 350 degrees oven before serving.

This recipe yields 16 pitas.

                        Drizzle of olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
     1/4           cup  pistachios -- toasted

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Season the rabbit with salt and pepper.  Place the rabbit in an oven-proof pan and cover with the duck fat.  Add the garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs to the pan and season with salt and pepper.

Cover the pan with aluminum foil and place in the oven.  Slow cook the rabbit for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until the meat is very tender.  Remove from the oven, cool completely in the fat and strain.  Reserve 1 cup of the confit oil.  Discard the rosemary.

Meanwhile, in a sautÈ pan, over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of the confit oil.  When hot, add the mushrooms.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ until wilted, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Carefully add the Marsala and cook until the liquid has almost evaporated.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.

To make the rillette:  Remove the meat from the rabbit, discarding the bones.  In a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, combine the rabbit, 1/4 cup of the reserved confit oil, shallots, garlic, parsley, and Dijon mustard.  Season with salt and black pepper.  Process for 30 seconds, starting and stopping the machine several times.  Do not puree the mixture.  Taste, and reseason if necessary.  If the rillette is not moist enough, add another 1/4 cup of the confit oil.  Cover the rillette and store in the refrigerator.  The rillette will keep for up to 2 weeks.  (Yields about 3/4 of a pound)

Line a 12 1/2- by 4 1/2- by 3 1/2-inch terrine mold with plastic wrap, allowing the plastic wrap to hang over the sides of the mold.  Dissolve the gelatin in the veal reduction.  Line the terrine mold with a third of the rillette.  Spoon half of the mushrooms over the rillette, pressing down firmly after each layer.  Repeat the layering with the remaining rillette and mushrooms, finishing with the rillette on top.  Slowly pour the gelatin mixture (about 1/2 cup at a time) over the terrine, letting the liquid soak into the terrine.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.

Carefully place the terrine mold in warm water to loosen the mold.  Unwrap the plastic wrap and place on a serving platter.  Slice the terrine into individual servings.

To serve, spoon the Caramelized Onion Sauce in the center of each plate.  Toss the lettuce with the olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper.  Place in the center of sauce.  Lay a piece of the terrine against the lettuce.  Garnish with parsley and toasted pistachios.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

                            Russian Cigarettes

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 50    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  6        tablespoons  superfine sugar
  3 1/2    tablespoons  Almond And Sugar Powder -- (see recipe)
  3              large  egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  1           teaspoon  all-purpose flour
  1             recipe  Filling For Russian Cigarettes -- (see recipe)
  1             recipe  Glaze For Russian Cigarettes -- (see recipe)

Place the butter in a small stainless-steel bowl and beat with a wooden spatula, warming it over low heat as needed to make it smooth, white, and creamy.  Beat in the sugar.  When smooth, beat in the almond and sugar powder.  Beat in 1 egg white with the wooden spatula.  Then beat in the remaining egg whites, 1 at a time, with a wire whisk.  Whisk in the vanilla.  Sift the flour over the batter and mix it in with the wooden spatula.  Cover the batter airtight and refrigerate overnight or for up to 1 week.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Scoop the batter into the pastry bag, and pipe the batter in domes 1-inch wide, arranging them on the baking sheets in staggered rows and separating them by 2 to 3 inches.  (Do not pipe more than 12 or 13 cookies on each baking sheet or you wonít be able to roll them before they cool.)  Or, spoon the batter in 1 teaspoon domes using the ice cream scoop.  Let rest at room temperature for about 5 minutes before baking.  Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until the cookies are golden brown around the edges but still pale in the center, about 4 to 7 minutes.

While the cookies are baking, place a folded kitchen towel (a smooth, untextured towel, no terry cloth) on your countertop.  One at a time, lift each cookie off the baking sheet using a metal spatula and place it upside down on the towel.  Roll it around a wooden dowel or metal rod to form a cigarette.  As you finish rolling the cigarette, press down firmly on the dowel to prevent the cigarette from unrolling, then slide it off the dowel onto a plate.  Work quickly because if the cookies cool they will become brittle.  If they do cool and start to crack as you roll them, return the baking sheet to the oven briefly to reheat them.

Storage:  Covered airtight in a cookie jar or tin cookie bowl for up to 1 week.  Pipe the filling into both ends of the each cigarette to fill the entire length.  Dip 1 end of each cigarette in the chocolate, clean off the excess on the edge of the pot, and place the cigarette on a sheet of waxed paper until the chocolate sets.  Then dip the other end of each cigarette in the chocolate, clean off the excess on the edge of the pot, and return to the sheet of waxed paper until the chocolate on both ends has set.  Serve on a serving platter.

This recipe yields about 50 cookies.

Place the butter in a small stainless-steel bowl and beat with a wooden spatula, warming it over low heat as needed to make it smooth, white, and creamy.  Beat in the sugar.  When smooth, beat in the almond and sugar powder.  Beat in 1 egg white with the wooden spatula.  Then beat in the remaining egg whites, 1 at a time, with a wire whisk.  Whisk in the vanilla.  Sift the flour over the batter and mix it in with the wooden spatula.  Cover the batter airtight and refrigerate overnight or for up to 1 week.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Scoop the batter into the pastry bag, and pipe the batter in domes 1-inch wide, arranging them on the baking sheets in staggered rows and separating them by 2 to 3 inches.  (Do not pipe more than 12 or 13 cookies on each baking sheet or you wonít be able to roll them before they cool.)  Or, spoon the batter in 1 teaspoon domes using the ice cream scoop.  Let rest at room temperature for about 5 minutes before baking.  Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until the cookies are golden brown around the edges but still pale in the center, about 4 to 7 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the cookies are baking, place a folded kitchen towel (a smooth, untextured towel, no terry cloth) on your countertop.  One at a time, lift each cookie off the baking sheet using a metal spatula and place it upside down on the towel.  Roll it around a wooden dowel or metal rod to form a cigarette.  As you finish rolling the cigarette, press down firmly on the dowel to prevent the cigarette from unrolling, then slide it off the dowel onto a plate.  Work quickly because if the cookies cool they will become brittle.  If they do cool and start to crack as you roll them, return the baking sheet to the oven briefly to reheat them.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Storage:  Covered airtight in a cookie jar or tin cookie bowl for up to 1 week.  Pipe the filling into both ends of the each cigarette to fill the entire length.  Dip 1 end of each cigarette in the chocolate, clean off the excess on the edge of the pot, and place the cigarette on a sheet of waxed paper until the chocolate sets.  Then dip the other end of each cigarette in the chocolate, clean off the excess on the edge of the pot, and return to the sheet of waxed paper until the chocolate on both ends has set.  Serve on a serving platter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 50 cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  shrimp
  1         tablespoon  Creole seasoning -- plus
  1           teaspoon  Creole seasoning
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
     1/3           cup  flour
  1                cup  chopped celery
  1                cup  chopped onions
     1/2           cup  chopped bell peppers
  2                     mild green chiles or banana peppers -- halved lengthwise,
                        and seeded
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2               cups  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
                        (or 2 cups chopped canned tomatoes)
  1                cup  water
  1 3/4           cups  chicken broth
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
                        Cooked rice

Season the shrimp with Creole seasoning.  Set aside in the refrigerator.  Make a roux by combining the oil and flour in a large cast-iron or enameled cast-iron Dutch oven over medium heat.  Stir slowly with a wire whisk or wooden spoon for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the roux becomes dark brown, the color of chocolate.

Add the celery, onions, bell peppers, and chiles.  Cook, stirring often, for 6 to 7 minutes.  Add the bay leaves and garlic and cook for about 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and water.  Season with Creole seasoning.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, for about 1 hour, or until a thin oil film appears on the surface.  Stir occasionally to prevent the mixture from sticking.

Increase the heat to medium, add the broth, salt, and cayenne and cook for about 15 minutes.  Add the shrimp and cook for about 10 minutes, or until the shrimp turn bright pink and the tails curl in.  During the last 5 minutes of cooking time, add the green onions and parsley.  Remove the bay leaves.  Spoon the rice in the center and ladle the Courtbouillon over the rice.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 main-course servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1              large  egg white
  2        tablespoons  chopped yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  24                    wonton wrappers
                        Oil -- for frying

Put the shrimp, egg white, onions, cilantro, salt, cayenne, and sesame oil in a food processor and pulse 2 or 3 times to finely chop.  Do not puree.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.  Can be made 1 day ahead and will keep for 2 days.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

For the dumplings:  Place a spoonful of the shrimp filling in the center of each wonton wrapper.  Lightly wet the edges of the wrappers with water.  Fold the wrapper over the filling, forming a triangle and seal completely.

Preheat the fryer.  Fry the wontons in batches until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt.

This recipe yields 24 dumplings.

Arrange the bread slices on the baking sheet and brush them with half of the olive oil, then sprinkle them with the salt and pepper.  Turn the slices over, brush with the remaining oil, and sprinkle with the remaining salt and pepper.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, split,
                        germ removed, and finely sliced
  10                    basil leaves -- torn
  4             sprigs  thyme -- leaves only
  2                     bay leaves -- broken
  20                    ripe plum tomatoes -- peeled
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar - (to 1/2 tspn)

Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 200 degrees.

Line a baking sheet with foil and pour about 2 tablespoons olive oil evenly over the pan.  Sprinkle the oil with salt and pepper.  Strew a little of the garlic, basil, thyme, and bay leaves over the oil.

Cut each tomato lengthwise in half and carefully, with your fingers or a tiny spoon, remove the seeds.  Lay the tomato halves cut-side down in the pan, wiggling the tomatoes around if necessary so that each tomato has a floss of oil on its cut side.  Using a pastry brush, give the tops of the tomatoes a light coat of olive oil.  Season the tops of the tomatoes with salt and pepper and a little sugar, and scatter over the rest of the garlic, basil, thyme, and bay leaves.

Slide the pan into the oven and bake the tomatoes for 2 1/2 hours, or until they are very tender but still able to hold their shape; turn the tomatoes over at half-time and open the oven for just a second every 30 minutes or so to get rid of the moisture that will build up in the oven.  Cool the tomatoes to room temperature on their pan.

When the tomatoes are cool, transfer them to a jar, stacking them neatly.  Pour whatever oil remains in the pan over the tomatoes and then, if you plan to keep the tomatoes longer than 1 or 2 days, pour in enough olive oil to cover and refrigerate.

This recipe yields 40 tomato halves.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cold
     1/2           cup  solid vegetable shortening -- cold
  1                cup  milk

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt.  Mix well.  Add 1 tablespoon of the cold butter and the cold shortening and work it into the dry ingredients, using your hands, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Stir in the milk.  The dough will be sticky.

Dust your work surface with some flour.  Turn the dough onto the floured surface.  Gently fold each side toward the center.  Pick up the dough and dust the work surface with additional flour.  Return the dough to the floured surface and fold each side towards the center again.

Turn the dough over and press it out to 1-inch thickness.  Cut the biscuits, straight down, do not twist the cutter, with a 2 1/4-inch round cookie cutter.

Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter and add to a 10-inch round cake pan.  Place the biscuits in the pan, turning once (to coat both sides with butter), about 1/4-inch apart.  Let the biscuits rest for 15 minutes before baking.  Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4           cups  milk
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  3                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  cornstarch -- dissolved in
     1/4           cup  water
  4             ounces  white chocolate -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2          teaspoons  gelatin
  2          teaspoons  water
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
  3               cups  sweetened whipped cream
  1                cup  simple syrup - (equal amounts water and
                        sugar, simmered until sugar dissolves)
     1/2           cup  Chambord
     1/2        recipe  Chocolate Sponge Cake -- cut into 3 nine-inch
                        by 5-inch slices, (see recipe)
  2              pints  fresh raspberries
  3             ounces  white chocolate piece -- shaved into curls
  2               cups  Raspberry Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Fresh mint sprigs

In a nonstick saucepan, over medium heat, combine 2 cups of the milk, sugar, and vanilla.  Whisk to dissolve the sugar.  When the mixture comes to a gentle boil, take 1 cup of the milk-sugar mixture and add it to the yolks.  Whisk to blend well.  Temper the egg mixture to the milk mixture.  Cook over medium heat until it thickens slightly, 4 to 5 minutes, whisking occasionally.

Over medium heat, slowly add the cornstarch mixture to the saucepan, whisking constantly for 1 minute.  Using a wooden spoon, continue stirring for about 2 minutes.  Add the chopped white chocolate and continue stirring for 2 more minutes.  Add the butter and stir until it is completely melted and mixture has thickened to a custard, about 2 minutes.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap down to the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming.  Cool completely, stirring occasionally.

Soften the gelatin in the water.  In a small saucepan, combine the gelatin and cream.  Place over medium heat and cook until the gelatin dissolves, about 1 minute.  Remove from the heat.  In a large bowl, combine the pastry cream and gelatin.  Mix well.  Fold 1 1/2 cups of the sweetened cream into the mixture.

Combine the sugar syrup and liqueur together.  Brush the tops of the sliced cake with the syrup.  Let the syrup soak into the cake for 10 minutes.  Line a 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, allow the wrap to overhang the pan.

Place a piece of cake on the bottom of the pan.  Place 1 pint of the raspberries over the cake.  Spoon half of the cream mixture over the berries.  Place the second piece of cake on the cream mixture.  Repeat with the remaining berries, chocolate mixture and cake.  Cover the top with the overhanging plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.

Remove from the refrigerator and invert onto a glass serving platter.  Ice the sides and top of the terrine with the remaining 1 1/2 cups of whipped cream.  Top the terrine with the shaved chocolate.

Spoon the Raspberry Sauce in the center of each plate.  Slice the terrine into individual servings.  Place each slice in the center of the sauce.  Garnish each with a sprig of mint

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1              dozen  mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1                     loaf crusty bread
                        === PICADA SAUCE ===
  2                     garlic cloved -- peeled, minced
     1/4           cup  blanched almonds -- roasted
     1/4           cup  blanched hazelnuts -- roasted
  1              slice  fried bread
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- or as needed

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large Dutch oven, over medium heat, add the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ until wilted.

Season the squid with salt and pepper.  Add to the onions and sautÈ for 1 minute.  Remove the pan from the heat, add the brandy and carefully flame.  Shake the pan back and forth several times until the flame dies out.  Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.  Deglaze the pan with the wine.  Add the clam juice and bring to a boil.

Stir in the Picada Sauce.  Remove from the heat and ladle into serving bowls.  Garnish with parsley and serve with crusty bread.

For the Picada Sauce:  Using a mortar and pestle or a spice mill or a food processor, grind the garlic, nuts and bread together.  Add the parsley and mash until incorporated.  Add in enough oil to the mixture to form a thick paste, about 1/4 cup.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Yields about 1/2 cup)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.
