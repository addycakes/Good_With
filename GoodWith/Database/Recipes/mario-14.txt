Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for kneading
  4                     egg whites -- beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  water -- more or less

On a wooden board, place the flour in a mound.  Form a well in the center and add the egg whites and salt.  Add the water, a little at a time, while mixing in the flour and water with a fork.  Using both hands, knead the dough into a ball, adding more flour as necessary, to obtain a smooth, pliable dough.  Set the dough under an inverted bowl and let it rest 15 minutes.

Roll the pasta out to the thinnest setting on a pasta-rolling machine and cut it into 3/4-inch wide noodles.

This recipe yields 1 pound of noodles.

       Abruzzo Style Dumplings - {Gnocchi Di Semolina All'Abruzzo}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  milk
  1 3/4           cups  semolina
  1                cup  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated caciocavallo or
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1                     egg -- beaten
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped Italian parsley

Pour the milk into a large saucepan and bring to a boil.  Slowly whisk in the semolina, stirring constantly.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the mixture starts to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and 1/2 cup of the butter, 3 tablespoons cheese, the egg, and the prosciutto.  Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper.  Mix well.

Pour the semolina mixture out onto a moist work surface, either Formica or marble.  Let cool.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Using butter, grease a 10-inch round baking dish.

Using wet hands, pat the semolina mixture down to 1/2-inch thickness.  Cut the semolina into 1 1/2-inch rounds and arrange one layer of rounds across the bottom of the dish.  Sprinkle some of the cheese over the rounds and dot with a little butter.  Make a second layer, leaving a 3/4-inch border all the way around.  Sprinkle this layer with cheese and dot with butter as before, then make a third and fourth layer, leaving a successively larger border all the way around on each layer, and topping each layer with butter and cheese.

Bake until the top is browned, about 30 minutes.  Serve hot, sprinkled with parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2 1/2           cups  ground toasted almonds -- divided
     1/2           cup  sugar
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1                     egg -- plus
  3                     egg whites -- plus
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  apricot jam
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped semisweet chocolate

Grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch tart pan with a removeable bottom with butter and set aside.

Toss together the flour, 1/2 cup of the almonds, and sugar.  Cut the butter into the dry mixture until it is the consistency of fine bread crumbs.  Add 1 egg and a pinch of salt and mix well, kneading slightly.  Form the pastry into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate 30 minutes.

Roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thickness.  Line the tart pan with the dough, letting it hang over by 1-inch.  Trim the edges, reserving the scraps and rolling them into a ball.  Place the pan in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Roll the reserved dough ball out to 1/8-inch thickness and, using a pastry cutter with a crimp edge, cut it into several strips that are 9-inches long and 1/4-inch wide.  Set these strips aside in a cool place.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Line the tart pan with waxed paper and load the inside with beans.  Bake in the oven until the dough has firmed but is still pale about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and set aside.

Beat the egg whites until they are thick and glossy.  Spread the apricot jam in an even layer inside the tart crust.  Fold the remaining almonds and the chocolate into the whipped egg whites and spread this mixture over the apricot jam.  Arrange the dough strips over the top of the tart in a criss-cross fashion, pushing the ends into the apricot mixture.  Brush the top with the beaten egg and bake 30 minutes.  Serve warm or room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  2 1/2         pounds  fresh anchovies -- gutted, filleted
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  3                     eggs -- beaten
  1                cup  bread crumbs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     lemons -- cut into wedges

In a tall-sided pot, heat the olive oil to 375 degrees.

Dredge the anchovy fillets in the flour, then in the egg, then in the bread crumbs to coat well.  Working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot and changing the temperature of the oil, fry the fillets in the hot oil until golden brown, about 4 minutes.

Remove with a spider or slotted spoon and immediately season with salt and pepper.  Drain on paper towels and serve with lemon wedges alongside.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  whole anchovy fillets -- "Alici Marinati"
  2                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  fresh torn large bread cubes -- lightly toasted
  3        tablespoons  freshly-grated Peocrino Romano -- plus
                        extra for garnish
  2 1/2    tablespoons  raisins
  2 1/2    tablespoons  pine nuts -- toasted
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced
  1              bunch  fresh parsley -- leaves roughly
                        chopped
  3             medium  boiled old russet potatoes -- peeled, mashed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
                        Flour -- for dredging
  2                     sliced lemons -- for garnish

Roughly chop the anchovy fillets.  In a medium-sized bowl, combine the eggs, bread, cheese, raisins, and pine nuts.  Add the crushed garlic and parsley, the mashed potatoes and anchovy.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Using a large spoon, form the mixture into fritters about 2-inches in diameter.  Dredge in flour.

Fill a deep pot no more than halfway with extra-virgin olive oil.  Heat oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 360 to 375 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the cooking process.

Working in small batches of 6, carefully lift the anchovy balls and place them in the hot oil.  Fry the fritters until golden brown.  Using a slotted spoon or spatula, remove the finished fritters to a plate lined with paper towels.  Drain on paper towels as they cook.  Continue this process until all the fritters are cooked.  Sprinkle with cheese and serve hot with sliced lemons for squeezing.

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 dozen fritters.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fritters

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4      teaspoon  fresh brewer's yeast
  2              whole  eggs
  1 2/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  warm water
  1              sprig  fresh parsley -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     globe artichokes
  1                     lemon
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
                        Chili flakes -- to taste

To make the batter, place the yeast, eggs, flour and water in a bowl.  Blend gently to combine.  Add the parsley and garlic.  Stir to combine and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Set aside for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, cut off the spiky tips of the artichokes.  Remove the tough outer leaves.  Slice artichoke 1/4-inch thick and place in cold water with lemon juice to keep them from turning brown.

Fill a deep pot no more than halfway with extra-virgin olive oil.

Heat oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 360 to 375 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the cooking process.

While the oil is heating, drain the artichoke slices and dredge through the flour mixture so that the pieces are floured on all sides.  Set aside until the oil reaches temperature.

Working in batches of 6, fry the artichoke slices until golden brown.  Use a slotted spoon or spider to gently drop the artichokes into the oil, being careful not to splatter the hot oil, 2 to 3 minutes.  Using the same spoon or spider, remove the finished wedges to drain on paper towels.  Serve immediately with a sprinkle of chili flakes and salt and pepper, to taste.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

     1/4           cup  mint leaves - (packed)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cut 4 pieces of parchment paper into 16-inch squares.  Grease each piece of parchment with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Season the blue fish with salt and pepper and place just right of the center of each piece of parchment paper.  Divide the orange segments, oregano flowers, and red onion on top of the 4 fish fillets and sprinkle each with parsley and mint.  Drizzle with olive oil and some juice from the oranges.

Fold the left half of the parchment over and crimp the edges between your thumb and forefinger so that each pouch is sealed.  Brush each pouch with olive oil.  Place each on a cookie sheet and bake 10 minutes.

Remove and present still sealed to each diner.  Using a sharp knife or a pair of scissors, open the "cartoccio".  Drizzle with olive oil, add some raw orange zest, salt, and more orange juice.  Eat immediately.

Option Two:  Make the pouch of double layers of foil and cook on a grill for 8 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- diveded
  6                     pork sausage links -- pricked all over
  3               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             quarts  cold water
  2        tablespoons  coarse sea salt
  3               cups  quick-cooking polenta
  1                cup  freshly-grated caciocavallo or
                        Pecorino Romano
     1/4         pound  smoked mozzarella -- thinly sliced

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat.  Add the sausages and cook, turning occasionally, until all sides are browned and the fat runs freely from each sausage.  Remove and discard the excess fat, then add the tomato sauce to the pan with the sausages, scraping the bottom of the pan to take up any browned bits.  Season with salt and pepper, if necessary, reduce the heat to a low simmer, and cook, covered, for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Remove the sausages from the sauce, slice, and set aside, along with the sauce.

Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil and add the sea salt and oil.  Stir in the cornmeal, a little at a time, whisking constantly to prevent the formation of lumps.  Cook for 5 minutes, until the polenta comes away from the sides of the saucepan.  Turn the polenta out onto a clean wooden board and allow to cool.  Once it is cool, cut it into strips, using butcher's twine or a very sharp knife.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cover the bottom of a 9- by 13-inch ovenproof casserole or baking dish with a layer of sauce.  Add a layer of polenta slices, then a layer of cheese, a layer of mozzarella, and a layer of sliced sausage.  Repeat the process until all the ingredients have been used, ending with a layer of cheese.  Bake in the oven 25 minutes.  Let sit 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
     1/2         pound  fresh pork sausage
     1/2         pound  ground beef
  2               cups  canned tomatoes and their juices -- crushed
  1                     fresh hot chile pepper -- finely chopped
  2                     eggs
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated caciocavallo or
                        pecorino Romano -- plus more for
                        topping pasta

Prepare the pasta dough according to the recipe and roll out to the thinnest setting on a pasta-rolling machine.  Set aside.

In a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over high heat and add the onion.  Cook for a few minutes, until it is softened and golden brown, then add the sausage and beef.  Season with salt and pepper and cook until the meat begins to brown.  Stir in the crushed tomatoes and their juices, as well as the hot pepper.  Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring to meld the flavors and make sure the meat is cooked all the way through.

Divide the sauce into 2 equal portions.  Into 1 portion, add the eggs and cheese and stir to make a homogenous mixture.  Allow this portion of the mixture to cool completely.  Transfer the non-egg portion of the mixture to a saute pan.

Cut the pasta sheets into 4-inch squares and place a heaping teaspoon of the mixture with egg and cheese added in the center of each square.  Fold each square over on itself to form a rectangle, and seal the edges with finger pressure.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the packets in the boiling water for 4 minutes, then drain, and add to the saute pan with the ragu.  Toss over high heat for 1 minute, then serve, divided evenly among 6 warmed pasta bowls, topped with grated cheese.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     3/4           cup  cornstarch
  1                     lemon -- zest grated
  4               cups  milk
     1/2           cup  toasted sliced almonds -- for garnish

In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch and lemon zest.  Add the milk, little by little, stirring constantly to break up any small lumps that form.

When the mixture is completely combined, place over medium heat and continue stirring until everything dissolves and the cream looks smooth.  It will begin to come easily away from the sides of the pan.

Remove from the heat and pour into individual bowls or ramekins and chill, at least 1 hour, until firm.  Garnish with almonds.

To toast almonds:  Toss almonds into a dry hot pan and sprinkle with 1/4 cup sugar.  Take off the heat and stir to caramelize.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                        === COMPLETE THE DISH ===
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  3             ounces  pancetta -- finely chopped
  1                     yellow onion -- finely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  2               cups  white wine
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2          cups  red wine vinegar
                        === GRILLED SCALLION SALAD ===
  3            bunches  scallions
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  1                     lemon

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a bowl, combine 1/2 cup olive oil with the sliced onion, carrot, and celery.  Add the salt, crushed garlic cloves, bay leaves, rosemary, juniper berries, and the bottle of wine.  Place the pork in a non-reactive bowl and cover with the marinade.  Marinate for 3 days, refrigerated, stirring twice a day.

In a large casserole, heat the remaining olive oil, then add the pork pieces and pancetta to sear on all sides, working in batches, and removing the meat once it is seared.  Add the chopped onion and remaining garlic to the pan, and cook until just softened.  Add the marinade and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Add 2 cups wine and the pork and bring to a simmer.  Cook over low heat, partially covered, for 90 minutes, or until the meat is very tender.

Remove the meat and keep it covered.

In a small saucepan, heat the sugar over high heat until it melts and turns golden.  Remove from the heat and add the vinegar.  Pour this mixture into the sauce and heat through.  Serve the pork with the sauce spooned over.  Encircle the pork with the Grilled Scallion Salad.

  10            ounces  finely-ground pork
  3                     eggs -- beaten, plus
  5                     eggs -- beaten
  1                cup  grated caciocavallo or pecorino

  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Drain the cardoon pieces and place in a medium saucepan.  Cover with cold water, to which 1 tablespoon of salt has been added, then add the juice of 1 lemon and the flour.  Bring to a boil and cook gently over medium-high heat, about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cardoon pieces are very tender.  Drain and squeeze dry, then set aside.

If using artichokes:  Trim the leaves from the artichokes, clean the choke, and peel the stem.  Drop each into acidulated water as finished.  Drain the hearts and place in a medium saucepan.

Beat the remaining 5 eggs into the cardoons, then stir in the remaining cheese.  Place this mixture in a saucepan, place over low heat and cook until starting to thicken.

In a soup pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Cook the meatballs in batches of 6 or 7 until they are light golden brown and remove to a plate.  Add the onions to the pan and scrape up the brown bits with a wooden spoon while stirring the onions.  Pour the stock over and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and add the meatballs and the reserved cardoon/egg mixture.  Cover and simmer 10 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through.  Serve hot.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             quarts  water
  2        tablespoons  salt -- plus
                        more for seasoning
  1              pound  chicory -- trimmed
  6               cups  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  6                     eggs
     1/2         pound  Parmigiano-Reggiano -- freshly grated
     1/2         pound  caciocavallo -- freshly grated
                        = (or substitute provolone)
  1 1/4           cups  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
  4             slices  day-old peasant bread -- cut 1/2" cubes

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease a 9-inch casserole with butter.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Set up an ice bath next to the stovetop.  Plunge the chicory into the boiling water and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes, then drain, and plunge into the ice bath.  Drain again and squeeze out excess water.

Chop the chicory finely and place in a small saucepan with 1/2 cup chicken stock.  Cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, then remove from heat, and set aside.

In a medium mixing bowl, beat the eggs, add salt and pepper, to taste, and then add 2 tablespoons each of Parmigiano-Reggiano and caciocavallo.  Mix well, then add the chicory.

Turn the mixture into the prepared casserole and top with half of the remaining cheese.  Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, until golden brown and crusty.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool.

Cut into six wedges and place each in a soup bowl.  Bring the remaining chicken stock to a boil.  Meanwhile, heat the olive oil to 325 degrees in a tall-sided pot and add the bread cubes.  Fry until they are golden brown on all sides and remove from the oil with a slotted spoon.  Drain on paper towels, then distribute evenly among the bowls.  Fill each bowl with a ladle of chicken stock, top with the remaining cheese, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  blanched almonds
  6                     bitter almonds
                        = (or 2 tbspns apricot kernels or 12
                        blanched almonds)
                        Sugar -- if necessary, plus
     3/4           cup  sugar
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
                        more for greasing the pan
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  5              large  eggs
  6             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  water

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the blanched almonds and bitter almonds or apricot kernels and grind to a fine powder, adding a little sugar if necessary to keep the nuts from sticking together.  Set aside.

Melt 5 tablespoons butter over low heat in a small saucepan.  Remove from heat and let it cool.

Grease a 9-inch cake pan with butter and set aside.

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, cornstarch and nutmeg.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Separate the eggs and place the whites and yolks into separate bowls.  Beat the yolks with a hand mixer and gradually add the ground almonds and the sugar, beating the mixture until it is light and fluffy.  Gradually add in the flour mixture and cooled butter, beating vigorously between each addition.

In the other bowl, beat the egg whites until they are stiff and glossy, then fold them into the flour mixture.  Pour the whole batter into the prepared cake pan and bake until the cake is firm and golden, about 40 minutes.

Let cool for 15 minutes, then turn out of the pan and let cool completely.

In a double boiler over very low heat, melt the chocolate, stirring constantly.  Add 2 tablespoons water and stir until the chocolate is smooth and glossy.

Once the cake is cool, pour the melted chocolate on top and spread it with a spatula.  Serve the cake at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

               Chocolate Fritters - {Cuscinetti Di Teramo}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  1                     lemon -- zested
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
  2        tablespoons  sweet white wine
     1/2           cup  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped medium fine
     1/3           cup  hazelnuts -- toasted, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  apricot jam
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
                        Honey -- for brushing
                        fritters

Place the flour on a clean work surface and add the salt, sugar, lemon zest, oil, and enough wine to make a firm but tender dough.  Knead for 5 minutes, then wrap the dough in plastic and let it rest 30 minutes.

In the meantime, make the filling by combining the chocolate, nuts, and jam and mix with a spoon.  Set aside, covered.

Roll the dough out to 1/4-inch thickness and, using a 3-inch cookie cutter, cut out as many circles as possible.  Place a dab of filling on each circle of dough, moisten the edges with a bit of beaten egg, and fold each round in half, pressing them shut with finger pressure or a fork.

In a tall-sided pot, heat the oil to 350 degrees and fry the until they are deep golden brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Brush each fritter with honey and serve hot or cold.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings, about 30 to 32 fritters.

                        Donzelline With Prosciutto

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  virgin olive oil -- plus
  4               cups  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
  1                     egg
  3        tablespoons  lambrusco red wine
                        Sea salt -- to taste
  8             slices  prosciutto
  8             ounces  stracchino cheese

In a mixing bowl, stir together the rosemary, flour, olive oil, egg, and red wine until you have formed a soft dough.  Knead 4 minutes and then roll out into a circle that is 1/4-inch thick.  Do not over knead.  Dough also can be made using the "well" method.  Let rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

In a 3-inch tall saucepan, heat the oil to 360 to 375 degrees.

Cut the dough into 3- to 4-inch triangles.  Gently place the dough triangles into the hot oil and fry until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.  Using a slotted spoon or strainer, remove the donzelline from the oil and place to drain on a serving plate lined with paper towels.

Serve the donzelline warm sprinkled with salt and slices of prosciutto, slices or shards of stracchino.  I also recommend serving it with Sangiovese di Romagna, or another young fruity red wine.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2               cups  dried peeled fava beans
  1             medium  red onion -- finely chopped
  1                cup  finely-chopped fennel
  1           teaspoon  sun-dried tomato paste -- dissolved in
     1/4           cup  water
     1/4         pound  vermicelli noodles
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  sundried tomato paste
     1/2      teaspoon  hot red pepper chiles
  2               cups  breadcrumbs -- toasted

                        Fennel fronds -- for garnish
                        Pepperoncino -- for garnish

In cold water, soak the fava beans overnight to soften.  Drain and add the beans to a pot filled with fresh cold water to cover.  Add the onion, fennel, and dissolved tomato paste.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and let simmer until the beans soften and split, forming a puree, about 1 hour.

Using your hands, break up the vermicelli into smaller-sized noodles.  Add the vermicelli to the pot and continue to simmer until the noodles are cooked, about 15 minutes.  Season to taste with the salt and pepper.

In a small bowl, combine extra-virgin olive oil, tomato paste, and chiles and drizzle over puree.  Allow to cool to room temperature before serving with the toasted breadcrumbs scattered on top.  Garnish with fennel fronds and pepperoncino, to taste.

     1/4         pound  caul fat
                        = (available at specialty butcher shops)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2               cups  kale chiffonade - (1/2" ribbons)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2            bottles  balsamic vinegar - (16 oz ea) -- reduced by 3/4

Preheat the grill or broiler.

Cut the duck meat and pancetta into 1/4-inch cubes.  Run the meat through a meat grinder.

Place the potatoes in a pan, cover with cool water and place over medium-high heat.  Cook until just tender, then refresh in cool water and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat and the potatoes with the cinnamon, cumin, and salt.  Mix very well, then divide the mixture into 8 equal oval patties, about 1/2-inch thick.  Wrap each patty in caul fat.  Place the patties under the broiler or on the grill and cook through, about 4 to 5 minutes per side.  Set aside.

In a large 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil until just smoking.  Add the garlic and saute until very light brown, about 2 minutes.  Toss in the kale and saute, stirring quickly, about 2 to 3 minutes, until just wilted but not too soft.  Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper.

Divide the mixture evenly among 4 plates, place 2 crepinettes over each portion and serve with balsamic syrup drizzled over.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     3/4           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
     3/4           cup  freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice
  1 1/2           cups  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  1              large  potato -- peeled, and
                        cut into 8 even pieces
  2        tablespoons  dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water
  5               cups  flour
  8                     eggs -- beaten
  1              pinch  salt
  1         tablespoon  pork fat -- softened
  2                     oranges -- segmented, and
                        peel coarsely chopped
  2                     grapefruits -- segmented, and
                        peel coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter

Stir the sugar and water in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves.  Increase the heat and boil until the syrup turns deep golden brown, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and mix in the vinegar.  Add the juices and boil until reduced to 1/2 cup, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes.  Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 20 minutes.  Set aside.

In a small saucepan, cover the potato pieces with plenty of water and bring to a boil.  Cook until the pieces are very tender but not falling apart, about 15 minutes.  Drain the potatoes and run through a food mill.  Set aside and allow to cool.

Dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Place the flour on a clean work surface and make a large well in the center.  Pour in the water and yeast mixture, the beaten eggs, and salt.  Add the milled potato and pork fat, and begin to work these ingredients into the flour, bringing it all together to form a soft, sticky dough.  Add more flour if necessary to bring it all together.  Set aside in a clean bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.

After 1 hour, punch down the dough and divide into 2 even pieces.  Knead the dough a bit and set each piece aside again, covered with the damp towel, to rise another 45 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.

Place the loaves in bread pans or form them into rounds on baking sheets and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the bread is nicely browned on the outside.  Let cool 10 minutes before slicing.

While the bread cools, return the citrus sauce to the heat and bring to a simmer.  Add the segmented fruit, peel, and butter, and cook 10 minutes to thicken and heat through.  Serve the sauce spooned over the bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lemon
  4             medium  artichokes
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced
  2             pounds  fresh young fava beans -- shelled
     1/2           cup  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Squeeze the juice of half the lemon into a bowl of water large enough to hold the artichokes.  Trim the artichokes to the hearts, rubbing the cut surfaces with the lemon half to keep them from browning.  Remove the choke, cut the artichokes into 1/4-inch thick slices, then toss the slices into the acidulated water.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat and add the onion and garlic.  Sweat the vegetables in the oil until they are soft and just golden brown.  Add the fava beans and stir to mix well.  Drain the artichoke slices then add to the pan with the favas.  Add 1/2 cup water and increase the heat under the pan so that the liquid boils.  Cook until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.

  4                     cardoons stalks - (to 6) -- rinsed, dried
     1/2                lemon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1                     egg -- beaten
     1/2           cup  fresh large bread crumbs
                        = (Big Guy crumbs recommended)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying

Using a peeler, peel the cardoons starting from the bottom of the stalk, removing the tufts and the hard external ribs.  You should only be using the internal ribs, which need to be rinsed and patted dry.  Remove the filaments, squeeze the lemon into a bowl of water and lay in the cardoons.  Cut the cardoons into pieces as long as your thumb from the tip of the nail to your hand.

Bring 4 quarts water to rolling boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Add the cardoons and boil until tender, about 35 minutes.  Remove the cardoon pieces form the water and allow to air dry.

Meanwhile, fill a deep pot no more than halfway with extra-virgin olive oil.  Heat oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 360 to 375 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the cooking process.

Once the cardoons are dry, dredge them in the flour, through the beaten egg, and, finally, through the bread crumbs.  Working in batches, fry the cardoons in the oil until golden brown.  Use a slotted spoon or spider to gently drop the cardoons into the oil, being careful not to splatter the hot oil.  Using the same spoon or spider, remove the finished cardoons to a serving plate.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh mozzarella cheese
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  large fresh bread crumbs -- not toasted
                        = (Big Guy crumbs recommended)
  8        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         bunch  chopped fresh oregano leaves
                        Chili flakes -- to taste

Slice the mozzarella into 3/4-inch slices.  In a large frying pan, heat the oil over high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the garlic cloves and fry, pushing the garlic cloves through the oil to infuse the oil with the garlic flavor.  As soon as the garlic begins to color, remove from the pan.

Smash cheese slices into bread crumbs.  Lower the heat to medium-high, and place the cheese slices into the pan in 1 layer.  Make sure to leave enough room so that the cheese slices can be flipped.  Fry on both sides until golden brown, about 2 to 4 minutes per side.  Remove and let drain on a serving plate lined with paper towels.

Sprinkle the fried cheese lightly with vinegar.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and the fresh oregano.  Repeat with remaining slices until all the cheese has been fried.  Serve hot sprinkled with chili flakes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
  1              pound  fresh calamari -- cleaned, drained
  2                     lemons -- cut 1/4"-thk slices
     1/2         pound  sea scallops (dry or diver) -- halved across
                        the equator
  2               cups  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  salt
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     lemons -- cut in wedges for
                        garnish

Pour enough oil into a deep pan to fill the pan a little less than halfway.  Be sure to use a pan into which you can insert a large basket, or strainer with a handle, for frying.  Heat the oil over medium-high heat until just smoking.  If you have a high temperature thermometer, the temperature of the oil throughout the frying process should remain at about 360 to 375 degrees.

In a wide, shallow bowl, mix 1/2 the calamari, 1/2 the lemon slices, and 1/2 the scallops.  Sprinkle the mixture with 1 cup cornstarch and salt and, using your hands, toss the mixture quickly so that the cornstarch coats everything.  Toss the coated mixture into the basket (or large strainer) with a handle.  Bat the strainer against your hand to shake off any excess cornstarch.

Carefully drop the coated seafood and lemon mixture into the hot oil and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 1 minute.  Remove the fritto to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.  Immediately repeat, combining the remaining lemons, calamari, scallops, and cornstarch.

Season the hot fried foods with salt and pepper and serve immediately with fresh lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 antipasto servings.

In a wide, shallow bowl, mix 1/2 the calamari, 1/2 the lemon slices, and 1/2 the scallops.  Sprinkle the mixture with 1 cup cornstarch and salt and, using your hands, toss the mixture quickly so that the cornstarch coats everything.  Toss the coated mixture into the basket (or large strainer) with a handle.  Bat the strainer against your hand to shake off any excess cornstarch.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Carefully drop the coated seafood and lemon mixture into the hot oil and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 1 minute.  Remove the fritto to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.  Immediately repeat, combining the remaining lemons, calamari, scallops, and cornstarch.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season the hot fried foods with salt and pepper and serve immediately with fresh lemon wedges.

           Game Hens With Pomegranates - {Beccazini 'ngranti'}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Seeds from 1 large pomegranate
  1                cup  Marsala
  1         tablespoon  chopped mint
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     Cornish game hens
  6                     thin slices pancetta
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter
  12                    fresh sage leaves
                        Peel of two oranges -- cut 1/4" slices

In a small bowl, just cover the pomegranate seeds with the Marsala.  You may have to use more Marsala.  Gently mix in the mint and set aside, covered, for 1 hour.

Season the birds inside and out with salt and pepper.  Drain the pomegranate seeds and mint, reserving the liquid.  Stuff the birds with some of the seeds, reserving remainder for later use, and the mint.  Using a needle, truss the bird tightly so that the inner cavity is closed and sealed shut buy the 2 legs.  Wrap each bird in a slice of pancetta, using your palms to press the pancetta tight against the bird.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In an oven-proof saute pan, heat the olive oil, butter.  Add 3 sage leaves and cook 1 minute before adding the hens.  Brown the birds on all sides over high heat until well-browned, about 5 minutes.  Lower the heat, and add the remaining sage leaves, and pomegranate seeds.  Place the saucepan in the oven for 7 minutes.  Remove the pan from the oven.  Drizzle the hens with 3 tablespoons of the remaining Marsala and pat with 4 tablespoons of the remaining butter.  Baste the hens with the pan juices and return to the oven for 5 more minutes.

In a small saucepan, melt the remaining butter over low heat.  Add the orange peel and saute gently for 5 minutes, stirring gently so that the peel absorbs the butter.  Remove the sauteed peels from the heat.  Remove the hens from the oven and transfer them to a serving dish.  Sprinkle the hens with the orange peel, and drizzle them with pan juices and pomegranate seeds.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GNOCCHI DOUGH ===
  3             pounds  russet potatoes
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                     extra-large egg
  1              pinch  kosher salt
                        === SAUCE ===
  1           teaspoon  hot red pepper flakes
  4               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4           cup  fresh basil leaves - (lightly packed)
     1/2         pound  fresh mozzarella di bufala -- cut 1/4" cubes

Place the potatoes in a large pot and just cover with cold water.  Boil the whole potatoes until they are soft, about 45 minutes.  While still warm, peel the potatoes and pass them through a food mill onto a clean pasta board.

Make a well in the center of the potatoes and sprinkle with the flour.  Place the egg and salt in the center of the well and, using a fork, stir the egg into the flour and potatoes.  Bring the dough together, kneading gently until a ball is formed, and continue to knead for another 4 minutes, until the dough is dry to the touch.  Cut a tennis-ball sized hunk of dough off the main ball and roll it into a dowel about 3/4-inch thick.  Cut across the dowel to form pellets about 1-inch long.  Flick each pellet down the tines of a fork to form the traditional gnocchi shape.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

In a 14- to 16-inch frying pan, combine the pepper flakes, tomato sauce, and 1 teaspoon salt.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer 15 minutes, or until the sauce is as thick as good porridge.  (At this point the sauce could be refrigerated for up to 2 days).

When you are ready to serve the gnocchi, bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water and cook until floating aggressively, 4 to 5 minutes.  Carefully transfer the gnocchi to the pan with the sauce, using a slotted spoon.  Turn the heat to medium and toss gently for about 30 seconds.  Tear the basil leaves into a few pieces and add to the sauce along with the mozzarella cubes.  Toss together for 30 seconds longer.  Pour into a heated bowl and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GNOCCHI ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             pounds  fresh spinach -- rinsed, and
                        shaken dry
  1              pound  boiled potatoes
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour - (to 1)
  1                     egg
  1              pinch  salt
                        === SAUCE ===
  4             ounces  Gorgonzola
  2             ounces  butter
  1              ounce  grappa
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley leaves
  1                     Handful chili flakes
     1/4           cup  chopped chives

Set up a small ice bath.

In a pan, heat extra-virgin olive oil over high heat, then toss in spinach with salt.  Cook for about 1 minute.  Remove spinach and shock in a bowl of cold ice water.  Place spinach in a clean dish towel and wring spinach dry by twisting and squeezing.  Using a knife, chop the spinach extremely fine.

Meanwhile, take the warm boiled potatoes, peel them, and run them through a food mill on smallest setting, or a ricer.  Add the chopped spinach to the potatoes, and mix to combine.  Make well in center of the spinach potato mixture, add the flour, egg, and salt, and knead to form a dough.

Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Roll the dough into 1-inch thick ropes and cut into 1-inch long pieces.  Flick the dough off the tines of a fork to establish the classic gnocchi shape.  Drop 10 to 15 gnocchi at a time into boiling water.  When they float, all together, remove the gnocchi to the ice bath.  Drain well.  Repeat until all the gnocchi have been boiled.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, mash together the Gorgonzola and the butter until smooth.  Add the grappa and simmer until the liquid evaporates, about 4 minutes.  Toss gnocchi into pan with the Gorgonzola and butter until well combined.  Add chopped parsley and a handful of chili flakes and chives.  Pour into warmed pasta bowls and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Set up a small ice bath.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a pan, heat extra-virgin olive oil over high heat, then toss in spinach with salt.  Cook for about 1 minute.  Remove spinach and shock in a bowl of cold ice water.  Place spinach in a clean dish towel and wring spinach dry by twisting and squeezing.  Using a knife, chop the spinach extremely fine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, take the warm boiled potatoes, peel them, and run them through a food mill on smallest setting, or a ricer.  Add the chopped spinach to the potatoes, and mix to combine.  Make well in center of the spinach potato mixture, add the flour, egg, and salt, and knead to form a dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll the dough into 1-inch thick ropes and cut into 1-inch long pieces.  Flick the dough off the tines of a fork to establish the classic gnocchi shape.  Drop 10 to 15 gnocchi at a time into boiling water.  When they float, all together, remove the gnocchi to the ice bath.  Drain well.  Repeat until all the gnocchi have been boiled.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, mash together the Gorgonzola and the butter until smooth.  Add the grappa and simmer until the liquid evaporates, about 4 minutes.  Toss gnocchi into pan with the Gorgonzola and butter until well combined.  Add chopped parsley and a handful of chili flakes and chives.  Pour into warmed pasta bowls and serve.

              Grilled Portobello Mushrooms With Pea Sprouts

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Mushrooms

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  portobello mushrooms -- stems removed
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        extra for drizzling
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/2         pound  fresh pea sprouts
                        = (or other accessible sprouts)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  Cacio di Roma
                        = (or other semi-soft sheep's milk cheese)
  4                     domestic mushrooms

Special Equipment:  Truffle slicer or small mandolin

Preheat grill or broiler.  Drizzle the portobello mushrooms with extra-virgin olive oil.  Place the mushrooms on the grill so that they are centered near the heat.  Grill until soft and nicely cooked, and barely charred, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.  Sprinkle some lemon juice on the mushrooms after they have been charred and splash them with red wine vinegar.

In a mixing bowl, toss the pea sprouts, olive oil, and remaining lemon juice, so that the sprouts are evenly coated in the liquid.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper, and divide among 4 plates.  For a nice effect, stack the sprouts like little hay stacks.

Using a peeler, shave cheese over and around salad.  Using the mandolin, slice the domestic mushrooms in paper thin slices over and around the salad.  Place the portobellos on each haystack and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PEPPERS ===
  9              large  red bell peppers
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  2                     basil leaves -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated pecorino Romano
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE TROUT ===
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for brushing fish
  9                     garlic cloves -- divided
  5               cups  finely-chopped parsley
  6                     trout - (1 lb ea) -- gutted, scaled,
                        and rinsed well
  6                     branches rosemary
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Peppers:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Cut the tops off 6 of the 9 peppers and scoop out the insides with a spoon.  Set aside.  Core and seed the remaining peppers and cut them into 1/2-inch dice.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and add the garlic, diced peppers, parsley, and basil and cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, until the garlic is golden brown and the peppers are slightly soft.

Remove from heat and, in a large bowl, combine with the bread crumbs, pecorino, egg, and salt and pepper, to taste, and mix to combine.  Divide evenly among the whole peppers; do not pack the stuffing down too tightly, or it will be very heavy once it is cooked.  Drizzle the outside of each pepper with a little olive oil and place in the oven on a baking sheet for 15 to 20 minutes, until the pepper is soft and the top of the stuffing is crusty and browned.  Serve hot.

Trout:  Preheat the grill or broiler.

In a blender or food processor, combine 1 cup olive oil, 3 cloves of the garlic and the parsley and pulse or puree to make the "salsa verde" (green sauce).  Set aside.

Inside each cleaned fish, place 1 clove garlic, 1 branch rosemary, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Drizzle inside and out with olive oil and place on the grill or under the broiler, wrapping in aluminum foil, if desired.  Turn after 5 to 8 minutes and cook until the flesh is opaque.  Serve hot, drizzled with the salsa verde.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Basic Pasta With Semolina dough -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  6              dozen  large snails -- ready for cooking
  4                     mint leaves -- chopped
  6             sprigs  fresh oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare the pasta dough according to the recipe and roll out to the thinnest setting on a pasta-rolling machine.  Using a paring knife, cut the pasta sheets into long strands of spaghetti.  Carefully hang the strands over a dowel over the back of a chair to dry.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Meanwhile, in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and add the garlic.  Cook for 2 minutes, until it is fragrant and golden, then add the snails and mint, and toss well.  Season with salt and pepper and then add the oregano.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 10 to 12 minutes.

Once the snails are cooked through and fragrant, cook the spaghetti in the boiling water until tender yet al dente, about 4 minutes.  Drain and add to the pan with the snails.  Gently toss over high heat for 1 minute, adding more olive oil or a little pasta cooking water if necessary, and divide evenly among 6 warmed pasta bowls.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Abruzzo Broad Noodles -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  spinach -- trimmed, blanched,
                        and drained
  1              pound  goat-milk ricotta
  1                cup  freshly-grated caciocavallo or
                        pecorino Romano
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare the dough according to the recipe and roll it out to the second-thinnest setting on a pasta-rolling machine.  Cut it into 4 or 5 sheets of equal size, flour each sheet well, and cut them into 1-inch squares.  Set aside on sheet trays lined with kitchen towels.

In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the spinach until finely chopped and add the ricotta, 1/4 cup of the grated cheese, and the nutmeg.  Process until smooth, season with salt and pepper, and set aside in a warm place.

Add more water if necessary to keep it from becoming too "tight", season with salt and pepper.  Divide evenly among 4 pasta bowls and top with grated pecorino.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  guanciale -- thinly sliced
                        = (or substitute smoked pancetta or bacon)
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1                     red onion -- halved, sliced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  red pepper flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  bucatini
                        Caciocavallo or pecorino Romano -- for grating

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, place the guanciale slices in a single layer and cook over medium-low heat until most of the fat has been rendered from the meat.  Remove the meat to a plate lined with paper towels.

Discard half the fat from the pan, leaving enough to coat, and cook the garlic, onion, and pepper flakes.  Place these three ingredients in the pan, add the guanciale, and cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, until the onion, garlic, and guanciale are light golden brown.  Season with salt and pepper.  You may add extra-virgin olive oil if necessary to keep the aromatics from burning.  Add the tomato sauce, reduce the heat, and allow to simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.

Cook the bucatini in the boiling water according to the package directions, until tender but still al dente, about 12 minutes.  Drain the pasta and add it to simmering sauce.  Increase the heat to high and toss to coat.  Divide the pasta among 4 warmed pasta bowls.  Top with freshly grated pecorino cheese and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        as possible
  1                cup  roughly-chopped canned peeled seeded
                        tomatoes
                        and roughly chopped
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        === "HEE HEE" GARNISH ===
  2             ounces  field mushrooms -- sliced 1/8" thick
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

  1                     Squeeze lemon
                        Extra-virgin olive oil

In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, heat 1/2 cup olive oil until hot but not smoking.  Toss in the mushrooms, garlic and season with salt and pepper.  Deglaze pan with vinegar.  Place in a large bowl, and add the sausage and combine.  Add chili flakes, parsley, 2 eggs, cheese and cayenne pepper

Place equal amounts of the mixture in the center of each lamb piece, and gently roll up the lamb so that the mushroom mixture is enclosed.  Secure the roll with a toothpick.  Repeat the process with the remaining lamb pieces.

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over high heat.  When the oil is hot, but not smoking, add the lamb rolls and brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and wine and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to let the liquid simmer, until the lamb and the stuffing is cooked, about 1 hour, carefully stirring and basting occasionally with the pan juices.

Serve immediately with "Hee Hee" garnish spooned over each serving.

"Hee Hee" Garnish:  Combine ingredients and serve over lamb.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, heat 1/2 cup olive oil until hot but not smoking.  Toss in the mushrooms, garlic and season with salt and pepper.  Deglaze pan with vinegar.  Place in a large bowl, and add the sausage and combine.  Add chili flakes, parsley, 2 eggs, cheese and cayenne pepper

Reduce the heat to let the liquid simmer, until the lamb and the stuffing is cooked, about 1 hour, carefully stirring and basting occasionally with the pan juices.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  3             pounds  lamb shoulder -- cut 4" pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated caciocavallo or
                        pecorino Romano
  6                     eggs
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs
  6                     red or green bell peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        seeded and cut into strips

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven, heat 1/4 cup of the extra-virgin olive oil over medium heat and add the onion.  Cook for 5 minutes, until it is softened and golden.

Season the lamb chunks with salt and pepper and add to the skillet.  Increase the heat to high and sear the lamb on all sides, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan.  Stir in the wine, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to incorporate the browned bits of meat and onion, and season with salt and pepper.  Cook over medium-low heat for about 90 minutes, until the meat is very tender.  Add more wine or water, if necessary, to keep the pan from drying out.

When the meat is cooked, combine the cheese, eggs, and bread crumbs in a large bowl and whisk together.  Season with salt and pepper and add the roasted pepper strips.  Increase the heat under the lamb to high and add the egg mixture to the pan.  Stir as for scrambled eggs and cook until the eggs harden.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  castelluccio lentils
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2        medium  red onion -- chopped 1/8" dice
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced, plus
  2                     garlic cloves -- whole
  4               cups  chicken broth -- hot
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4         pound  Tuscan or Umbrian country bread
  1                cup  pasta shells
                        === CHILI OIL ===
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced thin
  2        tablespoons  chili flakes
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper

Wash and drain the lentils, carefully picking through them to take out any pebbles.

In a 3-quart saucepan, heat the 6 tablespoons oil until just smoking.  Add the onions and sliced garlic.  Cook until softened but not brown, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Add the lentils and the hot chicken stock.  Bring the liquid to a boil.  Lower then heat and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, keeping the level of the liquid just over the lentils by periodically adding more water.  Add the pasta shells during the last 6 minutes of cooking.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

In the meantime, preheat the grill or broiler.  When the soup is ready to serve, grill or toast, slices of the bread until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Rub each slice with a cut garlic clove.

Ladle the soup into warm bowls.  Place a slice of garlic bread on top of each soup serving.  Drizzle the bread and the soup with the chili oil and serve immediately.

Chili Oil:  In a small hot saute pan, add extra-virgin olive oil and garlic.  Saute until golden and add chili flakes and salt and pepper.  Cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let infuse.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  Yukon gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more to grease the baking dish
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2            bunches  pencil-thin asparagus -- cut into thirds
     1/2           cup  reserved potato cooking water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4         pound  pancetta ham -- cut 1/4" cubes
     1/2         pound  cremini mushrooms -- cleaned, chopped
     1/2           cup  dried bread crumbs
  6              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
     1/2         bunch  fresh mint leaves -- chopped
                        === HEE HEE GARNISH ===
  4                     crimini mushrooms -- sliced paper thin
     1/2                red onion -- sliced paper thin
  1                     lemon -- juiced
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt
  1              pinch  chili flakes
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed

Bring 6 quarts of water to boil in a large pot.  Add 2 tablespoons salt and the potatoes.  Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 8 minutes.  Drain and reserve 1/2 cup cooking water.  Set aside.

In a medium saute pan, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil until hot but not smoking.  Add the garlic and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the garlic turns a light golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Add the asparagus and the reserved potato water to the pan.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a boil.  Return the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the asparagus is tender, about 5 minutes.

Heat a saute pan over medium heat.  Add the pancetta cubes and cook, over medium-low heat, until the fat from the meat is completely rendered, about 10 minutes.  Once the pan has enough pancetta fat, add the cremini mushrooms and saute in the pancetta fat until golden brown, about 10 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Using a few tablespoons of olive oil, grease a 12-inch round baking pan with 3- to 4-inch sides.  Coat the pan with the bread crumbs, shaking off any excess crumbs.  Set the dish aside.

Pass the potatoes through a food mill into a large bowl.  Add 1/4 cup oil, eggs, cheese, mint, and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Stir to combine well.  Spoon 1/2 of the mashed potatoes into the prepared pan and, using a wooden spoon, smooth them evenly across the pan to form and even layer.  Spoon the asparagus and then the mushrooms over the potatoes, using the spoon to smooth each into an even layer.  Top the mushrooms with the remaining potatoes, using the spoon to spread them evenly.  Bake until the edges are golden brown, about 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve either hot or at room temperature.  Serve with Hee Hee Garnish.

Hee Hee Garnish:  Combine all ingredients and spoon on top of potato cake.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  6             quarts  water
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1              pound  waxy potatoes
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     scallions, whites and greens -- sliced on bias
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed
     1/2                red onion -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Add the potatoes and cook until tender but not falling apart.  Drain and allow to cool for 10 minutes, then peel and slice potatoes into 1/2-inch thick slices.

In a hot rondeau heat 1/4 cup olive oil, add octopus, red pepper flakes, and garlic.  Cook over high heat for about 40 minutes or until octopus is tender and has released its juices.  Season octopus with salt and pepper.  Allow to cool and then slice into 1/2-inch pieces.

Mound the octopus slices attractively in the center of a platter and arrange the warm potato slices around the edge.  Sprinkle with the scallions and parsley.  Mix together the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, red onion, salt, and pepper.

Taste and adjust the seasoning, then pour the dressing over the octopus and still warm potatoes.  Cover with a piece of foil and set aside in a cool place to marinate for several hours before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  2             pounds  pork shoulder -- cut 1" cubes
     3/4           cup  tomato paste
  1 1/2           cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  3               cups  hot chicken stock -- plus
                        more for thinning the sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
  12              cups  water
  6               cups  Arborio rice
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  1 1/2           cups  freshly-grated caciocavallo -- plus
                        extra for garnish
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  penne pasta
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  1                cup  Pecorno Romano
     1/3           cup  fresh chopped parsley leaves
  1              pinch  hot red pepper flakes
  2               cups  fresh bread crumbs -- plus
                        extra for topping

In a 12- to 14-inch saucepan, combine 1/2 cup of olive oil, and onions.  Cook until soft.  Season the pork with salt and pepper and add to onions.  Cook until deep brown.  Add tomato paste, tomato sauce, and chicken stock.  Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring well to combine.  Season, to taste, with salt.  Turn the heat to low and let simmer until the meat becomes very tender, about 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes.  If the sauce becomes too thick, add some extra chicken stock or water.  Throughout the cooking process, the meat should always be just covered in sauce.

In the meantime, bring 12 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan, and add 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  Add the rice and cook, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat, covered, until the rice is al dente, about 25 minutes.  Drain the rice and place it in a large, shallow bowl.  Allow the rice to cool for at least 30 minutes.

When the meat sauce is done and the rice is cool, stir the beaten eggs into the rice.  Mix well to combine.  Stir 3/4 of the meat ragu, 1/2 cup freshly grated cheese, and the nutmeg into the rice.  Season the mixture, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Mix again to combine and then set the mixture aside.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Add the penne, and cook the pasta according to the package directions, until al dente.  While the pasta cooks, melt 6 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan.  Remove from the heat.  Drain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid.

Place the drained pasta in a bowl.  Add 1 cup of the meat ragu, 1 cup pecorino, the melted butter, the hot pepper flakes, and 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs.  Season the mixture, to taste, with salt and pepper and stir well to combine.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Generously butter the sides and bottom of a round 12- to 14-inch baking dish with 4-inch sides.  Add 3/4 cup bread crumbs to the dish, turning and rotating the dish so that the bread crumbs coat all of the sides.

Spoon 1/3 of the rice into the dish, spreading the to form an even layer across the bottom of the dish.  Top the rice with 1/2 of the pasta.  Use a wooden spoon to gently smooth the pasta so that it to forms an even layer across the top.  Spoon 1/2 of the ragu over the pasta.  Top with another layer of rice (1/2 of what remains), followed by the remaining pasta, then the remaining ragu.  Cover the ragu with the remaining rice, and use a wooden spoon to smooth the rice across the top so that it forms an even layer.  Sprinkle the top of the rice with remaining 1/4 cup of bread crumbs and sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and caciocavallo atop the bread crumbs.  Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Remove the timbale from the oven and allow to cool 10 minutes.

To unmold the timbale, run the blade of a thin knife around the inside edge of the pan separate any sticking ingredients.  Place a round serving plate, one that is 6 inches larger than the baking pan over the timbale.  Being careful to keep the platter in contact with the baking dish, and not allowing the dish to slip on the platter, invert the baking dish over the platter.  Gently remove the baking dish, leaving the timbale on the platter.  If the timbale does not slide out easily, don't tug or try to force it out.  Instead, wipe the bottom and the sides of the baking dish with a hot kitchen towel.  If necessary, carefully shake the platter and dish in unison, being careful not to separate one from the other.  The timbale should now release easily when the dish is lifted.  Allow the timbale to rest 10 minutes before serving.  The dish can be simply served as is, with a big serving spoon or cut into wedges, topped with remaining ragu, more cheese and chili flakes.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Butter -- for greasing
  6                     Bosc or other firm pears -- peeled
     1/4           cup  honey
  1              pinch  cinnamon
  5             ounces  semisweet chocolate
  2                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  confectioners' sugar

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Using the butter, grease an ovenproof casserole.  Cut a slice off the bottom of each pear to make it stand upright, then place them in the casserole.  Add 1/2 cup water and place the pears in the oven to soften for 40 minutes, basting 3 to 4 times throughout the process.

Combine the pan juices with the honey and cinnamon in a small bowl and whisk together until it's the consistency of a light emulsion.  Augment with hot tap water if necessary.  Drizzle the pears with this mixture, return the pears to the oven, and let cook for another 5 minutes.  Remove from the oven and set aside until ready to serve.

In the top part of a double boiler, melt the chocolate, stirring constantly to avoid scorching.  Set aside to cool.

Separate the 2 eggs and beat the yolks into the chocolate, which should be cool but still liquid.  Whisk the chocolate to make sure it is well mixed.  Beat the egg whites and confectioners' sugar together, to form stiff peaks, and then, fold this mixture into the chocolate mixture.

Place 1 pear on each of 6 dessert plates and top with some of the chocolate mixture.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  semolina flour
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1               cups  tepid water -- (1 to 1 1/4)

Place both types of flour in a large mixing bowl and stir to mix well.  Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the water a little at a time, stirring with your hands until a dough is formed.  You may need more or less water, depending on the humidity in your kitchen.

Place the dough on a floured work surface and knead it like bread until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Cover the dough and let it stand for 10 minutes at room temperature.

Roll the dough into long dowels about 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick.  Place the pasta strands between 2 hands and lightly roll back and forth to create a lightly spiraled, snake-like noodle.  Place the pici on a sheet tray that has been dusted with semolina flour, cover the pasta with a clean dish towel, and set aside until ready to use.  At this point, the pasta can be frozen for several months.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Place both types of flour in a large mixing bowl and stir to mix well.  Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the water a little at a time, stirring with your hands until a dough is formed.  You may need more or less water, depending on the humidity in your kitchen.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the dough on a floured work surface and knead it like bread until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Cover the dough and let it stand for 10 minutes at room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll the dough into long dowels about 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick.  Place the pasta strands between 2 hands and lightly roll back and forth to create a lightly spiraled, snake-like noodle.  Place the pici on a sheet tray that has been dusted with semolina flour, cover the pasta with a clean dish towel, and set aside until ready to use.  At this point, the pasta can be frozen for several months.

Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Candies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  powdered sugar
     1/2           cup  honey
  3        tablespoons  corn syrup
  2                     egg whites -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  blanched almonds -- chopped
     1/4           cup  pistachios -- chopped
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil -- for work surface

In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, slowly dissolve the sugar with the honey and corn syrup.  Cook for 5 to 10 minutes over low heat until the temperature reaches 275 degrees.  Beat the egg whites to soft peaks.  Slowly add the sugar-honey syrup to the beaten egg whites.  Let cool for 30 seconds.  Add nuts and stir.

Spread the vegetable oil over a level, clean work surface (marble is ideal, but clean baking sheets works well).  Pour the honey nut mixture onto the oiled surface, using a spatula to smooth it out evenly.  Using a sharp knife, cut the nougat into pieces.  Allow to cool completely.  This will take several hours.

Once the nougat is ready, it should be wrapped in waxed paper and kept in an airtight container to keep from getting hard.  The nougat can be kept like this for up to 1 month.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     red bell peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        cored, seeded, and cut 1/4" strips
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped Italian parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  light red wine
     3/4           cup  warm water
  1 1/2         ounces  yeast
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4         pound  fresh anchovies -- cleaned

In a large bowl, combine the pepper strips, garlic, parsley, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Drizzle about 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over and refrigerate until ready to use.

In a large bowl, combine the wine, water, and yeast in a large bowl and stir until dissolved.  Add the honey, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 tablespoon olive oil and mix thoroughly.  Add 1 cup of the flour and mix with a wooden spoon to make a loose batter.  Add 2 more cups of the flour and stir for 2 to 3 minutes to incorporate as much flour as possible.

Bring the dough together by hand and turn out onto a floured board or marble surface.  Knead 6 to 8 minutes, until you have made a firm, smooth dough.  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a towel.  Set aside to rise for 45 minutes.  Cut the dough into 2 pieces and set aside to rise for another 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Take half of the dough and roll out to 1/8-inch thickness.  Remove the pepper from the marinade and arrange them atop the dough, along with the anchovies.  Sprinkle with the remaining aromatics and oil in the pepper bowl.  Season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with the remaining olive oil.  Roll out the remaining dough to a similar thickness and top the bottom crust.  Pinch all around the edges to seal.  Cut a vent in the top of the pizza.

Bake on a pizza sheet for 30 minutes, until the top and sides are golden.  Remove from the oven and let rest 5 minutes before slicing and serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  water
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2               cups  polenta
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  3             pounds  cherrystone clams -- scrubbed

Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil and add salt.

Slowly whisk the polenta into the water in the top section of the double boiler, whisking in 1 direction to avoid creating lumps.  Continue whisking, scraping the bottom and corners of the pot, for 5 minutes.  When the polenta begins to thicken, cover it, and fit the top of the double boiler into the bottom part of the double boiler.  Cook for 90 minutes, stirring every 30 minutes.  Once it is ready, turn it out onto a board.

Once the polenta is ready for serving, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large frying pan, and add the garlic.  Cook until it is golden brown, then add the tomato sauce, wine, and red pepper flakes, and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the clams, cover the pan, and cook for 5 minutes, until they all open.  Uncover and cook for an additional 5 minutes, discard any that do not open.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Serve a wedge of polenta on each of 6 heated dinner plates and spoon some of the clam cooking sauce over it.  Divide the clams evenly among the plates and season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                             Potato Doughnuts

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2    tablespoon  yeast
     1/2         pound  baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks for boiling
  2                     eggs
  3 1/2           cups  flour - (to 4)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1              quart  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
     1/8           cup  amaro (a bitter-herb liqueur)
  1                     orange -- zested and juiced
                        Confectioners' sugar -- as needed

In a small saucepan, heat the milk over low heat until warm.  Crumble the yeast in the milk and let sit 15 minutes, until it is foaming.

Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil, cooking until tender.  Drain and pass through a food mill or ricer and place in a large bowl.  Add the eggs, flour, sugar, 1/4 cup oil, amaro, juice, and zest of orange and mix well to combine.  Add the yeast mixture and knead well, adding more flour if necessary to keep the batter from becoming too sticky.  Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 hour.

Divide the dough into four equal pieces and roll each one out to form a 1 1/2-inch thick dowel.  Cut the dowels into 5-inch lengths and form little doughnuts.  Place the doughnuts on a well-oiled baking sheet and let rise until they double in volume.

In a tall-sided pot, heat the quart of olive oil to 375 degrees.

Working in batches, fry the doughnuts in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and allow to drain on a plate lined with paper towels.  Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

In a small saucepan, heat the milk over low heat until warm.  Crumble the yeast in the milk and let sit 15 minutes, until it is foaming.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil, cooking until tender.  Drain and pass through a food mill or ricer and place in a large bowl.  Add the eggs, flour, sugar, 1/4 cup oil, amaro, juice, and zest of orange and mix well to combine.  Add the yeast mixture and knead well, adding more flour if necessary to keep the batter from becoming too sticky.  Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the dough into four equal pieces and roll each one out to form a 1 1/2-inch thick dowel.  Cut the dowels into 5-inch lengths and form little doughnuts.  Place the doughnuts on a well-oiled baking sheet and let rise until they double in volume.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a tall-sided pot, heat the quart of olive oil to 375 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Working in batches, fry the doughnuts in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and allow to drain on a plate lined with paper towels.  Dust with confectioners&apos; sugar and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  potatoes
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
  2             ounces  fresh brewer's yeast
                        Sea salt -- for the paddle
  1                cup  fresh ricotta cheese
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  8             ounces  salami -- sliced thinly
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In large pot, cover the potatoes with cold water.  Add 1 tablespoon salt.  Bring the water to a boil over high heat and cook the potatoes at a boil until they are tender, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Drain well and let the potatoes cool slightly.

When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them and pass them through a potato ricer into a large puree in a large bowl.  Dissolve the yeast in warm water according to the package directions.  Add the flour and yeast to the bowl with the potatoes.  Mix with hands to combine well.

Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and continue kneading until you achieve a smooth dough.  You may need to add some more water.  Once the dough is well kneaded and smooth, place it in a large bowl, and cover with a damp kitchen towel.  Place the bowl in a warm spot (like above the refrigerator) and let proof 2 hours.

Preheat oven and baking tile to 475 degrees.

After the dough has rested, use a sharp knife to cut the dough into 2 pieces, 1 slightly larger than the other.  Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out into 2 rounds about 12-inches in diameter, again 1 slightly larger than the other.  Coat the paddle with the sea salt.  Place the larger dough round on the paddle spread with coarse sea salt.

Combine ricotta and oil in a small bowl.  Using 2/3 of the ricotta, smear a layer of ricotta onto dough.  Top with a layer of salami.  Cover the pizza with the second portion of dough, using your finger to crimp seal the edges shut.  Spread the remaining ricotta over the top of the second dough layer and score top.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  4                     russet potatoes -- peeled
     3/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- divided
     1/2           cup  chopped chives -- plus
  4        tablespoons  chopped chives
  2                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
  4        tablespoons  butter
  8                     sage leaves
     1/2                lemon -- juiced

Boil potatoes for about 40 minutes.  Drain and peel.

In a mixing bowl, crush the potatoes with a masher until smooth.  Add 1/2 cup of the cheese, 1/2 cup chives, eggs, and nutmeg, and mix well.

Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Using a pasta roller, roll out the pasta to thinnest setting and cut into 4-inch squares.  Place 1 tablespoon potato mixture in center of each square.  Fold opposite corners of each square together and press firmly to seal and form a triangle.  Bring the opposite points of the triangle together and press firmly to meld.  Continue until all the pasta is stuffed and formed into tortelli.  Drop pasta into boiling water and cook until tender, about 6 to 7 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan and continue cooking until you begin to see hints of a golden brown color (noisette), appearing in the thinnest liquid of the butter.  Add the sage leaves and remove from heat.  Add the lemon juice and set aside.  Drain the tortelli well, gently pour into saute pan and return to heat.  Add the remaining chives and cheese, toss to coat and serve immediately.

                        Prosciutto With Fig Tarts

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2                     extra-large eggs
  12       tablespoons  sweet unsalted butter -- melted and liquid
                        === TARTS ===
  12                    ripe figs
  8             ounces  prosciutto di Parma -- sliced paper thin
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds
  2             ounces  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Butter a baking dish and set aside.

On a pasta board, or large, clean, wooden cutting board, make a mound out of flour and make well in center, just like making fresh pasta.  This can also be done in a large mixing bowl.  Place the sugar, eggs, and melted butter into the well.  Using a fork, mix the ingredients, bringing the walls of the flour into the well bit by bit, and forming a mass of dough.

Once the dough has come together, knead it for 1 minute until a medium ball has formed.  Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and roll each into a ball.  Wrap each dough ball in plastic.  Refrigerate the balls for 15 minutes so that the dough has a chance to rest.

Meanwhile, cut the figs into halves.  Remove the pastry from the refrigerator and roll each piece into a 4- to 5-inch circle, about 1/4-inch thick.  Carefully place the rounds in the prepared baking sheet.  Arrange the fruit cut-side up in the center of each pastry round.  If you desire, you can fold the tart edges in over the fruit to form a kind of shell, or else let the fruit come near the flat edges of the tarts, forming a flat, disk-like tart.  Bake the tarts until the pastry is golden brown, about 20 to 22 minutes.

Remove the tarts from oven, lay 2 thin slices of prosciutto over each, and sprinkle them with cracked black pepper, fennel seeds and the extra-virgin olive oil.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === GREEN OLIVE PESTO ===
  1 1/2          large  green olives -- pitted

     1/4         pound  cremini -- brushed clean,
                        and cut in halves
     1/4         pound  oyster mushrooms -- brushed clean,
                        and cut in halves
     1/4         pound  yellow foot mushrooms -- brushed clean,
                        and cut in halves
     1/2        medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  crushed red chili flakes -- (optional)
  4                     scallions, green and white -- cut 1" long pieces
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  4                     canned plum tomatoes -- cut in halves
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- recipe follows
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             slices  Italian peasant bread, 1" thick -- grilled
  1                cup  Green Olive Pesto -- (listed above)

To make the pesto:  In a food processor, combine the olives, onion, pine nuts, and garlic, and blend for 1 minute.  With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil until it forms a thick, smooth paste.  Allow to stand 1/2 hour before using.

In a heavy 4-quart saucepan, place the chanterelles, crimini, oyster, and yellow foot mushrooms, the red onion, chili flakes, scallions, garlic, tomatoes, and tomato sauce and bring to a boil.  Add wine after 8 minutes of cooking.  Lower the heat so that the mixture simmers, partially covered, for 15 minutes.

In the meantime, preheat the grill or broiler.

After simmering, the mushroom mixture should be thick, like a ragu.  Season the hodgepodge, to taste, with salt and pepper, and pour into a large, shallow serving bowl.

Toast the bread and smear with the green olive pesto.  Stand the crostini at fun angles in middle of mushroom hodge-podge and serve immediately in center of table.  Serve on top of grilled bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2                Basic Bread Dough II -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1              pound  broccoli -- broken 1" florets,
                        and stems sliced 1/4" thick
                        Freshly-grated nutmeg -- to taste
  1              pound  fresh ricotta

Preheat oven and baking tile to 500 degrees.

Split dough into 2 pieces, 1 slightly larger than the other, and roll out into 2 rounds about 12-inches in diameter, again 1 slightly larger than the other.  Coat the paddle with the sea salt.  Place the larger dough round on the paddle spread with coarse sea salt.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the broccoli and cook until softened and light brown, stirring constantly, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Allow to cool.  Season with several gratings of fresh nutmeg and salt and pepper.

Smear the large dough round with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil.  Spread ricotta over the dough and smear within 1-inch of the edge all around.  Place the broccoli pieces on top of the ricotta, and drizzle with the remaining olive oil and breadcrumbs.  Place the second dough round on top and press down on the edges to seal.  Poke holes in the top layer.  Drizzle lightly with water and some oil and bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.  Let rest 5 minutes before serving.

                        Rock salt -- as accompaniment

Bring 6 quarts water to boil and set up ice bath nearby.

Cook all the shrimp for 1 1/2 minutes and plunge into the ice bath.  Cook the scampi for 1 minute, and plunge into the ice bath.  Repeat with the calamari.  Cook the lobster for 8 minutes and then cool in the ice bath.

In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, place mussels and clams with 1 cup of water and bring to a boil.  Cover the pan and let the seafood steam, removing each shellfish as it opens until they are all cooked and removed from the pan.  Discard any shellfish that do not open.  Keeping each type of open shellfish separate, dress each individually with 1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, a touch of lemon juice, a pinch of chilies, and 1 to 2 tablespoons parsley.  Dress the crabmeat in the same manner.  Arrange all the seafood on a big platter.  Garnish with lemon wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                     live dungeness crab - (2 lbs)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/4         pounds  mussels -- well cleaned
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red onion
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  crushed hot chili pepper
                        = (or pepperoncino)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  dried spaghetti
     1/2         bunch  fresh parsley -- finely chopped

Place the cleaned mussels, still in their shells, in a large saucepan over high heat.  Cover and let cook until the mussels open up and release their juices, about 3 minutes.  Drain, reserving all of the strained mussel liquid.

Cut the onion in half through the root and slice each half into half moons, each 1/8 of an inch thick.  In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the garlic, hot chili pepper and the onions, cooking until soft and golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.

While the garlic, hot pepper and onions cook, remove the mussels from their shells and discard the shells.

You can also begin to prepare the spaghetti by bringing a large pot filled with 6 quarts of water to a boil.  When the water boils, add 2 tablespoons of salt and your spaghetti.  Cook the spaghetti according to the package directions, until it is tender but still al dente.  Drain the pasta before adding to the mussel mixture.

Add the mussels to the saucepan, and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Add the reserved mussel juices.  Raise the heat to high and allow the mussel mixture to boil for almost 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat, add the chopped parsley, a pinch of hot chili pepper and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.  Toss the mussel sauce with the cooked spaghetti.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  chicken - (4 lbs)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
  1                cup  freshly-grated caciocavallo or
                        pecorino Romano
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1                     garlic clove -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1                     celery rib -- coarsely chopped
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  2             quarts  water

Remove the innards (liver, heart, and gizzard) of the chicken.  In a small saute pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and add the innards to the pan and saute over high heat until they are browned.  Season with salt and pepper and chop coarsely.

Bring 2 quarts water to a boil.

In a Dutch oven, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over high heat and add the chicken.  Brown it all over, then remove from the pan, and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the reserved innards, bread crumbs, cheese, egg, garlic, parsley, nutmeg, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Mix well and stuff the cavity of the bird with the stuffing.  Truss the bird with butcher's twine and place in the Dutch oven, along with the celery and onions.

Pour 2 quarts boiling, salted water over the chicken, and place over medium flame.  Cook meat for 1 hour or until the chicken is falling apart and the cooking liquid has mingled with the chicken's juices.  Serve the broth hot with chicken pieces.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lamb shoulder - (4 lbs) -- boned
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced, plus
  1                     whole clove garlic clove
  2             sprigs  parsley -- chopped, plus
  1                     parsely sprig -- whole
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- cut into strips
  2                     hard-boiled eggs -- cut into 6 pieces
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated caciocavallo or
                        pecorino Romano
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  red wine
  1                     onion -- quartered
  1                     carrot -- cut into 6 pieces
  1                     celery rib -- cut into 6 pieces
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1                cup  canned whole tomatoes with juice -- crushed
  1              pound  ziti
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

Cut open the lamb and pound it out with a meat mallet to 1-inch thickness, or have your butcher do this for you.  Season with salt and pepper on both sides.

In a medium bowl, combine the bread crumbs, chopped garlic, and chopped parsley, and mix well.  Spread this mixture in an even layer over the meat.  Distribute the prosciutto over the meat in an even layer, then place the egg wedges in one line down the center of the meat.  Sprinkle the cheese over the meat in one layer.  Roll the meat up and tie it tightly with butcher's twine.

In a large dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the meat and brown it deeply on all sides.  Add the wine to the pan and let it evaporate.  Add the onion, carrot, celery, whole parsley, garlic clove, and bay leaves and cook 10 minutes more, then add the tomato paste and tomatoes.  Cook, covered, at a simmer over low heat for 2 hours.  Turn the meat once or twice and add more wine or water if necessary to keep it from drying out.  Once the meat is done, remove, and let rest 15 minutes before carving.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Strain the pan juices and return to the roasting pan, discarding the solids.  Bring the juices to a boil over medium-high heat and stir to dislodge browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary, and keep hot.

Cook the ziti in the boiling water according to the package directions, until tender yet al dente.  Drain the pasta and add to the sauce, adding a splash of cooking water if necessary to keep the sauce from getting too "tight".

Serve the pasta in heated pasta bowls, topped with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and serve the sliced lamb alongside or as a second course.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              small  onions -- chopped medium dice
  6             ounces  pancetta or good quality bacon -- cut 1" dice
  1              pound  green peas -- fresh or frozen
     3/4         pound  ground lamb
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     eggs -- beaten
                        Chili flakes -- to taste
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated caciocavallo cheese
     1/2         bunch  fresh parsley leaves -- chopped
  1              piece  leg of lamb - (3 lbs) -- butterflied
     1/2           cup  dry white wine

In a Dutch oven heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add onion and saute until just beginning to soften, about 5 minutes.  Add pancetta and peas and toss.  Add the ground lamb, season with salt and pepper and cook 8 to 10 minutes.  Let cool, add eggs and chili flakes and stir through fat, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.  Once the meat mixture is cool, add the bread crumbs, grated cheese, and parsley.  Stir to blend.

Use the mixture to stuff the leg of lamb, dividing the stuffing evenly throughout the meat flaps created by the butterfly cut.  Use butcher's twine to tie the leg so that none of the stuffing will spill out.  Season with salt and pepper.

Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in the 12-inch saute pan over high heat.  When the oil is hot but not smoking add the stuffed leg to the pan and sear it.  Pour in the white wine and allow it to evaporate.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and cover with the lid.  Lower the heat to medium and allow the leg of lamb to cook until medium, about 45 minutes.  Add water when necessary to keep the leg from sticking to the pan.  Serve hot, drizzled with gravy from the pan.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  orange marmalade
     1/4         pound  bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  anisette
     1/4           cup  very strong espresso
     1/2           cup  almonds -- toasted, and
                        finely ground
  6                     eggs
  6        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
                        more for garnish
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3               cups  dry white wine
  1              pinch  aniseeds
  4               cups  all-purpose flour

In a medium bowl, combine the jam, chocolate, anisette, espresso, and almonds.  Mix well and set aside.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.

In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk and add the sugar, oil, wine, and aniseed.  Mix well, then gradually add the flour and mix and knead to form a smooth, soft dough.  Roll out to the thickness of one finger, and cut into 1-inch lengths about the width of a finger.

Once the water is boiling, add the lengths to the water and boil until they are firm and white.  Remove with a slotted spoon, pat dry and, before the lengths completely dry, use a pastry bag to stuff each one with some of the jam mixture.  Sprinkle with sugar and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk and add the sugar, oil, wine, and aniseed.  Mix well, then gradually add the flour and mix and knead to form a smooth, soft dough.  Roll out to the thickness of one finger, and cut into 1-inch lengths about the width of a finger.

Once the water is boiling, add the lengths to the water and boil until they are firm and white.  Remove with a slotted spoon, pat dry and, before the lengths completely dry, use a pastry bag to stuff each one with some of the jam mixture.  Sprinkle with sugar and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Caciocavallo or
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  12            slices  pork shoulder - (3 oz ea) -- pounded
  12                    Swiss chard leaves
  12            slices  prosciutto
  12                    thin slices smoked mozzarella
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  2        tablespoons  pork fat -- softened
  1                cup  dry white wine

Beat the eggs well in a medium bowl and add the cheese, and salt and pepper, to taste.  In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat a few tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat and add the egg mixture.  Cook over medium-high heat until the eggs are set, then turn out of the pan.  Cut into 12 equal pieces and set aside.

Season each piece of pork with salt and pepper and place one piece of cooked egg in the center of each.  Top the egg with one chard leaf, 1 slice prosciutto, and 1 slice mozzarella.  Roll each piece of pork up tightly and secure with butcher's twine or toothpicks.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven, heat the remaining olive oil over medium heat and add the onion and parsley.  Once the onion is softened, add the pork fat and, once it is liquefied, add the pork rolls.  Brown well on all sides, then stir in the wine and cook at a simmer for 30 minutes.  Serve hot, with the pan juices poured over.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe)
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
     1/4         pound  pancetta -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        = (or good quality bacon)
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/2         pound  parsnips -- peeled, halved,
                        and cut into 1/4" half moons
                        = (omit the thickest part of the ends)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano -- for serving

Roll out the pasta dough to the thinnest setting on a pasta machine.  Cut the dough crosswise into 1/4-inch strips.  Place the tagliatelle on a sheet tray that has been dusted with semolina flour, cover with a clean dish towel, and set aside until ready to use.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, cook the pancetta over high heat until it is browned and the fat has been rendered, about 10 minutes.  Add the butter and parsnips and saute over high heat without shaking the pan too much until they are golden brown and slightly crispy, 5 to 6 minutes.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper, add the parsley, and cook 1 minute longer.

Cook the tagliatelle in the boiling water until tender yet al dente, about 2 minutes.  Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water, and add the pasta to the pan with the pancetta and the parsnips.  Toss over high heat to coat the pasta, adding pasta cooking water if necessary to keep the sauce form getting too tight.  Divide equally among 4 heated pasta bowls, grate Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top of each bowl, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === TORTELLINI ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     1/4         pound  ground veal
     1/4         pound  ground pork shoulder
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- finely diced
     1/4         pound  mortadella -- finely diced
  1                cup  grated caciocavallo or pecorino Romano
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe)

In a large pot, combine the pork rind, trotter, ham bone, and beef shank.  Press the clove into the onion and add to the pot, along with the celery and whole sprigs parsley.  Add 8 cups water and bring to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, until the meat is tender, about 2 hours.  Season with salt, if necessary.

Strain the broth and return to the pot.  Discard the vegetables and retain the meat.  Once the meat is cool enough to handle, strip it from the bones, remove excess cartilage, and return to the pot with the broth to simmer.

Meanwhile, place the beans in a 4-quart pot and cover with water.  Bring to a boil over high heat and cook 10 minutes.  Drain and rinse under cold water, then return the beans to the pot, add the bay leaf, onion, prosciutto bone, and 5 cups water.  Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to low and cook, covered, for about 45 minutes, or until legumes are tender.  Drain the beans and set aside, discarding the water.

In a 10-inch skillet, heat the oil over medium heat and add the garlic, scallions, fennel, chopped parsley, and carrots, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are tender, about 12 minutes.  Drain the tomatoes, reserving the juices, and add the tomatoes to the skillet.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer 10 minutes.  Add the reserved juice to the main stockpot.  Add the favas and peas to the tomato-vegetable mixture, stir, and cook 7 minutes.  Add the herbs, black pepper, and nutmeg, to the tomato-vegetable mixture and cook 20 minutes.  Add the greens and cook an additional 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the tortellini in the boiling water for 4 minutes, then drain, and add to the main stockpot with the tomato vegetable mixture and the chickpeas.  Season with salt and pepper, if necessary, and serve with cheese grated over.

Tortellini:  In a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed, large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and garlic and cook until onion is translucent.  Add the veal and pork shoulder and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the meat is well-browned and begins to release some of its juices.  Remove from the heat and place in a large bowl.

Add the prosciutto and mortadella to the bowl, then add the egg and mix well to combine.  Cook until the mixture firms up and holds its shape when a tablespoon-sized ball is removed from the pan.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool.

Prepare the pasta dough according to the recipe and roll out to the thinnest setting on a pasta-rolling machine.  Cut the pasta dough into 3-inch squares and place a scant tablespoon of the meat mixture in the center of each square.  Bring 2 diagonal corners of each square together, then bring the other 2 corners around together to form the tortellini.  Set aside on damp towels until ready to cook.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a large pot, combine the pork rind, trotter, ham bone, and beef shank.  Press the clove into the onion and add to the pot, along with the celery and whole sprigs parsley.  Add 8 cups water and bring to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, until the meat is tender, about 2 hours.  Season with salt, if necessary.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Strain the broth and return to the pot.  Discard the vegetables and retain the meat.  Once the meat is cool enough to handle, strip it from the bones, remove excess cartilage, and return to the pot with the broth to simmer.

<DirT>
Meanwhile, place the beans in a 4-quart pot and cover with water.  Bring to a boil over high heat and cook 10 minutes.  Drain and rinse under cold water, then return the beans to the pot, add the bay leaf, onion, prosciutto bone, and 5 cups water.  Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to low and cook, covered, for about 45 minutes, or until legumes are tender.  Drain the beans and set aside, discarding the water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 10-inch skillet, heat the oil over medium heat and add the garlic, scallions, fennel, chopped parsley, and carrots, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are tender, about 12 minutes.  Drain the tomatoes, reserving the juices, and add the tomatoes to the skillet.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer 10 minutes.  Add the reserved juice to the main stockpot.  Add the favas and peas to the tomato-vegetable mixture, stir, and cook 7 minutes.  Add the herbs, black pepper, and nutmeg, to the tomato-vegetable mixture and cook 20 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh tuna -- all skin and
                        sinews removed
  3        tablespoons  breadcrumbs
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  grated Pecorino
  1           teaspoon  golden raisins
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Flour -- for coating
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- to fill a deep
                        pot no more than halfway
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1                can  peeled whole tomatoes - (28 oz) -- chopped by hand
     1/2         bunch  fresh parsley -- finely chopped
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        Fennel fronds -- for garnish

Cut tuna into chunks and pass through meat grinder with a medium die.

In a medium-sized bowl, combine with the breadcrumbs, egg, cheese, raisins, and pine nuts.  Combine until the mixture forms a thick homogenous paste.  Lightly salt and pepper.  Using a tablespoon measurement, scoop heaping tablespoons of the tuna mixture and roll between your palms to form round-shaped croquettes.

Fill a deep pan no more than halfway with the olive oil.  Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350 degrees.  The oil should stay at or around this temperature throughout the frying process.  Roll each tuna croquette into the flour to coat, shaking off any excess.  Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower the meatballs into the hot oil and cook until they are a light golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove with the same slotted spoon and leave to drain on a serving platter lined with paper towels.  Season croquettes with salt and pepper while hot.  Repeat until all the tuna has been used.

In a medium saucepan, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat.  Add the garlic and cook until soft and lightly toasted, about 7 to 8 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Use a potato masher to soften and break down the tomatoes.  Add a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and cook tomatoes for about 8 to 10 minutes.  Sprinkle with the chopped parsley and garnish with fennel fronds and some more drizzles of extra-virgin olive oil.  Spoon some sauce on a plate, place a croquette on top and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                        === VARIATION 1 ===
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  capers -- rinsed, drained
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  1                     lemon -- cut into wedges
                        === VARIATION 2 ===
  4                     leaves fresh sage
     1/2           cup  mushrooms -- sliced
     1/2           cup  dry Marsala
                        === VARIATION 3 ===
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  rose wine
                        Freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped parsley
                        Extra-virgin olive oil

For the basic:  In 12-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil over high heat until hot, but not smoking.  While the oil heats, salt and pepper both sides of each veal cutlet.  Dredge through the flour, shaking to remove any excess flour.

Place the floured cutlets in the pan and fry until golden brown on one side, about 5 minutes.  Flip the cutlets over, and pour in the wine.  Continue cooking until almost all of the wine has evaporated and a thick gravy-like sauce has formed.  Garnish veal with chopped parsley and extra-virgin olive oil

For variation number 1:  Prepare the saute pan and the cutlets as described above.  When the pan is hot, add the floured cutlets in 1 layer.  Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Flip the cutlets over, pour in the white wine, and add the capers and lemon zest.  Continue cooking until the wine has evaporated and a thick gravy-like sauce has formed.  Serve hot with lemon wedges.  Garnish veal with chopped parsley and extra-virgin olive oil.

For variation number 2:  Prepare the pan and the veal cutlets as described above.  When the pan is ready, add the sage leaves, pushing them around to infuse the oil with their flavor.  The sage will become lightly fried.  Remove the sage leaves and set them aside for garnish.  Add the mushrooms and saute until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.  Add the floured cutlets and cook until golden brown on one side, about 5 minutes.  Flip the cutlets over, and add the wine.  Continue cooking until the wine has evaporated and a thick gravy-like sauce has formed.  Top with sage leaves.  Garnish veal with chopped parsley and extra-virgin olive oil.

For variation number 3:  Prepare the saute pan and the cutlets as described above.  When the pan is ready, add the cutlets in a single layer.  Cook until golden brown on 1 side, about 5 minutes.  Flip the cutlets over.  Add the Basic Tomato Sauce and the wine.  Continue cooking over high heat until the sauce has reduced some and the cutlets are cooked through, about 7 minutes.  Remove the cutlets to heated dinner plates.  Spoon some of the sauce over the cutlets and top with grated Parmesan, to taste.  Garnish veal with chopped parsley and extra-virgin olive oil.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CONFECTIONERS' CUSTARD ===
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
  8        tablespoons  granulated sugar -- divided, plus
  2          teaspoons  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4                     egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon zest
                        === TARTS ===
     1/2           cup  milk -- plus
  2        tablespoons  milk
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1               cups  granulated sugar
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  pumpkin -- cut 1/4" cubes
  6             ounces  semi-sweet chocolate
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Confectioner's sugar -- for dusting

To make the Custard:  Combine the milk, 6 tablespoons of the sugar, and vanilla in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Stir and slowly bring to a boil.  Set up an ice bath nearby.  While the milk comes to a boil, beat the egg yolks and the remaining sugar in small bowl.  Continue beating until the mixture thickens and the color lightens.  Gradually folding in the flour.  Whisking all the while, add a few drops of the boiling milk to the bowl.  Add all of the egg mixture to the saucepan with the lemon zest, lower the heat to low, and, whisking constantly, cook until the mixture thickens, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool in the ice bath.

To make the Tarts:  In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the milk, flour, sugar, and butter until well combined.  The mixture will form a smooth, fluid dough.  You may need to add a little more milk, a teaspoon at a time.  Form the dough into a ball and let it rest, covered, for 1 hour.

In the meantime, in a medium-sized saucepan, heat the olive oil until hot but not smoking.  Add the pumpkin cubes and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until soft, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

Using a sharp knife, cut the dough into 2 portions, 1 slightly larger than the other.  Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll each dough portion out into a circle, about 1/8-inch thick.  Again, 1 portion will be larger than the other.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Break the chocolate into little pieces.  Place the chocolate in a bowl with the cooled pumpkin, and the confectioners custard.  Stir until well combined.  Place 1 tablespoon of the mixture at regular intervals (about 2-inches apart) on the smaller dough round.  Using a pastry brush, brush the same pastry with the beaten egg, covering all the pastry that remains uncovered by the pumpkin mixture.

Lay the other pastry round on top of the first and use your fingers to crimp and seal the edges.  Using a small, round cookie cutter (preferably one that is scalloped), cut around the mounds of fillings to create individual filled tarts.  Use your fingers again to lightly seal each individual tart.  Brush the tops of the tarts with the beaten egg mixture.

Bake on a cookie sheet in a preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.  When the pastries are cooked and cooled, cover them with confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields about 8 tarts.
