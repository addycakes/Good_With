Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     egg
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  flaked coconut
     3/4           cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  grated orange rind
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Shortening -- as needed
                        Orange Syrup -- (see recipe)

In a medium mixing bowl, beat egg until fluffy.  Add remaining ingredients, except shortening, and beat just until smooth.  For thinner pancakes, stir in additional 1 to 2 tablespoons milk.

Heat griddle or skillet over medium heat or to 375 degrees.  Grease griddle with shortening, if necessary.  Griddle is ready when a few drops of water bubble and skitter rapidly around.

For each pancake, pour scant 1/4 cup batter onto hot griddle.  Cook pancakes until puffed and dry around edges.  Turn and cook other sides until golden brown.

This recipe yields about nine 4-inch pancakes.  Recipe can be doubled.

Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     eggs -- separated
  3        tablespoons  sour cream
  1                     apple -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     3/4           cup  maple syrup

Combine egg yolks, sour cream, apple, flour, baking powder and cinnamon; stir well.

Beat egg whites with an electric mixer until peaks form; fold into yolk mixture.

Drop batter by 1/4 cup onto a hot, lightly greased griddle.  Cook until golden brown, turning once.  Serve with maple syrup.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A bit of sour cream in the batter makes these pancakes a bit less sweet than most, which might make them a hit at your house.  Try them with powdered sugar, sliced bananas or your favorite jam in place of the maple syrup.

Description:
  "These delicious apple-flavored flapjacks would serve well as either a

  chicken."

  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  apples -- peeled, chopped fine
     1/2           cup  pecans -- chopped

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BLINI ===
  1 1/2           cups  2% milk
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1             packet  active dry yeast
     3/4           cup  buckwheat flour
     1/2           cup  flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  2                     eggs
  4        tablespoons  butter -- divided
                        = SMOKED SALMON AND SOUR CREAM DRESSING =
  1                cup  flaked smoked salmon
  3        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated orange peel
  1                cup  sour cream
     1/4           cup  chopped celery
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onion
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill or parsley

To prepare Blini (buckwheat pancakes):  Combine milk and butter in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave on High in 1-minute increments until butter is melted, stirring between each minute.  Cool to warm (110 degrees).

Sprinkle yeast over surface of milk and let stand about 5 minutes to dissolve yeast.  In separate mixing bowl, combine flours, sugar and salt.  Pour milk mixture over dry ingredients and mix until just combined.  Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place for about an hour or until the mixture is bubbly and has expanded by about a third.  (At this point, resulting batter can be refrigerated overnight and recipe completed the following day.)

Add eggs to batter, stirring to deflate bubbles made by yeast.  Heat heavy skillet over high heat; reduce heat to medium-high.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in skillet; drop small spoonfuls of batter to form small pancakes into skillet.  Cook until the edges look a bit dry and small bubbles form at the surface of the pancakes.  Flip to cook other side; remove from skillet when second side is browned.  Stack on wire rack to cool.  Repeat with remaining batter until done.

To prepare Smoked Salmon and Sour Cream Dressing:  In a small bowl, combine salmon, orange juice and peel; set aside.

In separate bowl, combine sour cream, celery, green onion, salt and pepper; set aside.

To assemble:  Top each blini (pancake) with a dollop of sour cream dressing; place about a tablespoon of salmon mixture on top of dressing and sprinkle with dill and additional pepper if desired.

Repeat with remaining ingredients.  Arrange on serving platter garnished with extra dill sprigs.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 30 blini.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  buttermilk
  2                     eggs
     1/4           cup  butter -- melted

  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  fresh or frozen blueberries
  2        tablespoons  butter

In a medium bowl, whisk buttermilk and eggs until thoroughly combined.  Continue whisking while drizzling in 1/4 cup melted butter.  Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a small bowl.  Stir into wet ingredients, stirring just enough to combine (add water to thin if necessary).  Fold in blueberries.

Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Drop a scant 1/4 cup batter into skillet for each pancake.  When pancakes start to bubble and pop, flip pancakes over and cook on second side until golden brown.  Continue until batter is used up.

Serve with blueberry or maple syrup, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2                     eggs
  2               cups  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  butter -- melted
     1/4           cup  raisins
     1/4           cup  sliced hulled rinsed strawberries

In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

In another bowl, lightly beat the eggs, buttermilk, milk, and melted butter.  Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients all at once, stirring just to blend; the batter should be slightly lumpy.

Heat a lightly oiled griddle or heavy skillet over medium-high heat (375 degrees on an electric griddle).  Pour enough batter onto the griddle to make a normal-sized pancake (about 1/4 cup); immediately ladle 2 more tiny circles of batter so that they attach themselves to the first pancake to make mouse ears.

When bubbles cover the surface of the pancakes and their undersides are lightly browned, turn them over and cook about 2 minutes more, until the other sides are browned.  Before serving, place raisins on each pancake to make the eyes and nose and a strawberry slice for the mouth.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  eggs
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3          teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/3           cups  milk
  2             sticks  butter - (16 tbspns) -- divided
                        Cinnamon-sugar
                        Juice of 1 fresh lemon
                        Loganberry, raspberry or boysenberry jam

Beat the eggs until light and frothy.  Add flour, salt, sugar and milk.  Beat for 5 minutes more.  The batter will be thin, but very smooth and creamy.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in 10-inch skillet for each pancake.  Heat until pan is very hot, but don't allow butter to burn.  Ladle in enough batter with one hand so that, with the other hand holding the skillet handle and rotating the skillet, there is just enough batter to cover the bottom and slightly up the sides of the pan, without a lot of excess.  This will produce a giant, crepe-like pancake.

Check the cake by gently lifting the edge with a spatula.  When it is nicely browned, turn the cake.  The second side will brown quickly.

Place the pancake onto a warm plate, sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar then lemon juice, then spread with jam.  Roll up as for a jellyroll, sprinkle again with cinnamon-sugar, cut into two pieces, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    eggs
     1/2           cup  milk
  12            slices  bread
     1/4           cup  butter

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.

In medium bowl, beat together eggs and milk until well blended.  Pour half of the egg mixture into a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan.  Place 6 of the bread slices in the egg mixture.  Turn slices and let stand until egg mixture is absorbed.  Place on heavily buttered baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining egg mixture and bread slices.

Bake for 6 minutes.  Turn slices.  Spread with butter, if desired.  Continue baking until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Serve immediately or freeze for later use.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

To Freeze:  Cool toast slices on wire rack.  Return to baking sheets.  Freeze in single layer 1 to 2 hours.  Wrap in individual-serving portions or stack slices and wrap.  Return to freezer.  Store up to 1 month.

To Serve Frozen Toast:  Reheat single servings in toaster or place unwrapped slices on ungreased baking sheets and bake in preheated 375 degree oven until hot, about 8 to 10 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     onion -- peeled, chopped
  6                     parsley sprigs -- chopped
  8                     potatoes -- peeled, shredded
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  4                     egg yolks -- beaten
     2/3           cup  flour
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon -- (optional)
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     egg whites -- beat until
                        soft peaks form

Working quickly so potatoes don't turn brown from the air, put onion, parsley and potatoes into a large strainer or colander.  With your hands, squeeze the liquid from the mixture.

Transfer mixture to a bowl.  Add lemon juice and mix with a fork.  Add egg yolks, oil, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and pepper; stir to blend.  Quickly fold in egg whites.
