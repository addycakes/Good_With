  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    oxtails
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  ancho chile powder
     1/4           cup  salt

  2                     fennel bulbs -- chopped
     1/2                celery stalk -- chopped
  1              large  carrot -- chopped
  10                    garlic cloves
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  4                     lemon grass stalks, white part only -- pounded, minced
  2               cups  red wine
  1                can  Roma tomatoes - (8 oz) -- drained
     1/2           cup  dark soy sauce
     1/2         bunch  fresh thyme
  2                     bay leaves
                        Water -- to cover oxtails
                        === PRESERVED LEMON POLENTA ===
  3               cups  polenta
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
     1/2           cup  finely-diced preserved lemons
  3               cups  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  butter

Mix flour, chile, salt and pepper and coat oxtails well.  In a hot stock pot, coat bottom with oil and sear oxtails until all sides are browned.  Pull out oxtails and wipe out stock pot. 
Saute onions, fennel, celery, carrots, garlic, ginger and lemon grass.  Deglaze with wine and reduce.  Add tomatoes, soy, thyme and bay.  Add water to completely cover meat.  Check for seasoning; the broth should taste well seasoned.  Bring to boil then simmer on low heat for 3 hours.  The meat should fall off of the bone. 
Remove oxtails and reduce sauce by 20 percent.  Using a hand blender, puree sauce.  Check for seasoning.  Serve on top of polenta. 
For the Preserved Lemon Polenta:  In a saucepan, saute shallots and ginger in 1 tablespoon of butter.  Add polenta, lemons, stock, salt, pepper and butter.  Check for seasoning.  Stir well and cover tightly.  Bake in 400 degree oven for 1 hour.  A crust will form.  Break through crust for polenta.

                        === GINGERED YAMS ===
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger
  4             medium  yams -- peeled, quartered
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  2             ounces  butter - (to 4 oz)

                        === FIVE SPICE APPLES ===
                        Canola oil -- for cooking
  1              small  red onion -- diced
     1/2    tablespoon  five spice powder
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  2                     Granny Smith apples - peeled, diced
  8             ounces  apple juice
  1         tablespoon  butter -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CHILE OIL ===
     1/2           cup  ground red chile - (ancho, chimayo
                        or pasilla)
     1/2    tablespoon  ground cumin
  3               cups  canola oil
  1           teaspoon  salt

Toast both peppercorns and anise until fragrant in a saute pan.  Mix everything together and taste.  The liquid should be tasty, but not overly salty.  Place pork in brine overnight.  After brining, thoroughly rinse pork in cold water.  Season the pork with black pepper and saute in well-oiled pan.  Color both sides then place in a 375 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes.  The middle of the pork should get hot.  Note: even when fully cooked, the meat will remain pink because of the brining process.  Let loin rest for 10 minutes then slice. 
Place pork around a mound of yams.  Garnish with apples, chive batons and chile oil.  Optional garnish for the adventuresome would be fried yam chips. 
For the Gingered Yams:  Place cream and ginger in saucepan and on low heat, reduce the cream to 1 cup.  In another saucepan, place yams and garlic and completely cover with cold water.  Place on stove at medium heat and slowly boil.  Cook about 20 to 30 minutes or until yams can be pierced with a paring knife then easily fall off of the knife.  Strain well and place in food processor.  Puree and add cream, butter, salt and pepper.  Check for seasoning.  Keep warm for serving. 
For the Five Spice Apples:  In a saute pan, coat with oil and caramelize onions.  Add five spice, sugar and apples.  Deglaze with juice and season.  Let mixture cook and reduce by 50 percent.  The apples should remain intact and have some liquid left.  Stir in the butter.  Check for seasoning.  Do not overcook apples to mash.  This can be done in advance and reheated for plating. 
For the Chile Oil:  Heat chile and cumin in a saute pan until barely smoking.  Whisk in oil.  Transfer to a tall, glass jar and let stand overnight.  Oil will separate.  Will keep for 3 months in the refrigerator. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Toast both peppercorns and anise until fragrant in a saute pan.  Mix everything together and taste.  The liquid should be tasty, but not overly salty.  Place pork in brine overnight.  After brining, thoroughly rinse pork in cold water.  Season the pork with black pepper and saute in well-oiled pan.  Color both sides then place in a 375 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes.  The middle of the pork should get hot.  Note: even when fully cooked, the meat will remain pink because of the brining process.  Let loin rest for 10 minutes then slice. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place pork around a mound of yams.  Garnish with apples, chive batons and chile oil.  Optional garnish for the adventuresome would be fried yam chips. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Gingered Yams:  Place cream and ginger in saucepan and on low heat, reduce the cream to 1 cup.  In another saucepan, place yams and garlic and completely cover with cold water.  Place on stove at medium heat and slowly boil.  Cook about 20 to 30 minutes or until yams can be pierced with a paring knife then easily fall off of the knife.  Strain well and place in food processor.  Puree and add cream, butter, salt and pepper.  Check for seasoning.  Keep warm for serving. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Five Spice Apples:  In a saute pan, coat with oil and caramelize onions.  Add five spice, sugar and apples.  Deglaze with juice and season.  Let mixture cook and reduce by 50 percent.  The apples should remain intact and have some liquid left.  Stir in the butter.  Check for seasoning.  Do not overcook apples to mash.  This can be done in advance and reheated for plating. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Chile Oil:  Heat chile and cumin in a saute pan until barely smoking.  Whisk in oil.  Transfer to a tall, glass jar and let stand overnight.  Oil will separate.  Will keep for 3 months in the refrigerator.

                    Asian Gazpacho With Scallop Satays

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Scallops

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  cucumbers -- peeled, seeded
  1                can  whole Roma tomatoes with juice - (8 oz)
                        (or super-ripe fresh Roma tomatoes,
                        peeled)
  1             medium  red onion -- chopped
  5                     garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger
  3                     serrano chilies -- stems removed
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
     1/4           cup  canola oil
     1/4           cup  thin soy sauce
     1/8           cup  rice wine vinegar
                        Juice of 2 limes
  2        tablespoons  sambal
     1/2         bunch  cilantro
     1/2         bunch  mint
     1/2         bunch  basil
  1         tablespoon  ground coriander
                        Salt-- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  sliced scallions -- for garnish
                        === SCALLOP SATAYS ===
  6             ounces  bay scallops - (abt 5 scallops per skewer)
  1                cup  Asian Gazpacho -- (see above)

Using a food processor or a blender, completely puree all the vegetables, in batches.  Add the oils, soy sauce, vinegar, lime juice and sambal.  Blend and season with salt and pepper.  Add the herbs and ground coriander, blend and taste for seasoning again.  A little sugar can be added if it tastes too tart.  Ideally, this should be made a day in advance so the flavors have time to meld together and develop. 
For Satays:  If using wooden skewers, be sure to soak the skewers in water for 30 minutes before grilling. 
Variation #1:  Marinate the scallops in the gazpacho for 30 minutes.  Brush the scallops with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill satays over medium heat, for 4 to 5 minutes, turning occasionally, until done. 
Variation #2:  Make a "ceviche satay" by marinating the satays in one cup of gazpacho for 2 to 3 hours, depending on scallop size.  The acid in the gazpacho will "cook" the scallops.  Throw away the used marinade. 
Serve gazpacho very cold in chilled bowls and garnish with scallop satay and chopped scallions. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Prepare a medium-hot oiled grill.  Season the shrimp and then dip in the BBQ sauce and place on grill.  Watch carefully and have a spray bottle of water handy to squelch flare-ups.  Rotate and turn the shrimp often and brush with additional BBQ sauce.  They will take about 8 minutes. 
For the Grilled Vegetable Slaw:  In a large bowl, toss all of the vegetables with the olive oil and season.  Place the vegetables on a hot, oiled grill and mark/cook the vegetables all the way through.  Slice the vegetables on an angle into 1/4-inch strips.  Toss the vegetables with the juice and season. 
For the Roasted Potatoes:  In a large bowl, toss everything together.  Wrap in a double thick foil "papillote."  Place on the grill, preferably on indirect heat.  Cook for 45 minutes.  Check for doneness and seasoning. 
For Plating:  On a large platter, pile the potatoes in the middle and surround with the slaw.  Place BBQ on top and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Drink Suggestion:  Shanghai Beer

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  3             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- roughly chopped
  3 1/2         ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- roughly chopped
  9        tablespoons  butter -- cubed
  3              large  eggs -- at room temperature
                        === SAUCE ===
  3             ounces  bittersweet chocolate
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Cocoa powder -- for garnish
                        Chocolate curls -- for garnish
                        === CREAM ===
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  toasted almonds
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

To make the cake, preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  In a medium saucepan, combine the 1/2 cup of sugar with 1/3 cup water and bring to a boil, stirring, over high heat.  Meanwhile, combine the chocolates and the butter in a medium bowl.  When the sugar mixture boils, pour it over the chocolates and stir until blended.  Set aside. 
In a mixing bowl, combine the 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar and the eggs.  Using a mixer set at high speed, whip the eggs and sugar until the mixture falls back onto itself in a slowly dissolving ribbon-like pattern when the beater is lifted.  Add 1/3 of the egg mixture to the chocolate mixture and fold in with a spatula to lighten.  Fold in the remaining egg mixture. 
Bring a kettle of water to a boil.  Spray 6 (6-ounce) ramekins or 6 (2- by 3-inch) loaf pans with nonstick cooking spray and place them in a roasting pan just large enough to hold them.  Divide the batter among the ramekins, place the roasting pan in the oven, and add enough water to the pan to come three-quarters of the way up the sides of the ramekins.  Bake until a cake tester inserted in the middle of the cakes comes out with just a few crumbs sticking to it, about 30 minutes.  Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. 
For the Sauce:  In a small saucepan, combine the chocolate and cream and heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until the chocolate is melted.  Cool for at least 30 minutes. 
For the Cream:  Bring cream and almonds to a boil and store refrigerated for 24 hours.  Strain, add vanilla and whip. 
For Plating:   Dust plates with cocoa.  Invert the ramekins onto the plates and add a scoop of the almond cream to each.  Drizzle the chocolate over the cake and cream, sprinkle with chocolate curls, if using, and serve. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

            Boiled Garlic Chive Dumplings In Cold Water Dough

Recipe By     :Iris Lee Tsai
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VEGETARIAN DUMPLING FILLING ===
  2            bunches  garlic chives -- finely chopped
                        (regular chives can be substituted)
  2           packages  mung bean noodles - 1 1/3 oz ea) -- soaked soft,
                        and cut into 1/2" strands
  1                cup  re-hydrated black mushrooms -- stemmed, and
                        finely diced
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  thin soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  sesame oil
     1/2    tablespoon  salt
  1                     egg
                        === COLD WATER DOUGH ===
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  cold water
                        === SPICY SOY DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  thin soy sauce
     1/3           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  sliced scallions
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  sambal

In a large bowl thoroughly mix all filling ingredients together by hand.  Cook a tester to check for seasoning. 
For the Cold Water Dough:  In a stainless steel bowl, mix flour and salt.  Slowly add cold water to flour in 1/4-cup increments.  Mix with chopsticks until a ball is formed.  On a floured surface, knead dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball.  Place back in bowl and cover with a damp cloth.  Allow dough to rest for at least 1 hour. 
Working on a floured surface with floured hands, roll out dough to form a long 'noodle', 1-inch in diameter.  Cut 1/2-inch pieces and turn them over so cut sides are facing up.  Flatten with your palm and roll out thin using a rolling pin.  The dumpling wrapper should end up about 3 inches in diameter. 
Making The Dumplings:  Place a small mound of filling in the middle of the wrapper.  (Be very careful not to touch the edges with the filling, as this will impede proper sealing of the dumplings.  Nothing is worse than dumplings breaking during cooking.)  Fold the wrapper in half to form a half moon shape.  Starting on one end fold/pinch the wrapper tightly together.  Proceed with this fold/pinch method until the dumpling is completely sealed.  There will be approximately 10 to 14 folds per dumpling.  Rest the dumplings with the folded edges straight up. 
Cooking The Dumplings:  Use a large stock pot with plenty of water.  Add a small handful of salt, as if you were cooking pasta.  Make sure the water is at a rolling boil before adding dumplings.  Once the dumplings are dropped, gently stir so that they do not stick together or stick to the bottom.  Do not try to boil too many at a time, as it will take too long to cook resulting in soggy dumplings.  Overcooking also causes the dumplings to break apart. 
For the Spicy Soy Dipping Sauce:  Combine all and serve in a small bowl. 
For Plating:  Serve dumplings on a large platter lined with lettuce with a bowl of dipping sauce on the side.  One family tradition is the serving of the dumpling 'broth' at the end of the meal since inevitably some of the dumplings do break and flavor the water.  Waste not, want not. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  fresh chicken livers
  5                     egg yolks
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  chopped shiitake mushrooms -- sauteed with
  1           teaspoon  minced shallots
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives
     1/2           cup  edamames
  1         tablespoon  white truffle oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === EDAMAME SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  1             medium  yellow onion -- roughly chopped
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2               cups  chicken stock or low-sodium canned
  1                cup  edamames
  1                cup  spinach leaves
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cold and in pieces
                        Juice of 1 lemon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Set up a steamer.  Place livers and eggs in a food processor.  Mix and add the cream while moving.  Season.  Pour mix into a large mixing bowl.  Fold in mushrooms, chives, edamames and truffle oil.  Cook a little bit in the microwave to check seasoning.  Ladle mix into rice bowls.  Place in the steamer for 25 to 30 minutes or until custards are set. 
For the Edamame Sauce:  In a hot sauce pan, coat with oil and soften onions and garlic, about 3 minutes.  Season.  Add chicken stock and bring to a boil.  The stock should taste salty, like pasta blanching water.  Add the edamames and cook until soft, about 15 minutes.  Do not over cook for they will darken.  Check often.  During the last minute, add the spinach.  Immediately transfer to a blender and blend at high speed.  Add the butter, blend and check for seasoning.  Mix in the juice and reserve hot. 
For Plating:  Place bowl on doiled plate.  Ladle sauce on top of hot flan to completely cover.  Drizzle with a little truffle oil. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

          Creamless Fresh Pea Soup With Truffled Snow Pea Salad

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  2             medium  yellow onions -- roughly chopped
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  3               cups  chicken stock or low-sodium, canned
  3               cups  shucked English peas
  1                cup  spinach leaves
  4        tablespoons  butter -- cold and in pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === TRUFFLED SNOW PEA SALAD ===
  1                     lime -- juiced
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  1         tablespoon  truffle oil
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  blanched, stringed snow peas,
                        sliced lengthwise 1/8"
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a hot saucepan, coat with oil and brown onions and garlic, about 5 minutes.  Season.  Add chicken stock and bring to a boil.  The stock should taste salty, like pasta blanching water.  Add the peas and cook until soft, about 5 to 8 minutes.  Do not over-cook for they will darken.  Check peas often.  During the last minute, add the spinach.  Immediately blend using a hand blender and when pureed, add the butter and blend well.  Check for seasoning. 
For the Truffled Snow Pea Salad:  In a bowl, whisk together juices and oils.  Season with salt and pepper and check for seasoning.  Toss well with snow peas. 
For Plating:  Pre-heat the soup plates and ladle in the soup.  Top with the salad and drizzle a little bit of truffle oil. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  lamb shanks - (8" to 10" long)
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  madras curry powder
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
     1/4           cup  coarsely-ground fennel
     1/4           cup  coarsely-ground coriander
                        Canola oil -- for cooking
  2                     onions -- chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
  2              large  carrots -- chopped
     1/4           cup  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  minced ginger
  1             bottle  red wine
     1/4         bunch  fresh thyme -- picked, and
                        roughly chopped
  1                cup  dark soy sauce
  1                     banana
  6                     kaffir lime leaves
  3                     Thai bird chilies
                        Water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === THREE ONION COUSCOUS ===
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  1                     yellow onion -- finely diced
  1              bunch  scallions -- chopped
                        (save green part for garnishing)
  1                     red onion -- finely diced
  2        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
     1/3           cup  dried currants
  3               cups  couscous
  6               cups  boiling water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Season the shanks well with salt and pepper.  Mix flour with curry, chili, fennel, and coriander.  Completely coat shanks in mix. 
In a hot casserole lightly coated with canola oil, sear shanks and color on all sides.  Set shanks aside and wipe out casserole.  Saute onions, celery, carrots, garlic and ginger until soft.  Season with salt and pepper.  Deglaze casserole with red wine and reduce by half.  Stir in thyme.  Add soy sauce, banana, kaffir lime and chilies.  Add shanks and completely cover with water.  Check for seasoning.  Slowly bring to a boil then cover tightly with foil or lid. 
Roast in a 325 degree oven (at a simmer) for at least 3 hours.  The meat should fall off of the bone.  Remove shanks and reduce sauce until thickened slightly.  Remove kaffir lime leaves and puree sauce using a hand blender.  Check again for seasoning. 
For the Three Onion Couscous:  In a hot saute pan, add canola oil and caramelize onions with the scallions.  Season.  Remove to a large bowl.  Add olive oil, currants and couscous.  Boil water and add exactly 6 cups to bowl and quickly stir together.  Immediately cover bowl with plastic wrap.  Let stand 30 minutes.  With a fork, fluff couscous and check for seasoning. 
For Plating:  In a large pasta bowl, place a small mound of couscous and top with shanks.  Ladle sauce on shanks and garnish with chopped green scallions. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a hot casserole lightly coated with canola oil, sear shanks and color on all sides.  Set shanks aside and wipe out casserole.  Saute onions, celery, carrots, garlic and ginger until soft.  Season with salt and pepper.  Deglaze casserole with red wine and reduce by half.  Stir in thyme.  Add soy sauce, banana, kaffir lime and chilies.  Add shanks and completely cover with water.  Check for seasoning.  Slowly bring to a boil then cover tightly with foil or lid.

Roast in a 325 degree oven (at a simmer) for at least 3 hours.  The meat should fall off of the bone.  Remove shanks and reduce sauce until thickened slightly.  Remove kaffir lime leaves and puree sauce using a hand blender.  Check again for seasoning.

For the Three Onion Couscous:  In a hot saute pan, add canola oil and caramelize onions with the scallions.  Season.  Remove to a large bowl.  Add olive oil, currants and couscous.  Boil water and add exactly 6 cups to bowl and quickly stir together.  Immediately cover bowl with plastic wrap.  Let stand 30 minutes.  With a fork, fluff couscous and check for seasoning. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Plating:  In a large pasta bowl, place a small mound of couscous and top with shanks.  Ladle sauce on shanks and garnish with chopped green scallions.

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  leftover gratin -- mashed, see * Note
     1/2    tablespoon  madras curry powder
     1/2           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1                cup  chopped leftover steak -- see * Note
     1/2           cup  shredded Gruyere cheese
  2                     to 4 individually-sized round baking
                        crocks
                        === MUSTARD SALAD ===
  1         tablespoon  pommery mustard
  1         tablespoon  rice wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  mustard oil -- (see below)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  mesclun mix
                        === MUSTARD OIL ===
  2        tablespoons  dry mustard powder
  1           teaspoon  turmeric
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Water -- to make a paste
  2               cups  canola oil

* Note:  See the "Grilled Peppered New York Strip With Shallot-Pommery Sauce And Spinach-Shiitake-Potato Gratin" recipe which is included in this collection. 
Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees.  In a large bowl, mix the mashed gratin with the curry powder and parsley.  Fill crock 1/3 full with curried mash.  Top with chopped steak, then top again with mash.  Sprinkle on cheese and bake for 25 to 30 minutes until bubbling hot.  If top is not golden brown, switch oven to broiler and color the tops. 
For the Mustard Salad:  In a bowl, mix mustard, vinegar and sugar.  Whisk in the oil.  Season.  Toss lightly with mesclun. 
For The Mustard Oil:  In a bowl, whisk mustard, turmeric and salt with water to form a paste.  Whisk in oil and let stand overnight.  Mixture will separate, don't remix before using, you want to use the clear flavored oil off the top. 
Place crock on one side of an oval plate, the salad on the other. 
This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings (depending on amount of leftovers).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    quail eggs
  1         tablespoon  rice wine vinegar
                        Water
                        === SPICED BISCUITS ===
  2 3/4            cup  bread flour
  2 3/4            cup  cake flour
     1/2   tablespoons  salt
     3/8           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ancho chile powder
  4        tablespoons  baking powder
     1/2    tablespoon  minced fresh thyme
                        Zest of above lemon -- minced
     1/2           cup  chilled butter - (4 oz)
  2                     whole eggs
  12            ounces  buttermilk - (place eggs in pint cup
                        and top fill with milk to the top)
                        === LEMONGRASS-CRAB-FENNEL SALAD ===
  2                     lemongrass stalks, white part only -- finely minced
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     scallions -- cut 1/16" slices,
                        green and white parts separated
                        Juice of 1 lemon
     1/2    tablespoon  coarsely-ground toasted coriander
  1              large  fennel head -- de-cored, and
                        shaved paper thin
     1/2         pound  fresh crab leg meat -- picked over
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

In a 2-quart sauce pan filled 2/3 of water add vinegar and bring to a boil.  On a simmer, open eggs into the water and try to gather the whites around the yolks.  Cook only briefly, 1 to 2 minutes, should keep the eggs runny. 
For the Spiced Biscuits:  In a food processor, combine all dry ingredients, thyme and zest.  Add chilled butter and pulse to small pieces.  Add egg-milk mixture and incorporate.  Do not over mix.  Remove from processor and roll out on a floured surface.  Using a 2-inch round pastry cutter, make circles and bake on parchment paper at 350 degrees for 12 to 14 minutes until golden brown.  A tester should come out cleanly.  (Makes 12 biscuits, 2 per serving) 
For the Lemongrass-Crab-Fennel Salad:  In a small saute pan on medium heat, add 1 tablespoon oil and saute lemongrass and scallion whites until soft, about 4 minutes.  Season and set aside.  In a bowl, whisk together juice, coriander, scallion greens and remaining oil.  Add lemongrass and check for seasoning.  In another bowl, mix crab and fennel.  Add 2/3 of the vinaigrette and toss to coat.  Check for seasoning. 
For Plating:  Cut the biscuits in half.  Lay a little salad down to prevent sliding and place the bottom half on the salad.  Top with small mound of salad the top with egg.  Drizzle on vinaigrette and rest top of biscuit against the mound. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Beverage Suggestion:  Jasmine Tea, Black Coffee, Fresh Orange Juice

Mix warm water with sugar to dissolve.  Add yeast and let stand for 10 minutes.  Mixture should get foamy or the yeast is dead.  Mix in lard. 
In a food processor, add flour and yeast mixture.  While blade is spinning, pour in water until a ball forms.  If dough is too sticky, add more flour.  If dough appears dry and doesn't form a ball, add more water. 
As soon as a ball forms, take dough out and knead by hand on a floured surface.  Roll dough into one long log about 2 inches thick.  Cut into 2-inch pieces. 
For the Filling:  In a hot saute pan coated with canola oil caramelize the shallots.  Season.  Add the cremini mushrooms and cook for one minute.  Add the remaining mushrooms and thyme.  Check for seasoning.  Deglaze with red wine.  Let reduce by 75 percent, then add the demi-glace and reduce until dry.  Cool mixture before stuffing the buns. 
Form small circles (1 1/2 inches in diameter) with the dough and place mushroom mixture in the middle.  Encircle stuffing with the dough and seal with a little twist.  Let rest in a warm place for 30 minutes.  Fry at 350 degrees until golden brown.

     1/4           cup  sesame seed oil
  1                cup  chopped scallions
     1/3           cup  chopped cilantro
  3             pounds  hanger steak -- sinew removed
                        Sliced green scallions -- for garnish
                        Fried shallots -- for garnish, (optional)
                        Sesame Fried Rice -- see * Note
                        Cucumber Kimchee -- see * Note
                        === GOCHU-JAN SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  marinade from above
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Juice of 1 lemon

* Note:  See the "Sesame Fried Rice" and "Cucumber Kimchee" recipes which are included in this collection. 
In a food processor, add chile paste, garlic, ginger, vinegar, sugar, soy and black pepper.  Blend well than drizzle in the oils.  While still running, add the scallions and cilantro.  Check for seasoning.  It should not be salty since salt is added right before grilling.  Remove 1/2 cup of the marinade and reserve for sauce. 
In a dish, completely coat the hanger with remaining marinade and let marinate overnight.  On a hot, oiled grill, season hanger with salt and grill, about 8 minutes for medium-rare. 
For the Gochu-Jan Sauce:  Mix all ingredients in a bowl. 
For Plating:  On a large white plate, zig-zag the sauce. Place small mound of Sesame Fried Rice and top with hanger steak sliced in half, on the bias.  Place Cucumber Kimchee on top and garnish with sesame seeds, scallions and fried shallots. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry
                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  pommery mustard
  1                cup  red wine
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground coriander
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/2    tablespoon  salt
  1                     skinless turkey breast
                        === 3 PEA FRIED RICE ===
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  4               cups  cooked long-grain rice -- usually day old
  3                     eggs -- scrambled
  2        tablespoons  chive batons
  1                cup  English peas -- blanched
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  snow peas -- blanched
  1                cup  snap peas -- blanched
                        === CITRUS VINAIGRETTE ===
                        Juice of 1 lemon
                        Juice of 1 lime
                        Juice of 1 orange
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Make marinade in a large bowl.  Check for seasoning.  Marinate turkey breast for at least 6 hours or overnight.  (One can speed up the marination process by slicing the breast into 4 to 6 long, thin slices.) 
Season the marinated breast and grill on low grill heat, 20 to 25 minutes.  If it is a large breast, butterfly it so that it will cook through; if necessary, finish in a 350 degree oven.  Let rest for 15 minutes before slicing. 
For 3 Pea Fried Rice:  In a wok, coat with canola oil and add garlic and ginger.  Cook until soft and add rice.  Mix well then add eggs, chives and English peas.  Heat thoroughly. 
Check for seasoning.  Toss snow and snap peas with Citrus Vinaigrette.  Check for seasoning. 
For Citrus Vinaigrette:  Mix all ingredients well. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Grilled Peppered New York Strip  With Shallot-Pommery Sauce And Spinach-Shiitake-Potato Gratin

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     prime sirloin strips - (8 oz ea) -- also called NY strips
                        Five-peppercorn mix - (3 black; 2 white;
                        1 green; 1 pink; 1/2 Szechwan) -- coarsely cracked
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === SHALLOT-POMMERY SAUCE ===
  5                     shallots -- sliced
     1/2           cup  red wine
  2        tablespoons  pommery whole grain mustard
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  4             ounces  butter -- hard
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SPINACH-SHIITAKE-POTATO GRATIN ===
  6              large  russet potatoes peeled, and
                        sliced 1/4" thick
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1              pound  spinach leaves -- de-stemmed
  2               cups  sliced shiitake mushrooms -- sauteed in oil
  1              quart  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CRISPY ONIONS ===
  1              large  red onion -- thinly sliced
  2               cups  rice flour
                        Canola oil -- for frying
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === MUSTARD OIL ===
  2        tablespoons  dry mustard powder
  1           teaspoon  turmeric
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Water -- to make a paste
  2               cups  canola oil

Season the steaks liberally with salt and 5-peppercorn mix. On a hot grill, mark the steaks and cook each side about 4 to 5 minutes. I prefer medium rare, which takes about 8 minutes total. Make sure to let the steaks rest after grilling for about 3 minutes to let the meat relax.  
For the Shallot-Pommery Sauce:  In a 1-quart stainless steel saucepan, add 1 tablespoon of butter and caramelize the shallots.  Season.  Add the red wine and reduce until almost dry.  Add the mustard and saute for 2 minutes then add the cream.  Heat the cream until hot, but not boiling.  Pour into a blender and blend at high speed.  Add the remaining butter and check for seasoning.  Keep warm in a water bath. 
For the Spinach-Shiitake-Potato Gratin Dauphinoise:  Pre-heat the oven to 325 degrees.  In a large bowl, mix everything together.  Taste the cream for proper seasoning.  Dump contents in a baking dish with at least a 2-inch lip.  Make sure the cream covers the mixture.  Bake in oven for 30 minutes, then stir well.  Bake another 45 minutes until cream is thickened and potatoes are soft. 
For the Crispy Onions:  Completely coat the onions in flour and deep fry at 350 degrees until golden brown.  Lightly sprinkle salt. 
For The Mustard Oil:  In a bowl, whisk mustard, turmeric and salt with water to form a paste.  Whisk in oil and let stand overnight.  Mixture will separate, don't remix before using, you want to use the clear flavored oil off the top. 
Plating:  Cut the gratin with a ring mold and place in the center of a plate.  Spoon shallot-pommery sauce around the gratin.  Slice the steak and encircle the gratin.  Garnish with crispy onions and mustard oil. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

For The Mustard Oil:  In a bowl, whisk mustard, turmeric and salt with water to form a paste.  Whisk in oil and let stand overnight.  Mixture will separate, don&apos;t remix before using, you want to use the clear flavored oil off the top.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAKE MARINATED BASS ===
     1/2           cup  sake
     1/4           cup  canola oil
  2        tablespoons  thin soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  4             pieces  Chilean sea bass - (6 oz ea)
                        === SPICY CRAB SUSHI ROLLS ===
  8             ounces  fresh lump crabmeat -- picked over
     1/2    tablespoon  sambal
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  4                     nori sheets
     1/2           cup  julienned peeled seeded cucumber
                        Water -- for sealing sushi
                        === MANGO BROWN BUTTER VINAIGRETTE ===
  4             ounces  butter - (to 6 oz)
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1                     shallot -- peeled
  1                cup  chopped mango
  1                cup  julienned mango
     1/2         pound  pea sprouts
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame seeds -- for garnish
  1         tablespoon  pink peppercorns -- for garnish

In a bowl combine sake, oil, soy sauce, ginger, sugar, and black pepper.  Place bass in a shallow baking dish and pour marinade over.  Marinate for at least 3 hours or overnight.  Preheat grill or broiler.  Grill or broil over high heat about 10 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish.  It should be flaky with an oily texture when done. 
For the Spicy Crab Sushi Rolls:  In a large bowl, mix crab, sambal, cilantro, chives, honey, pepper, salt, and oil.  Taste for seasoning.  Lay out one sheet of nori and spread with crab mixture.  Place the cucumber on top of the crab.  Roll it tightly, dampen edge with water and seal.  Set aside.  Fill and roll remaining nori sheets.  Slice each roll into 3 pieces. 
For the Mango Brown Butter Vinaigrette:  In a small saucepan, warm butter over low heat until it turns brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.  In a blender, combine orange juice, lime juice, mustard, shallot and chopped mango and blend until smooth.  When butter is browned, pour it in the blender, while running, in a steady stream.  Taste for seasoning.  Transfer dressing to a bowl and toss with the mango julienne. 
In a bowl, toss the pea sprouts with a small amount of vinaigrette and mound a small amount in the center of a large dinner plate.  Place 3 pieces of sushi around the salad.  Lay the fish on top of the sushi and the sprouts.  Drizzle vinaigrette with the mango pieces around the plate.  Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and crushed pink peppercorns. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

          Grilled Stuffed Calamari 'Sushi' With Black Bean Aioli

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Calamari/Squid                  Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     red bell pepper -- finely diced
  2                     lapchong -- finely diced
                        (may substitute with sausage)
  2               cups  cooked sushi rice
     1/4           cup  chopped scallions
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
  1         tablespoon  oyster sauce
  12            medium  squid tubes
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chile powder (Korean or ancho)
                        Canola oil -- to cook
                        === BLACK BEAN AIOLI ===
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2                     serrano chiles
  1         tablespoon  rinsed, minced fermented black beans
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  2        tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
  2                     egg yolks
  1                cup  canola oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Pre-heat a grill very hot.  In a skillet coat lightly with oil and on high heat, sautee the pepper and lapchong until soft, about 4 minutes.  Fold in with rice and add the scallions, cilantro and oyster sauce.  Season and check.  Stuff the squid tubes using a pastry bag or plastic bag with the tip cut off. 
Oil the grill and season the tubes with salt, and chile.  Mark the tubes, and roll them around so that all sides cook evenly, about 5 minutes total.  Be careful not to overcook the squid as it will get tough.  Let rest 1 minute then slice into one-inch pieces, like sushi. 
For the Black Bean Aioli:  Sautee garlic, chiles, black beans and ginger until soft.  Deglaze with vinegar and reduce by 80%.  Let cool completely.  In a food processor, add mixture with yolks.  While processor is on, drizzle in oil, slowly at first until it emulsifies then more quickly.  Check for seasoning.  Store in refrigerator. 
For Plating:  Fill a small dish with the aioli and arrange the 'sushi' around the dish.  The 'sushi' should be dipped before consumed. 
This recipe yields about 30 pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  canola oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                     zucchini -- sliced 1/4" thick
                        lengthwise
  1                     red onion -- sliced 1/4" thick
                        rings
  1                     eggplant -- sliced 1/4" thick
                        lengthwise
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, sliced
  4                     scallions
  2                     tablespoons butter
  4                     shallots -- minced
  2               cups  hot vegetable stock - (to 3 cups)
  2               cups  barley
     1/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === MARINATED PORTOBELLO STEAKS ===
  4              large  Portobello caps -- de-stemmed
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  thin soy sauce
     1/3           cup  canola oil
     1/3           cup  red wine
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
                        === BASIL OIL ===
  2               cups  basil leaves -- save basil tops
                        for garnish
  1                cup  spinach
  1                cup  canola oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Mix oil and garlic.  In a large bowl, toss the oil with all the vegetables and season well with salt and pepper.  On a hot grill, mark and cook the vegetables.  Place all the vegetables back in same bowl and seal with plastic wrap to finish cooking.  When the vegetables are cool chop everything except the scallions into small pieces and pour any leftover liquid into the vegetable stock. 
In a 1-quart saucier, add a little butter and saute the shallots.  Add the barley and saute for 5 minutes until the barley gets a little 'toasty'.  Ladle in stock, one ladle at a time, (like making risotto).  Continue adding stock until the barley gets 'creamy'.  Season.  Add back the vegetables and heat thoroughly.  Add the cheese.  Check for seasoning. 
For the Marinated Portobello Steaks:  Mix all together, taste for seasoning and marinate mushroom caps for 1 hour.  On a very hot grill, mark and cook caps until hot in the middle. 
For the Basil Oil:  In very salted water, blanch basil and spinach for 30 seconds, or until very soft, yet still green.  Plunge in ice bath and squeeze out water.  Blend at high speed and add salt and the oil.  Cover blender and blend for 3 to 4 minutes or until the cup becomes warm. 
For Plating:  In a large pasta bowl, place a mound of barley on the top half of the plate.  Slice mushrooms like it was a steak.  Fan out in front of barley and garnish with basil oil and basil sprig. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Mix oil and garlic.  In a large bowl, toss the oil with all the vegetables and season well with salt and pepper.  On a hot grill, mark and cook the vegetables.  Place all the vegetables back in same bowl and seal with plastic wrap to finish cooking.  When the vegetables are cool chop everything except the scallions into small pieces and pour any leftover liquid into the vegetable stock.

<DirT>
In a 1-quart saucier, add a little butter and saute the shallots.  Add the barley and saute for 5 minutes until the barley gets a little &apos;toasty&apos;.  Ladle in stock, one ladle at a time, (like making risotto).  Continue adding stock until the barley gets &apos;creamy&apos;.  Season.  Add back the vegetables and heat thoroughly.  Add the cheese.  Check for seasoning. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Marinated Portobello Steaks:  Mix all together, taste for seasoning and marinate mushroom caps for 1 hour.  On a very hot grill, mark and cook caps until hot in the middle. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Basil Oil:  In very salted water, blanch basil and spinach for 30 seconds, or until very soft, yet still green.  Plunge in ice bath and squeeze out water.  Blend at high speed and add salt and the oil.  Cover blender and blend for 3 to 4 minutes or until the cup becomes warm. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Plating:  In a large pasta bowl, place a mound of barley on the top half of the plate.  Slice mushrooms like it was a steak.  Fan out in front of barley and garnish with basil oil and basil sprig.

        Herb Crab Salad Maki-Sushi With Tempura Shrimp Hand Rolls

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MASTER SUSHI RICE ===
  4               cups  sushi rice (Calrose/short grain)
                        Water -- as needed
  1                cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  mirin
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        === HERB CRAB SALAD ===
     1/2    tablespoon  honey
     1/2    tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
     1/2    tablespoon  canola oil
     1/2         pound  fresh picked crab
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
     1/4           cup  basil chiffonade
  1                     shallot -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  4                     yaki-nori sheets
                        Tempura Shrimp Hand Rolls -- see * Note
                        === GARNISH ===
     1/4           cup  julienned gari (pickled ginger)
     1/4           cup  toasted sesame seeds
     1/4           cup  chopped green scallions
                        Soy Syrup -- see * Note
                        Wasabi Oil -- see * Note

* Note:  See the "Tempura Shrimp Hand Rolls", "Soy Syrup" and "Wasabi Oil" recipes which are included in this collection. 
Wash rice at least 3 times or until water is clear.  Fill rice cooker with water to about 1-inch over rice.  I highly recommend a rice cooker -- there's a reason more than 2 billion people in Asia use them. 
Slowly heat vinegar, mirin and sugar until very hot but not boiling.  Fold in 'su' (vinegar and sugar) with the hot rice, add enough so that the rice has a tart/sweet taste.  Rice should be shiny, not mushy.  Carefully clean inside rim of bowl with damp cloth, cover and let rest for 30 minutes. 
For the Herb Crab Salad:  In a bowl, whisk together honey, mustard, lemon juice and oil.  Add crab, herbs and minced shallot.  Season with salt and pepper and check flavor. 
Lay nori, shiny-side down on sushi mat and lightly pat on rice on bottom half of nori, 1/4-inch thick.  Place crab filling 2/3 up on rice.  Roll, moisten end to seal and let rest. 
For plating:  On a huge white platter, drizzle Soy Syrup, Wasabi Oil, sesame seeds, gari and scallions all over.  Slice maki-sushi using both bias and straight cuts.  Place Tempura Shrimp Hand Rolls leaning against sushi.  Enjoy. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CARROT AND POTATO SPAGHETTI ===
  2              large  carrots -- peeled, cut into
                        spirals with a turning slicer
  1              large  potato -- peeled, cut into
                        spirals with a turning slicer
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste

Wrap the chicken in plastic and pound very thin.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mix the herbs together on a plate and dredge the chicken with the herbs.  In a hot skillet coated with oil, pan sear the chicken golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes a side. 
For the Honey-Lemon Grass Glaze:  In a medium-hot, non-reactive sauce pan, lightly coat the pan and sautee the lemongrass, ginger and shallots until soft, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Deglaze with wine and reduce by 80 percent.  Add the juice, stock and honey and reduce by 50 percent.  Whisk in the butter and check for seasoning.  Puree with a hand blender to a smooth consistency. 
For the Carrot And Potato Spaghetti:  In a large non-stick skillet, add butter and melt on medium-low heat.  Add carrots and potato and sautee.  Season with cumin and salt.  Cook until soft, about 10 minutes.  Keep heat on medium-low or the potatoes could burn. 
For Plating:  Place a small pile of the 'spaghetti'.  Hide with chicken paillard and glaze the top with the sauce.  Garnish with lemon zest. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

              Jasmine Tea Souffle With Lemon Grass Ice Cream

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  loose jasmine tea leaves
     1/4           cup  loose oolong tea leaves
  1                cup  milk
  3               cups  heavy cream
  2                     Tahitian vanilla beans -- split lengthwise,
                        and scraped
     1/2           cup  honey
  10                    eggs -- separated
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
     1/2           cup  sugar -- (1/4 cup for yolks,
                        and 1/4 cup for whites)
  6                     buttered and sugared six-ounce ramekins -
                        (to 8)
                        Lemon Grass Ice Cream -- see * Note

* Note:  See the "Lemon Grass Ice Cream" recipe which is included in this collection. 
In a non-reactive saucepan on low heat, mix teas, cream, milk and vanilla beans/pods and bring to a simmer.  Simmer for 20 minutes then take off stove and let steep an additional 30 minutes. 
Strain infused liquid and re-heat with the honey to a simmer.  In a stainless steel bowl whisk together the 10 yolks, cornstarch and 1/4 cup of sugar.  Temper the yolks by adding only a ladle of hot infused cream to the yolks.  Mix well then add tempered mixture back to the saucepan.  On medium heat, whisk constantly until it thickens then cook an additional 3 to 5 minutes.  A pastry cream texture should be achieved.  Transfer base to a small hotel pan, seal with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator.  Base can be made 24 hours in advance. 
Pre-heat a sheet tray in a 375-degree oven.  Whisk the egg whites with 1 tablespoon of sugar in an upright mixer equipped with a whip attachment on slow.  In about 8 to10 minutes soft peaks will be achieved.  Add the rest of the sugar and whip at high speed for two 5 second bursts. 
In a large stainless bowl, hand whisk the chilled infused cream base until smooth.  Using a spatula, gently fold in the egg whites at a 50/50 ratio by volume.  Work quickly, but do not over mix.  The base needs to be one homogenous color.  Fill ramekins to the top.  Drop each one from a height of 3 inches to disperse any unwanted bubbles. 
Place on heated sheet tray and bake for 12 minutes.  After 6 minutes the soufflÈs will start rising.  Check the rising soufflÈs to see if any edges are getting caught on the rims of the ramekins; if necessary open the oven door and carefully slice the sticking part with a paring knife (you won't ruin the soufflÈs if you work fast -- no slamming the door Alice).  The soufflÈs will straighten themselves out.  When the sides of the soufflÈ are golden brown (the key to a soufflÈ not falling is the crusty, golden brown sides), pull out of the oven and dust the tops with confectioners' sugar.  Serve immediately with a scoop of Lemon Grass Ice Cream. 
For Plating:  Place soufflÈ on plate.  Cut an opening in the top of the soufflÈ and put a scoop of ice cream inside. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     skinless chicken breasts
  2                     to 4 dried scallops -- (optional)
  1 1/2           cups  peeled carrots in 2" strips
  1 1/2           cups  peeled daikon in 2" strips
  1                cup  mizuna
  1            package  red kamaboko (fish cake)
                        (I prefer brand name Yamasa)
  1            package  mochi (pounded rice cake)
                        Salt -- to taste

Make chicken stock by cooking chicken breasts in 8 cups boiling water and 2 teaspoons salt.  Cook in boiling water for 10 minutes, (add dried scallops here if you like) then lower heat and cook for about 30 minutes.  While making stock, wash and drain all vegetables.  Cut mizuna into 2 strips (you won't need much of this-just to add green color).  Slice the kamaboko fairly thin.  Put a few mochi into toaster and toast until puffy. 
Remove chicken from stock onto a plate.  While chicken is cooling, strain the soup in either cheesecloth or some kind of cloth (I prefer using old restaurant linen because it strains better!) to strain to a clean pot.  Add the carrots and daikon and cook until tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Shred 1 breast of chicken and add to broth.  Save the rest to make chicken salad or whatever for another time.  Check flavor and add salt if needed. 
Just before serving, put mizuna in soup just to parboil-must be crunch/crisp.  Put toasted mochi in a bowl, pour the soup over mochi, then put several slices of kamaboko on top and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings (8 cups).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  warm water
     1/8           cup  sugar
     1/2    tablespoon  dry yeast
     1/2    tablespoon  melted lard
  2 1/2           cups  sifted all-purpose flour
  5        tablespoons  water
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2    tablespoon  ginger
  2               cups  rinsed drained chopped rock shrimp
  2               cups  chopped garlic chives
                        (regular chives can be substituted)
  2                     eggs
     1/2    tablespoon  sesame oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Canola oil -- to cook
  1                cup  chicken stock - (to 2 cups)
                        (may substitute water)

Mix warm water with sugar to dissolve.  Add yeast and let stand for 10 minutes.  Mixture should get foamy or the yeast is dead.  Mix in lard. 
In a food processor, add flour and yeast mixture.  While blade is spinning, pour in water until a ball forms.  If dough is too sticky, add more flour.  If dough appears dry and doesn't form a ball, add more water. 
As soon as a ball forms, take dough out and knead by hand on a floured surface.  Roll dough into one long log about 2 inches thick.  Cut into 2-inch pieces. 
For the Filling:  In a large bowl, mix the ginger, shrimp, garlic chives, eggs and sesame oil.  Season well with salt and pepper.  Make thick circles of the dough and place stuffing in the middle.  Encircle stuffing with the dough and seal with a little twist.  Let rest in a warm place for 30 minutes. 
In a hot saute pan coated well with oil, place shrimp buns flat-side down and cook until the bottom is browned.  Have pan cover ready and add 1 cup of chicken stock, cover immediately.  Be careful, the liquid will splatter! 
The stock will steam the buns.  Check them in 5 minutes as more stock may be needed.  The trick here is that once the buns are firm and fully cooked the stock will evaporate and the bottoms will crisp-up again. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  yeast
                        (or 2 tspns fresh yeast)
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/4           cup  warm water
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  five spice powder
  1 1/2    tablespoons  canola oil
     1/2    tablespoon  sesame oil
  1 3/4           cups  warm water

In a small bowl, mix yeast, sugar, salt and 1/4 cup warm water.  Let stand 5 minutes until foamy.  In a mixer with a dough hook, mix flour and five spice powder.  While mixer is running, slowly pour in yeast mixture, oils and the rest of the water; knead on low speed for 8 to 10 minutes.  Stop mixer when the dough forms a smooth and firm ball. 
Divide dough into 6 balls and place on sheet tray lined with parchment paper.  Cover with a cloth and place in a warm part of the kitchen; let balls double in size, about 2 hours.  Working on a floured surface with floured hands, take one ball and spread out with your fingers to about 5 inches in diameter.  Take a floured rolling pin and roll out to a little less than a 1/4-inch thick.  The final diameter will be 8 to 10 inches. 
On a low grill, brush on a little canola oil and mark one side.  Brush oil on the raw side and flip.  Immediately place toppings and cover with a lid to help retain the heat and assist the cheese melting process.  Carefully watch the pizza.  If the grill is too hot, the bottom will burn before the pizza is ready.  If this occurs, you can place the pizza on a tray and use the broiler of an oven to finish the melting. 
This recipe yields dough for six 8- to 10-inch pizzas. 
Comments:  Can be used for both grilled and baked pizzas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PORK AND GINGER FILLING ===
  2               cups  chopped napa cabbage
     1/2    tablespoon  salt
     1/2         pound  ground pork - (not lean pork, the fat
                        is good for juicy and flavorful dumplings)
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  thin soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  sesame oil
  1                     egg
  1                cup  chicken stock or water - (to 2 cups)
                        === HOT WATER DOUGH ===
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  boiling water - (to 1 3/4 cups)
                        === SPICY SOY DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  thin soy sauce
     1/3           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  sliced scallions
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  sambal

Sprinkle cabbage with the 1/2 tablespoon of salt and let stand for 30 minutes.  Place the cabbage on a clean dishtowel or cheesecloth and squeeze out any water.  The dryer the cabbage the better.  In a large bowl thoroughly mix the cabbage with all of the other ingredients, except the chicken stock.  Cook a tester to check the seasoning. 
For the Hot Water Dough:  In a stainless steel bowl mix flour and salt.  Slowly add hot water to flour in 1/4-cup increments.  Mix with chopsticks until a ball is formed and the dough is not too hot to handle. 
On a floured surface, knead dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball.  Place back in bowl and cover with a damp cloth.  Allow to rest for at least 1 hour. 
Working on a floured surface with floured hands, roll out dough to form a long 'noodle', 1-inch in diameter.  Cut 1/2-inch pieces and turn them over so the cut sides are facing up.  Flatten with your palm and roll out thin using a rolling pin.  The dumpling wrapper should end up about 3 inches in diameter. 
Making The Dumplings:  Place a small mound of filling in the middle of the wrapper.  (Be very careful not to touch the edges with the filling as this will impede proper sealing of the dumplings.  Nothing is worse than dumplings breaking during cooking.)  Fold the wrapper in half to form a half moon shape.  Starting on one end fold/pinch the wrapper tightly together.  Proceed with this fold/pinch method until the dumpling is completely sealed.  There will be approximately 10 to 14 folds per dumpling.  Rest the dumplings with the folded edges straight up. 
Cooking The Dumplings:  In a hot saute pan coated well with oil, place pot stickers flat-side down and cook until the bottom is browned.  Have pan cover ready and add 1 cup of chicken stock, cover immediately.  Be careful, the liquid will splatter!  The stock will steam the pot stickers.  Check them in 5 minutes as more stock may be needed.  The trick here is that once the dumplings are firm and fully cooked the stock will evaporate and the bottoms will crisp-up again. 
For the Spicy Soy Dipping Sauce:  Combine all and serve in a small bowl. 
For Plating:  Serve pot stickers on a large platter lined with lettuce with a bowl of dipping sauce on the side. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

Sprinkle cabbage with the 1/2 tablespoon of salt and let stand for 30 minutes.  Place the cabbage on a clean dishtowel or cheesecloth and squeeze out any water.  The dryer the cabbage the better.  In a large bowl thoroughly mix the cabbage with all of the other ingredients, except the chicken stock.  Cook a tester to check the seasoning. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Hot Water Dough:  In a stainless steel bowl mix flour and salt.  Slowly add hot water to flour in 1/4-cup increments.  Mix with chopsticks until a ball is formed and the dough is not too hot to handle. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
On a floured surface, knead dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball.  Place back in bowl and cover with a damp cloth.  Allow to rest for at least 1 hour. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Working on a floured surface with floured hands, roll out dough to form a long &apos;noodle&apos;, 1-inch in diameter.  Cut 1/2-inch pieces and turn them over so the cut sides are facing up.  Flatten with your palm and roll out thin using a rolling pin.  The dumpling wrapper should end up about 3 inches in diameter. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Making The Dumplings:  Place a small mound of filling in the middle of the wrapper.  (Be very careful not to touch the edges with the filling as this will impede proper sealing of the dumplings.  Nothing is worse than dumplings breaking during cooking.)  Fold the wrapper in half to form a half moon shape.  Starting on one end fold/pinch the wrapper tightly together.  Proceed with this fold/pinch method until the dumpling is completely sealed.  There will be approximately 10 to 14 folds per dumpling.  Rest the dumplings with the folded edges straight up. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cooking The Dumplings:  In a hot saute pan coated well with oil, place pot stickers flat-side down and cook until the bottom is browned.  Have pan cover ready and add 1 cup of chicken stock, cover immediately.  Be careful, the liquid will splatter!  The stock will steam the pot stickers.  Check them in 5 minutes as more stock may be needed.  The trick here is that once the dumplings are firm and fully cooked the stock will evaporate and the bottoms will crisp-up again. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Spicy Soy Dipping Sauce:  Combine all and serve in a small bowl. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Plating:  Serve pot stickers on a large platter lined with lettuce with a bowl of dipping sauce on the side.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             bottle  red wine
  2               cups  shaoxing wine - (may substitute
                        with 1 cup dry sherry)
  4               cups  thin soy sauce
  4               cups  water -- or to cover duck
  12            pounds  bone-in pork shoulder - (to 15 lbs) -- fat cap on
  2              boxes  Chinese rock sugar
                        (or 2 cups brown sugar)
  1              large  ginger -- sliced
  1                     garlic head -- sliced in half
  2            bunches  scallions
  2                     star anise
  2                     Thai bird chilies
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  8                     Shanghai cabbage -- halved, de-cored,
                        and cleaned
     1/4           cup  sambal oelek -- as a condiment

Put all liquid ingredients and sugar in a tall stockpot and bring to a boil.  Add pork and reduce heat.  When boiling again, turn down to a simmer and skim off the 'scum'.  Add the rest of the remaining ingredients, except cabbage.  Taste for seasoning; it should be fairly sweet.  If not, add more brown sugar.  Remember that the taste of the braising liquid will ultimately be the taste of the pork, so make sure it tastes good! 
Simmer slowly for 6 to 8 hours, or until pork is very soft.  Carefully remove the pork, place it on a large platter and cover with foil to keep hot.  Strain the liquid and reduce until a syrupy consistency is achieved, this will take 20 to 30 minutes. 
In the last 5 minutes of reducing, add the cabbage to cook until soft.  Place cabbage around the pork and glaze pork with reduction.  Serve with side of sambal oelek. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Roasted Pork Loin With Almond Pesto And 5 Spice Root Vegetable Pot Pie

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  slivered or whole almonds -- toasted
                        (save 1/4 cup for garnish)
  3                     serrano chiles
                        Juice of one lime
  6                     garlic cloves
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  2               cups  picked Thai basil leaves
  1                cup  picked mint leaves
     3/4           cup  peanut oil
  3             pounds  pork loin - (to 4 lbs) -- cut into at least
                        four 2" pieces, and pounded flat
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  sliced green scallions -- for garnish
                        Canola oil -- for cooking
                        === 5 SPICE ROOT VEGETABLE RAGOUT ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                cup  diced red onions
  1         tablespoon  five spice powder
  1                cup  diced carrots
  1                cup  diced celery
  1                cup  diced celery root
  1                cup  diced parsnip
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch slurry - (1/2 tbspn cornstarch
                        mixed with cold water)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === PASTRY CUPS ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  4             ounces  butter - (1 stick) -- cut into small pieces
                        and frozen (JB trick)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  five spice powder
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten with
  1         tablespoon  ice water

In a food processor, place almonds, chilies, lime juice, garlic and ginger and mix well.  Add the basil and mint leaves.  Slowly drizzle in the oil to achieve a thick puree.  Check for seasoning.  Season the pork and spread the pesto on each pork escalope.  Save a little pesto for garnishing.  Roll the pork escalopes and tie each one with string. 
In a hot saute pan coated with oil, sear the pork roulades on all sides.  Place pork in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes.  An internal temperature of 155 to 160 degrees is ideal.  I love my pork pink.  Let loin rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing. 
Add a little oil to thin out the remaining pesto. 
For the 5 Spice Root Vegetable Ragout:  In a 2-quart saucepan on medium heat, add the butter, onions and 5 spice powder.  Saute for 3 minutes then add carrots, celery, celery root and parsnips.  Saute for 10 minutes then add chicken stock.  Reduce stock by 30 percent until the vegetables are soft but not mushy.  Stir in the cornstarch slurry to thicken.  Check for seasoning. 
For the Pastry Cups (can substitute frozen puff pastry):  In a food processor with the blade, add flour, butter, salt and 5-spice.  Pulse until butter ends up in very small, tiny pieces.  Add the egg mixture and pulse until a ball is formed.  If ball is too dry, add a little water or, if too wet, add a little flour.  In either case, pulse to incorporate.  Wrap ball in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. 
Roll out dough to 1/4-inch thick and dock dough (make small holes).  Cut out circles or squares and place on an upside-down muffin pan.  Place a sheet of parchment on top then weigh down with a sheet tray.  Bake at 425 degrees for 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. 
For Plating:  Zigzag pesto oil on white plate.  Place one pastry cup in the center of a plate and generously over fill with vegetable ragout.  Slice thick slices of pork and surround cup.  Garnish with toasted almonds and sliced scallions. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a food processor, place almonds, chilies, lime juice, garlic and ginger and mix well.  Add the basil and mint leaves.  Slowly drizzle in the oil to achieve a thick puree.  Check for seasoning.  Season the pork and spread the pesto on each pork escalope.  Save a little pesto for garnishing.  Roll the pork escalopes and tie each one with string. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a hot saute pan coated with oil, sear the pork roulades on all sides.  Place pork in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes.  An internal temperature of 155 to 160 degrees is ideal.  I love my pork pink.  Let loin rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add a little oil to thin out the remaining pesto. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the 5 Spice Root Vegetable Ragout:  In a 2-quart saucepan on medium heat, add the butter, onions and 5 spice powder.  Saute for 3 minutes then add carrots, celery, celery root and parsnips.  Saute for 10 minutes then add chicken stock.  Reduce stock by 30 percent until the vegetables are soft but not mushy.  Stir in the cornstarch slurry to thicken.  Check for seasoning. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Pastry Cups (can substitute frozen puff pastry):  In a food processor with the blade, add flour, butter, salt and 5-spice.  Pulse until butter ends up in very small, tiny pieces.  Add the egg mixture and pulse until a ball is formed.  If ball is too dry, add a little water or, if too wet, add a little flour.  In either case, pulse to incorporate.  Wrap ball in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out dough to 1/4-inch thick and dock dough (make small holes).  Cut out circles or squares and place on an upside-down muffin pan.  Place a sheet of parchment on top then weigh down with a sheet tray.  Bake at 425 degrees for 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Plating:  Zigzag pesto oil on white plate.  Place one pastry cup in the center of a plate and generously over fill with vegetable ragout.  Slice thick slices of pork and surround cup.  Garnish with toasted almonds and sliced scallions.

           Sauteed Calf's Liver With Fig-Chinese Vinegar Syrup

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     calf's livers
  3        tablespoons  clarified butter
  3                     shallots -- minced
  4                     black mission figs -- cut 1/4" disks
     1/2           cup  Chinese vinegar
     1/2           cup  balsamic vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Coarse-ground green peppercorns -- to taste
                        === POTATO-LEEK HASH ===
  2               cups  leek rings - (1/4") -- about 3 leeks
  3        tablespoons  duck fat or butter
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  6              large  Yukon gold potatoes -- peeled, cut 1/4" dice
     1/4           cup  chopped chervil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Pre-heat hot a large, thick skillet.  Season the liver with salt and green peppercorn.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter and sear the liver until brown on both sides, about 8 to 10 minutes.  I prefer my liver medium.  Place livers on warm plates. 
Place skillet back on the heat, add shallots and brown, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Season with salt and black pepper.  Add figs and sautee for 1 minute.  Deglaze with the vinegars and reduce by 50%.  Whisk in butter and check for seasoning.  Reserve in a water bath. 
For the Potato-Leek Hash:  In a hot skillet, coat with 1 tablespoon of fat and saute leeks until soft, about 6 minutes.  Season.  Deglaze with white wine and completely reduce.  Set leeks aside, wipe out pan and heat again.  Add remaining fat and sear potatoes brown, about 10 minutes.  Add back the leeks and chervil.  Move around quickly to heat thoroughly.  Check for seasoning. 
For Plating:  On the plate with the liver, place hash to the side and ladle sauce on the liver. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1               dash  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Juice of 1 lemon

* Note:  See the "Master Seafood Mixture" recipe which is included in this collection. 
In the same food processor, add seafood mixture, egg and butter.  Pulse until the butter is incorporated but still visible (small pieces).  Place one tablespoon of mixture on a wrapper and bring up the sides going around the mound.  Drop from 6 inches onto a flat surface to flatten the shumai.  Steam shumai for 8 minutes. 
For the Lemon Grass Broth:  In a 2-quart casserole, saute onions, jalepeÒo, ginger and lemongrass.  Deglaze with fish sauce and reduce by 80 per cent.  Add stock and dash of white pepper.  Reduce by 20 per cent on a slow simmer, about 45 minutes.  Strain and keep hot.  Check for seasoning.  Squeeze in lemon juice right before serving. 
For Plating:  In a soup plate, place three shumai and ladle in the broth.  Serve and enjoy.

Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     duck breasts -- skin scored
  4                     shallots -- sliced
     1/4           cup  cognac
  2               cups  dark chicken stock
  4             ounces  foie gras -- denerved, and
                        cut small pieces, chilled well
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Canola oil -- for cooking
                        === RED CABBAGE SLAW ===
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
                        Juice of 1 lemon
     1/4           cup  canola oil
  2               cups  shredded red cabbage
     1/4           cup  sliced green scallions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === POTATO-CARAMELIZED ONION SALAD ===
  2               cups  balsamic vinegar
     1/2           cup  Chinese vinegar
  1 1/2           cups  canola oil
  2              large  red onions -- sliced
  6             medium  Yukon gold potatoes -- skin on,
                        cut 1/4 " slices
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Season the duck breasts and place skin-side down in a medium heated, thick saute pan.  Slowly render the duck fat away (12 to 15 minutes).  When the skin browns, let breast rest, meat-side down.  Just prior to plating wipe out pan and bring to high temperature and quickly sear the duck, meat side first, then the skin side, 3 minutes total.  Let rest again before slicing. 
For the sauce, caramelize the shallots in a saucepan with a little canola oil.  Season.  Deglaze with cognac and reduce by 75 percent.  Add the chicken stock and reduce by 50 percent.  Pour into a blender and monter au foie gras.  In other words, as liquid is blending, add foie gras pieces to blender.  Check for seasoning and keep warm for plating. 
For the Red Cabbage Slaw:  Mix mustard with lemon juice.  Whisk in oil and check for seasoning.  Toss with cabbage and scallions.  This slaw may be done 20 minutes before plating. 
For the Potato-Caramelized Onion Salad:  In a non-reactive sauce pan, reduce the two vinegars by 80 percent until a syrup consistency is achieved.  Pour the syrup into a blender while hot. While blending at high speed, drizzle in canola oil.  Check for seasoning. 
Caramelize red onions in a saute pan coated with a little canola oil.  Set aside.  In a non-stick pan, coat well with canola oil and saute potatoes until golden brown.  Season with salt and pepper. 
Toss hot potatoes with the onions and vinegar emulsion.  Check for seasoning. 
For Plating:  On a large white plate place a small mound of the potato-onion salad and surround with thin duck slices.  Top potato-onion salad with cabbage slaw.  Sauce around duck and drizzle some emulsion. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  4              large  sweet potatoes -- brunoise
                        (needs to be the size of risotto)
  3               cups  hot chicken broth - (to 4 cups)
  2             pounds  large scallops - (U-10's or bigger)
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2    tablespoon  minced ginger
  1              pound  chanterelles -- cleaned

                        Canola oil -- for cooking
                        === HARICOTS VERTS SALAD ===
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  1         tablespoon  truffle oil
     1/2           cup  virgin olive oil
  1              pound  haricot verts -- blanched, shocked
  1              bunch  chives -- cut into 1" batons
                        Truffle oil -- for garnish
                        Salt -- to taste

                        === FUNKY SWEET POTATO GARNISH === -- (optional)
  1              large  sweet potato -- spaghetti cut

                        Canola oil -- for frying

It is important that the sweet potato 'risotto' dice are all the same size.  Traditional risotto cooking technique is used.  In a 2-quart casserole, first saute the shallots in butter and season.  Add the sweet potato and saute.  Slowly add the hot chicken stock, one ladle at a time.  Only add more stock after the previous ladle is fully absorbed.  Continue adding stock until the 'risotto' gets creamy, but not mushy.  The individual grains of 'risotto' should remain distinct. 
Season the scallops with salt and pepper.  In very hot saute pan, coat with oil and sear the scallops until brown.  Flip scallops and brown other side.  Total cooking time should be about 8 minutes.  Wipe pan out, return to high heat, coat with canola oil, add garlic and ginger and saute until soft.  Add chanterelles and season.  Cook for about 6 to 8 minutes. 
For the Haricorts Verts Salad:  In a stainless steel bowl, mix lemon juice, truffle oil and olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper.  Toss vinaigrette with the haricots verts.  Check for seasoning.  Garnish with chives. 
For the Funky Sweet Potato Garnish:  Wrap the sweet potato hair around a slice of purple potato.  In a 300-degree fryer, fry until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Salt to taste and drain well. 
For Plating:  Using a ring mold or pvc pipe, fill bottom third with the hot chanterelles, then cover with 'risotto'.  Place in the center of a plate.  Surround with scallops and top with haricot verts salad.  Garnish with truffle oil, chive batons and funky garnish. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  2                     serrano chiles -- minced
     1/2           cup  hoisin sauce
  3               cups  sliced shiitake mushrooms
  2               cups  julienned leeks
  1                cup  bean sprouts
     1/2           cup  chopped cilantro
  1                cup  chopped scallions
  1            package  bean threads, rice vermicelli - (4 oz) -- blanched, refreshed,
                        and cup up
  1            package  lumpia wrappers
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water
                        === SPICY SOY DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  thin soy sauce
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
                        (can substitute other vinegars,
                        such as balsamic)
  1         tablespoon  sambal
  1         tablespoon  chopped scallions
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISH ===
  1                     red leaf lettuce head
  1              bunch  mint

In a hot wok or saute pan, add the oil.  Stir in the garlic, ginger, and chiles.  Be careful not to burn.  Add the hoisin and briefly saute to remove the raw taste.  Add the shiitake mushrooms, leeks, and bean sprouts.  Taste for seasoning.  Transfer mixture to a strainer, drain and let cool.  When cooled, mix in the cilantro, scallions and bean threads. 
Lay out a lumpia wrapper with the corner facing you.  Place a small amount of the mixture at the bottom, moisten the edges with the eggwash and roll the bottom corner towards the middle.  Fold in both sides and continue rolling.  When finished, let rest. 
In a deep pan, heat oil to 350 degrees.  Fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.  Serve immediately. 
For the Spicy Soy Dipping Sauce:  In a bowl, combine soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sambal, and chopped scallions.  Serve with Spring Rolls.  (Makes 3/4 cup) 
Optional garnish:  Place a fried roll on top of a leaf of red leaf lettuce.  Top with mint and wrap the mint and roll up in the lettuce.  This is a Vietnamese technique that not only adds flavor, texture and temperature difference, but also keeps your fingers oil free! 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

       Shiitake Stuffed Steamed Striped Bass Flashed With Curry Oil

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     striped bass
     1/4           cup  julienned ginger
     1/4           cup  julienned scallion
  2               cups  shiitake mushrooms -- sauteed with
     1/2    tablespoon  minced garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  4              large  napa cabbage leaves -- for steamer
                        === SOY SYRUP ===
  2               cups  thin soy sauce
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
                        Juice of 1 lime
                        === CURRY OIL ===
     1/4           cup  curry powder
                        Water -- to make runny paste
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  canola oil

Score both sides of the trout with a sharp knife.  Open trout and lay out skin down.  Season well.  Spread on a thin layer of shiitakes followed by some ginger and scallions.  Fold trout back together and place in steamer lined with napa cabbage leaves.  Steam for 10 minutes until fish is fully cooked.  Drizzle a little soy syrup and flash with hot curry oil.

Season shank with sea salt and pepper.  Sear off the shank in a hot roasting pan with oil and butter in a preheated 450 degree oven.  Continually baste shank and cook until brown.  Add mirepoix (carrots, celery and onions) and brown slowly.  Add white wine and bouquet garni (garlic, bay leaves, thyme, parsley, and peppercorns) wrapped in the green leek.  Continually baste while roasting.  Cook for about 2 to 3 hours until shank is bronzed and fork tender, with no liquid left in pan. 
Remove shank and add water to pan and reduce to make a sauce.  Strain and reseason with sea salt and pepper.

                  Smoked Salmon And Cucumber Sushi Rolls

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Salmon
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sushi rice - (Calrose or
                        any short grain variety)
                        Water -- as needed
  1                cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  mirin
     1/2           cup  sugar
  8                     nori sheets
     1/4           cup  julienned pickled ginger
  1                cup  cucumber strips
  1                cup  smoked salmon strips
                        Wasabi Oil -- see * Note
                        === LIME SOY SYRUP ===
  2               cups  thin soy sauce
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
                        Juice of one lime

* Note:  See the "Wasabi Oil" recipe which is included in this collection. 
Wash rice at least three times or until water is clear.  Fill rice cooker or casserole with water to about 1-inch over the rice.  Over high heat, cover and bring to a boil.  Reduce to medium-high heat and boil vigorously for 20 minutes.  Reduce heat to low and cook a further 20 minutes.  Remove from heat and let sit, still covered, for another 20 minutes. 
In a small saucepan, slowly heat the vinegar, mirin and sugar until very hot but not boiling.  Fold in "su" (vinegar and sugar) with the hot rice.  Place rice carefully in a clean bowl, cover, and let rest for 30 minutes. 
On a sushi mat, place a sheet of nori.  Lightly pat rice on bottom two thirds of nori.  Place pickled ginger, cucumber strips and salmon strips on top of rice.  Finish with a few drops of Wasabi Oil.  Roll up sushi tightly, moistening the edges to seal and let rest. 
For the Lime Soy Syrup:  In a saucepan, combine all the ingredients and let simmer until a syrup consistency is achieved, about a 70 per cent reduction.  Let cool completely. 
Cut sushi and arrange on a platter.  Serve with Wasabi Oil and the soy syrup. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                  Soft Shell Po-Boy With 'Kimchee' Slaw

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Crab                            Sandwiches
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  rice flour
  1           teaspoon  korean chile flakes (kochu kharu)
  1              quart  cold soda water
  4                     cleaned soft shell crabs -- primes or hotels
  4                     mini baguettes or hoagies -- lightly toasted
                        === 'KIMCHEE' SLAW ===
  2               cups  rice wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  korean chile flakes
     1/2    tablespoon  salt
     1/2    tablespoon  sugar
  1              small  napa cabbage head -- cut 1/2" slices
  2             medium  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 2" fine julienne
  12                    garlic cloves -- thinly sliced

In a large bowl, mix flour and chile.  Whisk in soda water until a pancake batter consistency is achieved.  Completely coat the crab in the batter.  Lightly drop in 350 degree oil and fry for 4 to 5 minutes until golden brown.  Season with salt and drain on paper towels. 
For the Kinchee Slaw:  In a non-reactive saucepan, heat the vinegar, chile, salt and sugar until just boiling.  Add the cabbage, carrots and garlic and simmer for only 3 minutes.  Pull off the stove and let cool. 
Transfer to a glass container with an air tight lid.  Store in refrigerator overnight.  Will keep for 3 to 4 weeks as long as you do not introduce bacteria to it, ie. your finger. 
For plating:  Place a small mound of slaw on the bottom piece of bread.  Top with 1 crab and top with a little more slaw.  Cover with top piece of bread and slice in half. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  4                     scallions -- cut 1/16" ribbons
     1/2           cup  peanut oil - (Lion and Globe or
                        an artisan roasted peanut oil)
  6                     fresh kaffir lime leaves -- cut 1/16" ribbons
  3                     Thai bird chiles -- cut 1/16" slices
  1         tablespoon  ginger in 1/16" ribbons
  1         tablespoon  garlic in 1/16" slices
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === TURMERIC FRIED RICE ===
                        Canola oil -- to cook
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  4                     scallions, cut 1/8" slices
  4               cups  day old cooked jasmin rice -- (add 1 tspn of
                        turmeric to raw rice to cook in the
                        flavor and color)
  2        tablespoons  thin soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === LONG BEAN SALAD ===
  4               cups  Chinese long beans in 2" pieces
                        (can substitute blanched haricots verts)
     1/2    tablespoon  sambal oelek
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
                        Juice of 2 limes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Set up a steamer that can hold the 4 fillets.  Mix lime juice, salt, sugar and water.  Add the fish and brine for 20 minutes.  Add the fillets to the steamer (should be lined with red leaf or banana leaf), top with the scallions and steam for 8 to 10 minutes until cooked though. 
Meanwhile, in a small sauce pan, heat the peanut oil very hot until almost smoking.  Mix the kaffir, chile, ginger, garlic and salt and pepper.  First plate the halibut and right before serving, add the mix to the hot oil, mix and immediately flash the halibut.  Serve. 
For the Tumeric Fried Rice:  It is recommended to use day old rice so that the drier rice can soak up the flavors.  In a wok, add 2 tablespoons of oil and quickly soft scramble the eggs.  Remove the eggs.  In the same wok, coat with oil and stir-fry garlic and ginger.  Add scallions and rice and heat thoroughly.  Add soy sauce, white pepper and scrambled eggs.  Check for seasoning. 
For the Long Bean Salad:  Blanch the long beans in a 350 degree fryer for only 1 minute until wrinkled.  Mix in a bowl the sambal, fish sauce and lime juice.  Add the hot long beans.  Check for seasoning and adjust.  Let sit at room temperature. 
For Plating:  Using a 2 1/2-inch O-ring or cut out tuna fish can, fill the bottom half with the fried rice.  Top with the long beans and press down firmly.  Top with the halibut and flash with the oil. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  rice flour
     1/2    tablespoon  togarashi or chili powder
  1              quart  cold club soda water
  8              large  shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        and butterflied
  8                     scallion fans
                        Canola oil -- for frying
  4                     yaki-nori sheets -- cut in half
  1            package  daikon sprouts
                        Wasabi Oil -- see * Note
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

* Note:  See the "Wasabi Oil" recipe which is included in this collection. 
In a bowl, mix flour with togarashi, or chili powder, and whisk in club soda until a pancake batter thickness is achieved.  Dip the shrimp and scallions in the tempura batter and fry until golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and season with salt and pepper. 
Lay the nori vertically with the shiny-side down.  Using wet hands, lightly place a 1/4-inch thick layer of rice on the bottom half of the nori.  Place one shrimp and scallion fan diagonally across the rice from the top left corner to the bottom right.  Lay daikon sprouts on top and add a touch of Wasabi Oil.  Roll a cone by bringing the bottom left corner of the nori to half way up the right side edge then roll over.  Moisten the top edge to glue.  Repeat process. 
This recipe yields 4 rolls.

           Traditional Duck With Pancakes And Hoisin-Lime Sauce

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2        gallons  water
  1                cup  Chinese black vinegar
     1/2           cup  dark molasses
     1/2           cup  dark soy sauce
  2                     star anise
  2                     Long Island ducks
     1/2           cup  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  five-spice powder
  4                     oranges -- washed, quartered,
                        and skin on
  12                    scallions -- chopped 1" lengths
                        (can be the ends)
  2              large  hand ginger -- washed, sliced 1/4"
                        (skin, pieces and all)
  1                     Black & Decker Airstation
                        Wooden skewers
  2                     duck hooks or string
                        Scallion brushes -- for garnish
                        === PANCAKES ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  boiling water with pinch of salt
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
                        === HOISIN-LIME SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  1                cup  hoisin sauce
                        Juice of 2 limes

In a tall stock pot (tall/big enough to submerge a duck completely), mix the water, vinegar, molasses, soy and star anise and bring to a brisk boil. 
Meanwhile, cut the head and feet off of the duck and make a slit at the base of the neck to insert the air pump.  While holding the rear of the duck tightly sealed, turn on the pump to separate the skin from the meat.  The air must travel all the way down the legs.  Set blown up ducks aside. 
Mix the salt and 5-spice together and season the duck inside and out.  In a large bowl, mix the oranges, scallions and ginger.  Stuff the ducks full of the mix and thread the skewer through the bottom flaps to seal.  Hook or tie the ducks by the neck and dip 3 times in the boiling glaze.  Hang in the refrigerator or cool place over night (ideally use a rotating fan to keep the air circulating which will more efficiently dry the skin). 
The next day, pre-heat an oven to 375 degrees and place ducks on a rack (on a sheet tray) and roast for 1 hour, breast-side up.  A lot of fat will render off so be careful when removing.  Carve up ducks and serve with pancakes, scallion brushes and hoisin-lime sauce. 
For the Pancakes:  Place the flour in a mixing bowl and quickly add the boiling water and mix as rapidly as possible.  Add the oils and work into the dough.  Mix for 2 to 3 minutes until the dough is homogenous and pliable.  Let rest 5 minutes. 
Roll out the dough into a long cylinder, 2 inches in diameter.  Cut into 8 to 10 pieces.  Turn each piece on its flat side and roll out on a floured surface with a rolling pin to about 5 to 6 inches.  In a skillet on low-medium, coat lightly with peanut oil and color both sides brown, small bubbles will form.  Keep covered with a damp, hot cloth.  These may be done in advance, then steamed hot for service. 
For the Hoisin-Lime Sauce:  In a skillet on medium heat, add the oil to coat.  Add the hoisin and stir, it should sizzle and bubble.  Cook for only 1 minute then add the juice and stir.  Transfer to a small serving dish. 
For Plating:  Lay out carved duck on a platter.  Serve with hoisin-lime, scallion brushes (to brush on the hoisin) and pancakes. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Canola oil -- for cooking
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2         tablespoon  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  fermented black beans
     1/4           cup  chopped scallions
     1/2           cup  hoisin sauce
  1                cup  red wine
  1                cup  dark soy sauce
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1              whole  roasted duck -- see * Note

* Note:  Either purchase a roasted duck from a Chinese store or follow these easy roasting instructions:  In a 350 degree oven, using a rack over a hotel pan of water, roast an unseasoned duck for 1 hour, 30 minutes on each side.  The water will not only prevent duck fat from splattering everywhere, but will also help keep the duck moist. 
In a large saute pan on medium heat coated with oil, saute garlic, ginger, black beans and scallions until soft.  Add hoisin and stir for 2 minutes.  Add red wine, soy sauce and sugar.  Check for seasoning.  Bring sauce to a boil then add roasted duck.  Turn duck frequently to completely coat with sauce.  Braise in sauce for 15 minutes then remove duck.  Keep sauce on a low simmer. 
When duck is cool enough to touch, break down duck to small pieces.  Add pieces back to the sauce, completely coat and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

* Note:  Either purchase a roasted duck from a Chinese store or follow these easy roasting instructions:  In a 350 degree oven, using a rack over a hotel pan of water, roast an unseasoned duck for 1 hour, 30 minutes on each side.  The water will not only prevent duck fat from splattering everywhere, but will also help keep the duck moist. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large saute pan on medium heat coated with oil, saute garlic, ginger, black beans and scallions until soft.  Add hoisin and stir for 2 minutes.  Add red wine, soy sauce and sugar.  Check for seasoning.  Bring sauce to a boil then add roasted duck.  Turn duck frequently to completely coat with sauce.  Braise in sauce for 15 minutes then remove duck.  Keep sauce on a low simmer. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When duck is cool enough to touch, break down duck to small pieces.  Add pieces back to the sauce, completely coat and serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  soba noodles -- blanched al dente
     1/4           cup  finely-sliced scallions, green part only
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  rice wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  Wasabi Oil -- see * Note
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped pickled ginger
  10                    nori sheets
  1                     cucumber -- peeled, and
                        finely julienned
  1                     red bell pepper -- julienned
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- julienned
                        === SOY SYRUP ===
  1                cup  thin soy sauce
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Scallions
     1/4           cup  toasted sesame seeds

* Note:  See the "Wasabi Oil" recipe which is included in this collection. 
In a large mixing bowl, combine soba noodles, scallions, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, wasabi oil, and pickled ginger.  Taste for seasoning. 
On a sushi mat, place one sheet of nori, shiny-side down.  On the bottom third of the nori, place a thin layer of the noodle mixture.  Place some cucumber and peppers on top.  Roll tightly.  Moisten the top edge of the nori with water to seal the sushi roll closed.

Slice and arrange sushi on a white platter.  Drizzle it with Wasabi Oil and Soy Syrup.  Garnish with scallions and sesame seeds. 
This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  shiitake mushrooms
  1                cup  chanterelle mushrooms

  8                     eggs
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  sliced green scallions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Canola oil -- for cooking
                        === ASPARAGUS-TRUFFLE SAUCE ===
  2             ounces  butter - (to 4 oz)
  2                     white onions -- sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  2               cups  water
  2               cups  asparagus, top part only
                        from naturally breaking -- (save 8 spears
                        for garnish), blanched, shocked, tossed in
                        lemon juice, salt and pepper
  1                cup  spinach leaves
     1/2    tablespoon  white truffle oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                     golf ball size black truffle -- sliced, (very optional)

In a hot saute pan, add 1 tablespoon of oil and saute garlic.  Add mushrooms and mix carefully.  Season with salt and pepper.  Deglaze with wine and reduce until nearly dry.  Check for seasoning and lay mushrooms on a tray to cool completely. 
In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and cream.  Mix in cooled mushrooms and scallions.  Spray 4 large ramekins with pan release and fill 4/5.  Place in hot bain marie (boiling water up half way) and bake in oven at 300 degrees for 25 minutes or until set. 
For the Asparagus-Truffle Sauce:  In a 1-quart casserole, add 1 tablespoon butter and sweat onions and garlic until soft.  Add water and season well.  Add the asparagus and cook for only 3 to 5 minutes until soft.  Add the spinach and take the casserole off of the heat.  (It is imperative that this water tastes salty so that when the asparagus and spinach are added, they maintain their green color.)  Immediately buzz the sauce with a hand blender and add the butter.  Check for seasoning.  Add the truffle oil and keep warm in a water bath. 
For Plating:  In a large pasta bowl, ladle in the asparagus sauce.  Place one custard in the middle and garnish with asparagus spears, truffle oil and fresh truffle slices. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.
