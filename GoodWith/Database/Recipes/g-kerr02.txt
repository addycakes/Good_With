Add pinch of salt to remaining egg wash and brush pastry.  Bake for 30 minutes, until crisp and golden brown.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  2 3/4           cups  apple cider
  2            packets  gelatin - (1/2 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  water
  1         tablespoon  Cointreau
  2              small  apples -- cored, and
                        cut 1/2" off tops
  12            ounces  cream cheese
  1 1/2                 eggs
     1/8           cup  brandy
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2                orange -- zested

Combine lemon juice and cider in pot and bring to boil, then cool.

Dissolve gelatin in water over very low heat.  Add Cointreau and cider/lemon juices.  Let cool.

Cut apples most of the way through from top to bottom into six even segments, keeping them intact at apple's base.  The apple should open to resemble a flower.  Place each apple in a small serving bowl, leaving 1/2-inch clearance at top.  Pour cooled cider mixture over apples and place in refrigerator to set.

In a bowl, mash together cheese, eggs, brandy, sugar and orange rind.  Whisk to get rid of lumps.  Pour over set apple jelly and place back in refrigerator to set again.  When firm, run heated knife around outer edge of jelly and invert bowl onto plate to serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  sweet potatoes
     3/4           cup  cold water
  2             pounds  granulated sugar
  4             pounds  fresh pineapple
  2            packets  gelatin
  2             ounces  raisins
  2             ounces  rum or tequila
                        Camembert cheese -- for serving
  2             ounces  toasted almonds

Peel the sweet potatoes and cook in boiling water until soft.  Drain, dry, and mash.

Pour the cold water into a saucepan on moderate heat and stir in the sugar.  Cook until sugar is dissolved and the liquid is clear, about 8 minutes.

Cut the top and bottom of the pineapple, trim off the outer skin and slice flesh into 4 and remove the center core.  Place flesh into a blender and puree at high speed.  Sieve this mixture into a bowl.

Dissolve the gelatin in water.  Soak the raisins in rum.  Chill the terrine or a square mold.

In a bowl, mix the pineapple with the mashed sweet potatoes.  Place the clear syrup in a large pan on high heat and add the pineapple and potato mixture.  Reduce the heat to low and let cook down to a very thick custard texture.  (Whenever you use fresh pineapple you must heat it to the boil in order to kill the Bromeline content.  Bromeline is a great digestive, but it stops gelatin from setting.)

Pour mixture into a chilled terrine or mold and place in the refrigerator to set.  When firm and chilled, remove Ate from the refrigerator, unmold and slice.  Serve with Camembert cheese surrounded with raisins soaked in rum, and toasted almonds.  Can also be served spooned out of the mold like a jam.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Preheat broiler, setting rack at least 4 inches from heat source.  Coat tenderloin with Gruyere, anchovy and pimentos, reserving some for garnish.  Broil for 5 minutes.  Remove from heat onto a wooden platter.  Sprinkle with parsley and extra pimento to serve.

  5         tablespoon  lard
  2               cups  flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  flour
                        Salt -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  iced water
  1                     chicken - (abt 3 lbs)
     1/2         pound  bacon slices
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  allspice
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/3           cup  dry sherry
     1/3           cup  sweet sherry
  2                     sage leaves

  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1                     egg yolk

To make pastry:  Combine butter and lard with 2 cups flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Add in water and form dough into a ball.  Rest in a cool place for 1/2 hour.

Roll pastry to 1-inch larger than pie plate; flip pie plate over onto pastry and cut a circle 1-inch wider than the lip.  Also cut a 1-inch wide band of pastry to match the size of the overhang.  Chill until ready to use.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Remove wings from chicken and cut into 4 pieces, removing backbone and breast bones.  Pat chicken pieces dry with towel.

Fry bacon in large pan.  Transfer to a dish to cool, then cut into 1-inch dice.  Brown both sides of chicken pieces in bacon fat over high heat.  Season with salt, pepper, allspice, and paprika.  Transfer chicken to pie pan.

Add 1 tablespoon flour to bacon fat to form a roux and then add dry and sweet sherry, stirring until smooth.  Pour this over chicken.  Place 1/2 sage leaf on each chicken piece.  Surround with grapes and sprinkle grapes with brown sugar.  Cover chicken with bacon.

Dampen edge of pie plate with water and attach band of pastry, pressing down with fingers, so it sticks out from the edge.  Dampen the surface of the pastry band with water and attach pastry circle to it, crimping to seal.  Cut a steam vent in top of pastry.  Brush crust with egg yolk and bake for 30 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  milk
  1                     egg yolk
  2            packets  vanilla rennet
  1                cup  cold water
  1              pound  granulated sugar
  2             pounds  brown sugar
  1                     cinnamon stick

Pour the milk into a pan over moderate heat and whisk in the egg yolk.  Stir in the vanilla rennet and remove from the heat and pour into a large bowl to set for about 10 minutes.  When it starts to set, place in the refrigerator to chill.

Pour the cold water into a saucepan over moderate heat and add both the sugars.  Stir to dissolve and add the cinnamon stick.  Mixture should clear in about 8 minutes.

Remove the set junket from the refrigerator and place on low heat.  Very slowly, a little at a time, pour in the cinnamon-flavored syrup with the cinnamon stick.  This will separate the rennet into little pieces.  Cook for 1 1/2 hours over low heat.

When cooked, (it will curd tightly), remove from the heat and allow to cool.  Place in the refrigerator to thoroughly chill, ice cold in fact.

Serve in bowls.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === WHITE SAUCE ===
  1 1/2         ounces  butter
  1 1/2         ounces  flour
  16            ounces  milk
  1                     bay leaf
  1                     whole clove
  2                     parsley stalks
     1/4         ounce  onion
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === TENDERLOIN ===
  3             ounces  clarified butter
  12            ounces  chicken livers -- washed, and
                        trimmed of tendons
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  oregano
  1              ounce  brandy
  2             ounces  butter
  4             pieces  beef tenderloin - (8 oz ea)
  3             ounces  onion -- diced
  4             ounces  pimento -- finely chopped
  16            slices  prosciutto ham
  4             ounces  red wine
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley

For Sauce:  Melt butter in saucepan over moderate heat and stir in flour.  Blend together well.  Remove pan from heat and add milk gradually.  Return to heat and bring to boil, stirring constantly.  Make a sachet of the bay leaf, clove, parsley stalks, and onion.  Add to simmering sauce and reduce heat to low; cook for 15 minutes.  Season with salt and white pepper.  Set aside until needed.

Heat 1 ounce clarified butter in frying pan on high heat.  Add livers, season with salt and pepper, and cook until just done.  Do not overcook!  Stir in 1 1/4 cups white sauce, 1 teaspoon oregano and 1 ounce brandy.  Pour into blender and puree.  Add 1 tablespoon butter and continue to puree for 4 minutes more.  Place in bowl and chill until required.

Cut tenderloin down center, but not completely through.  Open steak and beat flat with rolling pin.  Spread diced onion on steak and pat down.  Cover with 1/2 of pimento and 2 ounces chicken liver pate.  Roll steak up.  Cover steak with prosciutto and tie string to secure roll, every 1 1/2 inches, or 4 times.  Continue this procedure with remaining beef tenderloins.  Cut in between strings to separate meat into individual portions, each roll still tied.

Pour 1 ounce clarified butter into large frying pan over medium heat and fry roll-ups, 2 minutes on each side.  Remove from pan, cut off strings and keep meat warm on serving platter.

Drain off as much of the fatty juices as possible and add remainder of diced onion saute quickly to meat residue.  Pour in red wine and cook down.  Add remaining pimento.  Stir in remaining fresh butter and parsley.  Pour over fillets.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                cup  bread crumbs
  2                     oranges -- rinds peeled,
                        piths removed, pulp segmented
  2          teaspoons  arrowroot -- mixed with
     1/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar

                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Carefully remove bones from lamb, except for the last "shin" bone.  Scrape meat off bones.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a large saucepan, add 1/4 cup clarified butter and onions, carrots, and leeks.  Stir and add in bones and 2 cups cold water.  Raise heat and bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer and reduce by half.  Season with sprig of parsley, bay leaves, and crystallized salt.

Heat small frying pan.  Add bread crumbs and pour remaining butter on top.  Cook gently.  Add orange segments and continue to cook.  Meanwhile, combine orange rind and 3/4 cup water in small pan and bring to a boil.  Add arrowroot and sugar and reduce to low heat until it begins to thicken to a glaze.  Transfer bread crumbs and orange segments to a mixing bowl.  Season stuffing with Grand Marnier, salt, white pepper, and chopped parsley.

Stuff lamb and close pouch with skewers, lacing up with string in between, like a big boot.  Make shallow diagonal slashes over top of lamb.  Season flour with salt and pepper.  Dust lamb with flour.  Place in baking dish and roast for 1 hour 40 minutes.

Remove lamb from oven and place in a bain marie (small baking dish set in a larger baking pan which is filled half way with water).  Increase heat to 500 degrees and cook for another 15 minutes.  Baste with orange glaze.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2 1/4           cups  flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda

  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  2                     eggs
  2              small  ripe bananas -- abt 1 cup mashed
     1/4           cup  plain yogurt
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  sugar
  1              pound  salted butter
  6                     eggs
     1/8           cup  sifted cocoa
     1/4           cup  very strong coffee
     1/4           cup  Tia Maria

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt and set aside.  Combine butter and sugar, beating until almost white.  Add eggs, 1 at a time, then bananas.  Stir in yogurt and vanilla.  Fold in combined dry ingredients a little at a time until completely incorporated and mixture is smooth.

Pour into buttered and floured cake tin and bake for 40 minutes.  Turn onto wire rack to cool.  Regrease cake tin with butter only and set aside.

For Filling:  Beat together sugar and butter until almost white.  Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating thoroughly before each addition.  Mix together cocoa and coffee.  Then add Tia Maria to coffee/cocoa mixture and add all to filling.

Cut cake into 2 layers and place 1 layer in bottom of greased cake pan.  Cover with half of filling and then the remaining layer of cake.  Top with remaining filling.  To rid cake of air holes, hold it 12 inches from table and drop it so it lands flat.  Repeat this twice.  Cover cake with plastic wrap and freeze for 2 hours.  Serve ice cold with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Rabbit


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     rabbit - (3 lbs) -- ribcage, saddle,
                        and backbone removed, skin left intact,
                        tenderloin reserved, kidneys, liver minced
  1              piece  smoked bacon - (1 lb) -- rind removed,
                        cut into long 1/2"-square strips
     1/4           cup  brandy
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  thyme
  1              pound  veal tenderloin -- minced
  1              pound  pork tenderloin -- minced
  2                     eggs
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  3        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  2          teaspoons  thyme
     1/4           cup  clarified butter

Combine rabbit tenderloin, bacon strips, brandy, salt and pepper, and thyme.  Marinate for at least 1 and up to 12 hours.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine veal, pork and rabbit liver and kidneys with eggs.  Season with salt and pepper, garlic, parsley and thyme.  Strain brandy out of marinating bacon and add to stuffing, beating well.

Stuff 1/2 of forcemeat tightly into rabbit cavity, keeping a 2-inch clearance at either end.  Lay rabbit tenderloin and bacon strips on top and cover with remaining stuffing.  Truss or pin rabbit together.  Tie rabbit loosely with string every 2 inches, since the stuffing will expand during roasting.  Place rabbit in roasting pan, coat with clarified butter and roast for 1 1/2 hours.

To serve, remove pins and string and cut rabbit into 2-inch thick slices, like a terrine.  Cut shoulders and haunch in two and serve on a bed of buttered noodles.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  marjoram
  1           teaspoon  rosemary
  2          teaspoons  thyme
  1           teaspoon  basil
     1/4           cup  light salad oil
  1                     baby chicken - (abt 1 lb) -- boned, with
                        skin intact
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  6             ounces  pork fat -- cubed
  1             medium  onion -- finely sliced
  1                     shallot -- finely sliced
  1                     bay leaf
  8             ounces  chicken livers -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  clarified butter

Combine marjoram, rosemary, 1 teaspoon thyme and basil with salad oil in small pot.  Simmer over low heat for 10 minutes.  Strain through fine sieve and discard herbs.  Drown bird in oil and add wine.  Marinate for 3 hours, refrigerated

Meanwhile, fry pork fat in heavy saucepan until mostly rendered.  Remove and discard crisp fatty pieces.  Add onion and shallot.  Lower heat and add remaining thyme and bay leaf.  Add chicken livers and cook until browned.  Remove bay leaf and pass liver mixture through a meat grinder or sieve.

After bird has marinated, preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Dry bird thoroughly inside and out with paper towels and place sieved 'pate' into rear cavity.  Remold bird to its natural shape and secure both ends with poultry pins, then truss.  Season bird with salt and white pepper, coat with clarified butter, and roast at 350 degrees for 45 to 60 minutes, until nicely browned and tender.  Remove from the oven.

Turn up oven to 450 degrees.  Cut 1 (20- by 18-inch) sheet of parchment paper in a heart shape.  Grease well with clarified butter or oil.  Place cooked chicken on one side of the heart, remove string and pins and enclose it in paper, pleating edges together to secure (use staples, if you have to!).

Heat a little oil in large skillet and add parchment package.  The air inside will expand, forcing the package to 'blow up'.  When fully expanded, grease the outer surface and place in oven until lightly browned and remove immediately.

To serve, open bag and cut bird in two.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

                        === FILLING ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
  6        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  chicken stock
  2              large  chicken breasts -- boned
                        Clarified butter -- as needed
  6        tablespoons  dried tarragon
                        Salt -- to taste

  4             slices  prosciutto
  3          teaspoons  caviar -- (optional)
  2          teaspoons  chopped chives

For Batter:  Place flour in bowl.  Gradually add eggs and milk, beating continuously.  Season with salt and pepper.  Set aside in a cool place for 4 hours.

For Filling:  Melt butter in saucepan over moderate heat.  Gradually add in flour and cook 3 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add chicken stock, whisking continuously until thoroughly blended.  Bring to boil and cook 3 minutes.  Reduce heat to gentle simmer.

In frying pan, cook chicken in a little clarified butter over moderate heat.  Rub tarragon between palms over chicken to coarsely grind.  Season with salt and white pepper.  After 4 minutes, turn breasts over, reduce heat and cook until done.

  12            ounces  tomatoes -- roughly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3             ounces  white wine
  2             ounces  salted butter
  4             ounces  small white mushrooms
  1                     lime -- juiced
  4             ounces  tiny finger shrimp
  2        tablespoons  sour cream
  1           teaspoon  arrowroot -- mixed with
  1              ounce  rum
  1              bunch  watercress
  1              ounce  oil
  1              ounce  white wine vinegar

Place lobster in large bowl of 96.8 degree water to drown.

Bring large pot of water to boil and add 12 allspice berries and bay leaves.  Remove claws and legs from lobster.  Reserve legs and add claws and tail to water and cover pot.  Cook 3 minutes for each pound, about 6 minutes total.  Plunge in bowl of ice water when done, to stop cooking.  Once cooled, cut lobster in 1/2 lengthwise and rinse.  Remove meat from tail and claws and cut into small pieces and set aside.  Rinse tail shell and reserve.

In small pan, add remaining allspice and 1/2 of rum.  Heat on medium-low heat.

Place lobster legs in blender and crush.  Strain allspice/rum mixture into blender with legs and puree.

Heat 1 tablespoon clarified butter in frying pan on medium heat.  Add shallot and garlic.  Stir in the tomatoes and season generously with salt and pepper.  Strain pureed legs and rum mixture through a fine sieve into tomato mixture and add white wine; boil, stirring well.  Sieve all this into a clean saucepan and reduce to 3/8 cup.

Preheat warming oven to 400 degrees.  In a small frying pan, melt fresh butter and cook mushrooms.  Stir in lime juice.  Add shrimp and lobster meat.  Push contents of pan to edge, add remaining rum and flame.  When flames have died down, stir in sour cream and tomato-lobster stock and reduce again.  Stir in arrowroot mixture.

Place tail shells in the oven to warm on a heat-proof platter.  Toss watercress with oil and vinegar.  Remove shells from the oven and spoon lobster mixture into heated shells and garnish with dressed watercress.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  4              drops  vanilla extract
     1/2        gallon  round container vanilla ice cream
     1/2        gallon  round container strawberry ice cream
  16            ounces  chocolate sauce

Combine walnuts and biscuits.  Add butter and mash thoroughly.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Butter a 10-inch diameter springform pan and press biscuit crust into base and 2-inches up side.  Cover this crust with waxed paper, cut to fit bottom exactly.  Fill pan with split peas, up to height of sides and bake "blind" for 1 hour.  Let cool while still filled.

When crust is cooled, removed pea weights and paper.  Meanwhile, whip egg whites with cold water and salt until peaked.  Fold in sugar a little at a time.  Add vanilla and keep cool.

Unmold ice cream from containers and cut horizontally through middle of each to yield 4 discs total.  Place disks in pie crust, alternating strawberry and vanilla flavors.  Top with meringue, letting it fall all around the ice cream.  Set in freezer for 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Remove pie from freezer and place in oven to brown meringue tips.  You may also use a blow torch instead.  Serve with chocolate sauce.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GLAZE ===
  4            squares  semisweet chocolate
  1         tablespoon  Grand Marnier
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/4           cup  butter
                        === MOUSSE ===
  1                     orange -- rind cut
                        into matchsticks
  2        tablespoons  fine sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
     3/4           cup  sponge cake
     1/4           cup  Grand Marnier
  8            squares  semisweet chocolate
  6                     eggs -- separated, and
                        whites beaten stiffly
     3/4           cup  butter -- cut 1" dice

For Glaze:  To melt chocolate, pour just enough boiling water over to cover.  When soft to touch, carefully pour off water.  Add Grand Marnier and 1 tablespoon of water.  Combine well, remove pan from heat and add butter.  Stir until smooth and shiny.  Let cool.

For Mousse:  Boil orange rind in water for 5 minutes.  Drain.  Place rind back in saucepan with sugar and 2 tablespoons water.  Cook over medium-high heat until crystallized.  Remove from saucepan immediately.

Soak cake in 1/4 cup Grand Marnier for 10 minutes, then squeeze between hands.

Melt chocolate in same manner as for glaze.  Place chocolate over low heat and add egg yolks.  Beat until well combined.  Removed saucepan from heat and add butter gradually, beating until butter is incorporated.  Add candied peel and fold in liqueur-soaked sponge cake.

Fold 1/3 of the beaten egg whites into chocolate mixture and combine the rest of the egg whites carefully.  Pour into buttered mold and refrigerate for 4 hours.

To unmold, dip outside of mold in hot water for a few seconds and then invert onto a dish.  Coat with cooled glaze and serve chilled.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A very rich French chocolate mousse.

Meanwhile, place whole chicken in pot with water to cover.  Add bay leaf, thyme and parsley.  Cover and simmer 25 minutes.  Remove chicken and cool.  Cut into 1-inch cubes.

Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat and add flour.  Stir well and cook 1 minute to make roux.  Strain 5/8 cup chicken stock and add to roux, whisking well, to make sauce.  Season with salt and pepper and add cream and wine.  Whisk again until smooth and simmer for 5 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Place 1/2 of chicken in bottom of pie dish, cover with onion, then celery, then ham.  Heat a little clarified butter in small saucepan and fry mushrooms for 1 minute.  Add mushrooms to pie dish, along with lemon juice.  Top this with remaining chicken and pour sauce on top of it all.  Secure pastry to pie dish with water.  Cut air hole in top of dough and paint dough with egg yolk.  Bake 40 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MERINGUES ===
  3                     egg whites
  1              pinch  salt
  1           teaspoon  cold water
     3/4           cup  sugar -- sifted
  5              drops  red food coloring
  5          teaspoons  cocoa
                        === CREME PATISSIERE ===
  1                     vanilla bean
                        = (or 5 drops extract)
  3 3/4           cups  milk
  6                     egg yolks
     3/8           cup  sugar
     3/4          cups  flour
     1/8           cup  Tia Maria
     1/8           cup  Grand Marnier
     1/8           cup  Kirsch
  2              pints  Neopolitan ice cream -- for serving

For Meringues:  Preheat oven to 225 degrees.  Grease and flour cookie sheet.  Ready 3 piping bags with 1/2-inch nozzle.

Whisk egg whites until stiff and peaked.  Add good pinch salt and water and continue to whisk.  When whisk begins to leave a trail through meringue, gradually add in sugar, folding in last bit with a metal spoon.  Meringue should be very stiff and glossy.

Place 1/3 mixture into 1 piping bag.  Pipe in very small, even round shapes on cookie sheet to make a total of about 10 mini meringues.  Mix another 1/3 of meringue with food coloring and pipe second round of meringues in same manner as first.  Add cocoa to remaining meringue and repeat piping as before.  Place in oven for 2 hours.

Remove from oven and chip a small hole in bottom of meringues just big enough to fit small pastry tip.  Cool on wire rack.  If making meringues a day ahead, store in airtight container.

For Creme Patisserie:  In small pot, combine vanilla and milk and heat to just before boiling.  Place yolks in large bowl.  Add sugar and beat briskly until light and creamy.  Gently stir in flour, a little at a time.  Gradually add heated milk to yolks and combine well.  Pour into non-stick pan and cook gently over low heat stirring constantly, then set aside and cool for 2 hours.

The cream will continue to thicken as it cools.  When cooled, divide custard into 3 bowls and flavor each with a different liqueur.

To serve, place ice cream on chilled serving dish.  With a small tipped pastry bag, pipe the Tia Maria Cream into the chocolate meringues.  Pipe the Kirsch cream into the plain meringues.  Finally, pipe the Grand Marnier cream into the pink ones.  Arrange meringues over top and sides of ice cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        === HATEBLIKSEM ===
  3                     yards piping casing
  4               cups  cold water
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4                     sour apples -- peeled, and
                        covered with water until needed
  2                     sweet apples -- peeled, and

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  butter

Cook tripe with onion in milk for 2 hours.  Let cool and mince once.

Combine tripe, beef, and pork in bowl.  Add garlic and spices.  Cover with a clean cloth and rest in the refrigerator overnight.

Soak pig's casing in cold water, cover, and let stand overnight, refrigerated.

Place cold water in saucepan and season with salt.  Cut apples and potatoes into 1/4-inch thick slices and add to pan.  Cook, covered, for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, drain pig's casings and run warm water through it by placing one end over faucet.

Attach casing to end of sausage funnel on a mixer and place seasoned sausage meat onto the scoop.  Gently force the sausage mixture through the funnel into the casing.  When 12 inches long, tie ends of casing together, forming a ring.  Repeat two more times, making sausage links slightly shorter each time, so they will all fit nicely inside each other in frying pan.

Place in frying pan, the smaller rings inside the bigger ones.  Cover with water and cook for 7 minutes.  Drain and cool.

Add clarified butter to pan.  Prick sausages and add to pan.  Cook 5 minutes, turning once.

Drain potatoes and apples and mash together.  Season with salt and pepper and mix in butter.  Return to heat to dry out slightly.

To serve, scoop potatoes and apples onto platter.  Place sausage rings on top.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sponge cake - (9" by 2" deep) -- side, top, and
                        bottom crusts removed
  1                     papaya -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
  3                     limes -- 1 peeled, pulp
                        sliced, skin reserved, 2 juiced
  20            ounces  cold water
  6              drops  red food coloring
  4             ounces  sugar
  3             ounces  light rum
     1/2         ounce  crystallized ginger -- chopped
  3           packages  gelatin - (1/4 oz ea) -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  rum
  10            ounces  cream -- whipped with
  1              ounce  icing sugar
  10            ounces  strawberries -- hulled, washed,
                        and cut in halves

Chill 10-inch bread tin mold in freezer.  Cut trimmed cakes in 1/2 to get 4 layers.  Soak papaya with lime juice.

In large saucepan, heat together cold water, food coloring, sugar, 2 ounces rum and crystallized ginger for 10 minutes.  Bring to a boil and stir in lime peel; cook 3 more minutes.  Remove peel and discard.  Add 2 tablespoons of this syrup to gelatin/rum mixture and mix well.  Return all to pot, making sure gelatin is thoroughly dissolved.  When mixture cools slightly, pour into chilled mold up to 1-inch deep.  Place over bowl of crushed ice in freezer to set.

Remove mold from freezer and add another layer of jelly, tilting mold to coat evenly.  Fit 1 cake layer, cut 1-inch smaller than mold, into mold then sprinkle with 1 tablespoon rum.  Top cake layer with 1/3 of whipped cream, then add papaya, another cake layer, another tablespoon rum, sliced lime, then 1/3 more cream.

Place strawberries, round side out, on top of gelatin around cake layer and place remaining berries on top of cream.  Pour remaining gelatin along sides of mold over strawberries, then put on last cake layer and spread remaining cream on top.  Chill in refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight.

To unmold:  Very carefully run a blunt edged knife around inside of mold.  Dip mold in bowl of hot water for 6 seconds to loosen.  Invert onto serving dish and garnish with extra whipping cream, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  whole onions -- peeled
                        Clarified butter -- to taste
  1                     garlic clove -- smashed
  1 1/2         pounds  tomatoes -- cored, quartered
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  sugar -- or to taste
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
     1/2         pound  minced beef
  4             ounces  bacon slices -- cut thin pieces
     1/2      teaspoon  allspice
  2                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  finely-cut parsley stalks
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
                        = (or 20 fresh oregano leaves, chopped)
  1                     bay leaf
                        Roughly-chopped fresh parsley -- to garnish

Place onions in boiling salted water to cover.  Cook 10 minutes and drain.  Cut a thin slice off top of each onion and carefully squeeze out inside ribs, leaving 2 larger, outer ribs intact.  Finely chop inner ribs of 1 onion and set aside.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Heat enough clarified butter in saucepan to cover base.  When hot, add garlic, tomatoes, salt, pepper and sugar.  Add wine and boil gently, uncovered, for 10 minutes.

In another pan, heat some clarified butter and add onion innards and minced beef.  Brown meat and reduce heat, add bacon and season with salt, pepper and allspice.  Stir together and fry gently for 2 minutes.  Transfer meat mixture to bowl, add eggs, parsley stalks, basil and oregano.  Spoon this mixture into reserved large onion ribs.  Place onions in ovenproof dish.

Strain tomato sauce and pour around onion.  Add bay leaf to sauce.  Place in oven and cook 20 minutes.  Place baked onions on serving platter and quickly reduce sauce.  Strain over onions and garnish with chopped parsley leaves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1           teaspoon  flour
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  1                     avocado

Slice tenderloin tips down center, careful not to cut all the way through.  Pound meat flat with back of knife.  Preheat broiler.  Drain mushrooms, reserving liquid.

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in large frying pan over high heat and add garlic.  Cook for 1 minute, to release flavor, then add shallots, chiles and 1/2 sliced onion.  Add 4 ounces sherry, port and 3/8 cup liquid from mushrooms.  Bring marinade to boil.

Lay meat fillets in shallow dish, season with salt and pepper and strain marinade over them, reserving vegetables.  Return vegetables to pan and add beef stock.  Cook on high heat and reduce until syrupy, to about 1/4 cup.  Strain.

Rinse out pan and add 1 tablespoon olive oil and add remaining onion.  Remove fillets from marinade and dry lightly with paper towels.  Add reduced stock, marinade and mushrooms to onions.  Reduce.  Stir in 1/4 cup butter and cream.  Separately combine 1 teaspoon butter with flour.  Add this to sauce to thicken.  Add paprika and bring to a boil.  Add parsley.

Place fillets in broiling pan, brush with remaining olive oil and broil for 4 minutes on each side.  Cut avocado into quarters, peel and place pieces under broiler with tenderloin.

To serve, place pieces of avocado on platter, then top each with a tenderloin tip.  Add remaining sherry to broiler pan, then mix in simmering sauce.  Spoon sauce over meat and avocado pieces.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  veal sweetbreads
                        === PASTRY ===
  2               cups  flour -- sifted
  1              pinch  salt
     3/4           cup  butter -- cut 1/2" dice
     1/2           cup  water
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
                        Clarified butter -- as needed
  8             slices  bacon -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1                     lemon -- juiced

  30                    marjoram leaves
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten

Soak sweetbreads in cold water for 1 hour.  Rinse and place in pot.  Cover with additional cold water.  Bring slowly to a boil, then drain immediately and plunge into a bowl of cold water.  Remove skin and press sweetbreads between 2 plates.  Wrap plates in a towel, place a heavy weight on top, and compress for 30 minutes.  Blot sweetbreads dry after pressed.

To Assemble:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Heat clarified butter in pan.  When hot, add bacon and fry.  Line pie dish with half the bacon, cover with a layer of sweetbreads.  Add remaining bacon and remaining sweetbreads.  Moisten with lemon juice and cover with tomatoes.  Season with pepper and marjoram leaves.

Lightly brush lip of pie pan with water.  Cover filling with pastry and press down at edges to seal.  Trim off excess dough.  Cut vent holes in center and brush dough with egg.  Bake 45 minutes.
