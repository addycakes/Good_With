  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  strong black coffee
  1                cup  worcestershire sauce
  1                cup  ketchup
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar

                     Buffalo Bill Jr.'s Tex-Mex Steak

Recipe By     :Dick Jones, Actor
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground red pepper
  1              large  top sirloin steak, 1 1/2" thick
  1                can  black beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  1                cup  thick salsa
                        = (mild to hot, to your taste)
                        Fresh cilantro sprigs for garnish -- (optional)

In a small bowl or cup, combine chili powder, cumin, salt, and red pepper.  Trim the fat from the steak and press the seasoning mixture evenly into both sides of the steak.  Let it stand while you preheat the barbecue grill and until the coals have flamed down and have formed a gray covering ash.

Place the steak on the grill, 4 inches from the coals, and grill for 20 to 25 minutes for rare to medium meat (turning occasionally).  Remove the steak from the grill and let it stand for 10 minutes before carving.

Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the beans and salsa.  Mix until well blended.

Slice the steak on the bias, across the grain, and arrange on preheated serving platter.  Top with the salsa mixture and garnish with cilantro sprigs if desired.  Goes good wtih garlic-cheese toast and a tossed salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings (3 for the hungry ones).

In a small bowl or cup, combine chili powder, cumin, salt, and red pepper.  Trim the fat from the steak and press the seasoning mixture evenly into both sides of the steak.  Let it stand while you preheat the barbecue grill and until the coals have flamed down and have formed a gray covering ash.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the steak on the grill, 4 inches from the coals, and grill for 20 to 25 minutes for rare to medium meat (turning occasionally).  Remove the steak from the grill and let it stand for 10 minutes before carving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the beans and salsa.  Mix until well blended.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Slice the steak on the bias, across the grain, and arrange on preheated serving platter.  Top with the salsa mixture and garnish with cilantro sprigs if desired.  Goes good wtih garlic-cheese toast and a tossed salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings (3 for the hungry ones).

                 Buried Coal-Cooked Lobsters In The Shell

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     live lobsters - (2 1/2 lbs ea)
  5             pounds  damp seaweed
                        = (available from your fish seller)

Prepare an outdoor charcoal grill, filling the fire bed 6 to 8 inches deep.  Allow the coals to become ash covered.  Shake excess water from the seaweed if necessary and scatter half of it directly over the coals.

Dispatch the lobsters (see below) and place them on top of the steaming seaweed.  Cover the lobsters with the remaining seaweed and press down on it to force both lobsters and seaweed into the coals.

Cook the lobsters about 45 minutes, sprinkling the seaweed with 1/4 cup water every 10 minutes to keep it moist.  The lobsters are done when the shells are bright red.

Remove the seaweed with the tongs to a large platter.  Split the lobsters, place them on the seaweed, and serve.

Dispatching a lobster:  To kill a lobster instantly, place it on your cutting board (head away from you, tail facing) and insert the tip of a large chef's knife just behind the head.  To avoid muscular contractions, you can put the lobster in the freezer for a few minutes beforehand.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The only accompaniment you need with this meal is melted butter and plenty of napkins.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             pounds  pork spareribs
  1                can  cherry pie filling - (21 oz)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  spicy brown mustard
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce

Cut ribs into serving portions of 2 to 3 ribs each.  Put ribs in a large stockpot or Dutch oven; add water to cover ribs.  Season with salt, if desired.  Simmer, covered, for 45 to 50 minutes or until tender.  Drain; set aside.

Meanwhile, purÃe cherry pie filling in an electric blender or food processor.  Set aside.

Heat olive oil in a large skillet.  Add onion; cook, stirring, until onion is tender.  Add pie filling, soy sauce, mustard, ginger and Worcestershire sauce; mix well.  Simmer, uncovered, 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Reserve some sauce to serve with ribs.

Place ribs on gas grill over low heat or on charcoal grill 4 to 6 inches from slow coals.  Turn ribs 3 to 4 times and brush frequently with cherry sauce.  Cook 20 to 25 minutes, or until thoroughly coated with cherry sauce.  Discard any sauce used to barbecue the meat.  Serve ribs with the reserved cherry sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This is a tasty departure from tomato-based barbecue sauces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  kosher salt
                        = (or 1/2 cup table salt)
  2              whole  chickens -- cut into legs,
                        thighs, breasts and wings, skin removed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4              large  garlic cloves -- finely minced
  1                cup  juice from 5 lemons
                        = (limes also work well)
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme leaves
                        = (or 1 1/2 tspns dried thyme)

Dissolve salt in 2 quarts water in large bowl or two 1-gallon zipper-lock plastic bags.  Add chicken parts (seal zipper-locks bags, if using), and refrigerate until fully seasoned, about 1 1/2 hours.  Remove chicken from brine, rinse very well, dry thoroughly with paper towels, and season with pepper to taste.

Half an hour before cooking, ignite about 5 quarts hardwood charcoal or charcoal briquettes in a chimney and burn until completely covered with thin coating of light gray ash, 20 to 30 minutes.  Dump out coals and, spread coals over 2/3 of grill bottom, leaving 1/3 with no coals; position rack over coals and heat for 10 minutes.  Coals should be medium-hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above the grill surface for 4 seconds).

Heat olive oil and garlic in small saucepan over low heat until garlic starts to turn a light brown.  Remove from heat, add lemon juice in a large, shallow, nonreactive 13- by 9-inch baking dish or similar pan; set aside.  (Dry herbs may be added at this point; fresh herbs should not be added until just before coating chicken.)

Place chicken skin-side down on rack directly over to empty side in case of flare-ups.  Keep turning and moving pieces to ensure even cooking, until chicken is golden brown, 15 to 17 minutes for legs and wings and 18 to 20 minutes for thighs and breasts.

When chicken pieces are well colored, place them in lemon sauce and roll to coat completely.  Return pieces to side of grill with no coals; heat until lemon sauce flavors meat, about 5 minutes longer, turning each piece and brushing with sauce once or twice more.

Return chicken to pan and roll in lemon sauce once more; serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  It's recommended that you brine your chicken for 1 1/2 hours before cooking.  This helps retain the moisture in the chicken while it is being grilled and is especially important because the chicken is skinless.

Cut each chicken thigh into 12 small pieces.  On a bamboo skewer, lace 3 pieces of chicken alternately with 1 piece green bell pepper and 1 piece red bell pepper.  Set aside.

In large shallow baking dish, combine all remaining ingredients except the orange to make marinade.  Dip chicken skewers in mixture to coat; arrange skewers in baking dish, cover and marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight.

At cooking time, prepare Cranberry Plum Sauce; keep warm until needed.  Drain chicken.  Place skewers over hot charcoals, grilling for 3 to 5 minutes; turn once or until chicken is done, about 2 minutes on each side.

Arrange on serving platter around bowl of Cranberry Plum Sauce.  Garnish with orange slices.

Cranberry Plum Sauce:  In medium saucepan, mix all ingredients.  Whisk mixture over medium heat until well-blended and hot.  Pour into small serving bowl.  Serve warm with chicken.

This recipe yields 24 appetizers for 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     baking potatoes - (abt 8 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  margarine or butter -- melted
     1/2           cup  picante sauce
  1                cup  shredded cheddar cheese - (4 oz)
  3             slices  bacon -- crisp-cooked and cru
                        = (or 1/2 cup finely-chopped
                        fully-cooked ham)
                        Chopped tomato -- (optional)
                        Sliced green onion -- (optional)
     1/2           cup  dairy sour cream

Scrub potatoes; prick with a fork.  Tear off six 18- by 9-inch pieces of heavy foil.  Fold each in half to make a 9- by 9-inch square.  Wrap each potato in a foil square.  Grill on an uncovered grill directly over medium-slow coals for 1 to 2 hours or until tender.  Potatoes may be baked or micro-cooked to this point.

To bake:  Prick potatoes with a fork.  Bake in a 375 degree oven for 50 to 60 minutes or until tender.

To micro-cook:  Place 3 of the pricked potatoes in the microwave oven.  Micro-cook on 100% power (high) for 13 to 16 minutes or until tender, rearranging once after 7 minutes.  Repeat with remaining potatoes.

Unwrap potatoes.  Allow to cool enough to handle.

Cut potatoes in half lengthwise.  Scoop out potato pulp, leaving 1/4-inch thick shell.  (Save potato pulp for another use.)  Brush the inside of each potato shell with melted margarine.  Spoon 2 teaspoons picante sauce into each potato shell.  Sprinkle each with cheese.  Add bacon or ham.

Grill potato skins on an uncovered grill directly over medium coals for 10 to 12 minutes or until skins are crisp.  Sprinkle with tomato and green onion, if desired.  Top with sour cream.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

                              Grilled Salmon

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     center-cut salmon fillets - (6 oz ea) -- skin intact,
                        pinbones removed
                        Sea salt -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  dry mustard
                        = (such as Coleman's)
     1/2           cup  white sugar
  1                cup  cold water

Prepare a charcoal grill.  When the charcoal is hot and has a coat of white ash over it push all of the coals to one side of the grill.

Pat the salmon pieces dry.  Salt very lightly on both sides.  Place the salmon pieces skin-side down, on the cool side of the grill.  Cover the salmon, in groups of two or three if necessary, with a small domed cover, such as a stainless steel mixing bowl.  It is important to use a domed cover to enclose the fish.  It is the slow hot air circulation that cooks the fish, not the hot coals.

Grill the salmon for 15 minutes without turning.  Meanwhile, mix the mustard powder and sugar and whisk in the water until it has reached the consistency of heavy cream.

During the last 3 or 4 minutes of cooking, lift the domes and brush each piece of fish with olive oil.  Replace the domes to finish the cooking.  The salmon will be a whitish pink color and very tender to the touch and the skin will be brown and very crisp.

Serve each piece of salmon skin-side up with a simple salad, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  coriander seeds
  2        tablespoons  white peppercorns
     1/4           cup  sesame seeds
  2 1/2   fluid ounces  soy sauce
  1        fluid ounce  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  dark brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  liquid hot pepper seasoning
  2             pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut large chunks
  4                     green onions -- chopped fine
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  2                     red bell peppers -- halved, seeded,
                        and quartered
  2                     red onions -- peeled, quartered
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  2                     limes -- quartered, garnish

Make the shake:  In a small sautÃ pan, combine the coriander, peppercorns, and sesame seeds and toast over medium heat, shaking the pan, until the first wisp of smoke appears, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool.

Place the toasted spices on a flat surface and place a small sautÃ pan on top of them.  Holding the handle with one hand, place the other hand palm side down in the center of the pan and apply pressure, rolling the pan over the spices to crack them.

Make the dipping sauce:  In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, and liquid hot pepper seasoning; mix well, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the chicken chunks, scallions, ginger, and sesame oil and toss well.  Thread the chicken onto skewers alternately with the bell pepper and onion chunks, sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, and grill over a medium fire for 5 to 7 minutes per side.  To check for doneness: Cut into one of the pieces of chicken and check to be sure it is opaque all the way through.

Place the chicken skewers on a platter, sprinkle with the shake, garnish with the lime wedges, and serve with the dipping sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                            Grilled Shellfish

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks)
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  crushed red pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  48                    assorted shellfish
                        = (such as scallops, clams, oysters, and
                        mussels, scrubbed and debearded)
  4                     thick slices peasant bread
     3/4           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Heat charcoal grill until coals are white-hot, 30 to 40 minutes.  Place baking pan on grill; add butter, lemon juice, wine, garlic, red pepper, salt, and pepper.

As butter melts, arrange shellfish in a single layer on the grill.  Cook until shells pop open, 2 to 5 minutes; meanwhile, toast bread on edge of grill.

Transfer opened shells to pan of sauce; sprinkle with parsley; discard unopened shells.  Serve immediately with bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  While many people cook crustaceans such as shrimp and even lobster on the grill, few people realize that you can grill other types of shellfish as well.

Though the mollusks are prepared on a grill, the cooking method involves a steaming process, since the heat causes them to steam in their own juices, with their shells acting as miniature pans.  The oysters, clams, and mussels have built-in "timers" -- their shells are tightly closed when fresh, but they pop open when they are done cooking.  Any shell that doesn't open at all should be discarded -- it is probably bad.  Scallops are an exception to the closed-shell rule.  If purchased in their shells, they are still alive, and so they will be slightly open.  You will have to watch them carefully to monitor the cooking progress.

Prepare the sauce in a baking pan on the grill, and put the shellfish into the pan when they are done cooking.  The juices from the mollusks will mix with the sauce, infusing it with flavor.  You can serve your guests directly from this pan.  Toast some bread on the grill to serve along with these succulent morsels, and you have an easy, delectable first course.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9              large  garlic cloves
  3             quarts  water
     1/2           cup  kosher salt
     1/4           cup  black peppercorns -- plus
  2        tablespoons  black peppercorns
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  dried thyme -- crumbled
  1           teaspoon  whole allspice
     1/2                bay leaf
  12                    pork rib chops, 1 1/2" thk
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed) -- plus
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar - (packed)
  2 1/2    tablespoons  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt

Prepare grill.  Remove pork chops from brine, discarding brine and any spices still adhering to chops, and pat dry.  Season chops with salt and pepper and sprinkle both sides of each chop with about 1/2 tablespoon spice rub, patting it into meat.

Grill chops on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, 10 to 12 minutes on each side, or until a meat thermometer diagonally inserted 2 inches into centers registers 155 degrees.

Transfer chops to a platter and let stand 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  margarine or butter
  2               cups  sliced fresh mushrooms
  1             medium  onion -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  snipped parsley
     1/2           cup  rolled oats
     1/3           cup  milk
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     beaten egg
  1 1/2         pounds  lean ground beef
  2        tablespoons  ketchup
  1           teaspoon  prepared mustard

In a small skillet heat margarine or butter over medium heat until melted.  Add mushrooms and onion; cook over medium heat about 5 minutes or until vegetables are tender.  Stir in parsley.  Cool slightly.

Stir together rolled oats, milk, salt, pepper, and egg.  Add ground beef and mix well.  Place on waxed paper and flatten to a l2- by 8-inch rectangle.  Spoon mushroom and onion mixture evenly onto meat.  Roll up, starting with 8-inch end.  Seal seam and ends by pinching together.  Stir together ketchup and mustard.

Arrange preheated coals around a drip pan in a covered grill.  Test for medium-low heat above pan.

Tear off a 24- by 18-inch piece of heavy foil.  Fold in half to make a double thickness of foil that measures 18 by 12 inches.  Trim to make a 12-inch square.  Cut several slits in the foil square.  Place foil on grill over drip pan.

Place meat loaf on foil.  Cover and grill for 50 to 60 minutes or until no pink remains in meat, brushing with ketchup mixture during the last 5 minutes of grilling.  Remove meat loaf from grill; cover with foil.  Let stand 15 minutes before slicing.

                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7              large  plum tomatoes
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1                cup  feta cheese -- crumbled
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh mint
                        = (or basil or basil pesto)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Lightly grease grill and preheat barbecue to high.

Halve tomatoes lengthwise.  Squeeze out juice and seeds.  Using a knife, cut out centre pulp from halves, forming tomato shells.  Finely chop pulp and place in a bowl.  Finely chop 2 tomato halves, then add to bowl.

Brush remaining tomato halves all over with oil.  Place on grill, cut-side down, over high heat.  Barbecue, without turning, until marked on cut side, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, stir feta, mint and pepper into tomatoes in bowl.  After 5 minutes of grilling, remove tomato halves.  Spoon tomato-cheese mixture into hollow of each grilled tomato half, pressing filling gently.

Place tomatoes back on grill, filling-side up.  Cover and grill until tomatoes are hot, from 4 to 5 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Filled with herbed feta and fresh mint, these warm tomatoes are fantastic as a side dish or appetizer.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     beaten egg
     1/3           cup  fine dry bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped green sweet pepper
  2                     green onions -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

                     Jamaican Syle Barbecued Chicken

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (abt 4 lbs)
                        Jamaican Barbeque Sauce -- (see recipe)
  2               cups  wood chips -- soaked in water
                        for 1 hour, then drained
                        === MARINADE ===
  8             medium  scallions -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2                Scotch bonnet chile - (to 1) -- seeded, chopped fine
                        = (or abt 1 tspn Scotch bonnet hot sauce)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  sweet paprika
  1           teaspoon  thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Marinate the chicken:  Combine all of the marinade ingredients in a food processor and puree to a paste.  Run your fingers under the breast skin of the chicken to loosen it.  Spoon half of the marinade into the neck and central cavities and rub the remaining marinade over the breast meat under the skin.  Put the chicken in a sturdy plastic bag and marinate in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours, turning the bag a couple of times.

Light a grill for indirect cooking (with wood or charcoal on the periphery of the grill and meat in middle) and set a drip pan in the center.

When the temperature reaches 350 degree, toss the wood chips onto the coals or add them to a smoker box.

Remove the chicken from the bag and set it in the center of the grill, away from the flames.  Cover tightly and cook for 1 hour.

Brush the chicken with the barbecue sauce and cook, covered, for about 45 minutes longer; baste with sauce from time to time.  The chicken is done when it is deep brown and the juices run clear when the inner thigh is pierced.  Let the chicken rest for about 15 minutes before carving.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Beer Recommendation:  A dry, crisp pilsner is perfect to balance the heat and the sweet in this roasted chicken.  One excellent choice; Paulaner Premium Pilsner from Germany.

Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  paprika
  2 1/2    tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2 1/2    tablespoons  salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chili powder
  1 1/2    tablespoons  garlic powder
  1 1/2    tablespoons  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  ground red (cayenne) pepper - (to 2)
  3                     full slabs of "St. Louis-cut" pork spareri
                        = (preferably 3 lbs ea or less, and
                        trimmed of chine bone and brisket flap)
                        Sweet tomato-based barbecue sauce

The night before you plan to barbecue, combine brown sugar, paprika, black pepper, salt, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder and red pepper.  Apply about 1/3 of spice mixture evenly to ribs, reserving remainder.  Place ribs in a plastic bag; refrigerate overnight.

Before you begin to barbecue, sprinkle the ribs lightly but thoroughly with spice mixture, reserving remainder.  Let the ribs sit at room temperature for 30 to 40 minutes.

Prepare smoker, bringing the temperature to 200 degrees to 220 degrees.

Transfer ribs to smoker.  Cook about 4 hours, turning and sprinkling ribs with spice mixture after about 2 hours.  In the last 45 minutes of cooking, slather ribs once or twice with barbecue sauce.

When ready, the meat will bend easily between the ribs, and the sauce will be gooey and sticky.  Allow slabs to sit for 10 minutes before slicing them into individual ribs.  Serve with more sauce on top or on the side and plenty of napkins.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

              Mayan Swordfish Coated With Annatto And Chili

Recipe By     :Marlena Spieler
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  annatto seeds -- cooked,
                        plus 2 tbsp of cooking liquid, see * Note
  2             cloves  garlic -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse salt
                        Spicy Mexican Marinade, (see recipe)
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed cinnnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
  4                     swordfish steaks - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  1                     handful bay leaves -- to scent bbq
                        Bay leaves -- for garnish
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish
                        === FOR SERVING ===
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1                     avocado -- diced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro (to 3)
                        Pickled chilies -- diced

* Note:  Cooked Annatto Seeds - For one tablespoon of seeds, instructions are to place the seeds in 1/2 cup water in a small pan.  Bring to a boil, simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, then remove from heat and leave the seeds overnight to soften.  Alternatively, omit cooking and soaking and grind the seeds in a coffee grinder.

Puree the annatto seeds and the liquid with the garlic and salt, then mix with the Spicy Mexican Marinade, adding the cinnamon and cloves.

Rub the annatto-spice mixture on both sides of the fish steaks.  Place in a shallow dish and marinate at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes, or in the refrigerator for up to 3 hours.

Prepare a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill.  If using dried bay leaves, soak them in cold water until softened.  Place the bay leaves on the coals to produce fragrant smoke.

Remove the fish steaks from the marinade.  Cook the steaks over medium-hot coals for about 5 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through on one side, then turn, using a large spatula, and cook the other side.

Serve immediately, sprinkled with chopped onion, avocado, cilantro, tomatoes, and pickled chilies.  Garnish with bay leaves and lemon wedges.

Variation:  Mayan Fish with Tropical Flavor - To serve, omit the diced vegetables.  Drizzle unsweetened canned coconut milk over the hot fish and serve with diced banana and tomato and lime wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This traditional recipe, from the Caribbean shores of Mexico, dates back to Mayan times.  A whole fish such as snapper, tilapia, or bass may be used instead of the fish steaks or fillets.  Corn tortillas and black beans make delicious accompaniments.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           envelope  dry yeast
     3/4           cup  warm water -- plus
  2        tablespoons  warm water -- (105 to 115 deg)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2 1/2           cups  bread flour -- or more if needed
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  1                cup  prepared pizza sauce
     3/4           cup  pitted black olives -- halved
     1/4           cup  pitted green olives -- halved
  12            ounces  shredded mozzarella cheese -- (abt 3 1/2 cups)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/3         pound  mushrooms -- sliced
     1/2                green bell pepper -- cut julienne
     1/2                red bell pepper -- cut julienne
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Minced fresh herbs -- (optional)
                        = (such as oregano -- basil and rosemary)
     1/2           cup  mesquite chips -- soaked in water
                        for 30 minutes and drained

Sprinkle yeast over warm water in small bowl; stir to dissolve.  Let stand 5 minutes.  Stir in 2 tablespoons oil.  Mix 2 1/2 cups flour and salt in processor using on/off turns.  With machine running, pour yeast mixture through feed tube and process until combined, about 10 seconds.  Knead dough on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, adding more flour to dough if sticky, about 5 minutes.

Brush large bowl with olive oil.  Add dough, turning to coat entire surface.  Cover and let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Punch dough down; cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before continuing with recipe.)

Prepare covered barbecue grill (medium-high heat).  Brush 14-inch pizza pan with 1-inch-high sides with olive oil.  Punch dough down and knead 2 minutes.  Roll dough out on lightly floured surface to 16-inch round.  Transfer to prepared pan.  Spread sauce over dough; sprinkle with black and green olives.  Top with both cheeses, then mushrooms and bell peppers.  Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil.  Sprinkle with minced herbs if desired.

Add mesquite chips to fire.  Open bottom barbecue vent.  Place pizza on rack on lowest rung.  Cover, leaving top vent half open.  Bake until crust is golden brown, checking occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 1 (14-inch) pizza.

                            Mixed Summer Grill

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  roasted peanut oil
                        = (or hazlenut or walnut oil)
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  medium-ground black pepper
  6              large  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  8                     drumsticks - (abt 1 lb total)
                        = (or 2 boneless chicken breast halves)
  2                     loin lamb chops, 1" thk - (3/4 lb total)
  1                     salmon steak, 1 1/2" thk - (abt 3/4 lb)
  2                     Italian sausages - (abt 1/2 lb total)
                        = (or your kids' favorite style sausage)
                        Vegetable oil -- for grill rack

To make the marinade, in a small bowl, combine the olive oil, peanut oil, salt, pepper, garlic, and lemon juice.

Place the drumsticks, lamb chops, salmon, and sausages in 1 or 2 shallow pans large enough to hold them in a single layer.  Pour the marinade over the top, and turn the pieces to coat both sides.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or as long as overnight, turning several times.

If using hardwood chips (such as cherry, apple, hickory or mesquite), soak them in water to cover for at least an hour or until they sink, so the chips smoke instead of burn.

Oil the rack of a charcoal or gas grill.  Prepare a fire or preheat the grill.  When the fire is ready, drain the chips and add to the charcoal grill 5 minutes before adding the chicken.  If using a gas grill, wrap the drained chips in aluminum foil, poke a few holes in the foil, and place under the cooking grates on top of the gas fire.

Remove the meat from the marinade.  Place the drumsticks on the grill rack and sear on all sides.  Continue to grill until cooked, 5 to 7 minutes.  (Chicken breasts are cooked when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 175 degrees.)

Grill the lamb chops, salmon, and sausage alongside the chicken, turning as necessary.  Allow about 4 minutes on each side for the chops for medium-rare, 5 to 6 minutes on each side for the salmon, and a total of 8 to 10 minutes for the sausages, or until nearly charred.

Remove from the grill rack and let rest for several minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1                     chicken - (abt 3 lbs)
                        Lawry's seasoned salt -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- as needed
                        Mild paprika -- as needed
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/3           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Split chicken through the breast and flatten.  Remove and reserve wings, then remove and discard tail.  Blot chicken dry with paper towels, then sprinkle with lots of seasoned salt, black pepper and paprika.

Prepare grill for direct heat and preheat.  When coals are ready, place chicken and wings on grill and cook uncovered 5 minutes, then turn with tongs and baste with butter.  Cook for 5 minutes more, then turn and baste again.  When fire flares up, cover grill with lid.  Continue basting and turning chicken every 10 to 15 minutes until butter is gone, about 50 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat vinegar, red pepper and salt in saucepan over low heat.  When finished with butter, begin basting with vinegar mixture, turning chicken every 5 minutes for 25 minutes.  Chicken may appear burned, but continue cooking for full 25 minutes to cook off vinegar.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Split chicken through the breast and flatten.  Remove and reserve wings, then remove and discard tail.  Blot chicken dry with paper towels, then sprinkle with lots of seasoned salt, black pepper and paprika.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare grill for direct heat and preheat.  When coals are ready, place chicken and wings on grill and cook uncovered 5 minutes, then turn with tongs and baste with butter.  Cook for 5 minutes more, then turn and baste again.  When fire flares up, cover grill with lid.  Continue basting and turning chicken every 10 to 15 minutes until butter is gone, about 50 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, heat vinegar, red pepper and salt in saucepan over low heat.  When finished with butter, begin basting with vinegar mixture, turning chicken every 5 minutes for 25 minutes.  Chicken may appear burned, but continue cooking for full 25 minutes to cook off vinegar.

  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1                     red bell pepper
  3                     ripe Roma tomatoes - (abt 8 oz)
  6                     tomatillos -- husks removed
  4                     garlic cloves -- arranged on a
                        wooden skewer
     1/2         small  white onion -- peeled
  1                     pasilla chile - (abt 1/2 oz)
  1                     ancho chile - (abt 1/2 oz)

  1              bunch  fresh cilantro
                        = (reserve some sprigs for garnish)
     1/2           cup  tomato juice
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse salt
  2          teaspoons  lime juice
  2          teaspoons  maple syrup or brown sugar -- (optional)
  1                     red onion -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" slices
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  8                     jumbo shrimp -- peeled, tails intact
  4                     dried or fresh corn husks -- soaked in water
  1                     ripe avocado -- peeled, and
                        cut into 8 slices
  1                     lime -- cut into wedges

Prepare a charcoal fire with approximately 36 briquettes.  When the charcoal briquettes are very hot, spread the coals into an even layer.

Lightly oil the skins of the red bell pepper, tomatoes, tomatillos, skewed garlic cloves and white onion halves.  Place these ingredients over the hot charcoal fire and grill until the skins are blistered and lightly charred.  Turn the ingredients frequently.  This will take about 15 minutes.  Remove the ingredients from the fire and allow to cool.  Reserve.

Place the chiles over the fire and lightly toast, turning frequently.  This will take only 1 to 2 minutes.  Take care not to burn the chiles.  Remove the chiles from the fire.

Brush the red onion slices with olive oil.  Lightly salt and pepper.  Grill the red onions slices until nicely grilled and reserve separately from the above grilled ingredients.

Peel and discard the charred skins and stems and seeds of the red bell pepper.  Remove and discard the stems and seeds of the toasted chilies.

Transfer all of the grilled ingredients (except the red onions) to a food processor.  Add the remaining ingredients for the salsa and process to form a coarse puree.  Adjust the salt and pepper to taste.  If the salsa is a little too thick, add additional tomato juice or water to adjust the consistency.

Tie the corn husks at one end with a piece of string or strip of corn husk as for tamales.  Divide the grilled red onions between the corn husks.  Spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons of Charred Chile Salsa over the onions in each husk.  Place two shrimps on top of the salsa and red onions in each corn husk.

Add a few additional charcoal briquettes (8 to 10) to the charcoal fire if the coals have died down.  The fire does not have be very hot.  When the fire is ready, place the corn husks on the grill over the coals.  Close the lid and grill the shrimp for approximately 15 to 20 minutes (depending on the heat of the fire) or until the shrimp is cooked.  Remove the corn husks from the grill.

Place two slices of ripe avocado and some cilantro sprigs over the shrimp in each corn husk.  Transfer the corn husks to dinner plates and garnish with a lime wedge.  Drizzle a little virgin olive oil over each dish.  Serve with the additional salsa on the side.

Prepare a charcoal fire with approximately 36 briquettes.  When the charcoal briquettes are very hot, spread the coals into an even layer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly oil the skins of the red bell pepper, tomatoes, tomatillos, skewed garlic cloves and white onion halves.  Place these ingredients over the hot charcoal fire and grill until the skins are blistered and lightly charred.  Turn the ingredients frequently.  This will take about 15 minutes.  Remove the ingredients from the fire and allow to cool.  Reserve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the chiles over the fire and lightly toast, turning frequently.  This will take only 1 to 2 minutes.  Take care not to burn the chiles.  Remove the chiles from the fire.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush the red onion slices with olive oil.  Lightly salt and pepper.  Grill the red onions slices until nicely grilled and reserve separately from the above grilled ingredients.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Peel and discard the charred skins and stems and seeds of the red bell pepper.  Remove and discard the stems and seeds of the toasted chilies.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer all of the grilled ingredients (except the red onions) to a food processor.  Add the remaining ingredients for the salsa and process to form a coarse puree.  Adjust the salt and pepper to taste.  If the salsa is a little too thick, add additional tomato juice or water to adjust the consistency.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tie the corn husks at one end with a piece of string or strip of corn husk as for tamales.  Divide the grilled red onions between the corn husks.  Spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons of Charred Chile Salsa over the onions in each husk.  Place two shrimps on top of the salsa and red onions in each corn husk.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add a few additional charcoal briquettes (8 to 10) to the charcoal fire if the coals have died down.  The fire does not have be very hot.  When the fire is ready, place the corn husks on the grill over the coals.  Close the lid and grill the shrimp for approximately 15 to 20 minutes (depending on the heat of the fire) or until the shrimp is cooked.  Remove the corn husks from the grill.
</DirT>

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  beef top round steak, 1 1/2" thk -- well-trimmed
                        === MARINADE ===
     3/4           cup  prepared teriyaki sauce
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh ginger

In small bowl, combine marinade ingredients; mix well.  Place steak and marinade in plastic bag, truning to coat.  Close bag securely and merinate in refrigerator 6 to 8 hours (or overnight, if desired), turning occasionally.

Remove steak from marinade; discard marinade.  Place steak on grid over medium, ash-covered coals; grill, covered, 25 to 28 minutes for medium-rare doneness, truning occasionally.  Carve steak cross wise into thin slices.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Beef can be marinated in a plastic bag, glass utility dish or other non-reactive container.  Acidic ingredients and alcohol react with some metals, such as aluminum and iron, to discolor food and impart a metallic flavor.  Choose a container in which the beef fits snugly and lies flat

                      Texas Smoked Barbecue Brisket

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 15    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     beef brisket - (10 to 12 lbs)
     1/4           cup  kosher salt
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  cumin
     1/4           cup  chili powder
     1/4           cup  freshly-cracked black pepper
  2        tablespoons  cayenne pepper
     1/2           cup  paprika

In a large bowl, combine the salt, sugar, brown sugar, cumin, chili powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper and paprika and mix well.  Rub brisket thoroughly with this mixture and set aside.

Cook with fat side up !!  Build a fire in one half of a large grill.  For best results, use an aromatic wood such as mesquite.  When fire is ready, place brisket on grill, making sure that it is not above any part of the fire.  Close grill cover and open vent about 1/2-inch.

Feeding the fire periodically, cook for 8 to 10 hours or until the internal temperature is 165 to 170 degrees and the meat is very tender.  The exterior of the meat should be very black.  Remove from the fire, trim off excess fat and carve against the grain into very thin slices.

This recipe yields 15 to 18 servings.

Comments:  The time you invest in this brisket will pay big dividends.
