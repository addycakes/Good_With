  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  chopped thyme leaves
  4                     duck legs
  1                     white onion -- quartered
  4                     garlic cloves
  6                     star anise pods
  2              large  canela sticks (Mexican cinnamon)
  4               cups  melted duck fat
  1            package  cornhusks - (16 oz)
  1                cup  instant corn flour
     3/4           cup  warm water
     1/2           cup  vegetable shortening
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
                        ===  SOUR CHERRY MOJO ===
  2               cups  dried cherries
  3               cups  red wine
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced shallots
  1                     chipotle in adobo -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- finely minced
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley

In a bowl, combine the kosher salt and chopped thyme and mix it well.  Rub the salt and thyme mixture on both sides of the duck, layering it on thickly.  Place legs in a shallow pan and refrigerate, covered, overnight.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In the same shallow pan, add the onion, garlic, star anise, canela, and duck fat over the legs.  Cover the pan with aluminum foil.  Roast in the oven for 3 hours.

Meanwhile, soak the cornhusks in warm water for 1 hour.

To make the dough for the tamales, moisten the instant corn flour with the warm water.  Set aside.  Beat the shortening in a mixer until creamy and fluffy, about 10 minutes, then fold in the corn flour and chicken stock.

After 3 hours remove the legs from the fat, remove the outer skin and shred the meat away from the bone and set aside.

To assemble the tamales, open the soaked cornhusks and add 2 tablespoons of dough.  Spread the dough over the cornhusk leaving a 1/2-inch border.  Put 1 tablespoon of the shredded duck meat in the center in a line.  Fold the cornhusk over, enclosing the duck in the dough, and secure the tamale with a string or ripped-off piece of the cornhusks.  Repeat the process until all the dough and filling is finished.

In a double boiler or steamer, steam the tamales for 20 minutes.  Turn off heat and allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving.

To make the Sour Cherry Mojo:  Soak the dried cherries in a bowl with red wine for 1 hour.

In a medium saucepot, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat.  When the oil has begun to smoke, add the shallots, chipotle, and garlic.  Cook for 5 minutes then deglaze with red wine vinegar and duck stock.  Cook for 3 minutes then add the cherry mixture.  Cook for 30 minutes until the liquid has thickened.  Add the parsley.  Season with salt and pepper.

To serve, remove the tamale from the steamer.  Open the tamales and serve with a spoon of the cherry mojo.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

In a bowl, combine the kosher salt and chopped thyme and mix it well.  Rub the salt and thyme mixture on both sides of the duck, layering it on thickly.  Place legs in a shallow pan and refrigerate, covered, overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the same shallow pan, add the onion, garlic, star anise, canela, and duck fat over the legs.  Cover the pan with aluminum foil.  Roast in the oven for 3 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, soak the cornhusks in warm water for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the dough for the tamales, moisten the instant corn flour with the warm water.  Set aside.  Beat the shortening in a mixer until creamy and fluffy, about 10 minutes, then fold in the corn flour and chicken stock.
</DirT>
<DirT>
After 3 hours remove the legs from the fat, remove the outer skin and shred the meat away from the bone and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble the tamales, open the soaked cornhusks and add 2 tablespoons of dough.  Spread the dough over the cornhusk leaving a 1/2-inch border.  Put 1 tablespoon of the shredded duck meat in the center in a line.  Fold the cornhusk over, enclosing the duck in the dough, and secure the tamale with a string or ripped-off piece of the cornhusks.  Repeat the process until all the dough and filling is finished.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a double boiler or steamer, steam the tamales for 20 minutes.  Turn off heat and allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Sour Cherry Mojo:  Soak the dried cherries in a bowl with red wine for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium saucepot, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat.  When the oil has begun to smoke, add the shallots, chipotle, and garlic.  Cook for 5 minutes then deglaze with red wine vinegar and duck stock.  Cook for 3 minutes then add the cherry mixture.  Cook for 30 minutes until the liquid has thickened.  Add the parsley.  Season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, remove the tamale from the steamer.  Open the tamales and serve with a spoon of the cherry mojo.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  1                cup  flour
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander

  2             pounds  beef short ribs -- cleaned, excess
                        fat removed, cut into 2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  6                     dried pasilla chiles -- seeded, stemmed
  1                cup  hot water
  1                     white onion -- coarsely chopped
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        roughly chopped
     1/2         bunch  celery -- roughly chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  2               cups  red wine
  2                     tomatoes -- quartered
  3               cups  beef broth - (to 4)
  1                can  white hominy or pozole - (16 oz) -- drained
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley

Place flour in a bowl with all ground spices.  Mix well with a wooden spoon.  Once well mixed, add to a shallow dish.

Dredge short ribs one by one on both sides, making sure to shake off any excess flour.  In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of oil.  When the oil smokes, add the short ribs.  Brown short ribs for 5 minutes on each side until a golden crust starts to form.  Once brown, reserve, and continue until all are brown.  Set ribs aside.

While the short ribs are browning, heat a cast iron skillet.  When skillet is hot, add the pasilla chiles and toast for 4 minutes until they start to smoke.  Remove and submerge in 1 cup hot water.  Allow to steep for 10 minutes until they become soft and pliable.  Remove from water and puree in blender with 1/4 cup of the water.  Set aside puree mixture.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Add onion, carrots, celery, and garlic to the dutch oven.  Cook for 15 minutes until the vegetables caramelize.  Deglaze pot with red wine, then add tomatoes, beef broth, hominy, and pasilla chile puree.  Bring the whole mixture to a simmer.  Start adding all the browned short ribs back into the pan.

Cover and cook for 1 hour and 30 minutes until short ribs barely start falling off the bone.  Season with salt, pepper, cilantro, and parsley, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Aaron Sanchez
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  ground chile de arbol
     1/2      teaspoon  ground clove
  2          teaspoons  ground panela or piloncillo
                        = (if not available, use brown sugar)
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  calabaza -- peeled, and
                        diced into 1" pieces
  1                     white onion -- cut small dice
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2             quarts  chicken stock
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  creme fraiche or sour cream
  1           teaspoon  ground canela (Mexican cinnamon)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

In a small saute pan toast the cumin, coriander, chile, and clove for 3 minutes over medium heat.  When the spices have begun to release their aroma, add them to a large mixing bowl with the panela and olive oil, mix well with a whisk to break up any clumps of spices.

Add the diced and peeled calabaza and mix well to coat.  Pour the calabaza onto a large sheet tray and place in the oven to roast until the calabaza has softened and caramelized, about 30 minutes.

While the calabaza is in the oven, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large saucepan, when the oil begins to smoke add the onion and garlic and saute for around 5 minutes.

When the onion has become translucent add the calabaza and chicken stock and cook at a gentle simmer for 15 minutes, puree the mixture with a hand held blender, add the heavy cream, and simmer for another 5 minutes, season with salt and pepper and reserve in a warm place.

In a small bowl combine the creme fraiche and canela and mix well.  To serve, ladle the soup into a large bowl and finish with a dollop of the canela-creme fraiche.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  soft unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
  1                cup  superfine sugar
  1 3/4           cups  ground toasted hazelnuts
                        = (or finely chopped)
     1/2           cup  hazelnut liqueur
  2               cups  heavy cream
  3                     rounds Sponge Cake,  each 7" dia and 1/2"  -- (listed below)
     1/4           cup  orange liqueur -- mixed with
     1/4           cup  water
  1              quart  strawberries
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped toasted hazelnuts
                        === HOT MILK SPONGE CAKE ===
  1 1/2           cups  cake flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4           cup  milk
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  lemon extract
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
                        === OPTIONAL FLAVORED CREAM GARNISH ===
  1                cup  heavy cream
  3        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  1         tablespoon  orange liqueur
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla

Cream together the butter and sugar.  Beat in the hazelnuts and then half of the hazelnut liqueur.  Whip the cream.  Add the remaining half of the hazelnut liqueur to the cream and whip to shaving cream consistency.  Fold into the butter/nut mixture.

Line the bottom and sides of a 2-quart, cylindrical mold (like a souffle dish) with parchment.  Paint (imbibe) the sponge cake layers with the orange liqueur and water.  Place a layer of sponge cake on the bottom.  Top the sponge layer with a layer of 1/2 of the cream.  Plant a ring of strawberries, point down, around the outer edge.  Top with another sponge cake layer and repeat with cream and berries.  Top with a final layer of sponge cake.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  Remove from mold and dust sides with coarse hazelnuts.

For the Hot Milk Sponge Cake:  Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Lightly coat 3 (7-inch) cake pans with non-stick vegetable spray.  Line the bottoms with a circle of baking parchment.

In a large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together.  Repeat 3 times.  In a small saucepan, bring the milk and butter to a boil.  Remove from the heat and add the vanilla and lemon extracts.

In a mixing bowl beat the eggs and sugar until pale yellow, fluffy and doubled in volume.  While still beating, drizzle in the hot milk mixture.  Fold in the flour mixture.

Spread the batter in the prepared pans and bake for 15 minutes, or until golden, the center springs back when lightly pressed and a cake tester comes out clean.  Set the pans on a rack to cool.  Run the tip of a knife around the edges of the cakes to loosen them, and turn them out of the pans.

For the Optional Flavored Whipped Cream Garnish, whisk heavy cream in a bowl until it begins to thicken.  Add the confectioners' sugar, orange liqueur, and vanilla and whisk to soft peaks.  Place the cream in a piping bag fitted with a star tip.  Pipe rosettes on top of the cake and top each rosette with a small strawberry.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  1              whole  snapper - (2 to 3 lbs) -- remove center bones,

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Flour -- for dusting
  4                     eggs -- beaten with
  1                cup  buttermilk -- as an egg wash
                        === SOFRITO ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     yellow pepper -- minced
  1                     red pepper -- minced

     1/2                Scotch bonnet -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced aji amarillo
  1                     fennel bulb -- minced
  1              pinch  saffron
  1                cup  amontillado Sherry
  1                cup  fish stock or clam juice
  1                     lime
  1              bunch  cilantro -- pick leaves and
                        chop stems

                        Extra-large skewers for shaping fish, but
                        small enough to fit in the pot

In a large deep pot, fitted with a deep frying thermometer, preheat 5 inches oil to 325 degrees.

Starting at the tail end, push the skewer crosswise just above the tail, and bend the fish into an "s" shape and attach the skewer through the head, just in front of the front fin.

Season the fish and dust with the flour.  Place in the egg wash.  Place back in the flour.  Shake off excess.

Fry the fish at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes or until golden and cooked through.

Season with salt and pepper when removing from the fryer.  Set on paper towels to drain oil.  Serve with Sofrito and garnish with cilantro.

For the Sofrito:  In a saucepan, heat the olive oil.  Add all the dry ingredients.  Cook for about 5 minutes, until all vegetables are soft and the saffron is toasted.  Add the wine, reduce half way.  Add the stock and reduce half way.  Finish with cilantro and a squeeze of lime.

Recipe By     :Michael Symon
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     onion -- grated
  3                     baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled, grated
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour -- plus more as needed
  2              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  finely-grated fresh horseradish
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon zest
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh dill
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6         tablespoon  olive oil
  2         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1                cup  creme fraiche or sour cream
                        Fresh dill sprigs -- for garnish

In a bowl, combine the onion and potato.  Dust with the flour and mix to disperse it.  Add the eggs, horseradish, lemon zest, fresh dill, salt, and pepper, and mix until well combined.

In a large non-stick saute pan, heat the olive oil and butter over medium-high heat.  Once the bubbles from the butter subside, spoon 3 heaping tablespoons of the potato mixture into the saute pan.  Repeat, making 8 to 12 pancakes.  Cook pancakes about 4 minutes on each side, assuring that both sides are well browned and the potato is cooked through.  Reduce the heat of the pan if the potato cakes are browning too quickly in order to make sure the inside is cooked completely.  Remove the cakes to a paper towel-lined plate as they finish, and season with salt while hot.  You can cover them with foil and keep in a 200 degree oven to stay warm until ready to serve.

To serve, transfer potato cakes to a platter and dollop each one with creme fraiche.  Top with a sprig of dill.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  salt cured beef
     1/4           cup  oil
  1                     white onion -- small diced
  2                     Italian frying peppers -- cut small dice
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  2               cups  tomato sauce
     1/2           cup  white wine
     1/2           cup  beef stock
  1         tablespoon  white vinegar

  3               cups  blended oil -- for frying

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  tomato
  1              large  jalapeÒo
  1              small  onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     garlic clove
  6                     cilantro sprigs
     1/4           cup  canola oil
  7             ounces  small shaped pasta
                        = (such as melon seeds or alphabets)
  2               cups  chicken stock
                        Cotija or queso blanco -- shredded

Heat a dry cast-iron skillet (or ungreased skillet) over medium-low heat until a drop of water sizzles on contact.  Place the tomato and jalapeÒo in the pan and cook turning frequently, until the skins are blistered all over, about 15 minutes.  Remove the tomato into a mixing bowl to catch the juices.  Place the chile in a paper bag and let rest for 10 minutes.

When the chile is cool enough to handle, peel of the charred skin.  Place the tomato, onion, garlic, cilantro, and chile in a blender, or food processor, and process until smooth, about 1 minute, set aside.

Pour the oil into a dutch oven or medium saucepan over medium-high heat until it ripples, add the pasta and cook, stirring constantly, until golden.

Remove all but 2 tablespoons of oil, add the pureed tomato and chile mixture, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring continually.  Add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer.  Cover and cook for 20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed.  Serve with shredded cheese.

This recipe yields 4 small servings.

Recipe By     :Wayne Harley Brachman
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CREPES ===
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  whole milk
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3              large  eggs
  4        tablespoons  melted butter
                        Non-stick vegetable spray -- for coating pan
                        === APRICOT FILLING ===
  1 1/2           cups  dried apricots
  1                cup  water
  4        tablespoons  sugar
                        === CHOCOLATE WHIPPED CREAM ===
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa
  2               cups  heavy cream
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped toasted hazelnuts -- for garnish
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting
                        Cocoa powder -- for dusting

For the Crepes:  Combine all of the ingredients except the butter and nonstick spray in a food processor or blender and process until smooth, about 10 seconds.  If necessary, scrape down any solids that stick to the sides.  Add the butter and process for a few more seconds to blend.  Refrigerate, covered, for at least 2 hours or overnight.

Set a 7-inch, nonstick crepe pan over moderately-high heat, then spray with nonstick vegetable spray.  When hot, remove the pan from the heat and add 2 tablespoons of batter, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan.  Cook for 1 1/2 minutes, until lightly browned.  Starting at the edge closest to you, flip the crepe over with a rubber spatula.  (Use your fingers if you're brave.  It really doesn't hurt).  Cook for 1 minute more, until spotty brown.  Transfer to a plate and continue with the remaining batter.

For the Apricot Filling:  Put all of the ingredients into a saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes.  Let cool.  Drain off any excess water.  Puree in a food processor.  Set aside.

For the Chocolate Whipped Cream:  Sift the confectioners' sugar and cocoa onto a sheet of wax paper.  While whipping the cream, gradually add the sugar-cocoa mixture.  Whip to the consistency of shaving cream, about 4 minutes.

To assemble:  Coat each crepe with 1 tablespoon of apricot puree and 1 tablespoon of chopped toasted hazelnuts.  Roll.  Serve 2 per portion.  Dust with confectioners' sugar and cocoa powder and then top with chocolate whipped cream.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

     1/2           cup  cornmeal
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  ground turmeric
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Non-stick vegetable spray -- as needed
  2             ounces  osetra caviar
     1/2           cup  creme fraiche
  3                     hard-boiled eggs -- yolk and whites
                        finely chopped separately
  1              bunch  fresh chives -- finely sliced

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees in a convection oven or 350 degrees in a standard oven.

Mix all ingredients to form thin batter.

Spritz the cookie sheet with the non-stick spray.  Line with a sheet of parchment paper, and then spritz it again.

With an offset spatula, spread a thin layer of batter onto the parchment.  Bake until crisp and tanned, about 20 to 30 minutes (rotating the pan once, for even baking).  Repeat.

Once all the flatbread is cooked, break it into bite-size pieces with your hands.  Serve with osetra caviar and caviar garnishes: creme fraiche, chopped hard-boiled eggs, and chopped chives.

This recipe yields 16 to 20 servings, as hors d'oeuvres.

                         Lower East Side Nut Cake

Recipe By     :Wayne Harley Brachman
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  cake flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- plus
                        a pinch for the egg whites
  1                cup  sugar -- divided
     1/2           cup  matzo meal
  1                cup  finely-chopped roasted hazelnuts
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  4                     eggs -- separated
     1/4           cup  cream
  2        tablespoons  hazelnut liqueur
  2        tablespoons  melted butter
  1              pinch  cream tartar
     1/4           cup  spreadable seedless raspberry jam
                        === GANACHE FROSTING ===
  4             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        === GARNISH ===
  1               pint  strawberries or raspberries -- for garnish

For the Cake:  Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.

Lightly coat 2 (9-inch) square cake pans with nonstick vegetable spray.  Line the bottoms with baking parchment.  In a large mixing bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 cup of the sugar together 3 times.  Stir in the matzo meal and chopped hazelnuts.  Form a well in the center and add the oil, egg yolks, cream, hazelnut liqueur, and butter.  Mix until just blended.

In a clean, dry mixing bowl, whisk the egg whites with the pinches of salt and cream of tartar until creamy, foamy and barely able to hold peaks.  While sprinkling on the remaining cup of sugar whisk until the consistency of stiff shaving cream.

Fold 1/3 of the egg whites into the yolk mixture, then fold in the remainder of the whites.  Spread the batter in the prepared pans and bake for 20 minutes or lightly tanned, the center springs back when lightly pressed and a cake tester comes out clean.  Set the pans on a rack to cool.  This cake is very delicate.  Remove from the pans, and trim even.  Place the cake onto a plate, parchment-side up, and spread a layer of raspberry jam on the cut side of one layer.  Flip the other layer on top and spread more jam on top.

For the Ganache Frosting:  Put the chocolate in a small bowl.  Over medium heat, bring the cream to a scald.  Pour the hot cream over the chocolate.  Working from the center out, gently stir with a whisk to melt and blend.  Continue stirring until smooth.  Let cool for 30 minutes until spreadable

Frost the cake and comb the top decoratively.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PEANUT MERINGUES ===
  1                cup  egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  8             ounces  powdered sugar
  4        tablespoons  flour
  8             ounces  chopped peanuts
                        === HOT CHOCOLATE ===
     1/2         pound  semisweet chocolate chopped
     1/4         pound  butter -- cut into six pieces
  1              ounce  sugar
  3                     eggs
  1 1/2         ounces  cocoa -- sifted
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  heavy cream -- whipped

Meringues:  Preheat oven to 225 degrees.

In a standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip egg whites, cream of tartar, and granulated sugar to soft peaks at high speed.  Add the powdered sugar and flour, a third at a time.  Whip on high speed to stiff peaks.  Fold in the peanuts.

Place batter in a piping bag, and pipe meringues into 2-inch long tubes onto a parchment paper lined sheet tray.  Bake for 2 hours.

Hot Chocolate:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Over a steam bath, melt the chocolate and the butter, stirring with a rubber spatula.

In an electric mixer cream the sugar and eggs and combine them with the melted chocolate.  Add the cocoa and the vanilla extract.  Mix until smooth and pudding-like.

Butter a mini muffin pan.  Pour batter into muffin tin, filling the wells almost to the rim.  Bake until center is set, about 25 minutes.  Let puddings cool in the muffin pan and then turn out.

Place chocolate in a shallow bowl, heat for 45 seconds in a microwave, and serve with a dollop of whipped cream and a meringue.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  peeled baking potatoes
                        = (like russets or waxy potatoes, like
                        Yukon Golds)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1              large  Spanish onion -- minced (2 cups)
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped cooked spinach -- drained
                        === OIL PASTRY (AIL TEIG) ===
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  water
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  turmeric
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
     1/4         pound  smoked salmon -- shredded
     1/4         bunch  flat-leaf parsley -- washed

Make the filling:  Place the potatoes in a pot of water and boil until fork-tender (20 minutes).  Drain.  Meanwhile, saute the onions in the oil until softened.  Mash the potatoes and stir in the onion mixture and spinach.

Make the dough:  In a mixer fitted with the paddle, combine the oil, water, cumin, turmeric, salt and 1 1/2 cups flour.  If necessary, add additional flour or water to make a soft dough.  Form into two balls.  Wrap in plastic and let rest, at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Assembly:  Roll the dough out into 2 rectangles, 1/8-inch thick (approximately 15 by 10 inches).  Lay filling down center in a squared off log.  Place the salmon in a layer on top of the filling.  Trim dough and roll up.  Refrigerate for 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Slice into 2-inch pieces.  Set, seam-side down, on a non-stick cookie sheet or a sheet lined with parchment paper.  Bake for 30 minutes, until golden.  Garnish platter with flat-leaf parsley.

This recipe yields 16 to 24 pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     large heads cabbage
                        = (outer leaves for rolling, inside
                        leaves for stuffing)
                        === STUFFING ===
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef
  1 1/2           cups  barley -- cooked in beef
                        stock according to package instructions
  1              large  onion -- minced
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  sweet paprika
  1              large  egg
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  1              large  onion -- coarsely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves minced
  2               cups  strong beef stock
  1                cup  tomato sauce
  1         tablespoon  sweet paprika

If the leaves don't peel off, blanch the whole head in boiling water until each layer strips off.  You need 16 big leaves.  Return the leaves to the pot and cook for 2 minutes until pliable.  Drain and cut out the thick, tough part of the stem.

Mix the stuffing ingredients together and form a 1/4 cup of it into an oval.  Place it in the center of a leaf.  From the stem end, roll it up once.  Tuck in the sides and roll up the rest of the way.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

In the oil, saute the onions to golden, then saute the garlic for one more minute.  Add the tomato sauce and beef stock.  Whisk in the paprika.

Shred the remaining cabbage and spread it on the bottom of a large baking dish.  Arrange the stuffed cabbages seam-side down, on top of the shredded cabbage.  Cover with the sauce.  Bake covered for 1 hour, adding more liquid as necessary to keep cabbage moist.  Uncover and bake for another hour.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  ground ancho chile powder
  1           teaspoon  Mexican cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     rack St. Louis-style pork ribs
                        = (brisket bone and skirt meat removed)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === TAMARIND GLAZE ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     white onion -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped ginger

  2                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  1                     jalapeÒo -- finely minced
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1              quart  chicken stock
  1            package  tamarind pulp - (4 to 6 oz)
                        === CHAYOTE AND MANGO SLAW ===
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
     1/4           cup  white vinegar
  1                     chayote -- juilenned
     1/2                red onion -- thinly sliced
  1                     mango -- julienned
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro
  1                     tomato -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     limes -- juiced

In a large bowl, combine the cumin, coriander, sugar, ancho powder, cinnamon, garlic powder, and pepper.  Mix the spices well with a wooden spoon.  Season the pork ribs on both sides with salt, then start rubbing the spice mixture evenly on both sides to coat all the surface meat.  Place in refrigerator, cover, and allow to sit overnight.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

Wrap the pork ribs tightly in plastic, then place in shallow baking dish with 1-inch of water and place the pan in the oven for 1 hour and 30 minutes.  Remove the ribs from the plastic wrap and set aside.

While the ribs are cooking, in a large sauce pot, add 1 tablespoon oil and heat over medium-high heat.  When the oil has begun to smoke, add the onion, ginger, lemongrass, garlic, and jalapeÒo.  Start cooking until the onion becomes translucent, about 7 minutes.  Then, add the honey, chicken stock, and tamarind.  Simmer for 20 minutes then puree in a blender until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper and strain through a medium fine strainer.  Set aside.

To make the dressing for Chayote Slaw:  In a small sauce pot, combine the honey, pepper flakes, and vinegar.  Cook 10 minutes until the mixture is reduced by half.  Set aside to cool in a large mixing bowl.  When the mixture is cool, add the chayote, red onion, mango, cilantro, tomato, olive oil, and lime juice.  Mix well and set aside.

To finish the dish:  On a hot well oiled grill, add the cooked pork ribs and start to cook on one side 5 minutes making sure to baste the other side with tamarind glaze.  Then, flip the ribs over and baste this side for 5 minutes.  Repeat this process three times until a nice crust has formed.  Remove and cut between each bone and serve on a large platter with the Chayote Mango Slaw and a side bowl of the tamarind sauce.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  dried salt cod -- cut 3" pieces,
                        and soaked
  8                     all-purpose potatoes - (to 10) -- peeled, quartered
  1                cup  fine quality olive oil
  1              bunch  celery -- trimmed, well
                        washed, and cut 3" pieces
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2               cups  Gaeta olives -- pitted
  4               cans  San Marzano plum tomatoes - (28 oz ea) -- hand crushed,
                        with juice
  12              cups  chicken broth
                        Salt -- to taste

Soak the cod in cold water to cover in a cool spot or refrigerator for at least 24 hours or up to 3 days, changing the water frequently.  After 24 hours, break off a tiny piece of fish and taste for saltiness.  If fish is still quite salty, continue soaking until water is very clear and fish is almost sweet in taste.

Place potatoes in cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat and cook for about 15 minutes or until potatoes are almost cooked through.  Drain.

Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed casserole over medium heat.  Add the celery and saute for about 5 minutes, then add the onion and saute until vegetables begin to get soft.  Add the olives and saute for an additional minute.  Stir in the tomatoes and their juice.  Bring to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes.

Stir in broth and return to simmer.

Stir in the potatoes and the soaked baccala and simmer for about 10 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked and the baccala flakes when poked with a fork.

Taste and, if necessary, add salt.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Often, salt cod dishes will require no additional salt.  Therefore, always taste before adding any seasoning.
