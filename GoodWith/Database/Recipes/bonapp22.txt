--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  cake flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces
     1/4           cup  chilled solid vegetable shortening -- cut into pieces
  5        tablespoons  cold whole milk
                        === FILLING ===
  5                     Granny Smith apples - (1 3/4 lbs total) -- peeled, cored,
                        cut 1/4"-thk, then crosscut in thirds
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1                cup  dried Bing cherries
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Powdered sugar

For Crust:  Blend both flours, sugar, and salt in processor until just combined.  Add butter and shortening.  Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add milk.  Using on/off turns, process until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball; divide into 2 pieces, 1 slightly larger than the other.  Flatten larger piece into disk and smaller piece into rectangle.  Wrap each in plastic; chill 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.)

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Place apples on large rimmed baking sheet; toss with 3 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons butter, and lemon juice.  Roast until apples are tender, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.  Transfer to large bowl.  Stir in cherries, brown sugar, and vanilla.  Cool completely.

Butter 9-inch glass pie dish.  Roll out dough disk on floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer to pie dish; trim overhang to 1/2 inch.  Spoon filling into crust.

Roll out dough rectangle on floured surface to 11- by 6-inch rectangle.  Cut lengthwise into 8 strips.  Arrange 4 strips across pie, spacing evenly.  Place remaining 4 strips across first 4 strips, forming lattice pattern.  Fold dough overhang over ends of strips; crimp edge.  Brush strips and edge with 1 tablespoon butter.

Bake until pie is golden and filling is bubbling, covering edge with foil if browning too quickly, about 40 minutes.  Cool 45 minutes.  Dust pie with powdered sugar.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter 8-inch glass baking dish.

Mix both sugars, flour, and cinnamon in large bowl.  Mix in apples, then prunes.  Let mixture stand 5 minutes.  Transfer filling to prepared dish.  Bake until beginning to bubble at edges, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare Topping:  Mix first 4 ingredients in medium bowl.  Add butter; using fingertips, rub in until moist clumps form.  Rub in hazelnuts.

  8                     center-cut 1/2"-thk eggplant rounds
                        = (from 2 small eggplants)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed
  2                     eggs -- beaten to blend
  1 1/2           cups  fresh breadcrumbs
                        = (made from crustless French bread)
  2 1/2         ounces  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - (3/4 cup)
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  ricotta cheese
  1 1/4           cups  purchased marinara sauce
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated mozzarella cheese - (3 oz)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil baking sheet.

Sprinkle eggplant rounds with salt and pepper.  Place flour and eggs in separate shallow bowls.  Mix breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese in another shallow bowl.  Coat eggplant rounds with flour, then eggs, then breadcrumb mixture, patting to adhere.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 4 eggplant rounds to skillet.  Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to prepared sheet.  Repeat with remaining oil and eggplant rounds.

Spread 2 tablespoons ricotta cheese over each round.  Top each with sauce and mozzarella cheese, dividing equally.  Bake until rounds are heated through and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 first-course servings.

Comments:  Connie Capani of Binghamton, New York, writes: "I am 100 percent Italian, so perhaps it's no surprise that I love food: To Italians, it's like a security blanket.  I learned how to make spaghetti and other Abruzzi favorites from my mother.  Looking at food magazines is what got me interested in venturing out into American culinary territory.  I wanted to know how to make a "gravy" that didn't include tomatoes.  I often make a roast with gravy, but our guests usually request some of my baked eggplant marinara to go along with it."

Connie makes this ahead of time and refrigerates it, then reheats it before serving.

                 Cheese Ravioli With Herbs In Meat Broth

Recipe By     :Chef Jean-Yves Bath
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : First Course                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 3/4           cups  coarsely grated Cantal
                        = (or sharp white cheddar cheese)
  1 1/4           cups  finely-grated pecorino Romano cheese
     1/3           cup  crËme fraÓche
                        = (or sour cream)
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated lemon peel
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  50                    wonton wrappers
  1              large  egg white -- beaten to loosen
  1                cup  low-salt beef broth
  4        tablespoons  butter

Toss Cantal and Romano cheeses in medium bowl to blend.  Stir in crËme fraÓche, 3 tablespoons chives, 2 tablespoons parsley, and lemon peel.  Season filling to taste with salt and pepper.

Line large baking sheet with plastic wrap.  Place 1 wonton wrapper on work surface.  Place 1 heaping teaspoon cheese mixture in center of wrapper.  Brush edges with egg white, fold over to enclose cheese filling, and press edges to seal.  Transfer to prepared baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining wonton wrappers and filling.  (Can be made ahead.  Cover with layer of plastic, then layer of foil; refrigerate up to 6 hours or freeze up to 1 week.)

Boil broth and butter in heavy small saucepan until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 5 minutes.  Whisk in remaining 1 tablespoon chives and 1 tablespoon parsley.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover to keep warm.

Working in batches, cook ravioli in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 3 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer ravioli to serving bowl.  Ladle warm broth mixture over ravioli and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 first-course or 6 main-course servings.

Comments:  Donovan Clark of London, England, writes: "I met chef Jean-Yves Bath a couple years ago while I was dining at his elegant Michelin one-star restaurant, Bath's, in Paris.  He had renovated an old Chinese eatery near the Champs-…lysÈes, and it was the perfect setting to showcase the food of his native Auvergne region.  The simple cheese ravioli dish I had that night was unforgettable."

For a vegetarian version of this recipe, mushroom or vegetable broth could be used in place of the beef broth.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BASIL MAYONNAISE ===
  1                cup  mayonnaise
     3/4           cup  torn fresh basil leaves - (lightly packed)
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
                        === TARTLETS ===
  24             small  cherry tomatoes -- quartered
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2 1/2           cups  water
  1           teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
     1/2           cup  polenta - (3 oz) -- see * Note
     1/3           cup  grated Parmesan cheese - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter

* Note:  Coarse cornmeal, sold at Italian markets, natural foods stores, and some supermarkets.  If unavailable, substitute an equal amount of regular yellow cornmeal, and cook mixture for about half the time.

For Basil Mayonnaise:  Combine mayonnaise, basil, and lemon juice in processor.  Blend until smooth (some basil bits will remain).  Season mayonnaise with salt and pepper.  Transfer to small bowl, cover, and refrigerate.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

For Tartlets:  Rinse 2 mini muffin pans (12 cups per pan) with cold water; shake off excess water.  Mix tomatoes, garlic, and oil in medium bowl; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Let stand 15 minutes.  Arrange 4 tomato quarters in bottom of each prepared muffin cup.

Bring 2 1/2 cups water and salt to boil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Gradually whisk in polenta.  Reduce heat to medium and cook until polenta thickens, whisking almost constantly, about 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to low and continue to cook until polenta is tender, whisking often, about 15 minutes longer.  Whisk in cheese and butter.  Season polenta to taste with pepper.

Spoon enough polenta into muffin cups to cover tomatoes and fill cups.  Using wet fingertips, press polenta firmly to compact.  Cover pans with waxed paper; let stand until polenta is firmly set, at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.

Cut around each tartlet to loosen.  Turn over muffin pans, releasing tartlets.  Arrange, tomato-side up, on platter.  Top each with dollop of basil mayonnaise.  Serve, passing remaining mayonnaise.

This recipe yields 24 tartlets.

Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter to same skillet and melt.  Whisk in flour and mustard; cook 1 minute.  Gradually whisk in broth, juice concentrate, and cranberries.  Bring to boil, whisking occasionally.  Boil until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, about 6 minutes.

Return chicken to skillet.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Doris Murphy of Pompano Beach, Florida, writes: "When I was raising my children, the dishes I made were definitely home style to suit everyone's tastes; but even without the demands of feeding a family, I still prefer simpler recipes.  Nevertheless, I notice that most of my kids are pretty adventurous cooks.  Maybe they did get some of that creativity from me; when I recall the potato-meat-and-vegetable meals my mother served, I realize that I did branch out a bit."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3              large  chicken breast halves with
                        skin and ribs -- halved crosswise
  3                     chicken drumsticks with skin
  3                     chicken thighs with skin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  cubed (1/4") prosciutto - (abt 5 oz)
  6                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  1 1/4           cups  dry white wine
  1                cup  low-salt chicken broth
  1                cup  canned crushed tomatoes with added puree
                        Fresh rosemary sprigs

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Heat extra-virgin olive oil in heavy large ovenproof pot over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.  Working in 2 batches, sautÈ chicken until golden, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer chicken to platter.

Add prosciutto, sliced garlic, and chopped rosemary to same pot.  Stir 1 minute.  Add dry white wine, chicken broth, and crushed tomatoes with puree.  Bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Boil 5 minutes.

Return chicken to pot, arranging in single layer.  Return to boil.  Cover pot and place in oven.  Bake until chicken breasts are cooked through, about 20 minutes.  Remove chicken breasts.  Continue baking until drumsticks and thighs are cooked through, about 10 minutes longer.   Remove pot from oven.  Return chicken breasts to pot.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.)

Bring chicken mixture to simmer.  Transfer chicken to platter; tent with foil.  Boil until sauce is reduced to 2 cups and coats back of spoon, about 5 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour sauce over chicken.  Garnish with rosemary sprigs and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  An adaptation of a classic Northern Italian dish, spezzatini di pollo al pomodoro e vino bianco (chicken sautÈed with tomato and white wine).  Serve sautÈed broccoli rabe and a crusty ciabatta alongside.

What to drink:  Barbera or Italian Chardonnay.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray -- as needed
  1            package  devil's food cake mix - (18.25 oz)
  1 1/3           cups  water
  3              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  12       tablespoons  amaretto liqueur
     3/4      teaspoon  almond extract
  3               cups  semisweet chocolate chips - (abt 18 oz)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
     2/3           cup  sour cream
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  1                cup  slivered almonds -- toasted

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray three 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides with nonstick spray.

Combine cake mix, 1 1/3 cups water, eggs, oil, 3 tablespoons amaretto, and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract in large bowl; whisk until well blended.  Mix in 1 cup chocolate chips.  Divide batter among prepared pans.

Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans 10 minutes.  Run knife around pan sides.  Turn cakes out onto racks; cool completely.  Brush each cake layer with 2 tablespoons amaretto.

Combine butter and cream in medium saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until butter melts and mixture comes to simmer.  Remove from heat.  Add remaining 2 cups chocolate chips and whisk until melted.  Mix in remaining 3 tablespoons amaretto.  Cool until barely lukewarm, about 5 minutes.  Whisk in sour cream and remaining 1/4 teaspoon almond extract, then powdered sugar.  Refrigerate frosting just until thick enough to spread, whisking occasionally, about 10 minutes.

Place 1 cake layer on platter.  Spread 1/3 cup frosting over.  Top with second cake layer.  Spread 1/3 cup frosting over.  Top with third cake layer.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake.  Press nuts around bottom 2 inches of cake.  Chill 2 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover with cake dome; keep chilled.)

Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Connie Capani of Binghamton, New York, writes: "I am 100 percent Italian, so perhaps it's no surprise that I love food: To Italians, it's like a security blanket.  I learned how to make spaghetti and other Abruzzi favorites from my mother.  Looking at food magazines is what got me interested in venturing out into American culinary territory.  I wanted to know how to make a "gravy" that didn't include tomatoes.  These days, I work only part-time as a substitute teacher, but I still don't want to be in the kitchen the whole time when my husband and I entertain."

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-low heat.  Add onion, garlic, bay leaves, and guajillo chili; sautÈ until onion is tender, about 8 minutes.  Add clams and sautÈ 2 minutes.  Sprinkle with 1/4 cup parsley.   Add Sherry and lemon juice.

Increase heat to medium-high, cover, and simmer until clams open (discard any that do not open), about 8 minutes.  Transfer clams to shallow bowl.

Boil sauce until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour sauce over clams.  Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Clams in an oil and garlic sauce are found all over Spain but are especially good in Andalusia, where tiny bean clams are used.  Cockles, Manila clams, and small littlenecks work well, too.  Serve plenty of crusty bread to soak up the sauce.

  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     roasting chicken - (6 lbs) -- backbone removed,
                        cut into 8 pieces - (2 drumsticks, 2
                        thighs, 2 wings with top quarter of
                        adjoining breast, and 2 breasts)
                        === COOKING CHICKEN ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  6             ounces  thick-cut bacon slices -- crosscut into strips
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2              large  shallots -- chopped
  2              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  4              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  4              large  fresh parsley sprigs
  2              small  bay leaves
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  4        tablespoons  butter - (1/2 stick)
  1              pound  assorted fresh wild mushrooms
                        = (such as crimini and stemmed shiitake)
  20                    pearl onions - (1" dia) -- peeled
                        = (or boiling onions)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

For Marinating Chicken:  Combine wine, onion, celery, carrot, garlic, and peppercorns in large pot.  Bring to boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer 5 minutes.  Cool completely; mix in oil.  Place chicken pieces in large glass bowl.  Pour wine mixture over chicken; stir to coat.  Cover and refrigerate at least 1 day and up to 2 days, turning chicken occasionally.

For Cooking Chicken:  Using tongs, transfer chicken pieces from marinade to paper towels to drain; pat dry.  Strain marinade; reserve vegetables and liquid separately.

Heat oil in heavy large pot (wide enough to hold chicken in single layer) over medium-high heat.  Add bacon and sautÈ until crisp and brown.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to small bowl.  Add chicken, skin-side down, to drippings in pot.  SautÈ until brown, about 8 minutes per side.  Transfer chicken to large bowl.

Add vegetables reserved from marinade to pot.  SautÈ until brown, about 10 minutes.  Mix in flour; stir 2 minutes.  Gradually whisk in reserved marinade liquid.  Bring to boil, whisking frequently.  Cook until sauce thickens, whisking occasionally, about 2 minutes.  Mix in shallots, garlic, herb sprigs, and bay leaves, then broth.

Return chicken to pot, arranging skin-side up in single layer.  Bring to simmer; reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover pot and simmer chicken 30 minutes.  Using tongs, turn chicken over.  Cover and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes longer.

Meanwhile, melt 3 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add mushrooms; sautÈ until tender, about 8 minutes.  Transfer mushrooms to plate.  Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet.  Add onions and sautÈ until beginning to brown, about 8 minutes.  Transfer onions to plate alongside mushrooms; reserve skillet.

Using tongs, transfer chicken to plate.  Strain sauce from pot into reserved skillet, pressing on solids in strainer to extract all sauce; discard solids.  Bring sauce to simmer, scraping up browned bits.

Return sauce to pot.  Add onions to pot and bring to simmer over medium heat.  Cover and cook until onions are almost tender, about 8 minutes.  Add mushrooms and bacon.  Simmer uncovered until onions are very tender and sauce is slightly reduced, about 12 minutes.

Tilt pot and spoon off excess fat from top of sauce.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.  Return chicken to sauce.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled.)  Rewarm over low heat.

Arrange chicken on large rimmed platter.  Spoon sauce and vegetables over.  Sprinkle with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Marinating the chicken in the wine mixture adds flavor. Starting two days ahead and rewarming the dish improves that flavor.

Categories    : Desserts                        Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  water
     3/4           cup  slivered almonds -- toasted
  3               cups  vanilla ice cream -- slightly softened
  4        tablespoons  brandy
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
  1                cup  chopped butter cookies
  3               cups  coffee ice cream -- slightly softened
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground coffee beans
                        Honey-Brandy Oranges -- (see recipe)

Butter large piece of foil.  Stir sugar, honey, and 1 tablespoon water in heavy small saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat to high; boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 4 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Immediately stir in almonds.  Pour mixture onto prepared foil.  Cool completely.  Chop praline into 1/2-inch pieces.

Line 9- by 5- by 2 3/4-inch metal loaf pan with plastic.  Stir vanilla ice cream, 2 tablespoons brandy, and orange peel in bowl.  Fold in cookies.  Spoon half of ice cream mixture into prepared pan.  Cover and freeze pan and remaining vanilla ice cream mixture separately until almost firm.

Stir coffee ice cream, 2 tablespoons brandy, and ground coffee in another bowl.  Fold in chopped praline.  Spoon half of coffee ice cream mixture atop vanilla ice cream in loaf pan.  Top with remaining vanilla ice cream mixture, then coffee ice cream mixture.  Cover with plastic and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep frozen.)

Remove torte from loaf pan.  Cut into 1-inch-thick slices and serve with oranges.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  The crunchy honey-almond praline pieces in the ice cream are an easy, homemade version of turrÛn, a popular Spanish candy.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  ditalini - (abt 2 cups)
                        = (or other short tube-shaped pasta)
  1              pound  broccoli rabe -- cut 2" pieces
  1                can  vegetable broth - (14 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  1                can  cannellini - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
                        = (white kidney beans)
  1                     container purchased pesto - (7 oz)
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water 3 minutes.  Add broccoli rabe and boil until broccoli rabe is just crisp-tender and pasta is just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes longer.  Drain pasta and broccoli rabe, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid.  Return pasta and broccoli rabe to pot.

Meanwhile, bring vegetable broth and crushed red pepper to simmer in medium saucepan.  Add beans and simmer until beans are heated through, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.  Add bean mixture, pesto, and vinegar to pasta and broccoli rabe.  Stir well, adding pasta cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls if necessary.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve in shallow bowls.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Crusty bread and radicchio with creamy Italian dressing make nice sides.  End with red grapes and anise-dusted sugar cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  Black Forest ham in 1/4"-thk slices
     2/3           cup  mayonnaise
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  orange juice
  2          teaspoons  grated orange peel
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  4        tablespoons  butter - (1/2 stick)
                        Additional Dijon mustard
  4                     English muffins -- split, toasted
  8              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
                        = (or chopped fresh Italian parsley)

Using 3 1/4-inch biscuit cutter or clean 6-ounce tuna can as template, cut ham slices into rounds.

Whisk mayonnaise, 1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, orange juice, grated orange peel, and fresh lemon juice in small bowl to blend.  (Ham and sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Fill large skillet with enough water to reach depth of 2 inches.  Add white wine vinegar and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt to water.  Bring to simmer over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low.

Spread 3 tablespoons butter and some additional Dijon mustard over split sides of English muffins.  Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add ham rounds and cook just until beginning to brown, about 1 minute per side.  Place ham atop prepared English muffins.  Arrange English muffins on baking sheet.  Keep warm in oven while preparing eggs.

Crack eggs into skillet of simmering water.  Cook until whites are set and yolks are set to desired doneness, about 3 minutes for medium-set yolks.  Using slotted spoon, transfer eggs to plate.

Stir sauce in top of double boiler over simmering water until just heated through, about 2 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Place 1 egg atop ham on each prepared muffin half.  Spoon warm sauce over eggs, sprinkle with basil or parsley, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Rita Seger of Peru, Maine, writes:  "My husband, a friend, and I hiked a spectacular trail along the rocky cliffs of the northern Maine coast.  After roughing it for a couple of days, we enjoyed a night at the Weston House Bed & Breakfast in Eastport.  The next morning, one of the owners served a delicious version of eggs Benedict and mentioned that the sauce was easier to make than a typical hollandaise.  Could you request the recipe?"

Pour batter into prepared pan.  Bake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.  Cool cake completely in pan on rack.  Run knife around pan sides to loosen cake.  Release pan sides.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

For Caramel Sauce:  Stir sugar, water, and lemon juice in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, about 7 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Add in cream (mixture will bubble vigorously).  Return to low heat; stir until any bits of caramel dissolve.  Add butter; whisk until smooth.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Cut cake into wedges.  If desired, arrange wedges on baking sheet and rewarm in 350 degree oven 10 minutes.  Rewarm caramel sauce over medium-low heat, stirring often.  Place 1 cake wedge on each plate.  Drizzle with warm caramel sauce.  Serve with ice cream.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  eggplant -- peeled, and cut
                        crosswise into 1/8"-thk rounds - (abt 32)
  4               cups  water
  2 1/4      teaspoons  salt
     2/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1                cup  whole milk
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
                        Olive oil -- for frying
     1/4           cup  honey
  3        tablespoons  sesame seeds -- toasted
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint leaves

Place eggplant in large bowl.  Add 4 cups water and 2 teaspoons salt.  Let soak 30 minutes.  Drain well; pat eggplant dry with paper towels.

Mix flour, baking powder, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in medium bowl.  Whisk in milk and eggs.

Heat enough oil to come 1/2 inch up sides of pan in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Working in batches, dip eggplant rounds in batter, then fry in oil until golden, about 30 seconds per side.  Transfer to paper towels to drain.

Warm honey in small saucepan over medium heat.  Place eggplant rounds on platter.  Drizzle with honey.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds and mint; serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This recipe is from Andalusia in the south.  The North African touches of honey and mint come by way of the Moors, who ruled the region for centuries.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh oregano
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
  2                     bay leaves -- finely crumbled
  2             pounds  skinless halibut fillet -- cut into 1" pieces
                        Olive oil -- for frying
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

Whisk vinegar, garlic, oregano, thyme, cumin, and bay leaves in medium bowl to blend.  Add fish and toss to coat.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour or cover and refrigerate up to 4 hours.

Heat enough oil to come 1/2 inch up sides of pan in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Place flour in large bowl.  Remove fish from marinade.  Toss fish in flour, then shake off excess.

Working in batches, fry fish until cooked through and brown all over, turning occasionally with tongs, about 6 minutes per batch.  Transfer to paper towels to drain.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Transfer to platter.  Serve warm or at room temperature with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Generally this dish is served in Andalusia as part of a mixed fish fry, but it's wonderful on its own.  The marinade makes the fish flavorful and succulent.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  fresh basil leaves - (loosely packed)
  1 1/4           cups  mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  18            slices  pancetta, 1/8" thick
                        = (available at Italian markets and some
                        specialty food stores and supermarkets)
  18            slices  green tomatoes, 1/4" thick
                        = (abt 6 tomatoes)
  1                cup  all-purpose flour

  6             slices  yellow tomatoes, 1/4" thick
                        = (abt 2 tomatoes)
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced arugula

Puree basil, 1/4 cup mayonnaise, lemon juice, and mustard in processor until smooth.  Transfer to small bowl; mix in remaining 1 cup mayonnaise and season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Arrange pancetta in single layer on rimmed baking sheet.  Cook until pancetta is just crisp, about 15 minutes.  Transfer to paper towels to drain.  Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees.

Sprinkle all green tomato slices with salt and pepper.  Place 1/2 cup flour in shallow bowl.  Mix remaining 1/2 cup flour with cornmeal in another shallow bowl to blend.  Working with 1 green tomato slice at a time, coat with flour, then egg, then flour-cornmeal mixture.  Transfer to baking sheet.  Line second baking sheet with paper towels.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, fry green tomatoes until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to prepared baking sheet; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Keep warm in oven.

Sprinkle red and yellow tomatoes with salt and pepper.  Place 1 fried green tomato slice on each of 6 plates.  Spread each with 1 teaspoon basil mayonnaise, then top with 2 tablespoons arugula, 1 slice pancetta, 1 slice red tomato, another fried green tomato, 1 slice yellow tomato, pancetta, and another 2 tablespoons arugula.  Spoon 1 teaspoon mayonnaise over arugula, then top with remaining fried green tomatoes.  Spoon 1 teaspoon mayonnaise atop green tomato.  Finish with remaining pancetta and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Carey Paquette of Arlington, Virginia, writes:  "My boyfriend and I cook almost every night as a way to unwind.  It's nice to come home after a hectic day and make dinner together rather than pull something prepackaged out of the freezer.  One of our favorite things is grilled vegetables.  I'm always adding them to meals, since they don't need a lot of preparation.  They're the key ingredients in my popular chicken sandwiches."

              Grilled Peaches With Whipped Cream And Caramel

Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     firm but ripe large peaches -- peeled, halved,
                        and pitted
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
     3/4           cup  caramel sauce -- warmed

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Arrange peach halves, cut-side up, on baking sheet; sprinkle peaches with sugar.  Let stand until sugar begins to soften, about 10 minutes.  Place peaches on grill, sugared-side down.  Grill until tender and slightly charred, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer peach halves to plates.

Using electric mixer, beat whipping cream in bowl until peaks form; fold in 1/4 cup warm caramel sauce just until streaks appear.  Spoon caramel whipped cream alongside peaches.  Serve, passing remaining caramel sauce separately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Carey Paquette of Arlington, Virginia, writes:  "When it comes to cooking, I make an effort to prepare healthful meals, but wouldn't call myself a fanatic.  I believe that olive oil goes in everything and wine goes with everything; I just use them in moderation.  My boyfriend and I cook almost every night as a way to unwind.  It's nice to come home after a hectic day and make dinner together rather than pull something prepackaged out of the freezer."

     1/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  all purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  6                     ripe medium peaches -- peeled, halved,
                        pitted, cut 1/2"-thk slices - (abt 4 cups)
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  2        tablespoons  sliced almonds
  2        tablespoons  peach preserves -- melted
                        === MASCARPONE CREAM ===
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
  6        tablespoons  mascarpone cheese
                        = (Italian cream cheese available at
                        Italian markets and many supermarkets)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract

For Crust:  Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Using on/off turns, cut in butter until pea-size pieces form.  With machine running, add enough ice water by tablespoonfuls to form moist clumps.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic; refrigerate 1 hour.

Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Trim overhang to 1 inch.  Fold overhang in and press to form double-thick sides.  Press inside edge of crust to push it 1/8- to 1/4-inch above top edge of pan.  Pierce bottom of crust with fork.  Refrigerate 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake tart crust until golden, piercing with fork if bubbles form, about 25 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool; wrap in plastic and store at room temperature.)

For Filling:  Mix sugar, flour, and lemon peel in large bowl to blend.  Add peaches and toss to coat.  Pour into baked crust.  Drizzle honey over peach mixture; dot with butter and sprinkle with almonds.  Bake until peaches are tender and almonds are toasted, about 35 minutes.  Brush fruit and almonds with peach preserves.  Cool 15 minutes before serving.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Store tart at room temperature.)

For Mascarpone Cream:  Using electric mixer, beat cream, mascarpone, sugar, and vanilla in large bowl until peaks form.  Slice tart into 6 wedges and serve with dollops of mascarpone cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
     2/3           cup  hazelnuts -- toasted, husked,
                        cooled
     2/3           cup  cake flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6              large  eggs -- separated
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, and
                        cooled slightly
                        === BUTTERCREAM ===
  4          teaspoons  cornstarch
     2/3           cup  whole milk
  2              large  egg yolks
  1 1/2           cups  hazelnuts -- toasted, husked,
                        and cooled -- plus
  12             whole  nuts -- toasted, husked
  1 1/2           cups  powdered sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- cut 16 pieces,
                        and at room temperature
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  1                cup  apricot preserves
  3                     dried apricots -- cut into slivers

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour 9-inch-diameter springform pan.  Line bottom with parchment paper.  Blend first 4 ingredients in processor until nuts are ground as fine as flour.

Using electric mixer, beat egg yolks, 1/3 cup sugar, and vanilla in large bowl until mixture falls in heavy ribbon when beaters are lifted, about 5 minutes.

Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in another large bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add 1/3 cup sugar, beating until stiff but not dry.  Fold 1/4 of whites into yolk mixture to lighten.  Fold in remaining whites.

Sift half of flour mixture over; fold in gently.  Sift remaining flour mixture over and fold in, adding any nuts from sifter.  Drizzle butter over batter, folding in gently (do not overmix or batter will deflate).

Transfer batter to prepared pan; bake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.  Transfer pan to rack; cool cake 10 minutes.  Cut around pan sides to loosen cake; release pan sides.  Invert cake onto rack.  Remove pan bottom and parchment paper.  Cool.

For Buttercream:  Place cornstarch in heavy small saucepan.  Gradually add milk, stirring until cornstarch dissolves.  Whisk in egg yolks.  Whisk constantly over medium-high heat until custard comes to boil and thickens, about 3 minutes.  Transfer to large bowl.  Press plastic wrap onto surface of custard.  Chill 30 minutes.

Finely grind 1 cup nuts with powdered sugar in processor, about 30 seconds.  Using electric mixer, beat vanilla into custard.  Beat in butter, 1 piece at a time, then beat in ground nut mixture in 4 additions.  Refrigerate until firm enough to spread, stirring often, about 30 minutes.

Stir apricot preserves in small saucepan over medium heat for 1 minute.  Push preserves, including fruit pieces, through strainer into small bowl.  Cool.

Finely chop 1/2 cup hazelnuts.  Using long serrated knife, cut cake horizontally in half.  Place 1 layer, cut-side up, on 8-inch-diameter tart pan bottom or cardboard round.  Spread evenly with apricot preserves.  Top with second layer, cut-side down.  Transfer 3/4 cup buttercream to pastry bag fitted with large star tip.  Spread remaining buttercream over top and sides of cake.  Press 1/2 cup chopped hazelnuts onto sides of cake.

Pipe 12 rosettes around top edge of torte.  Place 1 hazelnut and 1 apricot sliver into each rosette.  Refrigerate until buttercream sets, at least 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome; keep chilled.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.)

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  3           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
                        === BERRY SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2                     baskets raspberries - (1/2 pint ea)

For Sauce:  Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over high heat.  Mix in sugar.  Add berries and stir until sugar dissolves and berries are heated through, about 3 minutes.  Remove skillet from heat; stir in liqueur.

Cut around cheesecakes to loosen.  Turn cheesecakes out onto plates.  Pour warm berry sauce around cheesecakes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Patrice Bedrosian, Brewster, NY
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into cubes,
                        and at room temperature
  2 1/2           cups  raisins
  3        tablespoons  caraway seeds
  2 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  1              large  egg

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter heavy ovenproof 10- to 12-inch-diameter skillet with 2- to 2 1/2-inch-high sides.

Whisk first 5 ingredients in large bowl to blend.  Add butter; using fingertips, rub in until coarse crumbs form.  Stir in raisins and caraway seeds.  Whisk buttermilk and egg in medium bowl to blend.  Add to dough; using wooden spoon, stir just until well incorporated (dough will be very sticky).

Transfer dough to prepared skillet; smooth top, mounding slightly in center.  Using small sharp knife dipped into flour, cut 1-inch-deep X in top center of dough.

Bake until bread is cooked through and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Cool bread in skillet 10 minutes.  Turn out onto rack and cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Wrap tightly in foil; store at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Patrice Bedrosian of Brewster, New York, writes: "In the days that followed September 11, 2001, I -- like so many Americans -- gravitated toward roast chicken, meat loaf, and anything that brought comfort and ease to my home.  You see, my stepbrother, Jerry O'Leary, a 34-year-old chef working at Cantor Fitzgerald's corporate dining room in One World Trade Center, was among the many victims on that terrible day.

"I feel quite certain that Jerry's love for cooking stemmed from his mother, Julie Lestrange.  And as long as I can remember, she has always had something delicious waiting for my family whenever we visit.

"I would like to share a recipe that Julie has given to me.  My hope is that you will, in turn, share it with my fellow readers, encouraging them to enjoy this delicious and comforting Irish bread, to smile, and to remember the love between a mother and a son."

Offer this easy-to-make bread with plenty of butter and your favorite jam.

Comments:  Patrice Bedrosian of Brewster, New York, writes: &quot;In the days that followed September 11, 2001, I -- like so many Americans -- gravitated toward roast chicken, meat loaf, and anything that brought comfort and ease to my home.  You see, my stepbrother, Jerry O&apos;Leary, a 34-year-old chef working at Cantor Fitzgerald&apos;s corporate dining room in One World Trade Center, was among the many victims on that terrible day.
</DirT>
<DirT>
&quot;I feel quite certain that Jerry&apos;s love for cooking stemmed from his mother, Julie Lestrange.  And as long as I can remember, she has always had something delicious waiting for my family whenever we visit.
</DirT>
<DirT>
&quot;I would like to share a recipe that Julie has given to me.  My hope is that you will, in turn, share it with my fellow readers, encouraging them to enjoy this delicious and comforting Irish bread, to smile, and to remember the love between a mother and a son.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
Offer this easy-to-make bread with plenty of butter and your favorite jam.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  cherry preserves
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  kirsch (clear cherry brandy)
                        === PANCAKES ===
  3              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  whole milk -- plus
  1         tablespoon  whole milk
     1/2           cup  water -- plus
  1         tablespoon  water
  3        tablespoons  corn oil
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/8      teaspoon  almond extract
  1              pinch  salt
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3        tablespoons  kirsch -- plus
     1/3           cup  kirsch
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        Additional corn oil
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
     1/4           cup  slivered almonds -- toasted

For Filling:  Mix preserves, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon kirsch in small bowl.

For Pancakes:  Combine first 7 ingredients, 1/4 cup sugar, and 3 tablespoons kirsch in blender.  Blend until smooth.  Add flour and blend until smooth.  Let batter stand 1 hour.

Stir batter to blend.  Lightly brush 7- to 8-inch-diameter nonstick skillet with oil; heat over medium heat.  Using 3 tablespoons batter for each pancake, add batter to skillet and quickly tilt pan to coat bottom completely (pancake will be thin).  Cook pancake until light golden on bottom, about 30 seconds.  Turn pancake over and cook until bottom is pale golden, about 20 seconds.  Transfer to plate.  Repeat with remaining batter, brushing skillet lightly with oil before cooking each pancake and stacking pancakes on plate between sheets of waxed paper.

Butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch broilerproof baking dish.  Place 1 pancake on work surface, pale-side up.  Spread scant 2 tablespoons filling over half of pancake.  Fold other half of pancake over filling, then fold in half again, forming triangle.  Repeat with 7 more pancakes and remaining filling.  Arrange pancakes in prepared baking dish.  (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.  Cover tightly and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before continuing.)

Preheat broiler.  Drizzle melted butter over pancakes; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar.  Broil just until edges of pancakes are brown, about 2 minutes.

Warm remaining 1/3 cup kirsch in small saucepan over low heat.  Remove from heat.  Using long match, carefully ignite kirsch; pour over pancakes.  Divide pancakes among 4 plates.  Sprinkle with almonds and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
     1/3           cup  whole milk
  1         tablespoon  distilled white vinegar
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  chilled solid vegetable shortening -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        === FILLING ===
     2/3           cup  sugar -- plus
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  orange juice
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  5               cups  pitted fresh cherries - (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
                        = (or frozen pitted sweet dark cherries,
                        thawed, drained [abt 26 oz frozen])
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  2          teaspoons  water -- for glaze

For Crust:  Whisk milk and vinegar in small bowl to blend.  Whisk flour and salt in medium bowl to blend; add shortening and rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Stir in milk mixture; briefly knead in bowl just until dough comes together.

Gather dough into ball.  Divide into 2 pieces, 1 slightly larger than the other.  Flatten each piece into disk.  Wrap disks separately in plastic and refrigerate 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare Filling:  Mix 2/3 cup sugar and next 6 ingredients in large bowl to combine.  Add cherries and toss to blend.  Let stand 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Roll out larger dough disk on lightly floured work surface to 13-inch round (crust will be thin).  Transfer to 10-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Roll out second disk on lightly floured work surface to 12- by 8-inch rectangle.  Using fluted pastry wheel or sharp knife, cut rectangle lengthwise into nine 3/4-inch-wide strips.

Spoon cherry filling into crust.  Place 5 dough strips across pie in 1 direction and 4 in opposite direction, forming lattice.  Press strip ends and edge of crust together to seal.  Crimp edges decoratively.  Brush lattice and edges with egg glaze.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup sugar over lattice.

Bake pie 20 minutes.  Cover crust edges with foil collar to prevent overbrowning.  Continue to bake until filling bubbles and crust is golden brown, about 40 minutes longer.  Transfer pie to rack and cool at least 1 hour.  Serve pie warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Test-kitchen tip:  A fluted pastry wheel will cut lattice strips with pretty scalloped edges, but a sharp knife works fine, too.

Spoon cherry filling into crust.  Place 5 dough strips across pie in 1 direction and 4 in opposite direction, forming lattice.  Press strip ends and edge of crust together to seal.  Crimp edges decoratively.  Brush lattice and edges with egg glaze.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup sugar over lattice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake pie 20 minutes.  Cover crust edges with foil collar to prevent overbrowning.  Continue to bake until filling bubbles and crust is golden brown, about 40 minutes longer.  Transfer pie to rack and cool at least 1 hour.  Serve pie warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

<DirT>
Test-kitchen tip:  A fluted pastry wheel will cut lattice strips with pretty scalloped edges, but a sharp knife works fine, too.

For Lemon Curd:  Combine first 5 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until butter melts and sugar dissolves.  Remove from heat.  Gradually whisk in eggs.  Whisk constantly over medium-low heat until curd thickens, about 2 minutes (do not boil).  Strain curd through sieve into bowl.  Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of curd; chill overnight.

For Lemon Syrup:  Combine all ingredients in small saucepan.  Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes.  Cool.

For Filling:  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup whipping cream, and vanilla in large bowl until smooth.  Beat 2 cups whipping cream and 1/4 cup sugar in another large bowl until peaks form.  Fold whipped cream into cream cheese mixture in 2 additions.

Puree 1 container blueberries and 1/4 cup lemon syrup in processor.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Add 1 1/2 containers blueberries and mash with potato masher until chunky puree forms.  Reserve remaining blueberries for garnish.

Arrange 1/3 of pound cake cubes (about 2 generous cups) in bottom of 14-cup glass trifle dish.  Drizzle with 7 tablespoons lemon syrup.  Spoon 1/3 of cream cheese filling (about 2 cups) over cake in dollops; spread to sides of dish.  Spoon half of blueberry puree over; spread to sides of dish.  Spoon half of lemon curd (about 1 1/4 cups) over blueberry puree in dollops, then spread to sides of dish.  Repeat layering with 1/3 of cake cubes, 7 tablespoons lemon syrup, 1/3 of cream cheese filling, and remaining blueberry puree, then remaining cake cubes, 7 tablespoons lemon syrup, and remaining lemon curd.  Spread remaining cream cheese filling over.  Sprinkle with reserved blueberries.  Cover and chill overnight.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)  Spoon trifle into dessert dishes.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Description:
  "The ideal summer dessert and make-ahead treat (it can chill for two days before serving).  Instead of the traditional custard, whipped cream folded into cream cheese is the easy filling in this version."

  4               cups  water
  1         tablespoon  Old Bay seasoning
  1         tablespoon  coarse kosher salt

Melt butter in saucepan and divide among 6 ramekins.

Remove corn, fennel, onions, potatoes, and mussels from pot (discard any mussels that do not open).  Divide among 6 large bowls.  Place 1/2 lobster atop mixture in each bowl.  Season broth with salt and pepper; pour over seafood and vegetables.  Serve with melted butter, lemons, and Lemon-Herb Mayonnaise.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut into pieces
     1/2           cup  toasted chopped pecans
     3/4           cup  whipping cream
  2              large  egg yolks
  1 1/4      teaspoons  maple extract
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for glaze

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in large bowl.  Using fingertips, rub in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Stir in chopped pecans.

Whisk cream, egg yolks, and maple extract in medium bowl to blend.  Pour over flour mixture; stir until moist clumps form.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface and knead gently until smooth, about 4 turns.  Pat dough out to 1/2-inch-thick round.  Using 2-inch-diameter fluted cutter, cut out scones.  Gather scraps.  Pat out dough and cut out additional scones.  Transfer scones to prepared baking sheet.  Brush with egg glaze.

Bake until scones are browned and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 16 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 12 scones.

Comments:  "There is a very special bakery in New Orleans that I visit on my many trips south," writes Lisa Despirito of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  "Piece of Cake serves luscious pastries of all sorts, but I always drop in for a maple-pecan scone and a cup of coffee."

Serve with whipped butter sweetened with a little maple syrup, if desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  ground pork
  8             ounces  ground veal
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
  1              slice  French bread, 1/2" thick -- crust removed,
                        soaked in water 3 minutes and squeezed dry
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
     1/2      teaspoon  Hungarian sweet paprika
  1                cup  low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4      teaspoon  crumbled saffron threads

Mix pork, veal, 1 tablespoon parsley, half of garlic, egg, bread, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in medium bowl to blend.  Shape meat mixture into 1-inch balls.  Dust meatballs with flour.  Set aside.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add meatballs and sautÈ until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer meatballs to plate.

Add onion to skillet; reduce heat to medium and sautÈ until tender, about 2 minutes.  Stir in paprika, then 1 cup broth and wine.  Return meatballs with any accumulated juices to skillet.  Bring to simmer.  Cover and cook until meatballs are tender, about 25 minutes.

Uncover; add 2 tablespoons parsley, remaining garlic, and saffron.  Simmer until sauce thickens, turning meatballs occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly, then cover and refrigerate.  Bring to simmer, thinning with broth if necessary.)

Place meatballs with sauce on platter.  Top with 1 tablespoon parsley.

This recipe yields about 32 meatballs.

Comments:  Redolent of garlic and saffron, these tiny meatballs are a sure hit at any tapas party.

     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/3           cup  white wine vinegar
  4          teaspoons  Moroccan spice blend

     1/3           cup  coarsely-chopped pecans
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        === PECAN TOPPING ===
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped pecans
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- room temperature
  1              large  egg white
                        === NECTARINES AND GLAZE ===
  4                     firm but ripe nectarines -- unpeeled, halved,
                        and pitted
     1/3           cup  apricot preserves
  1         tablespoon  water

For Crust:  Finely chop pecans with sugar in processor.  Add flour and salt; process 30 seconds to blend.  Add butter; process just until clumps form.  Gather dough together; flatten into rectangle.  Wrap in plastic; chill 30 minutes.

Line large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.  Roll out dough on lightly floured work surface to generous 12- by 10-inch rectangle.  Trim edges just to even sides.  Cut dough into eight 5- by 3-inch rectangles.  Transfer rectangles to prepared baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart.  Chill while preparing topping.

For Pecan Topping:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine pecans, sugar, and butter in processor.  Process until pecans are very finely chopped.  Add egg white and process until well blended.  Divide pecan topping equally among dough rectangles; spread to within 1/4 inch of edges.  Bake until pecan topping is set but cookies are still pale, about 10 minutes.  Remove cookies from oven; maintain oven temperature.

Meanwhile, prepare Nectarines And Glaze:  Thinly slice nectarine halves, keeping slices from each half together.  Arrange 1 nectarine half atop each cookie, fanning slices decoratively.  Return to oven and bake until cookies are light golden around edges, about 10 minutes.  Transfer baking sheet with tarts to rack.

Bring apricot preserves and 1 tablespoon water to simmer in heavy small saucepan.  Strain glaze through sieve set over bowl.  Brush glaze over nectarine slices.  Cool tarts completely on baking sheet.  (Tarts can be made 6 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.  Rewarm any remaining glaze and brush over tarts before serving, if desired.)

This recipe yields 8 tarts.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     3/4         pound  fresh crabmeat -- picked over
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped green onions
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick) -- room temperature
  4                     hot dog buns -- sides split open
  4                     red leaf or Bibb lettuce leaves

Whisk together mayonnaise, lemon juice, lemon peel, and cayenne pepper in medium bowl.  Mix in crabmeat and chopped green onions.  Season crab salad to taste with salt and pepper.

Spread butter on insides of hot dog buns.  Warm large skillet over medium heat 1 minute.  Place buns, buttered-side down, in preheated skillet and toast until golden, about 5 minutes.

Place 2 toasted buns on each of 2 plates.  Place 1 lettuce leaf inside each bun.  Divide crab salad among buns and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Creamy lobster salad heaped onto a buttered, toasted hot dog bun is the quintessential summer sandwich in northeastern shore towns.  This is an equally delicious ó and more economical ó variation.  Serve with: Potato chips, sweet pickles, and carrot and celery sticks.  Dessert: Blueberry pie and vanilla ice cream.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1/2 cup) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2        tablespoons  chilled solid vegetable shortening -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
  3                     thick-cut bacon slices -- chopped
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  1              pinch  sugar
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1              large  egg
  1              large  egg yolk
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Generous pinch of salt
                        Generous pinch of ground nutmeg
     1/2           cup  coarsely-grated GruyËre cheese - (packed)

For Crust:  Blend flour and salt in processor.  Add butter and shortening; using on/off turns, cut in until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 2 tablespoons ice water and process until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill at least 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Roll out dough on lightly floured work surface to 11-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom.  Press dough onto bottom and up sides of pan.  Pierce crust all over with fork.  Freeze 10 minutes.

Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake crust 10 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Bake until crust is set and partially cooked through, about 15 minutes longer.  Cool crust while making filling.  Maintain oven temperature.

For Filling:  SautÈ bacon in medium skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 4 minutes.  Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.  Add onion and pinch of sugar to drippings in skillet and sautÈ until onion is deep golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Whisk cream, egg, egg yolk, pepper, salt, and nutmeg in small bowl to blend.  Spread onion over bottom of baked crust; sprinkle bacon over, then cheese.  Pour cream mixture over.

Bake until tart is puffed and filling is set, about 25 minutes.  Cool tart on rack 10 minutes.  Remove pan sides.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

  3        tablespoons  butter
  4                     fully-cooked sausages - (13 oz total)
  1             medium  onion -- sliced
  1             medium  tart apple, such as Granny Smith -- peeled, cored,

  1                cup  apple cider
                        = (or apple juice)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh sage
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in large skillet over medium heat.  Add sausages and cook until beginning to brown, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Add onion and apple to sausages in pan; cook until onion and apple are tender and brown, stirring often, about 5 minutes.

Add apple cider and chopped sage; increase heat to high and stir until liquid is slightly reduced, about 2 minutes.  Stir in lemon juice.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Using slotted spoon, transfer onion and apple to 2 plates, dividing equally.  Top with sausages.  Whisk remaining 2 tablespoons butter into cider mixture.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Drizzle over sausages and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Steamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and oatmeal cookies would fit the rustic theme.

Categories    : First Course                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dried lentils
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  chopped red onion
  4                     Italian sweet sausages - (abt 13 oz) -- casings removed,
                        and crumbled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  dry red wine
  12            ounces  small pasta
                        = (such as conchiglie or pennette)
  2             ounces  grated pecorino Romano cheese - -- (abt 3/4 cup packed)
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
                        Additional extra-virgin olive oil
                        Additional grated pecorino Romano cheese

Cook lentils in small saucepan of boiling water until tender, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.  Drain well; set aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sausage; sautÈ until sausage is light brown, about 8 minutes.  Add wine and cook until almost all liquid evaporates, about 2 minutes.  Stir in cooked lentils and cook until mixture is heated through, about 3 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain well, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking water.

Return cooked pasta to pot.  Add sausage-lentil mixture, 3/4 cup cheese, and parsley and toss to coat.  Add enough reserved pasta cooking water to moisten.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve, passing additional olive oil and grated cheese.

This recipe yields 6 first-course or 4 main-course servings.

Comments:  "For my son's birthday, I'd like to make a pasta, sausage, and lentil dish that we both ate during an Italian vacation," writes Miriam Scott of New York, New York.  "We stayed at Locanda l'Elisa, located just south of Lucca in Tuscany.  The hotel's greenhouse-like restaurant, the Gazebo, served the pasta dish that was so wonderful.  Could you possibly track down the recipe? "

Adding some of the pasta's cooking water to this dish gives it a creamy quality.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  water
  2          teaspoons  light corn syrup
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  5             medium  peaches -- unpeeled, quartered,
                        and pitted
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- thawed
                        = (half of 17.3-oz package)
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
                        Sweetened whipped cream

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Combine sugar, 3 tablespoons water, and light corn syrup in small nonstick skillet.  Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of skillet with wet pastry brush and swirling skillet, about 7 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Quickly stir in unsalted butter, fresh lemon juice, and salt.  Immediately pour caramel into nonstick 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.

Place unpeeled peach quarters, skin-side down, in concentric circles atop caramel in cake pan, covering caramel completely.  Bake until peaches are just tender, about 30 minutes.  Remove cake pan from oven.

Roll out puff pastry sheet on lightly floured work surface to 12-inch square.  Using 10-inch-diameter tart pan bottom or plate as guide, cut out round.  Pierce pastry all over with fork.  Cover peaches in cake pan with pastry round; press pastry down around peaches at edge of cake pan.

Bake tart until pastry is puffed and deep golden, about 27 minutes.  (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.  Let stand in cake pan at room temperature.  Rewarm tart in 350 degree oven for 10 minutes before continuing.)  Let tart rest 5 minutes.  Cut around edge of cake pan to loosen pastry.  Place large platter over cake pan.  Using oven mitts, hold cake pan and platter firmly together and invert, allowing tart to settle onto platter.  Carefully lift off cake pan.  Rearrange any peaches that may have become dislodged.  Cool tart 30 minutes.  Sprinkle with lemon peel.  Cut warm tart into wedges; serve with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  3        tablespoons  butter
  2                     purchased mustard-marinated pork
                        tenderloins - (2 lbs total) -- each cut crosswise
                        into 3 pieces, patted dry
  2                     parsnips -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces - (abt 1 1/2 cups)
  3               cups  cubed peeled seeded butternut squash
  1                cup  frozen petite whole onions
  1                can  low-salt chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  3        tablespoons  coarse-grained Dijon mustard
                        Salt -- to taste

Melt butter in large deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Add pork; brown on all sides, about 5 minutes total.  Add parsnips, squash, onions, broth, and thyme; bring to boil.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PUFFS ===
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4              large  eggs
                        === FILLING ===
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/2      teaspoon  unflavored gelatin
  2               cups  whole milk
     2/3           cup  whipping cream
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  6              large  egg yolks
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
                        === SAUCE ===
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
     1/3           cup  water
     2/3           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut into cubes

For Puffs:  Bring 1 cup water and butter to boil in heavy medium saucepan.  Reduce heat to low; add flour and salt.  Stir until mixture is smooth and pulls away from sides of pan, forming ball, about 1 minute.  Transfer to large bowl.  Using handheld mixer, beat in eggs 1 at a time, blending well after each addition.  Cover dough loosely with plastic.  Let stand until cool, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Lightly butter 2 large baking sheets.  Spoon dough into pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch plain tip.  Pipe 1-inch rounds on prepared baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart.  Using moistened fingertips, smooth rounds.  Bake until golden brown and puffed, about 23 minutes.  Remove puffs from oven; turn off heat.  Pierce side of each puff with tip of small knife.  Return puffs to oven; let stand 10 minutes with door ajar.  Remove from oven and cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

For Filling:  Place 1 tablespoon water in small bowl.  Sprinkle gelatin over.  Bring milk, cream, and vanilla bean to simmer in heavy large saucepan.  Whisk egg yolks, sugar, flour, and salt in large bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in hot milk mixture; return to saucepan.  Whisk over medium heat until filling thickens and boils, about 1 minute.  Stir in gelatin mixture.  Transfer filling to medium bowl.  Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of filling and chill until cold, about 3 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.)

Spoon pastry cream filling into pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch plain tip.  Insert tip into cut on each puff and fill with cream.  (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate.)

For Sauce:  Stir sugar and 1/3 cup water in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat to high and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan.  Add cream (mixture will bubble vigorously).  Whisk in butter.  Remove from heat.

Place 4 puffs on each plate.  Drizzle puffs with warm caramel sauce.

This recipe yields about 4 dozen puffs.

Comments"  This dessert combines two confections that are popular in Chile: caramel and the small cream puffs called profiteroles.

  1              pound  dried poquito beans
                        = (or pink beans)
  1              pound  smoked bacon -- chopped
  1              large  red onion -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  2               cups  orange juice
  1         tablespoon  minced canned chipotle chilies -- see * Note

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  red onion -- thinly sliced

* Note:  Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

Place beans in large bowl.  Pour enough cold water over to cover beans by 1 1/2 inches; let stand overnight.

Cook bacon in large pot over medium heat until crisp, about 12 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels.  Transfer 3 tablespoons bacon drippings to small bowl.

Heat remaining drippings in pot over medium-high heat.  Add chopped onion and cumin; sautÈ 5 minutes.  Stir in juice and chilies; boil 5 minutes.  Add beans and soaking liquid; bring to boil.

Reduce heat to medium.  Cover partially; simmer 2 hours.  Uncover; simmer until beans are tender and liquid thickens, about 30 minutes.  Stir in bacon.  Season with salt and pepper.

Combine reserved bacon drippings and sliced onion in large skillet.  SautÈ over medium heat until brown, about 25 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Transfer beans to large bowl.  Top with caramelized onion and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Poquitos are small, pinkish-brown beans indigenous to the Santa Ynez region.  Dried pink beans are a good substitute.

                        === PARFAIT CAKE ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  1            package  soft coconut macaroons - (13 oz)
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds -- toasted
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  3              large  peaches - (abt 20 oz) -- peeled, pitted,
                        and diced
  3                     containers raspberries - (1/2 pint ea)
  2 1/2           cups  chilled heavy whipping cream
  9              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  light corn syrup
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  peach schnapps
                        === DECORATION ===
  5             ounces  imported white chocolate -- finely chopped
                        === COMPOTE AND TOPPING ===
  6              large  peaches - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, pitted,
                        and thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  peach schnapps
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  3                     containers raspberries - (1/2 pint ea) -- for topping

For Parfait Cake:  Spray 9-inch springform pan with 3-inch-high sides with nonstick spray.  Finely grind macaroons, almonds, and lemon peel in processor.  Press half of mixture over bottom of prepared pan.

Puree peaches in processor.  Transfer puree to heavy deep-sided saucepan and bring to simmer over medium heat.  Cook until reduced to 1 cup, stirring often, about 10 minutes (color of puree will darken slightly).  Transfer to bowl and chill until cool, about 15 minutes.

Puree raspberries in processor.  Strain through sieve set over medium bowl, pressing to extract as much fruit as possible.  Chill puree.

Whisk 1/4 cup cream, egg yolks, sugar, corn syrup, and butter in large metal bowl to combine.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water).  Whisk constantly until parfait base thickens and thermometer inserted into base registers 160 degrees, about 8 minutes.

Remove bowl from over water.  Using electric mixer, beat parfait base until billowy and completely cool, about 8 minutes.  Divide between 2 medium bowls (about 1 cup parfait base in each bowl).  Beat remaining 2 1/4 cups cream in large bowl until medium peaks form.  Fold cool peach puree and schnapps into 1 parfait base, then fold in half of whipped cream.  Spread peach parfait in prepared pan.  Sprinkle remaining macaroon mixture over.  Place in freezer.

Fold 1 cup of raspberry puree (reserve remaining puree for another use) into parfait base in second bowl.  Fold in remaining whipped cream.  Spread parfait over macaroon mixture in pan.  Cover; freeze at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.

For Decoration:  Fold 30- by 7-inch strip aluminum foil lengthwise in half to form 30- by 3 1/2-inch strip.

Microwave white chocolate in glass bowl for 10-second intervals until chocolate just begins to melt; stir until smooth.  Pour into small resealable plastic bag.  Cut tip off 1 corner of bag.  Pipe white chocolate over foil strip in lacy design.  Let stand until chocolate sets, about 10 minutes.

Using heated knife, cut around parfait cake to loosen; remove pan sides.  Holding foil strip upright and parallel to bottom of cake, place 1 end against cake, white chocolate side in.  Gently press strip completely around cake like a fence, leaving overhang.  Freeze 10 minutes.  Starting at overhang, carefully peel off foil.  Trim off chocolate overhang.  Cover; return cake to freezer for up to 12 hours.

For Compote And Topping:  Combine all ingredients except raspberries in large bowl; let compote stand at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour, stirring occasionally.  Arrange raspberries atop cake.  Cut cake into wedges.  Serve with compote.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Market tip:  Lindt and Perugina white chocolate gave the best results in our test kitchen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  center-cut 4-bone pork rib roast -- bones frenched,
                        roast well trimmed
  8              whole  dried apricots
  8              whole  pitted prunes
  2        tablespoons  corn oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried marjoram
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  2              large  carrots -- coarsely chopped
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter -- room temperature
  1 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  coarse-grained Dijon mustard
  1 1/2           cups  low-salt chicken broth
     1/2           cup  dry white wine

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Using long slender knife, carve out 3/4-inch-diameter horizontal tunnel through center of pork.  Chop carved-out meat and reserve.  Using handle of wooden spoon, firmly pack apricots and prunes into tunnel of roast.

Place roast on rack in roasting pan; rub with 1 tablespoon oil.  Sprinkle roast with 1/2 teaspoon marjoram, salt, and pepper.  Scatter onion, carrots, garlic cloves, and chopped meat around rack in pan.  Drizzle vegetables with 1 tablespoon oil; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon marjoram.

Roast pork until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of meat (not stuffing) registers 150 degrees, stirring vegetables occasionally, about 1 hour 25 minutes.  Transfer pork to cutting board; tent with foil to keep warm.

Whisk butter, flour, and both mustards in small bowl to blend.  Add broth and wine to roasting pan; place on 2 burners and simmer juices over medium heat until mixture is reduced to 1 1/2 cups, scraping up browned bits, about 3 minutes.

Strain liquid into small saucepan; skim fat from surface.  Bring liquid to boil.  Whisk in mustard mixture; simmer until sauce thickens slightly, whisking frequently, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Cut pork between ribs into chops.  Serve with sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
                        = (available at Italian markets,
                        specialty foods stores, and many
                        supermarkets)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/4         pounds  large button mushrooms -- halved
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped shallots
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh chives
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped smoked ham
                        = (such as Black Forest)
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Fresh parsley sprigs -- for garnish

Place dried mushrooms in medium bowl; add enough boiling water to cover.  Let stand until mushrooms soften, about 45 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to work surface; reserve mushroom soaking liquid.  Chop mushrooms.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add button mushrooms.  SautÈ until mushrooms are brown and juices evaporate, about 12 minutes.  Add porcini mushrooms; stir 1 minute.  Transfer mushroom mixture to medium bowl.

Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to same skillet over medium heat.  Add shallots and next 3 ingredients.  SautÈ until shallots are tender, about 2 minutes.  Add mushroom mixture and 1/2 cup mushroom soaking liquid, leaving behind any sediment.  Cover and simmer until mushrooms are tender, stirring occasionally and adding more soaking liquid if mixture is dry, about 20 minutes.  Add lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Rewarm over medium heat before serving.)

Transfer mushroom mixture to serving bowl.  Garnish with parsley sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Traditionally, this flavorful sautÈ would be composed entirely of fresh cËpes (we know them better by their Italian name, porcini) gathered from the forests around Bordeaux.  In this recipe, dried porcini mushrooms are supplemented with fresh large button mushrooms.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  rice pilaf mix with toasted almonds - --(6
  2        tablespoons  oriental sesame oil
  4 1/2           cups  mixed chopped assorted salad bar veggies
                        = (such as broccoli florets, red bell
                        pepper, mushrooms, and red onion)
  1              pound  uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  hoisin sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cook rice with its flavoring packet according to package directions.

Heat sesame oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add vegetables, shrimp, ginger, and garlic.  Stir-fry until vegetables are crisp-tender and shrimp are just opaque in center, about 4 minutes.

Add cooked rice and hoisin sauce to skillet.  Stir to blend.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Vegetables from the supermarket salad bar get an Asian spin.  Start with purchased wonton soup, and serve a mixed green salad with ginger vinaigrette alongside the rice.  Sliced pineapple with coconut sorbet is the perfect finish.  Look for hoisin at Asian markets and in the Asian foods section of most supermarkets.

  2               cups  hickory-wood chips -- soaked in water
                        for 1 hour, drained
  1                     disposable 9" aluminum foil pie pan
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper

Combine first 5 ingredients in large bowl.  Add oil; toss gently to coat.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Arrange hickory chips in foil pie pan; place directly atop coals.  Allow chips to begin smoking, about 10 minutes.

Grill vegetables until tender, turning frequently, about 10 minutes for tomatoes, 20 minutes for chilies, onion, and bell pepper, and 35 minutes for garlic.  Transfer vegetables to cutting board.  Cool.

Remove any loosened peel from tomatoes, chilies, and bell pepper.  Peel garlic.  Coarsely chop all vegetables; transfer to medium bowl.  Mix in cilantro and cayenne pepper.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Cover; chill.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields about 5 cups.

Comments:  If you have a gas grill and want great smoky flavor, soak hickory-wood chips in water one hour.  Drain well; place chips in a disposable aluminum pie pan directly over flames (or over lava rocks if they are part of the grill's design).  Allow chips to begin smoking, then grill vegetables until tender.

Anaheim chilies are also known as California chilies.  They are available at Latin American markets and many supermarkets.

This recipe is an accompaniment for "Spicy Barbecued Rib-Eye Steaks with Smoked Vegetable Salsa" (see recipe).

For Biscuits:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Whisk first 6 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Add butter; rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add half-and-half; stir just until dough forms.  Gather dough into ball with floured hands.  Gently knead 8 times against side of bowl.

Roll out dough on floured surface to 3/4-inch-thick round.  Using 3-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out 5 biscuits; place on ungreased baking sheet.  Gather dough and reroll as needed to make 1 more biscuit.

Bake biscuits until pale golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.  Cool 20 minutes.  (Biscuits can be made 8 hours ahead; cool completely and store in airtight container at room temperature.)

For Spiced Plums:  Melt butter in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add plums and sugar.  Cook until sugar dissolves and becomes syrupy and plums are just tender, stirring constantly, about 6 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in cinnamon and ground ginger.  Cool 5 minutes.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature; rewarm before serving.)

Using electric mixer, beat cream in medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Add 2 teaspoons powdered sugar and beat to firm peaks.  Fold in crystallized ginger.

Cut biscuits in half; place bottom halves on 6 dessert plates.  Top with warm plums, then cream.  Cover with biscuit tops.  Sift powdered sugar over.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  low-salt beef broth
  2             ounces  beef bone marrow
                        = (from four 2"-thk beef crosscut
                        shank bones)
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (3/4 stick)
  1              large  shallot -- finely chopped
  1                cup  dry red wine
  4                     New York strip steaks, 1/2" thk - -- (abt 8 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

Bring broth to simmer in heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add marrow; reduce heat to low and poach gently until marrow looks translucent and gray, about 2 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer marrow to small plate.  Refrigerate marrow poaching liquid.  Refrigerate marrow until cold and firm, about 45 minutes.  Dice marrow finely; cover and chill.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep marrow and poaching liquid chilled.)

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shallot and sautÈ until translucent, about 3 minutes.  Add wine and boil until reduced to scant 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes.  Transfer reduction to small bowl.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over high heat.  Sprinkle steaks lightly with salt and pepper.  Add to skillet and sear until cooked to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Transfer steaks to plates.

Add wine reduction to skillet and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Reduce heat to medium.  Whisk in remaining 3 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Add 1/4 cup reserved marrow poaching liquid and diced marrow.  Cook until marrow melts and sauce is smooth, whisking constantly, about 2 minutes.  Thin sauce with more poaching liquid by tablespoonfuls, if desired.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.  Spoon sauce over steaks.  Sprinkle with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In France, an entrecÙte (literally, "between the ribs") is the most tender cut of beef; New York strips are a close equivalent.  For this recipe, the steaks are quickly seared, then topped with a lighter, contemporary version of the classic sauce bordelaise made with beef marrow and red wine.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  crËme fraÓche -- see * Note
  2              large  egg yolks
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  2              large  shallots -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  Cognac or brandy
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1                     generous pinch of saffron threads
  40                    mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        Fresh chives for garnish

* Note:  Sold at some supermarkets.  If unavailable, heat 1 cup whipping cream to lukewarm (85 degrees).  Remove from heat and mix in 2 tablespoons buttermilk.  Cover and let stand in warm draft-free area until slightly thickened, 24 to 48 hours, depending on temperature of room.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

Whisk crËme fraÓche and egg yolks in medium bowl to blend.  Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add shallots and sautÈ until soft, about 3 minutes.  Remove skillet from heat.  Add Cognac and ignite with match.  Let flames burn out; whisk in lemon juice and saffron.  Set both mixtures aside.

Place mussels in heavy large pot; pour in wine.  Bring to boil over medium-high heat.  Cover pot and cook until mussels open, about 6 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Using tongs, transfer mussels to baking sheet (discard any mussels that do not open).  Remove top half of each mussel shell; divide mussels in bottom shells among 4 bowls.  Tent with foil.

Strain mussel cooking liquid from pot through sieve lined with damp paper towel into skillet with shallot mixture.  Boil over medium-high heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 3 minutes.  Very slowly whisk hot liquid into crËme fraÓche mixture; return to same skillet.  Stir over low heat just until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat; season sauce with salt and pepper.  Spoon sauce over mussels.  Garnish with chives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The name for this beautiful Bordelais dish is mouclade.  Use small mussels to approximate the tiny, sweet variety cultivated just off the coast north of Bordeaux.

What to drink:  Baron Philippe de Rothschild 2000 Mouton Cadet Blanc.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" cubes
  3        tablespoons  chilled solid vegetable shortening -- cut 1/2" cubes
  4        tablespoons  ice water -- more or less
                        === FILLING AND TOPPING ===
  5             ounces  soft fresh goat cheese
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  sour cream
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper - (generous)
  3              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              small  red bell pepper -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and cut into 1/2" strips
     1/2        medium  fennel bulb -- cored, and
                        cut lengthwise into 1/2" strips
  1              small  zucchini - (abt 5 oz) -- halved lengthwise,
                        and cut crosswise into 1/2" pieces
  1              small  yellow squash - (abt 5 oz) -- halved lengthwise,
                        and cut crosswise into 1/2" pieces
     1/2           cup  fresh corn kernels
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil

For Crust:  Blend flour and salt in processor.  Using on/off turns, cut in butter and shortening until pea-size pieces form.  With machine running, add enough ice water by tablespoonfuls to form moist clumps.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic; refrigerate 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Soften dough slightly at room temperature before continuing.)

Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Trim dough overhang to 1 inch.  Fold overhang in; press to form double-thick sides.  Pierce bottom of dough all over with fork.  Refrigerate 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake crust until golden, piercing with fork if bubbles form, about 20 minutes.  Cool 5 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees.

For Filling And Topping:  Whisk cheese, cream, sour cream, salt, and cayenne in medium bowl to blend.  Add eggs and whisk to blend.  Pour into prepared crust.  Bake until filling is set, about 20 minutes.  Cool 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat oil in large skillet over medium heat.  Add bell pepper and fennel and sautÈ until beginning to soften, about 4 minutes.  Add zucchini, yellow squash, and corn; sautÈ until all vegetables are tender, about 12 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mound vegetables on top of tart and sprinkle with basil.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

For Crust:  Blend flour and salt in processor.  Using on/off turns, cut in butter and shortening until pea-size pieces form.  With machine running, add enough ice water by tablespoonfuls to form moist clumps.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic; refrigerate 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Soften dough slightly at room temperature before continuing.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Trim dough overhang to 1 inch.  Fold overhang in; press to form double-thick sides.  Pierce bottom of dough all over with fork.  Refrigerate 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake crust until golden, piercing with fork if bubbles form, about 20 minutes.  Cool 5 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Filling And Topping:  Whisk cheese, cream, sour cream, salt, and cayenne in medium bowl to blend.  Add eggs and whisk to blend.  Pour into prepared crust.  Bake until filling is set, about 20 minutes.  Cool 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, heat oil in large skillet over medium heat.  Add bell pepper and fennel and sautÈ until beginning to soften, about 4 minutes.  Add zucchini, yellow squash, and corn; sautÈ until all vegetables are tender, about 12 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mound vegetables on top of tart and sprinkle with basil.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4         pounds  vine-ripened tomatoes -- halved, seeded
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

                        halves cut diagonallly 4"-long -- lightly toasted
                        Additional extra-virgin olive oil
  12                    anchovy fillets - (to 20)

Using coarse grater held over medium bowl, grate tomatoes down to skin.  Discard skin.  Add 1/3 cup olive oil and garlic to grated tomatoes.  Season mixture to taste with salt and pepper.  (Tomatoes can be prepared 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHOCOLATE STARS ===
  6             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  1         tablespoon  solid vegetable shortening
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray -- as needed
                        === CAKE ===
  4             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
                        === FILLING AND FROSTING ===
  3               cups  chilled whipping cream
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut into pieces
  1              pound  good-quality white chocolate -- finely chopped
                        = (such as Lindt or Baker's)
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  4        tablespoons  amaretto
                        = (or other almond liqueur)

For Chocolate Stars:  Line baking sheet with foil.  Stir chocolate and shortening in top of double boiler set over simmering water until melted and smooth.  Pour onto prepared baking sheet, tilting pan to spread chocolate mixture to irregular 14- by 9-inch rectangle.  Refrigerate until just firm, about 12 minutes.

Spray assorted star-shaped cookie cutters with nonstick spray.  Cut out stars.  Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.  Using small offset spatula, carefully transfer stars 1 at a time to another foil-lined baking sheet.  Refrigerate until ready to use.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and keep refrigerated.)

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line bottoms with parchment paper; butter parchment.

Stir unsweetened chocolate in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth.  Cool slightly.

Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in large bowl until well blended.  Beat in lukewarm melted unsweetened chocolate and vanilla.  Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, blending well after each addition.  Mix in cocoa powder mixture in 3 additions, alternating with milk in 2 additions.

Divide batter between prepared pans.  Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Run knife around edge of each pan to loosen cakes.  Turn cakes out onto racks and cool completely.  Peel off parchment.

For Filling And Frosting:  Bring 1 cup cream and butter to simmer in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring until butter melts.  Remove from heat.  Add white chocolate and stir until smooth.  Whisk in vanilla.  Pour 1 1/2 cups white chocolate filling into small bowl; cover and freeze until cold, about 2 hours.

Let remaining white chocolate mixture in saucepan stand at room temperature until lukewarm, about 20 minutes.

Using electric mixer, beat remaining 2 cups cream and almond extract in large bowl until peaks form.  Working in 3 batches, fold in lukewarm white chocolate mixture.  Refrigerate whipped cream frosting just until medium peaks hold, folding occasionally, about 3 hours.

Brush 2 tablespoons amaretto over top of each cake layer.  Place 1 layer on platter.  Spread chilled 1 1/2 cups white chocolate filling over.  Top with second cake layer.  Spread whipped cream frosting over top and sides of cake.  Chill until cold and set, about 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep refrigerated.)

Arrange chocolate stars decoratively atop cake and serve.

This recipe yields 12 to 14 servings.

Description:
  "A thick layer of pure white chocolate truffle separates the amaretto-brushed layers, and a bit more truffle filling is used to flavor the whipped cream icing."
