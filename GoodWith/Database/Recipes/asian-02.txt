                              Almond Cookies

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar (white)
     3/4           cup  soft brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  margarine
  1                     egg
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract (essence)
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
                        Sesame seeds -- as needed
  24                    blanched almond halves

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 

Cream the sugars with the margarine.  Add the egg and almond extract and beat until fluffy. 

Sift the flour and baking powder together and fold into the mixture a little at a time.  Beat lightly to make a smooth dough.  Do not knead the mixture too much, or the cookies will be hard. 

Shape the dough into balls the size of a walnut.  Dip the tops of the cookies into the sesame seeds.  (You may need to slightly dampen the top of each with a little water.)  Lightly press half an almond into the center and flatten a little. 

Place the cookies about 1 inch apart.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until golden brown.  Store in airtight containers. 

This recipe yields 24 cookies. 

Comments:  The almond has an interesting history in China.  The sweet almond was already in cultivation in the late Tang dynasty (AD 618-906), having been brought to China from Russian Turkestan and central Asia. 

The bitter almond is a local nut, which is actually the kernel of the native apricot.  It is used extensively in Chinese herbal medicine for respiratory dysfunctions and is also added in carefully prescribed quantity (because of its slightly toxic properties in its raw state and its strong bitter taste) to "superior" soups such as double-boiled quail and ginseng soup. 

In desserts, it is often ground and combined with milk.  The technique of baking, as in the above recipe, is borrowed from the West.

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BARBECUED PORK FILLING ===
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  oyster sauce
     1/2           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil or corn oil
  1              small  yellow onion -- diced
  2                     green (spring) onions -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
  1              pound  Cantonese Barbecued Pork -- diced (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil
                        === BREAD DOUGH ===
  2 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast - (1 pkg)
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1                cup  milk -- heated
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     egg -- beaten
  3 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus extra as needed
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  16           squares  parchment paper - (each 4" square)
                        === GLAZE ===
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  water

To make the filling, in a small bowl, stir together the 3 sauces, water, cornstarch and sugar until smooth; set aside. 

Preheat a wok over medium heat and add the oil.  When it is hot, add both onions and the ginger and stir-fry until the onions are softened but not browned, about 1 minute. 

Increase the heat to high, add the pork and toss to mix.  Stir the sauce quickly and add to the pork.  Bring to a boil and stir until thickened, about 30 seconds.  Stir in the sesame oil.  Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate until well chilled. 

To make the bread dough, in a bowl, stir together the yeast, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and the warm water.  Let stand until the yeast bubbles, about 3 minutes.  Stir in the warm milk, oil and egg; set aside. 

In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine the flour, salt and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.  With the motor running, slowly pour in the yeast-milk mixture.  Process until the dough forms a rough ball and begins to pull away from the sides of the work bowl, about 15 seconds.  If it is sticky, sprinkle in a little flour and process for 30 seconds longer. 

Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth and spongy but resilient, 3 to 5 minutes.  Form into a ball, place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours at warm room temperature (or overnight in the refrigerator). 

Turn the dough out onto the work surface.  Sprinkle with the baking powder and knead until incorporated, about 3 minutes.  Cut the dough in half and roll each half into a rope 8 inches long.  Cut each rope into 8 pieces.  Cover unused pieces with a damp kitchen towel.  Roll each piece into a ball.  Using a rolling pin, flatten each ball into a round 5 inches in diameter. 

To fill each bun, place 2 tablespoons filling in the center of a round.  Pull the edges so that they come together and then pinch them together securely to enclose the filling.  Shape into a smooth domed bun and place, pinched-side down, on a parchment square.  Set on a baking sheet.  Make the remaining buns in the same way and place 2 inches apart on the sheet.  Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. 

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.  To make the glaze, in a bowl, stir together all the ingredients. 

Just before baking, brush the buns with the glaze.  Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes.  Serve hot or at room temperature. 

This recipe yields 16 buns. 

Comments:  In China, jingling bells or the slapping of bamboo sticks signals the arrival of street vendors, who deliver to the door a mÈlange of breakfast foods.  One popular choice is buns stuffed with honey-glazed pork nuggets.

Shape into a smooth domed bun and place, pinched-side down, on a parchment square.  Set on a baking sheet.  Make the remaining buns in the same way and place 2 inches apart on the sheet.  Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.  To make the glaze, in a bowl, stir together all the ingredients. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Just before baking, brush the buns with the glaze.  Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes.  Serve hot or at room temperature. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 16 buns. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  In China, jingling bells or the slapping of bamboo sticks signals the arrival of street vendors, who deliver to the door a mÈlange of breakfast foods.  One popular choice is buns stuffed with honey-glazed pork nuggets.

                         Bamboo Shoots With Pork

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
                        (available at Chinese stores)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
  10            ounces  lean pork -- sliced across grain
                        into fine 1 1/2" long julienne
     1/4           cup  groundnut/peanut oil
  5             ounces  bamboo shoots -- sliced to match
                        the pork
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  4                     scallions (spring onions) mainly white -- cut 1" lengths

Mix the marinade ingredients together and marinate the pork for 15 minutes. 

Pour the groundnut oil into a preheated wok and heat until the oil begins to smoke.  Stir-fry the pork slices until the color changes, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove to a plate. 

Add the bamboo shoots, and toss quickly around the hot wok for 10 to 15 seconds.  Add the soy sauce and sugar.  Lower the heat and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Raise the heat to high.  Return the pork and toss together quickly. 

Sprinkle in the scallions, and stir-fry for 1 minute to combine all of the ingredients.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  It was in ancient China, in early Han times (202 BC-AD 220), that the delicately flavored shoot was discovered as a food.  It is the tender young shoot of an edible bamboo plant from about 6 inches (15 cm) high.  The creamy young shoot is considered a great delicacy in winter, having a more pronounced flavor than the spring bamboo shoot, which is more delicate in taste but possesses a crunchier texture. 

Fresh bamboo shoots add a delicacy and refinement to dishes, as indicated in this simple dish.

                           Beef And Black Beans

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Chinese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  beef rump -- thinly sliced
                        across the grain into 2" by 1" pieces
                        === MARINADE ===
  2          teaspoons  light soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
  1                     green bell pepper -- cut into julienne
  1                     white onion -- sliced
  1                     scallion -- cut into 1" lengths
                        === BLACK BEAN SAUCE ===
  2          teaspoons  fermented black beans (dow see)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  dark soy sauce
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  5        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2           cup  chicken broth

For the Marinade:  Place the beef slices on a plate.  Combine all the ingredients for the marinade in small bowl.  Drizzle marinade over beef.  Set aside 15 minutes. 

Assemble the vegetables together on a plate. 

For the Black Bean Sauce:  Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in wok until beginning to smoke.  Stir-fry the bell pepper and the onion slices for 1 minute.  Remove to a plate.  Wipe the wok dry with a paper towel. 

Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons oil in wok until just smoking.  Add the beef slices and stir-fry over maximum heat for 1 to 2 minutes, until the meat changes color.  Push the beef to the side of the wok, reduce the heat, and add the scallions and the black bean mixture.  Stir quickly for 30 seconds.  Pull the meat slices back to the center of the wok to coat with the black bean sauce.  Do not cook the black beans too long. 

Return the vegetables to the wok and "marry" with the beef slices.  Dissolve the cornstarch in the chicken broth.  Add the mixture and stir for 1 minute before serving. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  The black soy bean has a heritage that pre-dates Western civilization.  The native soy bean plant was discovered by the Chinese over 2,000 years ago.  Its amazing nutritional value and versatility (it produces various beans) were appreciated even in the simplest of rural households.  Still today, a common feature of the peasant kitchen is an earthenware crock containing salt-fermented black soy beans.  This dish has developed a remarkable following in the Western world, proving that the combination has universal appeal.

                             Beef And Walnuts

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Chinese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  beef sirloin (fillet steaks) -- cut 3/4" dice
                        === FOR BEEF SEASONING ===
  2          teaspoons  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
                        (available at Chinese stores)
  2          teaspoons  light soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  cold water
  4             ounces  walnuts
  2               cups  groundnut/peanut oil -- for deep-frying
  1             medium  carrot
  4        thin slices  fresh ginger
  2                     scallion stalks -- cut 1 1/4" lengths
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch
  1               dash  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  Family Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)

Combine the beef and beef seasoning ingredients.  Set aside for 10 minutes. 

Cook the walnuts in boiling water for about 6 minutes; drain.  Spread the walnuts out to dry. 

Pour the groundnut oil into a preheated wok and heat until it is just smoking.  Turn the heat to low, add the walnuts, and stir slowly.  Continue frying the walnuts over low heat until golden brown and crisp.  Remove, drain and place on paper towels.  Leave the oil in the wok. 

Cut grooves along the carrot's length at about 1/2-inch intervals.  Cut the carrot crosswise into 1/4-inch slices. 

Heat the oil in the wok until moderately hot.  Deep-fry the beef for 1 minute.  Remove with a slopped spoon and set aside.  Pour off the oil, leaving 1 tablespoon of oil behind.  SautÈ the carrot flowers, ginger and the scallions.  Add the walnuts and toss all together for 1 minute.  Return the beef to the wok to "marry" with the other ingredients.  Stir in the seasonings over high heat. 

Serve with steamed rice. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  The Song dynasty, especially the era of the southern Song (AD 1126-1279), is known as China's Golden Age.  With increased wealth from overseas trade, suddenly during this time there was a new, middle-class elite who began to be interested and indulge in good food in a way seen before only amongst the wealthy. 

This new middle class in the South created and developed their own culinary style distinct from the imperial legacy and adopted a more hybrid style utilizing the natural resources around them.  The result was a simpler, better-balanced style of cooking that has continued to this day.  Beef was still not greatly used, but specific cuts were used in simple dishes like the one above. 

From his travels in China, Marco Polo records nuts of every description: pine nuts, almonds, chestnuts, fox nuts and walnuts (which were introduced from Persia [Iran] in the early medieval centuries). 

Beef and walnuts is a dish that reflects the flowering of a cuisine that still holds a strong place in the culinary repertoire of the southerners.

                       Beef Consomme With Cilantro

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Chinese
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  clear Supreme Chicken Broth -- (see recipe),
                        strained
  1                cup  sake (Japanese rice wine)
  1              pound  prime-quality beef filet (eye fillet) -- trimmed of excess
                        fat and sinews
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         bunch  cilantro including stems -- washed well,
                        dried and chopped into 1" lengths

In a stockpot, bring the chicken broth to a boil.  Add the sake and simmer gently while you slice the beef. 

Slice the filet in half lengthwise and lay the open side down on a cutting board.  Cut evenly on the diagonal into slices 1/4-inch thick. 

Add the beef to the broth, and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 minute.  Adjust for seasoning, adding salt and pepper, if desired. 

Add the cilantro, stir gently once or twice to combine and serve. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  The simple, yet precise nature of this soup places it firmly in the sophisticated and cosmopolitan city of Guangzhou (Canton), the gateway to foreign trade from as early as the mid-eighteenth century. 

The use of beef filet (eye fillet), Japanese sake and cilantro (fresh coriander) indicates the new direction of contemporary Chinese cooking with cross-culinary influences from Vietnam and Thailand.  The blending of ingredients from other cuisines requires sensitive handling and understanding.

                        === FOR THE STIR-FRY ===
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- sliced

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  water
  8                     dried shiitake mushrooms
  6               cups  chicken broth
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (1" long) -- peeled, sliced
                        into thin rounds, then sliced thin strips
  2                     scallions, white and green parts -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              pound  bok choy - (abt 1/2 head) -- sliced 1/2" pieces

Heat the oil in a large skillet or wok.  Stir-fry the bok choy over high heat for 3 minutes, or until crisp-tender.  Season the bok choy with the salt and pepper.  Add the bok choy, mushrooms, and bean curd to the broth, and continue to simmer for 5 minutes. 

Serve the soup in bowls with the remaining ginger sprinkled on top.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (2" long) -- peeled
  1                     snapper - (abt 2 lbs) -- scaled, trimmed,
                        gutted, and gills removed
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4                     scallions, white and green parts -- sliced 1" strips
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water

Slice the ginger into paper thin rounds.  Slice the rounds into narrow strips.  Rinse and dry the fish.  Make 3 slices, 3 inches long on each side in the skin of the fish. 

In a large heavy-bottomed skillet or wok, heat the oil.  Add the ginger, scallions, and red pepper flakes and stir-fry for 1 minute. 

Place the fish in the pan along with the soy sauce and chicken broth.  Bring the broth to a simmer, baste the fish, and cover.  After 8 minutes, slip a large spatula under the fish and turn, baste, and braise it for 5 to 7 minutes more, or until fish is cooked but still moist. 

Carefully transfer the fish with a large spatula to a lipped platter, cover and keep in a warm place.  Combine the dissolved cornstarch with the braising liquid and cook over high heat for 1 minute, just until the sauce starts to thicken.  Pour the sauce over the fish and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings as part of a banquet.

                         Broccoli In Oyster Sauce

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  Chinese broccoli (gai larn)
                        (available at Chinese stores)
  6               cups  boiling water -- mixed with
  1           teaspoon  salt -- and also
  1         tablespoon  groundnut/peanut oil
                        (or 6 cups light chicken broth/stock)
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  chicken broth (stock)
     1/4           cup  oyster sauce (available at Chinese stores)

Trim each stalk of broccoli.  Use only the top 6 inches of each broccoli stalk.  Discard the leaves except for the young leaves at the tips.  Wash the broccoli under cold running water, and pat dry with paper towels. 

Bring the water to a rolling boil.  Add the broccoli and boil over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes. 

Meanwhile, gently simmer together the 1 tablespoon chicken broth and oyster sauce.  Strain the broccoli out of the water, arrange neatly on a serving plate and cut the stalks in halves with a pair of scissors. 

Spoon the oyster sauce over the broccoli greens and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Chinese broccoli, or kale, does not resemble Italian broccoli, which is a member of the cabbage and cauliflower family.  It is, instead, a stem vegetable with small white flowers and dark green leaves.  The stems are slender and juicy, while the leaves have a slightly bitter taste.  This vegetable was cultivated originally in China's southern states, particularly Guangzhou (Canton), but is now grown in most parts of China.

                         Cantonese Barbecued Pork

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  light soy sauce
     1/4           cup  dark soy sauce
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  Scotch whisky or dry sherry
  3        tablespoons  hoisin sauce
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated peeled fresh ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  five-spice powder -- (optional)
  4             pounds  boneless country-style pork spareribs,
                        pork butt, loin, or tenderloin
                        === HONEY GLAZE ===
  3        tablespoons  honey
  2          teaspoons  light soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil

In a small saucepan, combine the light and dark soy sauces, honey, sugar, salt, whisky or sherry, hoisin sauce, ginger, and the five-spice powder, if using.  Heat, stirring, until the sugar dissolves.  Remove from the heat and let cool. 

Cut the pork into strips about 2 inches wide, 7 inches long and 1 1/2 inches thick.  Place in a lock-top plastic bag, add the marinade and seal closed.  Massage to coat the meat fully with the marinade.  Refrigerate overnight or for up to 3 days.  Bring to room temperature before roasting. 

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. 

Pour boiling water into a roasting pan to a depth of 1/2 inch.  Rest a cooling rack slightly larger than the pan on top of it.  Drain the pork and set the strips across the rack.  Roast for 15 minutes.  Turn the strips over and roast until browned and firm to the touch, about 15 minutes longer. 

Meanwhile, make the honey glaze:  In a small bowl, mix together the honey, soy sauce and sesame oil, stirring well.  Brush the strips with the glaze and roast until the edges begin to char, about 1 minute longer.  Remove from the oven, cover and let rest for 15 minutes, then cut the strips across the grain into thin slices.  Serve warm or cold. 

This recipe yields about 3 pounds. 

Comments:  Barbecued pork is frequently added to noodles, soups, and main dishes.  It also makes a delicious snack or appetizer when dipped in Chinese mustard and toasted sesame seeds.  Plan several days in advance to allow time for marinating.  Make a big batch, as it freezes well for up to 2 months.

                   Cantonese Barbecued Pork Tenderloin

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  pork tenderloin or fillet -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1 1/2"-thick fillets
     1/4           cup  Chinese maltose -- plus
  1         tablespoon  Chinese maltose
                        (available at Chinese stores)
     1/4           cup  hot water -- (or enough to make
                        a thick syrup with the maltose)
                        === FOR THE BEEF MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  3        tablespoons  light soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  Chu Hou sauce (soy bean paste)
                        (available at Chinese stores)
                        Tiny pinch of red food coloring

Mix the marinade ingredients together, add the pork fillets, and marinate for about 40 minutes. 

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees for 10 minutes. 

Place the fillets on a rack in a roasting pan and place the pan in the center of the oven.  Roast for 15 minutes. 

Turn the fillets and roast for a further 15 minutes.  Remove the meat from the oven and set aside for 10 minutes to allow the meat to rest. 

Simmer the Chinese maltose with the hot water until the maltose dissolves.  Pour the mixture over the pork.  Cut into slices just before serving. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  The techniques of roasting and broiling (grilling) meats were established early in China's history, as far back as the Shang dynasty (1523-1027 BC).  In fact, the Chinese have been known to cook their food since 40,000 BC, or around the time that fire is thought to have been discovered.  The earliest roasting was done by heating slabs of stone and then roasting the raw food upon them, though most people know the famous essay by Charles Lamb on how the delights of roast pig were discovered in the dawn of Chinese culinary history when a farmer's house (sheltering his pigs) was burned down. 

This recipe is a perennial Cantonese favorite and is done, it is always welcome as part of a family or special dinner.

                        warm water, then cut into 6" lengths
                        === FOR THE SOUP ===
  3             quarts  chicken stock
  4             slices  fresh ginger
  2                     scallions -- cut 1 1/2" lengths
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GINGER SOY DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  light soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
                        Few drops of sesame oil
                        === CHINESE MUSTARD DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  light soy sauce
  2             ounces  English or French mustard
  2          teaspoons  peanut oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2              drops  vinegar - (to 3 drops)
                        === HOISIN SAUCE DIPPING SAUCE ===
  1           teaspoon  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  tomato ketchup
     1/4      teaspoon  vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  soy sauce
                        === PEANUT DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  smooth peanut butter
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  tomato sauce

* Note:  Such as Chinese cabbage, Tianjin cabbage (wong buk), hearts of cabbage (choi sum), spinach or lettuce, washed, tough parts of stalk removed, and cut into 4-inch lengths. 

Combine the ingredients for each of the dipping sauces in individual bowls. 

Place the steamboat with the soup in the middle of the table -- preferably a round one, as all diners must be able to reach the pot in order to cook their own food. 

Arrange plates of the various, uncooked foods around the pot, and place the different sauces at strategic points on the table. 

The diners select their food and cook it by placing it into the boiling soup, for just a few seconds, and then scooping it out with a miniature wire basket or chopsticks.  The food is then dipped in a sauce. 

The soup should be maintained at a rolling boil throughout the meal.  It is also best to cook the meat before the vegetables as it needs longer cooking and also imparts a flavor to the soup while it cooks. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 

Comments:  The Chinese Steamboat owes its beginning to the Mongols of northern China, more than 400 years ago.  These nomadic peoples did not bequeath a great culinary heritage to Chinese cuisine, but the Mongolian hot-pot is a most important legacy.  By the eighteenth century it had become a winter favorite in the Qing dynasty court and still remains and flourishes in all China's regions today. 

It began as a simple way of cooking meats and vegetables.  The thinly sliced meat is dropped with some leafy vegetables into a bubbling chicken soup contained in a specially designed pot (called a steamboat by the Cantonese, and a hot-pot or a fire kettle in other regions of China).  It is placed in the middle of the table for finishing and serving.  After a minute or two, the food is cooked and is lifted out and eaten with a variety of dipping sauces.  When all the meat and vegetables are finished, cellophane noodles are added to the broth, resulting in a wonderful fragrant and flavorsome soup. 

The Cantonese, ever quick to appreciate culinary worth, have adapted the Mongolian hot-pot.  Here is their version.

                         Cellophane Noodle Salad

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Salads/Dressings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  cellophane noodles (fun si)
                        (available at Chinese stores)
                        === FOR DRESSING ===
  1         tablespoon  pickle juice from Chinese pickles
                        (available in jars at Chinese stores)
  3        tablespoons  white vinegar
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  carrot julienne
  3        tablespoons  julienne-cut Chinese pickles
                        (available in jars at Chinese stores)
     3/4           cup  cucumber julienne -- seeds removed,
                        keep some skin on

Soak the noodles in warm water for 20 minutes.  Drain and cut into 4-inch lengths. 

Combine all of the dressing ingredients in a small saucepan and simmer for 3 minutes.  Set aside to cool. 

Mix together the noodles, carrots, pickles, and cucumber in a small salad bowl.  Pour on the dressing and toss to combine.  Chill and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Cellophane noodles (also called bean threads) are fine, translucent threads made from the starch of green mung bean and tapioca starch.  When soaked they become shiny and slippery and are enjoyed because they absorb the flavors of other foods.  Cellophane noodles are traditional throughout Asia, and are used extensively in salads and soups in Japan as well as throughout all regions of China.  This cold dish is considered an appetizer or side-dish to a meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7             pounds  chicken wings and thighs
  6                     celery stalks with leaves -- cut up
  4                     carrots -- cut up
  2              large  onions -- cut up
  4                     parsley sprigs
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme, sage, or basil -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper
  4                     bay leaves
  12              cups  cold water

Combine all the ingredients in a very large stock pot.  Bring to boiling; reduce heat.  Cover and simmer for 2 hours.  Remove chicken pieces. 

Pour broth through a large sieve or colander lined with 2 layers of cheesecloth.  Discard vegetables and seasonings.  If using the broth while hot, skim fat.  (Or chill the broth and lift off fat.) 

If desired, when bones are cool enough to handle, remove meat from bones and reserve meat for another use.  Discard bones.  Store broth and reserved meat, if any, in separate covered containers, and refrigerate. 

Do-Ahead Tip:  Broth can be made and refrigerated up to 3 days ahead, or frozen for up to 6 months. 

This recipe yields about 10 cups broth and 5 cups meat. 

Comments:  One of the advantages of cutting up a whole chicken yourself is putting the leftover bony pieces to use in homemade chicken broth.  Or purchase backs, necks, and wings from your supermarket.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  rice wine or chicken broth
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  12            ounces  boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- cut into thin
                        bite-sized strips
  1                cup  Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  6             ounces  dried Chinese egg noodles
                        or regular fine egg noodles
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  cooking oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  grated gingerroot
     1/2           cup  thinly bias-sliced carrot
     1/2           cup  thinly bias-sliced celery
  1                cup  red and/or green sweet pepper in 1"
                        by 1" by 1/4" slices
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  1                cup  sliced fresh mushrooms
     1/3           cup  coarsely-chopped almonds

In a medium mixing bowl stir together soy sauce, rice wine or broth, and 2 teaspoons cornstarch.  Stir in chicken and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Do not drain. 

Meanwhile, in a small bowl stir together chicken broth and 1 tablespoon cornstarch.  Set aside. 

Cook egg noodles according to package directions; drain and return noodles to pan.  Stir in sesame oil.  Keep warm. 

Pour cooking oil into a wok or large skillet.  (Add more oil as necessary during cooking.)  Preheat over medium-high heat.  Stir-fry garlic and gingerroot in hot oil for 15 seconds.  Add carrot; stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add celery and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add sweet pepper and onion; stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add mushrooms; stir-fry for 1 minute more, or until vegetables are crisp-tender.  Remove all vegetables from wok. 

Add almonds to hot wok; stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until toasted.  Remove from wok.  Add undrained chicken to hot wok; stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until tender and no pink remains. 

Push chicken from center of wok.  Stir chicken broth-cornstarch mixture; add to center of wok.  Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly.  Return vegetables and almonds to wok.  Stir all ingredients together to coat with sauce.  Cook and stir about 1 minute more, or until heated through.  Serve over noodles. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This chicken dish is loaded with traditional Cantonese ingredients such as rice wine, sesame oil, and ginger.  It is just as tasty served over rice instead of the egg noodles.

  6               cups  vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  6 1/2         ounces  fresh thin egg noodles
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1         tablespoon  grated peeled fresh ginger

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  vegetable oil
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken breast -- cut into 1/2" dice
  3              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3               cups  cold cooked white rice
     1/2           cup  frozen peas -- defrosted

Add the chicken, the remaining salt, and the pepper, and stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Add the soy sauce and lettuce and stir-fry for another minute, or until all the ingredients are hot.  Transfer the rice to a platter and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === POTSTICKER WRAPPERS ===
  2               cups  all-purpose (plain) flour -- plus extra
                        as needed
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  boiling water
                        === FILLING ===
  2               cups  finely-chopped napa cabbage
     1/4           cup  chopped blanched spinach
  1              pound  ground (minced) dark chicken meat
     1/2      teaspoon  grated peeled fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped garlic chives
                        or green (spring) onion
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch (cornflour)
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
  6        tablespoons  distilled white vinegar
  3        tablespoons  light soy sauce
                        Chili oil -- as needed
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

To make the wrappers, in a food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine the 2 cups flour and salt and pulse once to mix.  With the motor running, slowly pour in the boiling water.  Continue to process until a rough ball forms and the dough pulls away from the sides of the work bowl, 15 to 20 seconds.  Transfer to a lightly floured work surface.  Knead until smooth and no longer sticky, about 2 minutes.  Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for 30 minutes. 

Meanwhile, make the filling:  Place the cabbage and spinach in a kitchen towel, wring out the excess liquid and place in a bowl.  Add all the remaining filling ingredients and stir until combined.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. 

Uncover the dough and knead briefly.  Cut in half.  Roll out one half about 1/8-inch thick.  Using a round cookie cutter 3 1/2 inches in diameter, cut out rounds.  Set the rounds aside, lightly covered with the kitchen towel.  Repeat with the remaining dough and all scraps. 

To make the sauce, stir together the vinegar and soy sauce.  Add chili oil to taste.  Set aside. 

To make the potstickers, put 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle of a dough round.  Fold the round in half and pinch the edges together at one end of the arc.  Starting from that point, make 6 pleats or tucks along the curved edge to enclose the filling.  As each potsticker is made, place seam-side up on a baking sheet, pressing down gently so it will sit flat.  Cover with the kitchen towel and continue forming and placing the potstickers on the baking sheet until all are made. 

Heat a 9-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat.  When hot, add about 2 teaspoons vegetable oil.  Arrange 8 to 10 potstickers, seam-side up and just touching, in a spiral in the pan.  Fry until the bottoms are browned, about 1 minute.  Add water to come halfway up the sides of the potstickers and bring to a boil.  Immediately cover, reduce the heat to low and steam-cook for 8 minutes, adding more water if necessary to keep the pan wet. 

Uncover, increase the heat to high and cook until the liquid is absorbed and the bottoms are crispy, about 30 seconds longer.  Transfer to a serving plate and keep warm; fry the remaining potstickers. 

Divide the dipping sauce among individual saucers.  Serve the potstickers hot with the sauce. 

This recipe yields about 24 dumplings; serves 4 to 6. 

Comments:  Traditionally made with pork, Chinese potstickers work equally well with chicken.  In a pinch, wonton skins may be used for the homemade wrappers; reduce the cooking time to 3 minutes.

                              Chicken Stock

Recipe By     :George Mahaffey, "Country Inn: The Best of Casual Country Co
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Chinese
                Poultry                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         quarts  water
  1              pound  chicken bones or carcass of
                        a roasted 3 1/2-lb chicken
  1                     yellow onion -- cut up
  1                     celery stalk -- cut up
  1                     carrot -- peeled, cut up
  2                     fresh flat-leaf (Italian) parsley sprigs
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  peppercorns
  1                     bay leaf

In a stock pot over medium-high heat, combine the water and chicken and bring slowly to a boil.  Skim off any scum that rises to the surface.  Add the onion, celery, carrot, parsley, salt, thyme, peppercorns and bay leaf.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, for 2 hours.  Check from time to time and skim off scum that appears on the surface. 

Remove from the heat and let cool for 15 minutes.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl and use immediately.  Or let cool, cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 1 month before use.  Before using, remove and discard any fat congealed on top. 

This recipe yields about 6 cups (48 fl oz). 

Comments:  This kitchen staple can be prepared ahead and frozen for up to a month.  Homemade stock is a wonderful use of either inexpensive chicken bones or the carcass and remains from a roasted chicken.  By making it yourself, you can flavor it to your own taste.  If you need to substitute canned broth or stock, look for low-sodium versions and add your favorite spices and herbs.

            Chicken, Shrimp And Bok Choy Over Panfried Noodles

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Salt -- as needed
  1              pound  fresh thin Chinese egg noodles
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil -- or as needed
                        === SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  oyster sauce
                        === TOPPING ===
  1              whole  chicken breast -- boned and skinned
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil -- or as needed
  1           teaspoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  6                     green (spring) onions -- cut into 2" lengths
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4         pound  large shrimp (prawns) -- peeled, deveined
  1              small  red bell pepper -- cut 1 1/2" cubes
     1/4         pound  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed and sliced
     3/4         pound  baby bok choy -- cut into 2" lengths
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil

Bring a large pot three-fourths full with water to a boil and salt it lightly.  Gently pull the noodles apart, then drop them into the boiling water, stirring to separate the strands.  Bring to a second boil and cook for 1 minute.  Pour the noodles into a colander and rinse thoroughly with cold running water.  Drain well and toss with 1 tablespoon of oil to keep the strands from sticking together. 

Preheat an oven to 200 degrees. 

Preheat an 8- or 9-inch frying pan over medium-high heat.  When the pan is hot, add 1/2 tablespoon of the oil.  When the oil is hot, spread one-fourth of the noodles evenly over the bottom of the pan, spreading them with a wide spatula to form a pancake.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the bottom is golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.  Using the spatula, turn the noodle pancake over and brown the other side, about 3 minutes longer; add more oil if needed to prevent scorching.  Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm while you fry the remaining noodles.  Repeat to make a total of 4 noodle cakes. 

To make the sauce, in a bowl, combine the cornstarch, chicken stock, sugar, white pepper, soy sauce and oyster sauce.  Stir until smooth and set aside. 

To make the topping, cut the chicken into 1/2-inch cubes; set aside.  Place a wok over medium-high heat.  When the pan is hot, add the 1 tablespoon peanut oil, ginger, garlic, green onions and salt.  SautÈ until fragrant, about 15 seconds.  Increase the heat to high and add the chicken and shrimp.  Stir-fry until the chicken is white and the shrimp are pink, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl; set aside. 

Preheat the wok again over medium-high heat.  When the pan is hot, add the bell pepper, mushrooms and bok choy and stir-fry until the mushrooms begin to shrink, about 3 minutes, adding more peanut oil if needed to prevent sticking.  Stir the sauce and add to the pan.  Bring to a boil, stirring continuously until the sauce is glossy and thick, about 30 seconds.  Return the chicken-shrimp mixture to the wok, add the sesame oil and toss together quickly to mix. 

Divide the noodle cakes among 4 serving plates.  Evenly distribute the topping over each cake and serve hot. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  There is nothing more enticing than the sizzling sound and the seductive fragrance of noodles panfrying in a wok.  At hawker centers, coffee shops and noodle houses throughout Asia, noodles with multiple combinations of meats and vegetables are made to order within moments.

Pour the noodles into a colander and rinse thoroughly with cold running water.  Drain well and toss with 1 tablespoon of oil to keep the strands from sticking together. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Preheat an oven to 200 degrees. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Preheat an 8- or 9-inch frying pan over medium-high heat.  When the pan is hot, add 1/2 tablespoon of the oil.  When the oil is hot, spread one-fourth of the noodles evenly over the bottom of the pan, spreading them with a wide spatula to form a pancake.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the bottom is golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.  Using the spatula, turn the noodle pancake over and brown the other side, about 3 minutes longer; add more oil if needed to prevent scorching.  Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm while you fry the remaining noodles.  Repeat to make a total of 4 noodle cakes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To make the sauce, in a bowl, combine the cornstarch, chicken stock, sugar, white pepper, soy sauce and oyster sauce.  Stir until smooth and set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To make the topping, cut the chicken into 1/2-inch cubes; set aside.  Place a wok over medium-high heat.  When the pan is hot, add the 1 tablespoon peanut oil, ginger, garlic, green onions and salt.  SautÈ until fragrant, about 15 seconds.  Increase the heat to high and add the chicken and shrimp.  Stir-fry until the chicken is white and the shrimp are pink, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl; set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Preheat the wok again over medium-high heat.  When the pan is hot, add the bell pepper, mushrooms and bok choy and stir-fry until the mushrooms begin to shrink, about 3 minutes, adding more peanut oil if needed to prevent sticking.  Stir the sauce and add to the pan.  Bring to a boil, stirring continuously until the sauce is glossy and thick, about 30 seconds.  Return the chicken-shrimp mixture to the wok, add the sesame oil and toss together quickly to mix. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Divide the noodle cakes among 4 serving plates.  Evenly distribute the topping over each cake and serve hot. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  There is nothing more enticing than the sizzling sound and the seductive fragrance of noodles panfrying in a wok.  At hawker centers, coffee shops and noodle houses throughout Asia, noodles with multiple combinations of meats and vegetables are made to order within moments.

                      Chili Chicken With Orange Peel

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Chinese
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN MARINADE ===
  2          teaspoons  light soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
                        (available at Chinese stores)
                        Good pinch of salt
                        Good pinch of freshly-ground white pepper
                        Good pinch of roasted Sichuan peppercorns
                        (fagara, available at Chinese stores)
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  cold water -- for thickening
  1              pound  skinless boneless chicken breasts -- cut 2" finger
                        lengths
     1/2      teaspoon  chili oil
  3        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
  1           teaspoon  shredded fresh ginger
  4                     scallions (spring onions), white parts -- cut crosswise
                        into 2" lengths, green parts sliced
                        diagonally into 2" lengths
  1                     dried red chili -- seeded and chopped
  2        tablespoons  fresh orange zest (rind) julienne
  1         tablespoon  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
                        === SAUCE ==
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  chicken broth (stock)
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce

Combine all of the marinade ingredients and add the chicken pieces.  Work in well with the fingers.  Allow to stand for 30 minutes.  Sprinkle in the chili oil. 

Heat the groundnut oil in a preheated wok until the oil begins to smoke.  Add the ginger, the white parts of the scallions and the dried chili and sautÈ briefly for 7 to 8 seconds.  Add the chicken and stir-fry over maximum heat until the color changes from pink to white (1 to 2 minutes.)  Toss in the orange zest and mix.  Sprinkle on the rice wine.  Reduce the heat to low and gently stir-fry for another 2 to 3 minutes. 

Mix the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.  Make a space in the center of the wok and slowly pour in the sauce.  Stir constantly until the sauce boils.  Combine all the ingredients thoroughly, and add the green parts of the scallions just before serving. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  This is one of the gentler dishes to come from the great western province of Sichuan (Szechwan).  The recipe uses a typical Sichuanese blend of aromatics (the Sichuan/Szechwan wild pepper, chilis, ginger, scallions/spring onions and sugar), with the surprise addition of orange zest (rind). 

I suspect this last innovation has been "borrowed" from the South, where the idea of using fresh fruits with meats is popular, many classic Cantonese dishes calling for dried fruits and peel, particularly mandarine (tangerine ) peel.

            Chinese Chicken Salad With Peanut-Sesame Dressing

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Chinese
                Poultry                         Salads/Dressings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        large whole  chicken breasts
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2         pound  fresh Chinese egg noodles
  1 1/2      teaspoons  peanut oil
  3        tablespoons  white or black sesame seeds
     1/4           cup  finely-julienned red bell pepper
  1                cup  finely-julienned peeled carrot
     1/2           cup  fresh cilantro (fresh coriander) leaves
  1              small  cucumber -- cut 2" julienne
                        strips
                        === PEANUT-SESAME DRESSING ===
  2          teaspoons  peanut butter
  2          teaspoons  Asian sesame paste
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/3           cup  dark soy sauce
     1/3           cup  Chinese red vinegar or balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  peanut or corn oil
  1         tablespoon  Asian sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  chili oil -- or to taste
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
     1/4           cup  chopped green (spring) onion
     1/4           cup  chopped dry-roasted peanuts

Fill a large saucepan three-fourths full with water and bring to a boil.  Add the chicken breasts and return to a boil, skimming off any scum that forms on the surface, then immediately reduce the heat to low.  Simmer, uncovered, until tender, 20 to 25 minutes.  Drain and let cool. 

Remove the skin from the chicken breasts, bone the breasts and hand shred the meat with the grain into strips about 1/2 inch thick and 2 inches long. 

Refill the large saucepan three-fourths full with water.  Bring to a boil over high heat and add the salt.  Gently pull the strands of noodles apart, then drop them into the boiling water, stirring to separate the strands.  When the water comes to a second boil, boil for 1 minute longer.  Pour the noodles into a colander and rinse thoroughly with cold running water.  Drain thoroughly and transfer to a large bowl.  Toss with the peanut oil to keep the noodles from sticking together.  Set aside. 

If using white sesame seeds, toast them in a small, dry frying pan over medium heat until golden and fragrant, about 3 minutes.  If using black sesame seeds, leave them untoasted. 

In a large bowl, toss together the chicken, bell pepper, carrot, cilantro and toasted or raw sesame seeds.  Arrange the cooked noodles in a wide shallow bowl.  Scatter the cucumber over the noodles and top with the chicken mixture.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. 

To make the dressing, in a small bowl, stir together the peanut butter, sesame paste, sugar, soy sauce and vinegar.  In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the peanut or corn oil, sesame oil and chili oil.  When hot, add the garlic, ginger and green onion; sautÈ gently until fragrant but not browned, about 15 seconds.  Stir in the peanut butter-sesame paste mixture and cook until the mixture begins to form a light syrup, about 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and let cool to lukewarm. 

Pour the warm dressing over the chicken salad and sprinkle with the peanuts.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Cold shredded chicken in a peanut-sesame dressing is a common component of the exquisitely arranged cold appetizer platters served at Chinese banquets.  This salad is as popular among Westerners as it is with the Chinese, and many variations of it are offered in casual dining spots throughout the West.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a large bowl, toss together the chicken, bell pepper, carrot, cilantro and toasted or raw sesame seeds.  Arrange the cooked noodles in a wide shallow bowl.  Scatter the cucumber over the noodles and top with the chicken mixture.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To make the dressing, in a small bowl, stir together the peanut butter, sesame paste, sugar, soy sauce and vinegar.  In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the peanut or corn oil, sesame oil and chili oil.  When hot, add the garlic, ginger and green onion; sautÈ gently until fragrant but not browned, about 15 seconds.  Stir in the peanut butter-sesame paste mixture and cook until the mixture begins to form a light syrup, about 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and let cool to lukewarm. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Pour the warm dressing over the chicken salad and sprinkle with the peanuts.  Serve immediately. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 6 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Cold shredded chicken in a peanut-sesame dressing is a common component of the exquisitely arranged cold appetizer platters served at Chinese banquets.  This salad is as popular among Westerners as it is with the Chinese, and many variations of it are offered in casual dining spots throughout the West.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  chopped water chestnuts
  4                     scallions, white and green parts -- thinly sliced

  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil

Whisk the eggs in a medium bowl with the salt and pepper.  Mix the water chestnuts, scallions, and sesame oil into the eggs. 

Heat the vegetable oil in an 8- to 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.  Pour the egg mixture into the pan.  Let the eggs begin to set, then gently stir the middle of the omelet a couple of times with a fork and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.  Cover the omelet and cook over medium-low heat for 2 minutes more, or until the eggs are almost set. 

When the omelet is almost set, carefully flip it over onto a flat plate larger than the pan, then slip the omelet back into the pan to cook the other side for another minute. 

Invert the omelet from the pan to a plate, slice it into wedges, and serve immediately.

                          Chinese Rice Porridge

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Rice/Grains


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RICE PORRIDGE ===
     1/2           cup  long-grain white rice
                        (or equal amounts of long-grain
                        and glutinous rice)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
  4               cups  water
  4               cups  chicken stock
                        === FISH TOPPING ===
     1/4         pound  good-quality tuna, striped bass,
                        or sea bass
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-slivered peeled fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  light soy sauce
                        Big pinch freshly-ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped green (spring) onion
  2        tablespoons  coarse-chopped fresh cilantro (coriander)

To make the porridge, rinse the rice with cold water until the rinse water runs clear.  Drain.  Put the rice in a large saucepan and stir in the salt and oil.  Add the water and chicken stock.  Bring to a boil over high heat and stir the rice to loosen the grains from the bottom of the pan.  Set the cover ajar and boil gently for 5 minutes.  Cover, reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the rice is soft and is the consistency of porridge, about 1 1/2 hours.  Keep warm. 

To prepare the fish topping, wrap the fish in plastic wrap and place in the freezer to freeze partially, about 1 hour.  Cut the fish into thin slivers and arrange on a serving plate.  In a bowl, mix together the ginger, soy sauce, pepper and sesame oil; pour over the fish.  Sprinkle the green onion and cilantro over the top. 

To serve, ladle the hot porridge into warmed soup bowls.  To eat, pick up a few slices of fish, onions and cilantro and set them on top of each serving of porridge.  Serve hot. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 

Comments:  For many families in Asia, a typical day begins with a bowl of jook, or rice porridge.  Oftentimes, vendors with pots suspended from the ends of bamboo poles haul the hot meal right to the front door.  Although rice porridge comes from humble beginnings, today it is served with a variety of exotic toppings, ranging from sliced raw fish (as here) to thousand-year eggs, or bite-size balls of ground fish or meat.

                       Crispy Green Onion Pancakes

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose (plain) flour -- plus extra
                        as needed
  1                cup  boiling water
     1/4           cup  cold water
  4          teaspoons  Asian sesame oil - (about)
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt -- or more to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped green (spring) onion
     1/4           cup  peanut oil -- or as needed

In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, place the 3 cups flour.  With the processor motor running, pour the boiling water through the feed tube in a slow, steady stream.  When the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the work bowl in 5 to 10 seconds, add the cold water.  Continue to process until the dough comes together in a rough ball, about 15 seconds.  If the dough is sticky, add a little more flour and continue processing for 30 seconds longer. 

Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface.  Knead until smooth, soft, elastic and no longer sticky, 1 to 2 minutes, dusting lightly with flour if needed to reduce stickiness.  Gather the dough into a ball, place in a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat lightly on all sides.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. 

Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead only until smooth and no longer sticky, 1 to 2 minutes.  Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces.  Roll out 1 piece into a 10- to 12-inch round about 1/8-inch thick.  Evenly brush the top with a thin film of about 1 teaspoon sesame oil.  Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of the coarse salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the green onion evenly over the round.  Starting from one side, roll up tightly and pinch the ends to seal in the onions.  Anchor one end and wind the long roll around it into a flat spiral coil.  Tuck the end under and press the coil to flatten slightly.  Roll out the coil into a pancake 7 to 8 inches in diameter and about 1/4-inch thick.  Cover with a kitchen towel.  Repeat with the remaining dough. 

To fry the pancakes, heat a 9-inch frying pan over medium heat.  When hot, add enough of the peanut oil to coat the bottom with a 1/8-inch layer.  When the oil is medium-hot, add 1 pancake, cover and fry, shaking the pan occasionally, until the bottom is golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes.  Using a wide spatula, turn the pancake over; if the pan is dry, add a little more oil.  Re-cover and continue to fry, shaking the pan occasionally, until the second side is golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes longer. 

Remove the cover, slide the pancake onto a cutting board and cut into wedges.  Transfer to a serving dish and serve at once, or keep warm while you fry the remaining pancakes. 

This recipe yields 4 pancakes; serves 4. 

Comments:  These flaky flat breads can be found in street stalls throughout northern China and in Taiwan.  Although the bread requires patience and labor, it is such a delectable treat that it is well worth the effort.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Remove the cover, slide the pancake onto a cutting board and cut into wedges.  Transfer to a serving dish and serve at once, or keep warm while you fry the remaining pancakes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 pancakes; serves 4. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  These flaky flat breads can be found in street stalls throughout northern China and in Taiwan.  Although the bread requires patience and labor, it is such a delectable treat that it is well worth the effort.

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Chinese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         ounces  Chinese dried mushrooms -- soaked in warm
                        water for 30 minutes, rinsed, stems
                        discarded and caps shredded
  1              small  carrot -- cut fine julienne
  1              small  celery stalk -- cut fine julienne
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  celery salt
                        Good pinch of freshly-ground white pepper
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  cold water -- for thickening
     1/4           cup  groundnut/peanut oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  bean sprouts
  2             sheets  tofu skin (fu pei)
                        (Malaysian brand, available at
                        Chinese stores)
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  cold water -- to make a paste
                        for sealing the edges of the tofu skins
                        Worcestershire sauce -- for serving
                        Parsley sprigs -- for garnish

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil.  Blanch the mushrooms, carrots, and celery for 1 minute.  Drain and set aside. 

Mix all of the seasonings ingredients together in a bowl.  Set aside. 

Heat 1 tablespoon of the groundnut oil in a wok until moderately hot.  Stir-fry the onion slices for 20 seconds.  Add the bean sprouts and the blanched ingredients and stir-fry for 1 minute. 

Pour the seasonings mixture slowly into the center of the wok, stirring until the mixture thickens.  Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool. 

Meanwhile, spread out the tofu skins on a work surface.  Cut each skin into 4 rectangles.  Dampen the skins with a little water and cover with a damp cloth. 

Evenly divide the vegetable mixture into 8 portions.  Spoon 1 portion of the vegetable mixture onto each tofu rectangle, fold a corner over to firmly encase the filling and tuck the corner underneath.  Fold in both ends of the wrapping skin, as if wrapping a parcel, and roll up to resemble a filled pancake.  Spread a little of the cornstarch paste on the edges and press firmly.  Repeat with the remaining wrapper skins. 

Heat the groundnut oil in a flat skillet (frying pan) until moderately hot.  Reduce the heat a little and pan-fry each tofu roll on each side until crispy and golden brown. 

Diagonally slice each roll into 1-inch pieces.  Serve with Worcestershire sauce.  Garnish with sprigs of parsley. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  The soy bean has sometimes been called "poor man's cow" in China as, like all beans, it is rich in protein, complex carbohydrates and valuable minerals. 

The remarkable bean has an enormously wide range of by-products, ranging from soy sauces through to dried bean curd, which is available in sheets, sticks or twists. 

This recipe uses dried bean curd sheets as a wrapping for an interesting vegetarian filling, to form an unusual hors d'oeuvre or appetizer.

                             Deep Fried Kale

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  kale or Chinese broccoli (gai larn)
                        (available at Chinese stores)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
                        Groundnut/peanut oil -- for deep-frying

Choose a bunch of broccoli with large good-quality leaves.  Cut off the leaves (discarding any brown, wilted ones) and, with a sharp knife, cut out the center stem from each leaf.  After washing the leaves, dry very thoroughly. 

Stack 4 or 5 leaves on top of each other, roll up firmly and shred very finely with a sharp knife.  Repeat this procedure until all the leaves are shredded.  It is essential to shred perfectly evenly, or you will not achieve the correct degree of crispness. 

Fill a wok one-third full of groundnut oil, and heat the oil to moderately hot.  There should be a faint haze coming from the oil and the oil should shimmer.  Add a handful of the shredded kale leaves and stir gently as they deep-fry; cooking time will be only 20 to 30 seconds.  Remove with a strainer as soon as the leaves are bright green.  Repeat until all the leaves are cooked. 

Drain off the groundnut oil, leaving a film of oil behind.  Reheat the wok for a few seconds.  Return the kale leaves and toss quickly in the hot dry wok.  Sprinkle in the salt and sugar, and continue to toss the crisp leaves until thoroughly mixed.  Remove to a plate and serve.  (The leaves should crumble in the palm of the hand.) 

Optional:  Soak a few dried scallops (available at Chinese stores) in warm water for several hours, then steam for 30 minutes.  Break the scallops into shreds, squeeze dry in a tea towel, then deep-fry over low heat.  Sprinkle through the kale leaves just before serving. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  The Chinese have an amazing knowledge about their plant resources, even though no specific word corresponds to "vegetables," reference in Chinese is made by the word tsai, which simply translates as "greens." 

The green vegetable used in this recipe is known as Chinese kale, gai larn, or Chinese broccoli.  Every part of the kale is edible, even the tiny white flowers, though only the leaves are used to make this stunning accompaniment to a special meat dish.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  string beans -- trimmed
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped scallions (green and white parts)
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  Szechuan chili paste or hot sauce
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or rice wine
  1           teaspoon  sugar

Wash the beans under running water.  Dry the beans well on paper towels. 

In a wok or skillet, heat the oil until just before it smokes.  Add the beans, standing back to avoid being spattered with oil.  Cook the beans over high heat, stirring and turning frequently, until they are wrinkled and lightly browned, about 7 minutes.  Remove the beans with a slotted spoon and place in a colander to drain.  Set aside. 

Discard all but about 2 tablespoons of oil from the skillet.  Over high heat, reheat the remaining oil.  Add the scallions, garlic, and Szechuan paste and stir-fry for 20 seconds.  Add the soy sauce and stir. 

Put the string beans back into the skillet.  Add the wine and sugar and stir until well mixed, about 1 minute.  Remove from the skillet and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  3               cups  peanut oil -- for deep-frying

Make the filling:  Heat the 2 tablespoons groundnut oil in a wok.  Stir-fry the pork, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and bell pepper for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add all of the seasonings and mix well.  Remove to a plate and chill in the refrigerator at least 1 hour before wrapping the pancakes. 

Make the pancakes:  Combine the beaten eggs, salt, and sifted flour and blend.  Add the water, a little at a time, to make a smooth batter.  Heat a 7-inch skillet and add a little oil to thinly coat the bottom.  Carefully pour in enough batter to make a thin pancake.  Cook over low heat until the sides dry a little and shrink from the edges of the pan.  Turn out and repeat until the batter is used up. 

Place about 2 tablespoons of the filling onto each pancake and roll up, closing in the sides.  Seal the edges with the cornstarch paste, and lay the egg roll, sealed edge down, on the plate. 

Heat the 3 cups groundnut oil in a wok.  Deep-fry the egg rolls until golden brown.  Cut diagonally across in 1/2-inch slices for Chinese servings. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  The egg roll is probably another variant of the famous and familiar spring roll -- now a fast food of the Western world.  Then again it could be a dish inspired by the European seafood crepe.  If this is so, that would explain its southern background.  Typically, the Cantonese steam the Egg Roll, imparting an extremely moist and succulent texture to the dish.

                         Eggplant In Spicy Sauce

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  eggplants (aubergines)
  3        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
  8             ounces  ground (minced) pork
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  6              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     scallions (spring onions) -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  hot chili bean paste
                        (available at Chinese stores)
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
     1/2           cup  Family Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
  3        tablespoons  light soy sauce
                        Good pinch of freshly-ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
                        a little cold water

Slice the eggplants in half crosswise and then into thick finger-length pieces. 

Bring a pot of water to a boil.  Add the eggplant and quickly bring back to a boil.  Drain immediately and refresh in cold water.  Take care the eggplant is not mushy.  Place on a plate until ready for use. 

Heat the groundnut oil in a preheated wok and bring to smoking point.  Stir-fry the ground pork until the color changes.  Add the ginger, garlic and the scallions and stir-fry until fragrant.  Add the hot chili bean sauce and mix through.  Add the eggplant and toss quickly over high heat.  Add the seasonings, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and coats the pieces.  Serve hot, with steamed rice. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  The eggplant (aborigine) is called k'un-lun tzu kua by the Chinese, meaning "Malayan purple melon."  The name is evidence that, even though this remarkable vegetable has been documented in China as a common vegetable as far back as the Zhou dynasty (1050 BC-AD 249), it arrived via southeast Asia.  Very possibly it originated in India, traveled to Southeast Asia, then into China. 

Perhaps because of its distinctive beauty, the eggplant was elevated in the thirteenth century as an offering food to the shrine of imperial ancestors.  And the shiny dark skin was used as a cosmetic by society ladies to stain their teeth black. 

From a culinary point of view, however, the unique properties of the eggplant make it an exciting ingredient to marry with spicy sauces such as in this dish.

                           Eight Treasure Rice

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Rice/Grains


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  long-grain white rice
  3               cups  glutinous rice
  2        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
  6                     Chinese dried mushrooms -- soaked 45 minutes in
                        warm water, squeezed dry, stems
                        discarded, caps finely diced
  2                     dried Chinese sausages (lup chiang) -- diced
  1                     chicken thigh -- boned and diced
  1         tablespoon  dried shrimp -- soaked 20 minutes in
                        warm water and drained
     1/2           cup  lotus seeds -- soaked in cold
                        water for 3 to 4 hours, then drained
     1/2           cup  diced onion
     1/2           cup  diced bamboo shoots
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  Five spice powder
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2                     scallions (spring onions) -- chopped

Combine the rices and wash 3 times. 

Heat the groundnut oil in a wok until almost smoking.  Stir-fry the mushrooms, the Chinese sausages, chicken, dried shrimp, lotus seeds, onion, and bamboo shoots for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the soy sauce, 5-spice power, sesame oil, and salt.  Stir-fry to mix well. 

Bring the rice to a rapid boil and continue to cook by the absorption method.  When most of the water has been absorbed, add the stir-fried ingredients, mixing them through the rice.  Simmer, covered, on low heat for 20 minutes.  Turn off the heat, and allow to stand for 10 minutes. 

Stir the rice with chopsticks, adding the chopped scallions.  Remove the rice from the pot and pack into a lightly oiled bowl, pressing in firmly.  (If preparing a day in advance, refrigerate in the bowl until just before needed.)  Steam the rice in the bowl for 10 minutes, and invert to serve. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 

Comments:  This is the celebrated eight-treasure rice eaten at Chinese New Year.  In the early days of the Han dynasty (202 BC-AD 220), rice was considered a delicacy as millet was the staple grain.  Eight-treasure rice depicts the almost spiritual significance of rice to the Chinese people, bringing good fortune and blessings to all at the beginning of a New Year.

                           Family Chicken Broth

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  chicken carcass bones (including necks)
     1/2         pound  shoulder, leg, loin or fillet of pork
  2                     scallions, white part only -- kept whole
  2             ounces  fresh ginger -- peeled, and
                        slightly crushed
                        Salt -- to taste

Combine all of the ingredients in a stockpot in enough water to cover the chicken.  Bring to a boil then simmer gently, covered, for 1 1/2 hours.  Remove and discard the solid ingredients.  Strain the broth (stock) and reserve for family soups.  Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.  It is useful to freeze any unused stock. 

This recipe yields 10 cups. 

Comments:  Soup is practically indispensable in the Chinese daily family meal, acting as an important beverage to balance the various dishes.  Such soups are light and clear and feature fresh green or root vegetables in season.  The broths (stocks) for making these soups are usually made with a small amount of meat and/or bones -- the vegetables being the principal ingredient.  Chicken carcass bones or a little pork are quite sufficient for family broth.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Combine all of the ingredients in a stockpot in enough water to cover the chicken.  Bring to a boil then simmer gently, covered, for 1 1/2 hours.  Remove and discard the solid ingredients.  Strain the broth (stock) and reserve for family soups.  Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.  It is useful to freeze any unused stock. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 10 cups. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Soup is practically indispensable in the Chinese daily family meal, acting as an important beverage to balance the various dishes.  Such soups are light and clear and feature fresh green or root vegetables in season.  The broths (stocks) for making these soups are usually made with a small amount of meat and/or bones -- the vegetables being the principal ingredient.  Chicken carcass bones or a little pork are quite sufficient for family broth.

                            Fish In Wine Sauce

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  white fish fillets, such as sea perch,
                        porgy, snapper, sole, orange roughy
                        === FOR FISH MARINADE ===
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2                egg white
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  wood ear fungus (wun yee) -- soaked 20 minutes in
                        warm water, rinsed and drained
                        === FOR SEASONINGS ===
  3        tablespoons  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  Family Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  groundnut/peanut oil
                        Cilantro sprig -- for garnish

Cut the fish fillets into 2-inch square pieces.  Combine the fish marinade ingredients, add the fish pieces and set aside to marinate for 15 minutes. 

Simmer the wood ear fungus in the chicken broth for 1 minute.  Drain and set aside. 

Mix the seasonings ingredients together. 

Coat a skillet with the peanut oil and heat to moderately hot but not smoking.  Pan-fry the fish pieces for 2 minutes on each side; the fish should be removed before any browning.  Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. 

Pour off the excess oil from the pan.  Add the seasonings mixture and bring to a boil, stirring until thickened.  Return the fish pieces to the pan and gently simmer for 2 minutes. 

Serve on a heated dish, surrounded by the wood ear fungus and garnished with the cilantro. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This exquisite fish dish mirrors the refinements of the cuisine of the Song Dynasty (AD 960-1279), a period when people's eating habits mirrored their social position.  Although the distinction between the cooking styles and ingredients of the rich and the poor was not as marked as in the Western world, the rich had access to more variety and specialties. 

This dish calls for a white-fleshed fish of superb quality and freshness, and the wine must be the finest Shaoxing rice wine available.  It is a dish that originated in Beijing (Peking) and does justice to claims of the citizens of Beijing (Peking) that their food, when properly understood, is "like a beautiful young girl who does not need jewelry or makeup."

Categories    : Appetizers                      Beef
                Chinese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  beef shin (gravy beef) -- in one whole
                        round piece with no cuts
                        === SIMMERING SAUCE ===
  1                cup  light soy sauce
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1                     knob fresh ginger - (walnut-size) -- peeled and smashed
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, left whole
  2                     scallions
  2        tablespoons  five-spice powder or mixed spices -- wrapped in muslim

Bring all the ingredients for the simmering sauce to a boil in a pot large enough to hold the piece of beef.  Place the beef in the pot, and bring the sauce back to boil.  Reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours. 

Remove the beef and chill in the refrigerator for at least several hours, or preferably overnight. 

Thinly slice and serve as a cold appetizer. 

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings. 

Comments:  Another name for this dish is red-stewed beef.  The technique of stewing is recorded in texts surviving from the Zhou dynasty (1050-249 BC).  In fact, bamboo slips itemizing food, seasonings and cooking methods found recently in archeological diggings, clearly indicate that keng (stew) was the main food in China from antiquity to the Han period (202 BC-AD 220).  Keng was the forerunner of the method referred to today as red-stewed or red-cooked.

           Fresh Jumbo Shrimp Tossed With Ginger And Scallions

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh uncooked jumbo shrimp (king prawns) -- shelled, with
                        tails intact and deveined
  4               cups  groundnut/peanut oil -- for deep-frying
  6        thin slices  fresh ginger
  2             ounces  bamboo shoots
  2                     scallions (spring onions) -- cut 2" lengths
  4             ounces  snow peas (mangetout) -- topped and tailed
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  Family Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  cold water -- for thickening
  1         tablespoon  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil

Wash the shrimp thoroughly under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. 

In a wok, heat the groundnut oil to moderately hot.  Add the shrimp and cook for 30 seconds.  Drain and transfer to a plate. 

Pour off the oil from the wok; wipe out the wok with paper towels.  Add enough oil to coat the wok, and heat to almost smoking.  Add the ginger, bamboo shoots and the scallions and stir-fry for 20 seconds. 

Return the shrimp and add the snow peas and toss over high heat to combine well.  Add the salt and the chicken broth and bring to a fast boil.  Boil for 1 1/2 minutes. 

Stir in the thickening and cook until smooth.  Add the rice wine and the sesame oil.  Transfer the contents from the wok to a large serving plate. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 

Comments:  People all over China enjoy jumbo shrimp (king prawns), making them a food for celebrations.  The word for shrimp, har, has the same sound as the word for "laughter."  Thus the Chinese link the eating of shrimp with happiness.  A special shrimp dish is always a feature of Chinese New Year dinners.

               Fresh Noodles With Three Kinds Of Mushrooms

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  fresh rice noodles (ho fun)
  3        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
  6                     Chinese dried mushrooms -- soaked in warm water
                        for 45 minutes, water squeezed out, stems
                        discarded, and caps cut into julienne
     1/4           cup  straw mushrooms or white mushrooms -- halved
  6                     fresh field mushrooms -- cut into julienne
     3/4           cup  shredded scallions, mainly white part
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  oyster sauce
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  Family Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
                        Cilantro -- for garnish

Ho fun noodles are often sold as a square block.  Simply cut the block into 1/2-inch wide ribbons, and place them in a large bowl.  Pour in enough hot water to cover them, and gently stir the ribbon noodles with a pair of chopsticks to separate them.  They need only stand in the hot water for 1 to 2 minutes.  Drain in a colander, rinse briefly under warm water and set aside on a plate until ready for use. 

Heat the groundnut oil in a preheated wok.  Stir-fry all of the mushrooms together with the scallions for 1 minute.  Add the seasonings ingredients and simmer for 1 minute. 

Toss the noodles in the seasoning, combine and serve, garnished wtith a little cilanto. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  We have to thank the innovative people of the Han period for the noodle dishes of today.  In Han times (202 BC-AD 220) "noodle food" was generally referred to as ng (cakes).  It was during this period that the technique for large-scale flour grinding was developed. 

The making of rice noodles followed wheat noodles.  Rice noodle dishes, such as this recipe, became so popular in South China that they traveled further into Southeast Asia.  Noodle dishes such as char kueh teon were created and destined to become one of the most famous Hawker dishes of Southeast Asia.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Ho fun noodles are often sold as a square block.  Simply cut the block into 1/2-inch wide ribbons, and place them in a large bowl.  Pour in enough hot water to cover them, and gently stir the ribbon noodles with a pair of chopsticks to separate them.  They need only stand in the hot water for 1 to 2 minutes.  Drain in a colander, rinse briefly under warm water and set aside on a plate until ready for use. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Heat the groundnut oil in a preheated wok.  Stir-fry all of the mushrooms together with the scallions for 1 minute.  Add the seasonings ingredients and simmer for 1 minute. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Toss the noodles in the seasoning, combine and serve, garnished wtith a little cilanto. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 6 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  We have to thank the innovative people of the Han period for the noodle dishes of today.  In Han times (202 BC-AD 220) &quot;noodle food&quot; was generally referred to as ng (cakes).  It was during this period that the technique for large-scale flour grinding was developed. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;The making of rice noodles followed wheat noodles.  Rice noodle dishes, such as this recipe, became so popular in South China that they traveled further into Southeast Asia.  Noodle dishes such as char kueh teon were created and destined to become one of the most famous Hawker dishes of Southeast Asia.

                              Fried Noodles

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  fresh egg noodles, thin variety
     1/2           cup  groundnut/peanut oil
  2        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
     1/4         pound  Chinese barbecued pork (char sieu) -- cut 1/4" thick
                        julienne
  3                     scallions, mainly the white part -- sliced 2" long
                        shreds
     1/2           cup  snow peas -- topped, tailed,
                        and cut into julienne
  1         tablespoon  wood ear fungus (wun yee) -- soaked for 30
                        minutes in warm water, rinsed and drained
  1                cup  celery julienne
  1                cup  bean sprouts
     1/4           cup  water
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  oyster sauce
  2          teaspoons  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  cold water

Drop the noodles into boiling water, loosen the strands with chopsticks, and when the water comes to a boil again, drain immediately.  Rinse well under cold water and drain thoroughly.  Spread the noodles on a tray to allow them to dry for at least 20 minutes.  Lift them and gently shake to loosen and allow to dry more evenly.  Arrange the noodles on a dinner plate and shape into a loose mound. 

Heat the 1/2 cup oil in a wok until just beginning to smoke.  Slide the noodle mound into the oil, and fry for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the base of the noodles is crisping and turning golden brown.  Flip over to the other side and fry.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  (The outside noodles are crisped and lightly browned, but the inside should still be soft and tender.)  Keep warm in a low oven (210 degrees) with the door open. 

Meanwhile, heat the 2 tablespoons oil in a wok.  Stir-fry the Chinese barbecued pork and the scallions for 1 minute.  Add the snow peas, wood ear fungus, celery, and bean sprouts and toss together over moderate heat for 1 minute.  Sprinkle the water down the side of the wok, cover the wok with the lid and cook for about 30 seconds.  Add all of the seasonings ingredients, stirring immediately until the sauce is lightly velvety. 

Arrange the fried noodles on a serving plate, place the Chinese barbecued pork and vegetables over the top of the noodles and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  By the end of the Han dynasty (202 BC-AD 220), noodles were standard fare and enjoyed in various forms by rich and poor alike.  It is recorded that even the emperor ate boiled noodles.  By the eighteenth century, however, Chinese culinary attitudes had changed.  Poets and philosophers alike extolled the virtues of fine cooking as distinct from eating for survival. 

The technique of boiling then frying noodles marks this as an original Cantonese dish.  The variety of ingredients, offering interesting flavors and textures, is a reflection of the culinary directions of the eighteenth century.

               Fried Noodles With Shredded Pork And Chives

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  fresh thin round noodles (chow mein)
  2             ounces  pork loin or barbecued pork (char sieu)
     1/4           cup  groundnut/peanut oil -- plus
  2 1/2    tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
  2               cups  bean sprouts
  6                     dried Chinese mushrooms -- soaked in warm water
                        for 45 minutes and shredded
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  dark soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  fish sauce
     1/4           cup  chicken stock or water
  6             ounces  chives, preferably yellow chives -- cut into 2" lengths
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- mixed in
                        a little cold water for thickening

Boil the noodles for 30 seconds, stirring to loosen; then drain and set aside. 

Blanch the shredded pork in boiling water, cooking until the water comes back to a boil.  Remove and rinse quickly under cold running water.  Set aside. 

Heat 1/4 cup peanut oil in a preheated wok until smoking.  Fry the noodles until lightly browned and a little crisp.  Arrange the noodles into a pancake shape, and when the noodles are brown and crisp a little, reduce the heat for further crisping.  Turn over and repeat on the other side.  Remove and keep warm. 

Heat 2 tablespoons of peanut oil in the wok.  Stir-fry the bean sprouts and mushrooms for 30 seconds.  Add the seasonings mixture, return the cooked pork and sprinkle on the chives.  Combine well, sprinkle in a little extra oil and stir in the thickening. 

Arrange the noodles on a serving plate, fluff up a little and ladle the pork and vegetables over.  Serve at once. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Egg noodles originated in the southeastern provinces of China at least four centuries ago.  Traditionally, they were made simply from flour and water.  The generous amount of chives in this recipe, however, suggests it is a northern dish.  This blending is an example of how regional specialties borrow from each other.

                      Fried Shallot Or Garlic Flakes

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Condiments


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     shallots or garlic cloves -- cut cross-wise
                        into slices 1/8" thick
                        Peanut or vegetable oil -- for frying

In a frying pan over medium heat, pour in peanut or vegetable oil to a depth of 1/2 inch.  When the oil is moderately-hot (about 325 degrees), add the shallot or garlic slices.  Fry slowly, stirring, just until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the slices to paper towels to drain.  Let cool, then store the flakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to several weeks. 

This recipe yields about 1/2 cup. 

Comments:  You will find these crisp and tasty toppings and accompaniments served with everything from soups and salads to curries and stir-fries.  Although commercially prepared shallot and garlic flakes are available in Asian markets, they cannot compare to the freshly made ones given here.

                        skined removed
                        === FOR THE CHICKEN MARINADE ===
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  2          teaspoons  light soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch
  3               cups  groundnut/peanut oil -- for deep-frying
  1                     green bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1" traingles
  2                     red chili peppers -- seeded, chopped
  6                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  12                    black peppercorns -- crushed
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
  1           teaspoon  dark soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  light soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  white vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  cold water -- for thickening
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  hot chili oil

Score the chicken meat all over, then cut into 1-inch square bite-sizes pieces.  Mix the chicken with all of the marinade ingredients and set aside for 20 minutes. 

Meanwhile, assemble the remaining ingredients so they are ready for cooking. 

Heat the groundnut oil for deep-frying in a wok until moderately hot.  Deep-fry the chicken until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon, and drain on paper towels. 

Pour off the groundnut oil from the wok, leaving a generous film of oil, about 2 teaspoons.  Set over high heat and stir-fry the bell peppers, chili peppers, and garlic for 30 seconds. 

Add the peppercorns and chicken and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the seasonings, and stir in the thickening.  Add the sesame oil and hot chili oil and toss to combine thoroughly for 10 seconds.  Remove to a serving plate and serve hot. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  It is surprising that the Humanese people are known in China as possessing strong wills and a fighting spirit, for they surely are a reflection of their cuisine.  Their food is strong, robust and full of jostling flavors.  This dish typifies the style of cooking that has made Hunan food a strong contender for the best cuisine in China.

                      Ginger And Honey Fresh Fruits

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Desserts
                Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  stem ginger syrup
  2        tablespoons  clear honey
  1         tablespoon  chopped stem ginger
  1 1/3           cups  green ginger wine
  1              large  mango
  1              small  fresh pineapple -- cut into good
                        bite-size pieces
  1             medium  cantaloupe -- cut into balls
  2                     Chinese gooseberries (kiwis) -- peeled and sliced
  2                     star fruits -- sliced
                        Juice of 1 lime
  1         tablespoon  finely-julienned lime zest strips -- for garnish

Combine the stem ginger syrup, honey, and stem ginger with the ginger wine.  Set aside. 

Slice the mango on each side of the stone.  Cut the flesh from the skin in chunks.  Mix with the other fruits, lime juice and grated lime zest.  Pour the ginger wine mixture over the fruits.  Cover and refrigerate overnight. 

To serve, attractively arrange in a bowl and garnish with the lime.  Serve chilled. 

This recipe yields 10 servings. 

Comments:  Ginger is naturally associated with Chinese cooking.  The ginger plant is native to Asia and was one of the first oriental spices to travel the Silk Road to Europe.  Its uses are many.  SautÈed with garlic and scallions, it forms the basis for a host of dishes.  Dried or candied, it is used in preserves and sweets that the Chinese enjoy as nibbles.  In this recipe, sweet preserved ginger is used to add tang to fresh fruits.

                           Ginger-Peach Sorbet

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     ripe peaches -- peeled, pitted,
                        and cut into chunks
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                     egg white
  4             pieces  sweet stem ginger in syrup
                        or crystallized ginger -- chopped

In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine the peaches, lime juice and sugar.  Process to a smooth purÈe.  Pour the purÈe into a shallow metal pan.  Place the pan in the freezer and freeze until the edges are firm and the center is soft, about 2 hours. 

In a large bowl, beat the egg white until almost stiff; set aside.  Return the semi-frozen peach purÈe to the food processor and process until it becomes frothy, about 30 seconds.  Add the ginger and egg white to the processor and, using on-off pulses, process just long enough to blend in the white, 3 to 5 seconds. 

Pour the mixture into a freezer container, cover tightly and place in the freezer until firm but not frozen solid, 1 to 2 hours.  If it freezes solid, allow it to soften in the refrigerator before serving, about 30 minutes. 

This recipe yields about 3 cups; serves 4. 

Comments:  The origin of ice cream has been traced back to the ancient Chinese, who mixed ice with sweets, thus inventing water ices, the precursors to modern-day ice creams.  Chilled fresh fruit is the most popular traditional dessert in Asia, while ice desserts are favorites among the younger set.  This fruit sorbet recipe satisfies both traditionalists and the young.

  1              pound  green beans -- topped and tailed
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  2        tablespoons  cold water, for thickening

In large skillet (frying plan), combine the oil and garlic.  Stir over medium heat until light and golden (about 2 minutes).  Add the broth, cover, and simmer until the garlic is tender when pierced, about 5 minutes. 

Bring the broth back to a boil and add the beans.  Cook, covered, just until the beans are crisp-tender (3 to 4 minutes).  With tongs, lift out the beans and arrange on a serving plate. 

Stir the cornstarch thickening into the broth in the skillet.  Bring to a boil, stirring until thickened.  Spoon the sauce and garlic over the beans. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  The great variety of climate and soil in China has resulted in the cultivation of an enormous diversity of plants.  Abundant vegetation allows for economizing on the eating of flesh, to the extent that today the Chinese, by preference, eat much more vegetable and grain produce than meat, a diet that over many centuries has become extremely well balanced. 

The Chinese farmer, in a constant effort to utilize every square inch of his land, prefers to grow plants that will take the least space.  Consequently, legumes (pulses) of every description climb and trail upward over racks, and climbers cover the sides and roofs of his home and any outbuildings. 

Beans are a particularly popular crop in areas with a subtropical climate.  This tasty dish can be made with the traditional green (French) beans or with yardlong (snake) beans.

                         Hakka Salt-Baked Chicken

Recipe By     :Barbara Tropp for Food & Wine Magazine
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Chinese
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2         pounds  chicken - (to 4 lbs) -- rinsed, patted dry
                        (preferably free range)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
  5                     quarter-size slices of fresh ginger -- lightly smashed
  2                     scallions -- lightly smashed,
                        and cut into 1 1/2" lengths
  5                     cilantro sprigs -- plus additional
                        Cilantro leaves -- for garnish
  1                     star anise pod
  1         tablespoon  Rose Dew Liqueur or extra-dry vermouth
  4 1/2         pounds  kosher salt
                        Hakka Dipping Sauces -- for serving

Rub the cavity of the chicken with the rice wine and stuff with the ginger, scallions, cilantro sprigs and star anise.  Place the chicken, breast up, on a rack and brush the outside with the liqueur.  Let the chicken stand in a cool, airy place until the skin is dry to the touch, about 2 hours. 

Truss the chicken with string.  Wrap the chicken in a single layer of cheesecloth; bring the ends around and tie them together on top of the chicken breast with string.  The chicken should be tightly wrapped in a neat ball. 

Pour the salt into a large heavy stockpot or spun-steel wok that will hold the chicken snugly.  Turn the heat to moderately-high and stir the salt frequently until it is very hot to the touch, about 10 minutes.  Carefully pour all but 1 inch of the salt (about 6 cups) into a heatproof bowl.  Set the chicken in the pot, breast up, and cover completely with the reserved hot salt.  Cover the pot, reduce the heat to moderate and cook the chicken undisturbed on top of the stove for 1 1/2 hours.  Check for doneness by brushing off the salt and piercing a thigh with a sharp knife.  If the juices are still pink, re-cover with salt and continue to cook for another 15 to 30 minutes. 

Push the salt aside and carefully remove the chicken, holding it by the knotted cheesecloth; try not to tilt the chicken and spill the juices.  Set the chicken on a large platter and remove the cheesecloth and trussing strings.  Discard the salt.  Carve the chicken or use a cleaver to chop it Chinese-style into bite-size pieces.  Serve hot or at room temperature, garnished with cilantro leaves and accompanied by the Hakka Dipping Sauces. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Barbara Tropp, a scholar of Chinese culture and a cookbook author and restaurant consultant, introduced F&W readers to the simple, earthy cuisine of the Hakka people of southeast China.

                              Kung Po Shrimp

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  fresh uncooked jumbo shrimp -- shelled and deveined
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  groundnut/peanut oil
     1/4           cup  self-raising flour
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
                        Cold water -- as needed
  3               cups  groundnut/peanut oil -- for deep-frying
     1/2         small  red bell pepper -- cut into wedges
     1/2                green bell pepper -- cut into wedges
  1              small  onion -- quartered
  1                     dried chili pepper -- seeded and chopped
  1              large  garlic clove -- finely sliced
  2          teaspoons  finely-sliced fresh ginger
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch -- mixed with
  2          teaspoons  cold water -- for thickening

Wash the shrimp thoroughly under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels.  Place the shrimp in a bowl, sprinkle with salt and pepper and the peanut oil and set aside to marinate while you prepare the other ingredients. 

Combine the self-raising flour and cornstarch.  Sprinkle the mixture over the shrimp and toss through to coat.  Sprinkle on a little cold water to create a light batter, and mix quickly to combine. 

Heat a wok, add the peanut oil and bring to a high heat until the oil is shimmering.  Reduce the heat to moderate, and deep-fry the shrimp for 3 to 4 minutes, gently stirring with chopsticks to separate and cook evenly.  During the last few seconds of cooking, add the bell peppers and onion and cook for about 5 seconds.  Remove all of the ingredients with a strainer and set aside on a plate. 

Pour off most of the oil, leaving a good film of oil behind to coat the wok.  Add the chili, garlic and ginger and stir-fry for a few seconds; then add all of the seasonings ingredients.  Stir in the cornstarch thickening and cook until velvety. 

Return the shrimp and the vegetables to the wok, toss quickly in the sauce and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  An interesting movement, as far as food consumption is concerned, began during the Ching dynasty (1644-1911).  Corporate organizations flourished, from the lowest levels (poor family groups) to the more powerful levels (merchants and officials), whose members lived in Beijing (Peking), far from their native places.  In their own meeting places, they pooled their resources and could dine on their own regional foods, thus preserving local customs and tastes.  In this way, the capital became a melting pot of many regional dishes that later became known as Imperial Cuisine. 

Kung Po Shrimp was probably one such dish, with characteristics closely allied to the cuisines of the eastern Provinces of Jiangsu (Kiangsu) and Zhejiang (Chekiang).

                           Lamb In Honey Sauce

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Lamb


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  lean boneless lamb
  1         tablespoon  hosin sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  3        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  brown vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
  1           teaspoon  ginger juice (use a garlic press)
  1           teaspoon  honey
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch

Slice the lamb across the grain into thin slices.  Place in a dish and mix well with the hoisin sauce and sesame oil.  Dust with the cornstarch to coat the meat pieces evenly. 

Heat the groundnut oil in a preheated wok until moderately hot.  Stir-fry the lamb for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly with chopsticks to separate the slices.  Remove and drain well. 

Pour off the oil, leaving 1 tablespoon behind, and stir in the seasonings ingredients.  Bring to a boil.  Return the lamb to the wok and stir quickly over maximum heat until the seasoning ingredients coat the lamb slices.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Little is written about lamb in Chinese cooking as it plays a relatively small role in China's gastronomy.  Most Chinese find the odor of mutton disagreeable.  But because the texture of the meat is excellent, Chinese cooks take time and care in preparing lamb to minimize its less attractive features and maximize the best. 

This recipe was reputedly created exclusively for the Dowager Empress Cixi of the Quig dynasty (AD 1644-1911), whose royal taste was for many concoctions made with honey. 

Honey is probably the oldest and most respected sweetener in China, dating from as early as Tang (AD 618-906), when the bees of most of northern China provided honey for the palace tables of Changan (now Xian).

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Slice the lamb across the grain into thin slices.  Place in a dish and mix well with the hoisin sauce and sesame oil.  Dust with the cornstarch to coat the meat pieces evenly. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Heat the groundnut oil in a preheated wok until moderately hot.  Stir-fry the lamb for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly with chopsticks to separate the slices.  Remove and drain well. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Pour off the oil, leaving 1 tablespoon behind, and stir in the seasonings ingredients.  Bring to a boil.  Return the lamb to the wok and stir quickly over maximum heat until the seasoning ingredients coat the lamb slices.  Serve immediately.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Little is written about lamb in Chinese cooking as it plays a relatively small role in China&apos;s gastronomy.  Most Chinese find the odor of mutton disagreeable.  But because the texture of the meat is excellent, Chinese cooks take time and care in preparing lamb to minimize its less attractive features and maximize the best. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe was reputedly created exclusively for the Dowager Empress Cixi of the Quig dynasty (AD 1644-1911), whose royal taste was for many concoctions made with honey. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Honey is probably the oldest and most respected sweetener in China, dating from as early as Tang (AD 618-906), when the bees of most of northern China provided honey for the palace tables of Changan (now Xian).

                             Lobster Clay Pot

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     live lobster - (abt 2 lbs)
  1 1/2           cups  groundnut/peanut oil
  1                     knob fresh ginger - (small walnut size) -- peeled, and
                        smashed with the flat of a heavy knife
  3                     scallions, mainly white parts
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
  1 1/2           cups  Family Chicken Broth or water -- (see recipe)
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- mixed in
                        a little cold water -- for thickening
  1            package  Chinese egg noodles
                        or 1 package (12 oz) rice noodles (ho fun)
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry

Drown the lobster.  Remove the head, claws and legs and place into a steamer.  Cook for 10 minutes.  Remove the meat from all the parts and put aside for later use. 

Wash the tail section, remove the intestinal tract and chop the tail section, with the shell still on, into 10 to 12 pieces. 

Heat the groundnut oil in a pre-heated wok until moderately hot.  Add the ginger and scallions, then add the lobster tail sections and stir-fry for about 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and put aside. 

Drain off the groundnut oil, leaving a film of oil around the wok and reserving 1 teaspoon of the cooked oil. 

Return the wok to the heat, then return the lobster tail to the wok together with the cooked meat taken from the head, claws and legs.  Add the salt, sugar, sesame oil, and the chicken broth.  Immediately stir in the thickening until you have a velvety sauce that clings around the lobster pieces.  Put aside while you prepare the noodles. 

Cook the noodles in a large pot of boiling water until "al dente;" the time varies according to the type of noodles.  They should be soft through to the center, but still firm to the touch.  Drain, and rinse gently under cold water. 

Place the noodles back into a pot of hot water to heat again, drain, place in a bowl, and stir through a little salt and the cooked oil. 

Arrange the noodles in the clay pot, place the lobster over the noodles.  Pour enough of the liquid from the wok into the clay pot to a depth of about 1 inch.  Place on a moderately hot stove, and cook until the steam bursts through the lid. 

Pour the Shaoxing rice wine down the side of the clay pot, simmer for a few seconds more, then take the claypot directly to the table. 

Do not open the lid until everybody is ready.  The lid is then lifted off for everyone to experience the first breath of its fragrance. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 

Comments:  The ancient Chinese clay pot cooks this casserole to perfection, making this dish a very sophisticated keng (stew). 

A seafood casserole is the ultimate family dish, enjoyed particularly in the South of China.  The Chiu Chow of the fishing town of Shantou (Swatow), just North of Guangzhou (Canton), have a distinctive flair for seafood dishes and this lobster clay pot is a fine example of their repertoire.

                       Lychee And Ginger Ice Cream

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     egg whites
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                can  lychees - (1 1/4 lbs) -- drained, and
                        roughly chopped
  1                cup  chopped crystallized (sweet) stem ginger
                        in syrup
                        Grated zest (rind) of 1 orange -- for garnish

Beat the egg whites until thick, gradually add the sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.  Add the cream and continue beating until the mixture is thick and creamy. 

Add 2 teaspoons of the ginger syrup into the chopped lychees.  Gently mix the lychees and ginger into the ice cream mixture and pour into a large (2-quart) flat dish.  Cover and freeze.  When almost set, take out, beat again, then return to the freezer to set overnight. 

One hour before serving, place the ice cream in the refrigerator to soften a little.  Garnish with the orange zest. 

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings. 

Comments:  Southern fruits have always been northern luxuries, and the dainty and exotic lychee, cultivated in southern China since 1700 BC, has quite a history.  Stories of the extravagant favorite concubine of an emperor of the Tang dynasty (AD 618-906) tell of relays of exhausted horsemen bringing fresh lychees packed in ice from the South to Changan (now Xian), the capital, to indulge her passion for them. 

The flesh of the lychee is a translucent pearly white with a texture and flavor similar to a large luscious grape.  In this recipe an ancient fruit is married to an ancient recipe -- surprisingly, the making of ice cream in China goes back more than 3,000 years.

                      Ma Po (Minced Meat) Bean Curd

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  groundnut/peanut oil -- for deep-frying
  6             ounces  ground pork
  1         tablespoon  Chinese chili paste
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  mushroom soy sauce
  8                     cakes fresh bean curd -- roughly diced
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  Family Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  2                     scallions -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  Sichuan peppercorns (fagara) -- toasted and crushed

Pour the groundnut oil into a wok and heat until it begins to smoke.  Deep-fry the ground pork until it changes color (about 1 minute).  Strain off the excess oil. 

Combine the chili paste and chicken broth.  Add the mushroom soy sauce and the chili paste mixture to the wok and bring to a boil.  Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the bean curd and cook for 3 minutes.  Add all of the sauce ingredients, and stir in the scallions. 

Place on a serving plate and sprinkle with the Sichuan pepper. 

Roast the Sichuan peppercorns over low heat in a dry wok, gently stirring until they become "fragrant" (3 to 4 minutes).  Remove and crush them to a "pepper mill" texture (use a coffee or spice grinder), then store them in a screw-top jar. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  The origin of this famous dish is traced to the Qing dynasty, during the reign of the Emperor Tong Zhi (1864-74).  A charming story describes how a peasant woman in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan (Szechwan) province, once provided food and hospitality to the weary emperor.  Among the dishes this woman devised and served to her noble guest was a humble dish of bean curd and ground (minced) meat.  The woman's culinary skill was so highly praised that royal edict pronounced the dish fit for a king and was thereafter to be named in honor of the creator. 

In Chinese custom, the woman was mature enough to be simply called "grandmother" and as she was unfortunate enough still to bear the scars of the scourge of smallpox, the dish was rather unkindly called pockmarked grandmother's bean curd.  Her fame spread far and wide, and today on the Wanfu Bridge in Chengdu one can still sample the same culinary joys as the Emperor Tong zhi at the original house of "Ma Po."

Among the dishes this woman devised and served to her noble guest was a humble dish of bean curd and ground (minced) meat.  The woman&apos;s culinary skill was so highly praised that royal edict pronounced the dish fit for a king and was thereafter to be named in honor of the creator. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;In Chinese custom, the woman was mature enough to be simply called &quot;grandmother&quot; and as she was unfortunate enough still to bear the scars of the scourge of smallpox, the dish was rather unkindly called pockmarked grandmother&apos;s bean curd.  Her fame spread far and wide, and today on the Wanfu Bridge in Chengdu one can still sample the same culinary joys as the Emperor Tong zhi at the original house of &quot;Ma Po.&quot;

                            Mandarin Pancakes

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose (plain) flour -- plus extra as needed
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  boiling water
  3        tablespoons  Asian sesame oil or vegetable oil

In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine the 2 cups flour and salt; pulse once to mix.  With the motor running, pour the boiling water through the feed tube in a slow, steady stream.  Continue to process until a rough ball forms and the dough pulls away from the sides of the work bowl, 15 to 20 seconds.  If the dough is sticky, sprinkle with more flour and process for 15 seconds longer. 

Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface.  Knead until smooth and no longer sticky, about 3 minutes.  Cover with a damp towel and let rest for at least 30 minutes, or wrap in the towel and refrigerate overnight.  Bring to room temperature before continuing. 

Return the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead again until fairly firm, smooth and no longer sticky, about 1 minute.  Divide the dough in half.  Roll out one-half 1/4-inch thick.  Using a 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 10 rounds.  Brush half of the rounds with a thin film of sesame or vegetable oil, then cover each oiled round with an unoiled one. 

Preheat an ungreased frying pan over medium-low heat for 1 minute.  Meanwhile, on a lightly floured board, roll out one "sandwiched round" into a round 8 inches in diameter and place in the pan.  Within 45 to 60 seconds, the round should puff in the middle and blister on the bottom.  Turn it over and continue to cook for about 30 seconds longer.  Remove from the heat and immediately pull the layers apart to make 2 pancakes.  Stack them, dry-side down, and wrap in aluminum foil while preparing the remaining pancakes.  Use the pancakes immediately, or refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 1 month. 

To reheat refrigerated pancakes, fold them in half or into quarters and arrange them in a bamboo steaming basket.  Set the steaming basket over (not touching) boiling water in a wok; cover and steam for 3 minutes.  Serve directly from the basket.  If pancakes are frozen, thaw first at room temperature, then steam for 5 minutes. 

This recipe yields twenty 8-inch pancakes. 

Comments:  Mandarin pancakes are crÍpe-like breads used to wrap stir-fried dishes.  Commercially prepared pancakes are available in the frozen-food sections of Chinese food stores.

                             Mango Ice Cream

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     egg whites
  1 3/4           cups  superfine sugar
  2 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  2                     ripe mangoes -- flesh roughly
                        chopped into 1" pieces

In a bowl, beat the egg whites until thick.  Add the sugar and beat until stiff.  Add the cream and continue beating until the mixture is thick and creamy.  Gently mix in the mango pieces. 

Cover and freeze until almost set.  Take out, beat again and return to the freezer to set overnight. 

One hour before serving, place the ice cream in the refrigerator to soften a little. 

This recipe yields 10 servings. 

Comments:  The mango is more often associated with tropical countries like Thailand, Myanman (Burma) and India, where it is said to have originated more than 4,000 years ago. 

Exactly when this delightful "tropical" fruit first traveled to China is a little uncertain, but references to the cultivation of mangoes in China occur in texts dating from the seventh century.  Over many hundreds of years now, this delicious, plump, soft fruit has found great favor with the chefs of South China, where it is wedded to both savory and sweet dishes. 

Ice cream has a history that goes back much further.  Early recipes exist to testify that ice cream as we know it today was made and enjoyed some 3,000 years ago.

Categories    : Chicken                         Chinese
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN MARINADE ===
  2          teaspoons  groundnut/peanut oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  10            ounces  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut on diagonal
                        into 1/4"-thick by 2"-long slices
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground chilis
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-chopped onion
  2          teaspoons  cold water
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  groundnut/peanut oil
  1         tablespoon  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
     1/3           cup  Family Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  dark soy sauce
  4                     Chinese dried mushrooms -- soaked in warm
                        water for 45 minutes, rinsed, water
                        squeezed out, stems discarded, caps halved
     1/2         small  red bell pepper -- cut 1" triangles
  3                     scallions (spring onions), mainly white -- cut into 2" lengths
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  2          teaspoons  cold water -- for thickening
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  2           teaspoon  ground bean sauce (mo si jeung)

Mix the marinade ingredients together and marinate the chicken while you prepare all of the other ingredients for cooking.  Mix together the garlic, chilis, and onion.  Combine the ground bean sauce, water, and sugar. 

Heat a wok, add the groundnut oil, and swirl the surface with oil.  Stir-fry the garlic mixture for 5 seconds.  Add the ground bean sauce mixture and stir-fry for 5 seconds.  Add the rice wine and combine.  Pour in the broth; then the dark soy sauce and stir to combine.  Add the chicken, mushrooms, bell peppers, and scallions.  Stir-fry over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes.  Then, reduce the heat a little, and stir in the thickening mixture for a few seconds. 

Finally, add the sesame oil, which will impart a beautiful fragrance and richness to the dish. 

Serve hot. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Despite being conquerors and overlords, the Mongols were never really assimilated into China.  And although the Mongols were already rulers of a world empire, the Han Chinese looked down on them as barbarians. 

New skills and new foods were introduced with the new rule, but the Chinese maintained that all their conquerors had to offer by way of food was goat's milk and smelly cheese.  Yet some dishes were adopted and have stayed, most notably the Mongolian hot pot, stewed lamb dishes and stronger-tasting meat dishes, such as Mongolian chicken, with its emphasis on a full-flavored sauce of garlic, chilis, onions and the pungent ground bean sauce.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Despite being conquerors and overlords, the Mongols were never really assimilated into China.  And although the Mongols were already rulers of a world empire, the Han Chinese looked down on them as barbarians. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;New skills and new foods were introduced with the new rule, but the Chinese maintained that all their conquerors had to offer by way of food was goat&apos;s milk and smelly cheese.  Yet some dishes were adopted and have stayed, most notably the Mongolian hot pot, stewed lamb dishes and stronger-tasting meat dishes, such as Mongolian chicken, with its emphasis on a full-flavored sauce of garlic, chilis, onions and the pungent ground bean sauce.

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     Mandarin Pancakes -- (see recipe)
                        (or frozen spring roll wrappers, thawed)
     1/4           cup  dried lily buds
     1/4           cup  dried wood ear mushrooms
  1              whole  barbecued duck breast -- (see comments below)
  2        tablespoons  peanut or corn oil
  2                     extra-large eggs -- beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  finely-minced peeled fresh ginger
  1                cup  julienned peeled carrot
  1 1/2           cups  finely-shredded green or napa cabbage
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
                        A big pinch freshly-ground white pepper
  1         tablespoon  Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil
  2                     green (spring) onions -- finely slivered
                        Fresh cilantro (fresh coriander) leaves -- for garnish
                        Hoisin sauce -- for serving

If you are making homemade pancakes, prepare them in advance and keep warm. 

Place the lily buds and mushrooms in separate small bowls.  Add warm water to cover to each bowl and let stand until soft and pliable, about 10 minutes.  Drain both bowls.  Pinch off and discard the hard tips from the lily buds; set aside.  Pinch off and discard the hard centers from the mushrooms.  Tightly roll up each mushroom, then cut crosswise into thin slivers.  Set the lily buds and mushrooms aside. 

Cut the breast meat from the duck bones and discard the bones.  Using a paper towel, pat the excess grease from the breast.  Cut the breast with the skin into julienned strips about 3/8-inch wide.  Set aside. 

Place a wok over medium-high heat.  When it is hot, add 1 tablespoon of the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the eggs and stir to scramble.  Cook, stirring, until soft-cooked, 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer the eggs to a plate, break them up into small morsels and set aside. 

Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the wok.  When the oil is hot, add the salt, ginger, carrot, cabbage and the reserved lily buds and wood ear mushrooms; stir-fry until the cabbage begins to wilt, about 2 minutes.  Add the sugar, white pepper, rice wine or sherry, soy sauce and reserved duck strips; stir-fry until fragrant and thoroughly mixed, about 1 minute.  Stir in the sesame oil, then gently fold in the eggs.  Transfer the mixture to a warmed platter.  Top with the green onions and cilantro leaves. 

Place the hoisin sauce in a small serving saucer.  Set out the steamer basket or plate of pancakes or a plate of spring roll wrappers. 

To eat, smear 1 to 2 teaspoons hoisin sauce across the middle of a pancake.  Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons filling over the sauce.  Fold two opposite sides over and the bottom edge up to contain the filling and eat out of hand. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  This variation of the popular mu shu pork is made with the Cantonese barbecued duck available at most Chinese delicatessens.  Use only the breast meat from the duck for this simple recipe and reserve the rest for another use.  Alternatively, you can marinate and grill a fresh duck breast.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Rice/Grains


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  long-grain rice
  3        tablespoons  cooking oil
     1/2         pound  cremini mushrooms -- sliced thin
     1/2         pound  shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        caps sliced thin
     1/2         pound  white mushrooms -- sliced thin
     1/4      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
  1         tablespoon  grated fresh ginger
  6                     scallions including green tops -- sliced thin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  frozen peas
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil

Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.  Stir in the rice and boil until just done, about 10 minutes.  Drain the rice and set aside to cool. 

Meanwhile, in a large nonstick frying pan or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil over moderately-high heat.  Add half the mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms are tender and golden, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to a plate.  Repeat with the remaining mushrooms and another tablespoon of the cooking oil.  Add these mushrooms to the plate. 

In the same frying pan, heat the remaining tablespoon of cooking oil over moderate heat.  Add the red-pepper flakes, ginger, and scallions and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Increase the heat to moderately-high and add the rice, salt, and soy sauce.  Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes and then add the peas and mushrooms.  Cook, stirring, until everything's warm, another 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the sesame oil. 

Vegetable tip:  Most people throw away shiitake stems because they're tough But you can simmer them gently in stock, or any liquid, until they're tender.  If that's too much trouble, just save them to add flavor to stock. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  The quickest, and most authentic way to make this hearty version of a Chinese-restaurant favorite is to start with leftover rice (you'll need about three cups).  But even if you start with raw rice, you'll still be ready to eat in well under an hour.

                               Orange Beef

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Chinese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  groundnut/peanut oil
     1/2         pound  beef sirloin (topside) -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  2             pieces  dried mandarin (tangerine) peel -- soaked in warm
                        water for 45 minutes, and then shredded
                        (available at Chinese stores)
                        Finely-shredded orange zest (rind) -- for garnish

Heat the groundnut oil in a wok to moderately hot.  Deep-fry the beef slices until the beef changes color.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel.  Pour off the oil from the wok. 

Add all of the remaining ingredients, except the orange zest, to the wok and simmer together for 2 minutes. 

Return the beef slices to the wok and cook in the sauce over moderate heat until the sauce is reduced sufficiently to coat the meat pieces and most of the sauce has been reduced. 

Toss the finely shredded orange zest through and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Chieh translates as "lucky one" and describes the beloved mandarin (tangerine) tree. 

As an ornamental shrub, the mandarin orange is traditionally displayed in the home to celebrate Chinese New Year.  As a high-quality fruit, it is a much sought-after cooking ingredient, especially for its peel, when dried. 

Beef is considered by the Chinese to be too strong in "meat" flavor and is "married" to contrasting and often sweet ingredients, such as the fruit in this dish, to render it more palatable.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  short-grain white rice
  1              pound  ground (minced) pork
  4                     scallions (shallots/spring onions) -- chopped
  4                     canned water chestnuts -- drained and chopped
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  2          teaspoons  grated fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  light soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  rice wine

Place rice in a medium bowl.  Cover with cold water and let stand for 30 minutes.  Drain, spread out onto a paper-towel-lined tray and allow to dry. 

In a bowl, combine pork, scallions, water chestnuts, sugar, salt, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, and rice wine.  Using wet hands, mix until well-combined.  Divide mixture into 20 portions. 

Line a bamboo steamer with banana leaves or parchment (baking paper).  Using wet hands, shape pork mixture into small balls.  Roll each ball in rice until well coated. 

Half fill a medium wok with water (steamer should not touch water) and bring to a boil.  Working in batches, arrange balls in prepared steamer, allowing room for rice to expand.  Cover and place steamer over boiling water.  Steam for 30 minutes, adding more boiling water to wok when necessary.  Lift steamer off wok and carefully remove balls.  Serve warm with soy sauce or Ginger Soy Dipping Sauce. 

This recipe yields about 20 balls.

                          Peking Candied Apples

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Desserts
                Snacks

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BATTER ===
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
     3/4           cup  water - (about)
  2                     Granny Smith or other firm green apples
                        Juice of 1 small lemon
                        === CARAMELIZED SUGAR SYRUP ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  black or white sesame seeds
                        Peanut or corn oil -- for frying

To make the batter, in a bowl, sift together the flour, cornstarch and salt.  Stir in the egg and 3/4 cup water, adding more water if needed to achieve the consistency of a thick pancake batter. 

Peel, halve and core the apples, then cut each into 8 wedges.  Place in a bowl and immediately toss with the lemon juice.  Set aside. 

To make the sugar syrup, in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar and water.  When the sugar has dissolved, raise the heat to high and boil without stirring.  Continue boiling until the mixture changes from large, thick bubbles to a smooth, golden brown syrup-like consistency, 8 to 10 minutes.  This is the hard-crack stage (300 to 310 degrees).  To test the sugar syrup, using a small spoon, scoop up a small amount of syrup and drop it into the ice water.  It should harden instantly.  At this point, the syrup could easily burn, so lower the heat or set the pan in a bowl of ice-cold water to cool it quickly; keep warm while you make the fritters.  Stir in the sesame seeds. 

Preheat a deep saucepan or wok over medium-high heat.  Pour in oil to a depth of 1 1/2 inches.  Heat to 375 degrees.  Oil a serving platter.  Fill a deep serving bowl with ice cubes and add water to cover.  Set the platter and bowl aside. 

When ready to serve, slip the apple wedges into the batter to coat each wedge completely.  Using long chopsticks or a slotted spoon, lift out the apple wedges one at a time, allowing the excess batter to drip off into the bowl, and carefully lower into the hot oil.  Do not crowd the pan; the wedges must float freely.  Deep-fry, keeping the wedges separated and turning often, until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the wedges to paper towels to drain.  When all of the wedges have been fried, dip a few of them in the syrup.  Turn them with oiled tongs or chopsticks to coat completely with the syrup.  Then remove the wedges and set them on the oiled platter, keeping them separate.  Repeat with the remaining wedges. 

To serve, bring the platter of caramelized apples and the serving bowl of ice water to the table.  Pour the caramelized apple wedges into the ice water.  Using chopsticks or a slotted spoon, immediately transfer the hard candied apples from the water to a serving dish.  Serve at once. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Although this is not a traditional "hawker" dessert, a candied apple stand fits perfectly into the concept of Asian fast food.  Being well organized is the key to the success of this dish.  For a memorable presentation, candy the apples at the table in front of your guests.

                               Peking Duck

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     roasting duck - (abt 4 1/2 lbs)
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  1           teaspoon  five spice powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  light soy sauce
  1              piece  shallot
  5             pieces  star anise
  3        tablespoons  maltose
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar
                        === FOR THE PANCAKES ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- sifted
     2/3           cup  boiling water
  1              pinch  salt
  1         tablespoon  groundnut/peanut oil
                        Scallions (spring onions) -- for garnish
                        Hoisin sauce -- for serving

Put a kettle of water on to boil. 

Wash and dry the duck thoroughly.  Mix all of the filling ingredients together and place the filling into the cavity of the duck.  Sew up the opening with a needle and thread. 

Pour the boiling water over the entire body of the duck.  The skin will tighten and immediately separate from the flesh. 

Heat the maltose with the vinegar until the maltose dissolves.  Gently rub the mixture over the duck. 

Hang the duck in a drafty place to dry for at least 6 hours (overnight is a good idea). 

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Roast the duck on a rack for about 1 hour, or until the skin is crisp and reddish-brown. 

Meanwhile, make the mu shu pancakes:  Place the flour in a small mixing bowl, quickly pour in the boiling water and mix together as quickly as possible (it is important that the water be at a good boil).  The mixture will be flaky.  Add the salt and groundnut oil and work in.  Continue to stir for 2 minutes, until the mixture becomes soft and pliable, yet a little firm. 

Divide the dough into two equal parts.  Roll out each piece of dough into a sausage-like roll about 2 inches thick by 4 inches long.  Cut each roll into 4 pieces.  On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece into a 6-inch circle. 

Grease the bottom of a flat skillet (frying pan) with a little groundnut oil and fry each pastry circle, one at a time, on low to moderate heat.  Move the pan occasionally to prevent the pancakes from burning. 

Turn the pancake onto the other side when small bubbles appear.  Keep covered with a damp tea towel until all the pancakes are cooked and ready to serve. 

Serve the duck with the mu shu pancakes, scallions and hoisin sauce. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  The fame of this dish goes far beyond its place of origin.  Throughout most of the world today, Peking duck is synonymous with Chinese haute cuisine.  Not only is it acclaimed for its exquisite skin, crisp and melting over a fine layer of succulent fat, but perhaps even more for the formal ritual that must accompany the serving of the remarkable dish. 

There is an undoubted element of theater in its presentation: the famed duck is first wheeled out of a trolley by its creator, resplendent in white and complete with white gloves.  The duck is thus displayed in its full glory for the approval of the patrons before the masterful slicing of square pieces of crisp skin is performed in full view of the diners. 

The unique manner of wrapping each delicious morsel in a thin mu shu pancake and eating it with a judicious amount of sauce is a refinement that could easily be what I consider the first concept of nouvelle cuisine.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE DRESSING ===
     2/3           cup  walnut oil or olive oil
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2              small  garlic cloves -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  10                    fresh scallops
  3               cups  watercress tender tips only -- discard woody stems
  1                cup  water chestnuts -- halved
     1/2           cup  cherry tomatoes
     1/2           cup  walnut halves
  1                cup  bean sprouts -- topped and tailed
                        Nasturtium flowers and leaves -- for garnish

Mix the dressing ingredients together in a jar and shake well. 

Place the scallops on a plate suitable for steaming.  Sprinkle the scallops with a little of the dressing and steam gently over boiling water for 6 minutes. 

Wash and dry the watercress, and snap into 5-inch sections.  In a serving bowl, combine the watercress, water chestnuts, cherry tomatoes, walnuts and bean sprouts.  Pour on the dressing and toss with the vegetables and nuts.  Gently mix in the scallops.  Garnish with 1 or 2 nasturtium flowers and leaves. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  Two much-loved ingredients combine to make this delightful salad.  Curiously, however, the Chinese have not totally embraced salads as has the West.  This reluctance to accept uncooked foods is rooted in hygiene, as raw food has always been considered unsafe.  In today's China, there are still comparatively few salads as we know them abroad, but in Hong Kong, Singapore and wherever else the Chinese have settled, salad dishes of this type find ready acceptance. 

Watercress is an important vegetable in Chinese cooking, thought to have found its way to southern China from Persia in the early nineteenth century, when it was cultivated for its health-giving properties.  But almost certainly it was growing wild in very wet fields and on the edges of waterways well before that time. 

Watercress is a perennial green leafy plant belonging to the mustard family; hence the refreshing, peppery flavor that make it ideal for salads.  The southern Chinese enjoy this green vegetable in clear chicken or pork broth.

                Scallops And Asparagus With Macadamia Nuts

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  scallops
  5             ounces  fresh asparagus -- sliced 2" lengths
  6             pieces  carrot -- sliced decoratively
  6             pieces  bamboo shoots -- sliced decoratively
  3        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
  2             slices  fresh ginger, 1/4" thick
     1/2                garlic clove -- finely chopped
  12            medium  Chinese dried mushrooms -- soaked in warm
                        water for 45 minutes, stems discarded,
                        caps quartered
  2        tablespoons  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
     1/2           cup  Family Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
                        a little cold water -- for thickening
     1/2           cup  whole macadamia nuts
  2                     scallions, mainly the white parts -- cut into 2" lengths

Drop the scallops into a pot of boiling water and cook over high heat until the water comes back to a boil.  Remove the scallops, drain, and set aside on a plate. 

Drop the asparagus, carrots, and the bamboo shoot pieces in a pot of boiling water.  When the water returns to a boil, cook the vegetables for 20 seconds.  Drain and set aside. 

Heat the peanut oil in a preheated wok until the oil begins to smoke.  SautÈ the ginger and garlic for 3 to 4 seconds. 

Add the scallops and stir-fry over high heat for 30 seconds.  Sprinkle on the rice wine then add the mushrooms, asparagus, carrot and bamboo shoots and toss all of the ingredients quickly together to combine. 

Add the chicken broth, salt, pepper, and the sugar and toss together for 30 seconds. 

Pour in the thickening mixture and stir until the sauce is lightly velvety.  Toss in the macadamia nuts and scallions and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  Apart from the Chinese having a natural love of fish and seafood, economic reasons have made these two foods important staples in China.  Among the shellfish eaten most are shrimp (prawns), crabs, lobsters, abalone and scallops.  Scallops are highly regarded and carefully prepared to bring out their delicacy.  Dried scallops are a special delicacy used specifically for various dishes and commanding a fearsomely high price. 

This dish of fresh scallops and asparagus with macadamia nuts is a fairly modern interpretation which with its use of nuts bears the unmistakable stamp of Cantonese cuisine.

  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
  1         tablespoon  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1              small  egg
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  4               cups  groundnut/peanut oil -- for deep-frying
                        === SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  tomato ketchup
     1/2      teaspoon  chili sauce
  3        tablespoons  lightly-toasted sesame seeds

In a bowl, combine the ground beef with the garlic, ginger, pepper, rice wine, soy sauce, egg, and the cornstarch.  Pound the mixture into the sides of the bowl several times.  This technique helps to expel air, resulting in a sticky homogenous mixture.  Divide the beef mixture to make about 18 meatballs. 

In a wok, heat the oil to about 350 degrees.  Add about 6 meatballs at a time and deep-fry until golden brown.  Remove and drain. 

Mix the sauce ingredients together and set aside. 

Drain off the oil from the wok, wipe out with a paper towel and pour the sauce mixture into the wok.  Stir over low heat for a few seconds, then add the meatballs and sesame seeds to the sauce.  Stir well for 1 minute for the sauce to coat the meatballs.  Transfer the meatballs to a serving plate and serve. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Sesame seeds, known as hu ma ("foreign hemp") originated in the Mediterranean and in ancient Persia (Iran) and were introduced into China probably pre-Tang dynasty (AD 618).  Reports of Iranian street vendors in China selling steamed sesame seed bread date from Tang times. 

The highly prized seeds, available in both black and white varieties, with black seeds being more often used as a garnish, are also valuable for the aromatic oil produced from them. 

These meatballs would be regarded more as a snack food than a main meat dish, principally because of the decorative appeal of the sesame seeds.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Chinese
                Dim Sum

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  1                cup  stems of Chinese cabbage
                        (wong buk, Tianjin cabbage, is best)
  7             ounces  ground sirloin (topside) steak
  1              ounce  fresh pork fat -- ground
  2        tablespoons  cilantro
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  1                     good pinch of pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  light soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
                        (available at Chinese stores)
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
                        === FOR THE DUMPLINGS ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  boiling water
  2        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil -- for frying
     1/2           cup  Family Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
                        (or use 1/2 cup water)

Make the filling:  Blanch the cabbage in a pot of boiling water just to soften, drain well.  Squeeze the water out between paper towels. 

Combine the cabbage with the remaining filling ingredients in a large bowl.  Beat and knead until the mixture is soft and clingy.  Chill in the refrigerator. 

Make the dough:  Sift the flour into a stainless-steel bowl.  Add the boiling water gradually, mixing with a wooden spoon until a fairly thick, soft dough forms.  Cover with a damp cloth and set aside for 30 minutes. 

Remove the dough to a floured work surface, and knead for another minute or 2 until the dough is smooth and pliable.  Divide mixture in half. 

Roll each piece of dough into a 3/4- by 5-inch sausage.  Cut each sausage into about 10 pieces.  Press each piece into a circle with the palm of the hand and roll into 3-inch rounds. 

Make the dumplings:  Place 1 1/2 teaspoons of the filling into each round, close the edges together, pleating the side farthest away and seal together.  (The dumpling is slightly curved because of the stretching of one side.) 

Place the dumplings into a bamboo steamer and steam over boiling water for 15 minutes.  Remove and let cool. 

Place the dumplings into a thick-based skillet.  Add enough peanut oil to cover one-third of the dumplings.  Raise the heat and fry the dumplings for 2 to 3 minutes, until the bottoms become crispy and lightly browned. 

Sprinkle a little water into the pan to create a little steam, cover with a lid, and reduce heat to prevent burning the bottoms of the dumplings.  Shake the pan a little from time to time and continue to pan-fry and steam for another 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove and serve. 

This recipe yields about 10 dumplings. 

Comments:  Records show that these dumplings were made more than four centuries ago.  They are still a favorite in Shanghai and Beijing (Peking), where hundreds of specialty stalls make nothing else in order to satisfy the appetites of the locals.  The dough, made from wheat flour, is rather heavier than that of the South where rice flour is often used, and the technique of frying first, then steaming in chicken broth (stock) makes them a very substantial snack.  They should be eaten with a dip of vinegar and shredded fresh ginger.  Sometimes these dumplings are called "pot stickers" because the base of the dumpling is crisped and browned in oil before steaming.

                      Shoulder Pole Carrying Noodles

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  egg noodles -- fresh or dried
                        (available in the refrigerated section
                        at Chinese stores)
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  4        tablespoons  chopped scallions
  2          teaspoons  hot bean paste [chili]
                        (available at Chinese stores)
  4          teaspoons  white vinegar
     1/4           cup  light soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  Sichuan peppercorns (fagara) -- roasted and crushed,
                        (optional), see * Note
  1                cup  Family Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
                        === FOR MEAT SEASONINGS ===
  2        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
     1/2        pounds  ground beef sirloin or ground pork
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
                        Chopped scallions or cilantro leaves -- for garnish

* Note:  Place the peppercorns into a hot dry wok or skillet and stir over low heat for 3 to 4 minutes, until the peppercorns are fragrant.  Remove and grind in a coffee or spice grinder or blender, or place between 2 paper towels and crush with a rolling pin. 

To prepare fresh noodles:  Drop the noodles into a pot of boiling water and stir to separate.  When the water comes to a boil again, add 1 cup of cold water and cook until the water returns to a boil.  Drain the noodles in a colander, rinse under cold water and drain.  Mix the noodles with the sesame oil. 

To prepare dried noodles:  These vary in cooking time, according to the instructions on the package (cook until they are tender but not soft).  Place the noodles in a bowl and mix in the sesame oil.  Keep warm over a pot of hot water. 

In each serving bowl, place chopped scallions, 1/2 teaspoon of the hot chili bean paste, 1 teaspoon vinegar, 1 tablespoon light soy sauce, and a good pinch of Sichuan peppercorns.  Divide the chicken broth equally among the bowls. 

Heat the groundnut oil in a preheated wok until almost smoking.  Stir-fry the ground beef or pork until the color changes (about 1 minute).  Add all of the seasonings and combine well. 

To serve:  Divide the noodles among the bowls so they are three-fourths filled.  Top with the cooked meat, and garnish with a little chopped scallion or cilantro.  Just before eating, stir the noodles to mix with the seasonings. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  There have always been street vendors in China who have made a living by selling local specialties to the common folk.  In the second century BC, the poet and statesman Jia Yi proposed a chain of "take-away" restaurants on the northern border, in order to attract China's chief barbarian scourge, the Mongols, to the side of civilization.  Whether his idea was put into practice or not is obscure, but certainly during the Song dynasty ( AD 960-1279), it was possible to get food, tea or wine at almost any hour of the day or night in restaurants or in little stalls set up in the streets by the street vendors. 

Shoulder pole carrying noodles is typical of the food sold by these entrepreneurial vendors.  If customers would not come into the restaurants, then the food would be carried outside in baskets suspended on a bamboo pole across the shoulders in the normal manner of transporting goods.  This dish is still popular in the streets (and restaurants) of Sichuan (Szechwan) province today.

In the second century BC, the poet and statesman Jia Yi proposed a chain of &quot;take-away&quot; restaurants on the northern border, in order to attract China&apos;s chief barbarian scourge, the Mongols, to the side of civilization.  Whether his idea was put into practice or not is obscure, but certainly during the Song dynasty ( AD 960-1279), it was possible to get food, tea or wine at almost any hour of the day or night in restaurants or in little stalls set up in the streets by the street vendors. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Shoulder pole carrying noodles is typical of the food sold by these entrepreneurial vendors.  If customers would not come into the restaurants, then the food would be carried outside in baskets suspended on a bamboo pole across the shoulders in the normal manner of transporting goods.  This dish is still popular in the streets (and restaurants) of Sichuan (Szechwan) province today.

                              Shredded Pork

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR PORK MARINADE ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  cold water
                        Good pinch of salt
  10            ounces  lean pork -- cut 2 1/2" long
                        julienne
                        === FOR THE YUXIANG SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     scallion (spring onion) -- minced
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  vinegar
     1/4           cup  Family Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  cold water
     1/4           cup  groundnut/peanut oil
  2                     dried chili peppers -- left whole
  3             ounces  wood ear fungus (wun yee) -- soaked 20 minutes in
                        warm water, rinsed and shredded
  2             ounces  bamboo shoots -- shredded to match
                        the pork
  1                     leek -- washed well,
                        and shredded to match the pork

Add the marinade to the pork, working it in well with the fingers.  Set aside. 

Combine all of the yuxiang sauce ingredients and set aside. 

Heat the groundnut oil in a wok over very high heat until it is smoking.  Stir-fry the pork until the color changes (about 1 minute).  Add the dried chili peppers and fry for about 10 seconds, until the chili peppers have darkened. 

Add the wood ear fungus, bamboo shoots, and leek and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Stir in the yuxiang sauce, and toss all of the ingredients thoroughly together very quickly over a very high heat for 1 minute. 

Transfer to a warm serving plate and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Yuxiang translates literally as "the flavor of fish."  The term is a little puzzling as the dish does not taste like fish, nor is the sauce made from fish.  However, the spices and seasonings in yuxiang sauce were used originally to flavor fish dishes, hence the meaning. 

A dish bearing the term yuxiang will be an attractive bronze color and will have a sauce that exemplifies the Sichuanese (Szechwanese) love of combined flavors, salt, sweet, sour, hot and pungent.  Yuxiang shredded pork is another classic from the West of China.

                 Shredded Pork And Cellophane Noodle Soup

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
  2             slices  fresh ginger 1/4" thick
  4             ounces  pork fillet -- shredded 2" lengths
  2          teaspoons  Chinese Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
  6               cups  Family Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
  6                     dried mushrooms -- soaked 45 minutes,
                        stems removed, and thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  carrot in 1/4" thick julienne
  1                cup  zucchini in 1/4" thick julienne
  1 1/2    tablespoons  preserved mustard greens (mui choi)
                        or Sichuan preserved vegetables (jar choi) -- shredded, (optional)
  1              ounce  cellophane noodles (fun si) -- soaked 30 minutes in
                        warm water and cut into 6" lengths
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil

Heat a stockpot, then add the oil and heat until it is just beginning to smoke.  Saute the ginger slices, and stir-fry the shredded pork, until the color changes.  Pour in the rice wine.  Add the broth, mushrooms and carrot and simmer for 10 minutes. 

Add the zucchini, preserved mustard greens, bean curd and cellophane noodles and simmer for 2 minutes.  Stir in the seasonings and serve in a soup tureen. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 

Comments:  The Chinese do not really consider cellophane noodles as a "staple."  Made of green mung bean starch, they are usually used as an interesting ingredient to accompany meats or other vegetables in a normal "rice meal."  They are popular throughout China, Southeast Asia and Japan. 

Each region of China has its own version of this soup.  In Shanghai, meatballs in the soup make it a hearty meal by itself; the peppery, crunchy Sichuan (Szechwan) pickled vegetable (jar choi) transports us immediately to Sichuan (Szechwan) and to the Zhejiang (Chekiang) provinces, while the mustard greens (mui choi) place it distinctly in the southern province of Guangdong (Kwangtung).

                Dim Sum

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE DOUGH ===
  1                cup  Chinese wheat starch flour (dun min fun)
                        (available at Chinese stores)
     1/4           cup  potato flour
                        (available at Chinese stores)
  1                cup  boiling water
  1         tablespoon  lard
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  8             ounces  fresh uncooked shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        washed under cold running water, dried
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh pork fat -- see * Note
  2        tablespoons  minced water chestnuts
  2        tablespoons  minced bamboo shoots
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
  1                     good pinch of white pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
                        A little beaten egg

* Note:  Trim fat from a pork chop or similar -- essential for a crisp, crunchy texture. 

Make the dough:  Place the wheat starch flour in a stainless-steel mixing bowl, and add the potato flour.  Mix the 2 flours together, and gradually add the boiling water, mixing at the same time with a wood spoon until a fairly thick, soft dough forms.  Do not over-mix at this stage, and do not worry if the flour is not completely mixed through. 

Sprinkle the work surface with potato flour, and add the dough, kneading well, adding a little extra potato flour when necessary to make the dough quite smooth with no lumps.  Add the lard to the center of the dough, spread over and knead into the dough.  Cover the dough with plastic wrap to keep it warm. 

Roll the dough into a 1-inch thick sausage.  Slice the dough into 1-inch pieces.  Shape the pieces into balls and flatten with the flat side of an oil-rubbed cleaver.  (You will need to lift the dough from the work surface with the chopper.) 

Make the filling:  Roughly grind (mince) the shrimp.  Grind the pork fat.  Combine the shrimp, pork, water chestnuts and bamboo shoots.  Add the seasonings ingredients.  Beat all of the ingredients together to make a smooth mixture.  Cover and refrigerate to chill completely. 

Make the dumplings:  Place a walnut-size ball of the filling into the center of each dough wrapper, pressing well.  Fold the dough to encircle the filling, pleat the back side of the wrapper, and press the other side to seal.  The dumpling will look like a bonnet. 

Place the dumplings, without touching each other, in a lightly oiled bamboo steamer.  Steam over boiling water for 10 minutes. 

This recipe yields about 30 dumplings. 

Comments:  As teahouses flourished in the southern areas of Guangdong (Kwangtung) province during the Tang dynasty (AD 618-906), it became necessary for southern chefs to devise and create more and more dainty nibbles and pastries to accompany the now popular and leisurely pastime of tea-drinking.  Seafood was used, as well as pork and chicken, to stuff pastries and dumplings, har gau being the Cantonese masterpiece of this specialized art of dim sum.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Roll the dough into a 1-inch thick sausage.  Slice the dough into 1-inch pieces.  Shape the pieces into balls and flatten with the flat side of an oil-rubbed cleaver.  (You will need to lift the dough from the work surface with the chopper.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Make the filling:  Roughly grind (mince) the shrimp.  Grind the pork fat.  Combine the shrimp, pork, water chestnuts and bamboo shoots.  Add the seasonings ingredients.  Beat all of the ingredients together to make a smooth mixture.  Cover and refrigerate to chill completely. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Make the dumplings:  Place a walnut-size ball of the filling into the center of each dough wrapper, pressing well.  Fold the dough to encircle the filling, pleat the back side of the wrapper, and press the other side to seal.  The dumpling will look like a bonnet. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Place the dumplings, without touching each other, in a lightly oiled bamboo steamer.  Steam over boiling water for 10 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields about 30 dumplings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  As teahouses flourished in the southern areas of Guangdong (Kwangtung) province during the Tang dynasty (AD 618-906), it became necessary for southern chefs to devise and create more and more dainty nibbles and pastries to accompany the now popular and leisurely pastime of tea-drinking.  Seafood was used, as well as pork and chicken, to stuff pastries and dumplings, har gau being the Cantonese masterpiece of this specialized art of dim sum.

                              Shrimp Omelet

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
  8             ounces  fresh uncooked shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        washed, and cut bite-size pieces
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  6                     eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
  6                     Chinese dried mushrooms -- soaked 30 minutes,
                        stems discarded, caps cut julienne
     1/2           cup  bamboo shoots -- cut fine julienne
     1/2           cup  cooked peas
  1                cup  shredded scallions
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  light soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  oyster sauce
  1         tablespoon  Shaozing rice wine or dry sherry
                        Few drops of sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
     1/2           cup  cold water -- for thickening

Heat 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil in a wok over moderate heat.  Stir-fry the shrimp with the ginger and 1/4 teaspoon salt for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they turn pink and become bouncy.  Remove and set aside to cool. 

Beat the eggs with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper.  Add the cooked shrimp.  Assemble all of the other ingredients on a plate.  Have the seasonings mixture and the thickening nearby. 

Heat 3 tablespoons of the groundnut oil in a hot wok until just beginning to smoke.  Pour in the egg mixture, and cook over moderate heat, breaking the edges of the omelet with a spatula and tilting the wok to allow the soft center to run out.  There is no need to keep the eggs in one shape.  Continue to cook until the eggs are softly set and slightly brown on the outside.  Remove to a warm plate and place over a pot of hot water to keep warm while you make the sauce. 

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of the peanut oil to the wok over moderate heat.  SautÈ the mushrooms, bamboo shoots, peas, and the scallions for 1 minute.  Add the seasoning mixture and stir well.  Stir in the thickening.  Spoon over the omelet and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings. 

Comments:  As in every cuisine, eggs are the great standby.  Most Chinese households raise a few chickens and perhaps some ducks or geese.  The bonus, of course, is the eggs -- a valuable source of food for the family.  Eggs are added to soups and stir-fried dishes for extra substance and nutrition, and omelets of every description abound from region to region.  The following dish is one that would grace many family tables in South China, the shrimp (prawns) and the separate sauce marking the dish for special occasions.

                              Sichuan Beans

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  finely-ground pork
                        === FOR PORK MARINADE ===
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2            pinches  freshly-ground white pepper
  2               cups  groundnut/peanut oil
  1              pound  green beans, French beans -- topped and tailed
                        or Chinese yardlong (snake) beans -- snapped 4" lengths
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  dried shrimp (har mai) -- soaked 1 hour in
                        warm water, drained and minced
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1 1/2    tablespoons  preserved Sichuan vegetable (jar choi)
  2          teaspoons  chili bean paste
  1                     red chili pepper -- finely chopped,
                        for garnish

Place the ground pork in a bowl, add all of the marinade ingredients and mix well.  Set aside. 

Heat the groundnut oil in a wok until moderately hot.  Deep-fry the beans in 3 batches until the skins begin to wrinkle and the beans are softened (about 3 minutes).  Remove and drain well.  Pour off most of the oil from the wok, leaving about 1 tablespoon behind. 

Heat the remaining groundnut oil.  Add the pork and quickly stir-fry over high heat with the salt, dried shrimp, garlic, preserved Sichuan vegetable, and chili bean paste.  Stir-fry until the meat changes color from pink to white, about 2 minutes.  Return the beans to the wok and toss until well combined and heated through.  Serve, either hot or cold, garnished with the chopped red chili pepper. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  This unusual-shaped bean is an ancient Chinese vegetable.  It is a long (15-inch), thin, round bean, olive green in color with a "meatier" softer texture and stronger flavor than the green bean.  The southern Chinese eat the young bean whole or simply snapped in half.  The northerners use the vegetable dried. 

This is a famous Sichuan (Szechwan) recipe, in which the beans are first deep-fried, giving them a rich, deep flavor, and then combined with a spicy meat sauce.

                           Sichuan Chili Shrimp

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    medium-size fresh uncooked shrimp
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
                        === FOR THE BATTER ===
  1                cup  self-raising flour
     1/2           cup  cold water
  1           teaspoon  groundnut/peanut oil -- plus
                        Groundnut/peanut oil -- for deep frying
                        === FOR THE SICHUAN SAUCE ===
  3          teaspoons  light soy sauce
  3          teaspoons  dark soy sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  white vinegar
     3/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  chili sauce (available at Chinese stores)
  2          teaspoons  oyster sauce
     1/2    tablespoon  sliced garlic
                        Thumb-size piece of ginger -- peeled and sliced
  1                     red bell pepper -- cut into wedges
  2                     scallions, mainly white - (to 3) -- cut into 1" slices
  1           teaspoon  dried chili flakes
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- mixed in
                        a little cold water for thickening
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil

Shell the shrimp, leaving the tail intact.  Make an incision along the back of each shrimp and remove the black vein, being careful not to split the shrimp too deeply, because otherwise they will curl during cooking.  Wash the shrimp thoroughly under cold running water, and pat dry with paper towels.  Sprinkle with the salt and return to the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. 

Place under cold running water for 10 minutes, pat dry with paper towels and return to refrigerator again for a further hour.  This process helps to firm up the shrimp.  Dust all over lightly with cornstarch. 

Make the batter:  Mix the flour and water into a smooth batter that will hold onto the back of a wooden spoon.  Stir in the oil. 

Heat the peanut oil in a wok, until the oil just begins to smoke.  Dip the shrimp one at a time into the batter, wipe off the excess, and deep-fry until golden brown.  Set the shrimp aside. 

Combine the Sichuan sauce ingredients and set aside. 

Drain off the oil leaving 2 tablespoons of groundnut oil behind in the wok.  Heat the oil and sautÈ the garlic, ginger, bell peppers, scallions and the chili flakes for about 1 minute.  Add 1 cup of the Sichuan sauce and toss together over high heat for about 30 seconds.  Stir in the cornstarch thickening, add the shrimp to toss through and, finally, stir in the sesame oil to glaze. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  The people of Sichuan (Szechwan) like their dishes hot and spicy.  Pork, chicken and shrimp are almost always cooked until fragrant with Sichuan (Szechwan) peppercorns or sizzling with freshly crushed dried or fresh chilis. 

The interesting thing about many Sichuanese (Szechwanese) dishes such as this is that the spices are so integrated that the searing heat of the chilis is tempered by accompanying ingredients to create full-bodied flavors that are harmonious and well mannered as well as spicy hot.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Shell the shrimp, leaving the tail intact.  Make an incision along the back of each shrimp and remove the black vein, being careful not to split the shrimp too deeply, because otherwise they will curl during cooking.  Wash the shrimp thoroughly under cold running water, and pat dry with paper towels.  Sprinkle with the salt and return to the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Place under cold running water for 10 minutes, pat dry with paper towels and return to refrigerator again for a further hour.  This process helps to firm up the shrimp.  Dust all over lightly with cornstarch. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Make the batter:  Mix the flour and water into a smooth batter that will hold onto the back of a wooden spoon.  Stir in the oil. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Heat the peanut oil in a wok, until the oil just begins to smoke.  Dip the shrimp one at a time into the batter, wipe off the excess, and deep-fry until golden brown.  Set the shrimp aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Combine the Sichuan sauce ingredients and set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Drain off the oil leaving 2 tablespoons of groundnut oil behind in the wok.  Heat the oil and sautÈ the garlic, ginger, bell peppers, scallions and the chili flakes for about 1 minute.  Add 1 cup of the Sichuan sauce and toss together over high heat for about 30 seconds.  Stir in the cornstarch thickening, add the shrimp to toss through and, finally, stir in the sesame oil to glaze. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  The people of Sichuan (Szechwan) like their dishes hot and spicy.  Pork, chicken and shrimp are almost always cooked until fragrant with Sichuan (Szechwan) peppercorns or sizzling with freshly crushed dried or fresh chilis. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;The interesting thing about many Sichuanese (Szechwanese) dishes such as this is that the spices are so integrated that the searing heat of the chilis is tempered by accompanying ingredients to create full-bodied flavors that are harmonious and well mannered as well as spicy hot.

                          Sichuan Dry-Fried Beef

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Chinese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE SICHUAN SAUCE ===
  1 1/2      teaspoons  light soy sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dark soy sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  4 1/2    tablespoons  white vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  chili sauce (available at Chinese stores)
  1           teaspoon  oyster sauce (available at Chinese stores)
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  10            ounces  beef brisket -- cut 1/4" thick
                        by 2" long shreds
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch -- mixed with enough
                        cold water to form a paste
  4               cups  groundnut/peanut oil -- for deep-frying
  1           teaspoon  fine fresh chili julienne
  2              large  garlic cloves -- finely sliced
  2          teaspoons  shredded scallions (spring onions)
  1         tablespoon  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry

Make the Sichuan sauce:  Combine all of the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl and mix until thoroughly combined.  Set aside. 

Mix about three-quarters of the egg into the shredded beef.  Sprinkle in the 1 tablespoon of cornstarch; then, work in a little of the cornstarch paste with the fingers.  Add the remaining egg and the remaining cornstarch paste, kneading them into the beef with the fingers. 

Heat the groundnut oil until moderately hot and deep-fry the beef, using a long fork or chopsticks to keep the shredded pieces separate.  Continue cooking until the beef is very crisp and brown (3 to 4 minutes).  Remove the beef from the oil with a slotted spoon, drain well and set aside. 

Drain off the oil from the wok, leaving a film of oil behind.  Reheat the wok until hot and stir-fry the chilis, garlic, and the scallions briefly.  Return the beef to the wok and quickly combine all of the ingredients well over high heat.  Pour in the rice wine, and stir in the Sichuan sauce.  Maintaining fairly high heat, toss the beef for a few seconds, until the sauce forms a velvety coating over the beef.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  The Han Chinese eat beef sparingly, if at all, in some parts of China.  In South China, the cow or ox is a hardworking member of the family, and is eaten only after no more use can be found for the animal. 

In the northern and neighboring provinces, China was host to a large Muslim population (in the sixteenth century AD).  Muslims do not eat pork and cultivated instead, a liking for beef. 

This classic beef dish from Sichuan (Szechwan) is so admired that it is featured in leading restaurants all over China and overseas.  The technique of deep-frying followed by dry sizzling heat in the wok is a Sichuanese chef's particular skill.  The preparation and the precise blending of spices make this one of China's most memorable dishes.

                Sichuan Grilled Eggplant And Spinach Salad

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Salads/Dressings
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     Asian eggplants (aubergines) -- abt 6" long ea
                        (or 1 large globe eggplant, abt 1 lb)
                        Peanut oil
                        === SICHUAN SESAME DRESSING ===
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (1" long) -- peeled and grated
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  dark soy sauce
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Asian sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  chili oil -- or to taste
     1/2           cup  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  fresh spinach -- carefully washed,
                        and stemmed
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds
  1         tablespoon  chopped green (spring) onion
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro (fresh coriander)

Preheat a gas grill to medium-high heat or prepare a fire in a charcoal grill.  If using Asian eggplants, cut lengthwise into slices 1/4-inch thick.  If using globe eggplant, cut crosswise into slices 1/4-inch thick.  Lightly score the flesh with a large crosshatch pattern.  Brush lightly on both sides with peanut oil.  Place the slices on the hot grill and grill, turning once, until the slices are tender, spongy and have light grill marks, about 4 minutes.  Transfer to a plate to cool, then cut into strips 1/4-inch wide by 2 inches long.  Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate. 

To make the Sichuan sesame dressing, in a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the 2 tablespoons peanut oil.  When hot, add the ginger and garlic and sautÈ gently until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute.  Stir in the salt, sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil and chili oil; simmer for 15 seconds.  Stir in the chicken stock.  Remove from the heat and let cool. 

Arrange the spinach leaves on a platter and set aside. 

In a small, dry saucepan over medium heat, toast the sesame seeds until golden and fragrant, about 3 minutes.  Set aside. 

Add the green onion, cilantro and cooled dressing to the eggplant and toss to mix well.  Scatter the eggplant over the spinach, then refrigerate until well chilled.  Sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds just before serving. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Traditionally, the eggplant is steamed for this recipe; grilling, however, produces a firmer texture and enhances its natural flavor.  Both methods result in a delicious side-dish salad.  To assemble a more substantial meal, add shredded poached chicken or julienned grilled red peppers (capsicums).

                         Sichuan Pork And Peanuts

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR PORK MARINADE ===
                        A little egg white
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  cold water
  1              pound  pork tenderloin fillet -- cut into 3/4" dice
     1/4           cup  groundnut/peanut oil
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced
  3             slices  fresh ginger
  1                     onion -- cut into 3/4" dice
  1                     red bell pepper -- cut into 3/4" dice
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
  1 1/2    tablespoons  light soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  chili bean paste
                        (available at Chinese stores)
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  brown bean paste (min si jeung) -- (optional)
     1/2           cup  roasted or deep-fried unsalted peanuts

Combine the pork marinade ingredients, add the pork, and coat well.  Set aside while you prepare the other ingredients. 

Heat 2 tablespoons of groundnut oil in a wok until the oil is just beginning to smoke.  Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry for a few moments.  Add the diced onion and red bell pepper and toss for a few seconds.  Remove to a plate. 

Wipe out the wok, add 2 tablespoons of groundnut oil and heat until the oil begins to smoke.  Stir-fry the pork until it changes color (about 2 to 3 minutes).  Stir in the sauce ingredients to combine well with the pork.  Return the onion and bell pepper mixture to the wok and toss together quickly and thoroughly.  Add the peanuts and mix. 

Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  In China, the pig has been aptly described as nothing more than a huge dish that walks while waiting to be served -- a saying that could well have originated in the great western province of Sichuan (Szechwan), where pork dishes truly excel. 

The nicely integrated flavors of this pork dish typify the spirit of Sichuanese cooking, with the added appeal, not always present in dishes from this area, of crisp, sparkling color and shapes.  Groundnuts (peanuts), indigenous here, lend greater local emphasis.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  In China, the pig has been aptly described as nothing more than a huge dish that walks while waiting to be served -- a saying that could well have originated in the great western province of Sichuan (Szechwan), where pork dishes truly excel. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;The nicely integrated flavors of this pork dish typify the spirit of Sichuanese cooking, with the added appeal, not always present in dishes from this area, of crisp, sparkling color and shapes.  Groundnuts (peanuts), indigenous here, lend greater local emphasis.

                              Sour Hot Soup

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  chopped scallions
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  Sichuan peppercorns (fagara) -- ground to a powder
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh or dried chiles
                        (or 1/2 tspn chili sauce)
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  cilantro in 1" lengths
                        === FOR PORK MARINADE ===
  1           teaspoon  light soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/2         pound  shoulder pork -- thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil
  8               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  bamboo shoots -- cut into julienne
  1         tablespoon  wood ear fungus -- soaked 30 minutes,
                        and rinsed
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch -- mixed with
                        a little cold water to make a paste
  3                     fresh bean curd cakes -- cut 1/2" julienne
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten

Place into a soup tureen the vinegar, soy sauce, scallions, sesame oil, ground peppercorns, chilis, ginger, and cilantro. 

Combine the pork marinade ingredients.  Add the pork slices and coat with the mixture.  Set aside for 20 minutes. 

Heat the oil in a stockpot.  Add the pork and stir-fry over medium heat until the pork changes color.  Remove the pork to a plate. 

Add the water, sugar and salt to the stockpot.  Bring to a boil.  Add the bamboo shoots, wood ear fungus and the cooked pork.  Simmer for 5 minutes. 

Stir in the cornstarch thickening until the soup boils and becomes a velvety consistency.  Add the bean curd.  Gently stir in the beaten eggs until the eggs float in soft tendrils.  Immediately pour over the ingredients in your serving tureen and serve. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 

Comments:  The tantalizing flavors in this soup make it one of the most famous of Sichuan's (Szechwan's) dishes.  It is a soup full of strong, jostling flavors, typifying the culinary uniqueness of this region, which stresses the Five Flavors -- hot (chili, peppery hot) sour, salty, sweet, nutty.  Originally a peasant soup, satisfying and filling, it is thick with bean curd, as Sichuan (Szechwan) is the home of the best bean curd in China.  Today, this soup is regarded as a classic international dish that emerged from this great culinary region of China.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE MARINADE ===
  1              large  egg white
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch
  1              pound  skinless boneless chicken breast meat -- cut into 1/2" dice
                        === FOR THE STIR-FRY ===
  2               cups  vegetable oil
     3/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2          teaspoons  balsamic or black Chinese vinegar

Add the red pepper flakes to flavor the oil and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then add the chicken, vinegar, soy sauce,and sugar, and heat for 1 minute.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Kirby cucumbers - (abt 1 lb)
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1             medium  garlic clove -- peeled, crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1 1/2    tablespoons  dark Chinese or Japanese sesame oil
  1                cup  rice vinegar
     2/3           cup  water
  6        tablespoons  sugar

Peel the cucumbers in alternating strips to make a striped pattern.  Slice the cucumbers lengthwise, scoop out the seeds with a spoon, and discard them.  Cut on the bias into 1/2-inch-wide slices.

                        cut crosswise diagonally into 1/2" slices
  1              small  red chili -- seeded, chopped fine
                        === FOR THE DRESSING ===
     1/4           cup  white vinegar
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  sesame oil

Mix all of the dressing ingredients together in a bowl.  Transfer the mixture to a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer over low heat until the sugar dissolves. 

Combine all of the vegetables in a bowl.  Pour on the dressing and toss thoroughly.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 to 2 hours. 

Arrange the salad in small saucers and serve as an appetizer to a Chinese meal. 

This recipe yields 10 small appetizer servings. 

Comments:  Every major region in China has its own distinctive pickled vegetables which often include garlic, chilis and ginger.  Chinese cabbage, pickled in brine and served in a ceramic container patterned with hollyhock flowers, was on the menu in 1754 for a meal prepared by the noted Chang Erh for Ch'ien-lung, a Ching dynasty emperor. 

Today, a pickled dish similar to this Spicy Sweet and Sour Salad is served as an appetite stimulant before banqueting.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Chinese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  3        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
  3             ounces  ground pork
  3             ounces  fresh uncooked shrimp (prawns) -- shelled, deveined,
                        and cut small bite-size pieces
  8             ounces  finely-sliced boneless chicken breast
  1                cup  finely-shredded celery
  1                cup  bean sprouts
     1/2           cup  finely-shredded bamboo shoots
  6                     Chinese dried mushrooms -- soaked 45 minutes,
                        stems removed, and finely shredded
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
     1/2      teaspoon  light soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- mixed in
     1/3           cup  cold water -- for thickening
                        === FOR THE SPRING ROLLS ===
  10                    spring roll wrappers - (abt 7" square)
                        (available ready-made at Chinese stores)
  1                     egg -- beaten
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- mixed in
  1         tablespoon  cold water -- to make a paste for
                        sealing the edges of the spring rolls
  4               cups  groundnut/peanut oil -- for deep-frying

Heat the 3 tablespoons of oil in a wok, and stir-fry the ground pork over high heat for 1 minute.  Add the shrimp and stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Add all of the remaining filling ingredients and cook for 1 minute.  Add the seasonings; then, stir in the thickening.  Discard any excess liquid; there should be only enough moisture to "cling" to the mixture. 

Spread 2 tablespoons of the filling evenly across the corner of a spring roll wrapper.  Fold in the sides and firmly roll up shaping as firm and as round as possible.  Moisten the edges of the sheet with a little of the cornstarch paste to seal the edges.  Continue filling the remaining wrappers in the same way, lay them on a plate, and cover with plastic wrap until ready to cook. 

Heat enough oil to cover the spring rolls to 375 degrees.  Deep-fry the rolls until crisp and golden brown (4 to 5 minutes).  Drain on paper towels.  The spring rolls can be kept warm in a low oven (250 degrees) with the oven door ajar until you have completed the deep-frying. 

This recipe yields 10 rolls. 

Comments:  The spring roll is a traditional Chinese festival food, eaten at Chinese New Year, which officially heralds the coming of spring.  The spring roll is basically a thin pancake-like wrapper encasing a mixture of meat and vegetables that is deep-fried until crisp and golden.  The fillings used in spring rolls vary throughout the regions of China, with each region claiming theirs as the best.

                          Steamed Fillet Of Sole

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     sole fillets - (abt 3/4 lb total)
  12                    snow peas
  12                    black mushrooms -- if dried,
                        soak in hot water 40 minutes or until soft
                        remove stems and discard
  2        tablespoons  finely-julienned fresh ginger
  2                     scallions -- cut into 2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry or rice wine
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/2    tablespoon  vegetable oil

Rinse the sole fillets and pat them dry with paper towels.  Cut each fillet in half lengthwise, then in half crosswise. 

In a large heat-proof plate with a raised rim, place the fillet pieces in one layer.  Distribute the snow peas and the mushrooms over the fillets.  Sprinkle with the ginger and scallions. 

In a small bowl, mix the sherry or rice wine, soy sauce, and the oil.  Pour the mixture over the fillets. 

In a shallow saucepan or skillet large enough to hold the plate, place a steamer rack that stands about 2 inches above the bottom.  Add 1 inch of water to the saucepan and bring to a boil.  Place the plate of fish on the steamer rack.  Cover the saucepan and steam the fish for 6 minutes over high heat. 

Carefully remove the plate from the saucepan.  There will be about 1/4 cup of liquid on the plate.  Spoon the liquid over the fish and serve. 

Note:  If you do not have a steamer rack, try a plate on top of three empty cans with both tops and bottoms removed.  Low tuna cans work extremely well. 

This recipe yields 2 servings. 

Comments:  The Shun Lee Dynasty was the first restaurant in New York City to introduce a refined Chinese cuisine to affluent uptown communities.  Prior to it's establishment, Chinese cooking of this quality had been primarily available only within Chinatown.  The preceeding recipe illustrates the Shun Lee approach to elegant and healthful cooking.

                 Steamed Fresh Shrimp In Black Bean Sauce

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh uncooked jumbo shrimp (king prawns) -- peeled and deveined
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  fermented black beans (dow see) -- rinsed, and
                        lightly mashed
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
     1/4           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  groundnut/peanut oil
                        Few drops Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
  2                     scallions -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
                        Cilantro sprigs -- for serving

Wash the shrimp thoroughly under cold running water, and pat dry with paper towels.  Place in the refrigerator to firm up. 

Mix the black bean sauce ingredients together and place in a bowl.  Arrange the shrimp on a plate ready for steaming, and pour the black bean sauce evenly over them. 

Place a round cake rack or steaming rack into a wok, pour in enough boiling water to come up to but not over the rack.  Place the plate of shrimp on the rack and cover with the wok lid.  Reduce the heat to maintain a steady steam, and steam for 6 to 7 minutes until pink and firm to the touch.  Remove.  Sprinkle the chopped scallions over the shrimp. 

Heat the 2 tablespoons peanut oil to smoking point in a small saucepan (being careful to stay with the pot while it is heating up).  Pour the smoking oil quickly over the entire plate of shrimp to sizzle the sauce.  (It is a good idea to take the plate of shrimp over to the pot of oil.) 

Arrange the shrimp side by side on an oval plate, and garnish with the sprigs of cilantro. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Of all China's shellfish, perhaps shrimp (prawns) are eaten more than any other kind.  There seems to be an almost inexhaustible supply for fishermen along China's extensive coastline, swift rivers, enormous lakes and little canals. 

The Cantonese are hard to beat when it comes to steaming fish and shellfish.  Two subtle hallmarks of the fastidious Cantonese cook -- subtle seasoning and critical timing -- are exemplified in this dish.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Wash the shrimp thoroughly under cold running water, and pat dry with paper towels.  Place in the refrigerator to firm up. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Mix the black bean sauce ingredients together and place in a bowl.  Arrange the shrimp on a plate ready for steaming, and pour the black bean sauce evenly over them. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Place a round cake rack or steaming rack into a wok, pour in enough boiling water to come up to but not over the rack.  Place the plate of shrimp on the rack and cover with the wok lid.  Reduce the heat to maintain a steady steam, and steam for 6 to 7 minutes until pink and firm to the touch.  Remove.  Sprinkle the chopped scallions over the shrimp. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Heat the 2 tablespoons peanut oil to smoking point in a small saucepan (being careful to stay with the pot while it is heating up).  Pour the smoking oil quickly over the entire plate of shrimp to sizzle the sauce.  (It is a good idea to take the plate of shrimp over to the pot of oil.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Arrange the shrimp side by side on an oval plate, and garnish with the sprigs of cilantro. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 6 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Of all China&apos;s shellfish, perhaps shrimp (prawns) are eaten more than any other kind.  There seems to be an almost inexhaustible supply for fishermen along China&apos;s extensive coastline, swift rivers, enormous lakes and little canals. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;The Cantonese are hard to beat when it comes to steaming fish and shellfish.  Two subtle hallmarks of the fastidious Cantonese cook -- subtle seasoning and critical timing -- are exemplified in this dish.

                           Steamed Pork Baskets

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Dim Sum
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  siu mai wrappers or wonton wrappers -- (about 48 wrappers)
                        Vegetable oil
                        === FILLING ===
  4                     dried Chinese black mushrooms -- soaked in warm water
                        to cover for 30 minutes
  1              pound  coarsely-chopped pork butt
     3/4         pound  shrimp (prawns) -- peeled, deveined,
                        patted dry and coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped bamboo shoots
  1 1/2    tablespoons  light soy sauce
     1/4           cup  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Asian sesame oil

To make the filling, remove the mushrooms from the water and squeeze dry.  Cut off the stems and discard.  Finely chop the caps and place in a bowl.  Add the pork, shrimp, bamboo shoots, soy sauce, chicken stock, cornstarch, salt, sugar, white pepper and sesame oil.  Stir to mix well.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or as long as overnight. 

Place 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle of a wrapper.  (If using wonton wrappers, trim the corners with scissors to make rounds.)  Bring the edges of the wrapper up and around the filling.  With your index finger and thumb, pinch tiny pleats around the sides to form a straight-sided fluted basket.  Tap down the filling to firm it up and leave the top open-faced.  Wrap your index finger around the midsection to give the basket a waist, then tap the bottom of the dumpling against the countertop so that it flattens slightly and can stand on its own.  Set on a baking sheet, cover with a sheet of waxed paper and continue making the dumplings with the remaining wrappers and filling. 

Bring a wok half full of water to a boil.  Grease the bottom of a bamboo steaming basket or a heatproof plate with vegetable oil.  Arrange the dumplings in the basket or on the plate, keeping them separate.  Set the steaming basket in the wok or the plate on a rack in the wok; cover and steam over (not touching) the boiling water for 15 minutes. 

Remove the basket or plate from the steamer and serve the dumplings hot or at room temperature.  Store any leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.  Reheat by steaming for 5 minutes or place in a microwave for 1 minute on high power. 

This recipe yields about 48 dumplings. 

Comments:  These tasty dumplings are among the most popular and quickest selling of all Chinese appetizers, a fact that has earned them the name siu mai, or "cook-and-sell" dumplings.  Except for their round shape, the thin dough sheets used for making them are identical to square wonton wrappers, which may be substituted.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Chinese
                Dim Sum

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water
     1/4           cup  superfine sugar
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  self-rising flour
  3          teaspoons  butter -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3          teaspoons  grated peeled fresh ginger
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  oyster sauce
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil
  3          teaspoons  cornstarch -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  water
  8             ounces  Chinese barbecue pork -- finely chopped
  6                     scallions (shallots/spring onions) -- finely chopped

To make dough, in a small bowl combine yeast with 2 tablespoons warm water, 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour.  Mix until well combined.  Cover with a kitchen towel and let stand in a warm place until frothy, about 15 minutes. 

Sift remaining all-purpose and self-rising flour into a large bowl.  Add remaining sugar, yeast mixture, remaining warm water, and melted butter.  Using a wooden spoon, mix to form a soft dough.  Turn out onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 3 to 5 minutes.  Place dough in a large oiled bowl, cover and let stand in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. 

To make filling, heat oil in a wok or frying pan over medium heat and fry ginger and garlic until aromatic, about 1 minute.  Add hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, soy sauce and sesame oil.  Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the cornstarch and water mixture, bring to a boil and stir until sauce thickens, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in pork and scallions.  Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool completely. 

Punch down dough.  Turn out onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes.  Divide dough into 16 pieces and roll or press out each piece to form a 2 1/4-inch circle.  Cover dough with a damp kitchen towel.  Working with one round of dough at a time, spoon 2 teaspoons of filling into the center.  Gather edges together, twist to seal and cover with a kitchen towel.  Repeat with remaining dough. 

Cut out 16 squares of parchment (baking paper) and place buns, sealed-side down, on paper.  Half fill a medium wok with water (steamer should not touch water) and bring to a boil.  Working in batches, arrange buns in steamer, cover and place steamer over boiling water.  Steam for 15 minutes, adding more boiling water to wok when necessary. 

Lift steamer off wok and carefully remove buns.  Using scissors, snip the top of each bun twice, to resemble a star.  Serve warm with soy sauce and hoisin sauce. 

This recipe yields 16 buns.

                          Steamed Pork Dumplings

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Chinese
                Dim Sum

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
     1/2         pound  fresh ground pork -- (should be fatty)
  3             ounces  fresh uncooked (green) shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and minced
  3             ounces  water chestnuts -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped bamboo shoots
  1                cup  finely-chopped scallions
     1/2           cup  minced celery
                        === FOR THE SEASONING ===
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  light soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1            package  won ton wrappers (large size) -- about 32 wrappers
                        === FOR THE DIP ===
     1/2           cup  light soy sauce
     1/4           cup  sesame oil

Mix together all of the filling ingredients in a bowl.  Add all of the seasonings ingredients.  It is a good idea to chill the filling for at least 30 minutes before wrapping. 

Hold a wrapper in the palm of your left hand, and place 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper.  Wrap the sides up and around, squeezing the skin close to the filling.  The top of the wrapper gathers naturally into pleats.  Gently push the filling down from the top to pack the "flower pot" firmly adding extra filling if needed.  The filling should be seen above the wrapper.  Flatten the base slightly. 

Place the sieu mai in a lightly oiled steamer basket, and steam for 15 to 20 minutes.  Serve with the soy and sesame dip. 

This recipe yields about 30 dumplings. 

Comments:  Teahouses became fashionable in the southern provinces during the Song dynasty (AD 960-1279), catering for the leisurely patrons of the arts of the time.  Tea-drinking was an art, accompanied by much dainty nibbling of appetizers.  The word for appetizer is dim sum, literally meaning "dot the heart."  A large teahouse in China could list more than 1,000 dim sum varieties.  Sieu mai is one of the original "dot hearts" that was destined to become famous throughout the Western world.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Mix together all of the filling ingredients in a bowl.  Add all of the seasonings ingredients.  It is a good idea to chill the filling for at least 30 minutes before wrapping. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Hold a wrapper in the palm of your left hand, and place 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper.  Wrap the sides up and around, squeezing the skin close to the filling.  The top of the wrapper gathers naturally into pleats.  Gently push the filling down from the top to pack the &quot;flower pot&quot; firmly adding extra filling if needed.  The filling should be seen above the wrapper.  Flatten the base slightly. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Place the sieu mai in a lightly oiled steamer basket, and steam for 15 to 20 minutes.  Serve with the soy and sesame dip. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields about 30 dumplings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Teahouses became fashionable in the southern provinces during the Song dynasty (AD 960-1279), catering for the leisurely patrons of the arts of the time.  Tea-drinking was an art, accompanied by much dainty nibbling of appetizers.  The word for appetizer is dim sum, literally meaning &quot;dot the heart.&quot;  A large teahouse in China could list more than 1,000 dim sum varieties.  Sieu mai is one of the original &quot;dot hearts&quot; that was destined to become famous throughout the Western world.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Chinese
                Dim Sum

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE DUMPLINGS ===
     1/2         pound  center-cut cod fillet
  1              large  egg
     1/4         pound  medium raw shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
     1/3           cup  minced water chestnuts
  2                     scallions, white and green parts -- finely minced
     1/4      teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  35                    wonton wrappers - (abt 3" dia)
  3              large  Chinese cabbage or lettuce leaves - (to 4)
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh coriander leaves
     1/8      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes -- (optional)

To make the dumplings:  Process the cod and egg in a food processor to a smooth puree.  Add the shrimp and pulse on and off so the shrimp are coarsely chopped with the fish.  Transfer the fish mixture to a medium bowl and mix in the ginger, water chestnuts, and scallions.  Season the dumpling filling with the coriander, soy sauce and pepper. 

Dust a baking sheet with cornstarch or line it with parchment.  Place 2/3 tablespoon of the dumpling filling on the upper half of a won ton wrapper.  Fold the skin over the filling and pinch together at the center of the edge.  Make 3 small pleats in the side of the skin facing you, to the right side of the center point, and then 3 more on the left side, to seal the dumpling.  Press the dumpling skin edges firmly together to seal.  Place the dumplings on the prepared sheet pan.  Repeat with the remaining filling and won ton wrappers.  The dumplings are ready to be steamed, or they can be refrigerated up to 24 hours before steaming. 

To make the sauce:  Mix all the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl. 

Line a steamer basket with the cabbage leaves.  Set the dumplings in the steamer basket, about 1/2-inch apart.  Steam the dumplings in batches if necessary.  (If you have a stacking-style steamer, you can steam multiple trays of dumplings at one time.)  Place the steamer basket over a pan of boiling water and steam the dumplings for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the filling is completely cooked and the wrapper is tender.  Transfer the dumplings to a serving plate with the dipping sauce and serve. 

This recipe yields 35 dumplings.

                            Steamed Spareribs

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
  2        tablespoons  fermented black beans (dow see) -- rinsed under
                        cold water, drained, and roughly chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  Family Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
  2          teaspoons  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce
  1              pound  pork spareribs -- chopped through in
                        sections between the ribs
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2                     fresh red chili peppers -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro (fresh coriander)

Heat the groundnut oil in a hot wok.  Add the black beans, salt, and sugar, and sautÈ gently for 10 seconds.  Add the chicken broth, rice wine, and light soy sauce.  Simmer together for 30 seconds.  Remove the sauce to a mixing bowl.  Add the spareribs and set aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes. 

Add the cornstarch and mix well to coat the spareribs.  Place the ribs on a plate ready for steaming.  Sprinkle on the red chili peppers, garlic, and cilantro.  Steam over boiling water for 45 minutes. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  The Chinese word for "home" is written as a combination of a roof over a pig.  The household that boasts a pig or, better still, several pigs, is a lucky one.  Pigs represent a certain security against poverty, always fetching a good price at the market. 

Spareribs, apart from being an economical way to enjoy China's favorite meat, are enjoyed for their good flavor, particularly when teamed with a robust sauce made from the salted black soy bean. 

This is a family dish found commonly in rural southern China.  It is interesting to see this home-style dish included and enjoyed in the yum cha menus of today.

Cut the sausage on the diagonal into thin slices.  Place the slices on a heatproof plate and set the plate in a bamboo steaming basket over (not touching) boiling water in a wok or on a rack in a steamer.  Cover the basket or steamer and steam until glossy and plump, about 10 minutes.  Remove from over the water and let cool.  Set aside. 

In a bowl, combine the soy sauces, oyster sauce, sugar and white pepper.  Stir well and set aside.  Gently pull apart and separate the strands of noodles; set aside. 

Preheat a wok, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat.  Add the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the garlic and sautÈ until a light golden brown, about 1 minute.  Raise the heat to high and add the shallots, chicken, shrimp, green onions, chilies and bok choy.  Stir-fry until the ingredients are almost fully cooked, about 1 1/2 minutes. 

Add the reserved noodles and sauce mixture to the wok; toss until the noodles are evenly coated.  Add the reserved sausage, bean sprouts, and the mussels or clams.  Stir-fry until the sprouts begin to wilt, about 1 minute.  Push the mixture up the side of the wok and crack the egg directly into the center of the pan.  Stir to scramble the egg lightly and let it set slightly, then gently fold the egg into the noodles.  Continue tossing until the egg is fully cooked and little bits of scrambled egg intermingle with the noodles.  Taste and adjust the seasonings, if necessary.  Transfer to a platter and serve hot. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  A well-seasoned wok and intense high heat are the secret ingredients to this Malaysian favorite.  In the home kitchen, a nonstick wok is best for cooking fresh rice noodles, which are particularly delicate and stick together easily.  Purchase the noodles at a Chinese market and try to use them the same day.

                          Supreme Chicken Broth

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Chinese
                Poultry                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  chicken
  1              pound  shoulder or loin of pork
  2                     scallions, white part only -- kept whole
  2             ounces  fresh ginger -- peeled, and
                        slightly crushed
  2        tablespoons  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry

Place the whole chicken and the pork in a stockpot, and add cold water just to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat; skim off the impurities.  Add the scallions, ginger and rice wine.  Lower the heat, cover and simmer for 2 hours. 

Remove the solid ingredients.  Pull the cooked chicken breasts off the bones; discard all of the solids.  Lightly mash the chicken breasts and reserve them.  Strain the broth through dampened gauze or fine-mesh cheesecloth.  Allow the broth (stock) to cool to room temperature. 

To make the broth, add the mashed chicken breasts to the cooled broth.  Place over high heat and stir steadily in one direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise, but do not change direction) until boiling.  Lower the heat and let the broth boiling gently for 15 minutes. 

Any remaining impurities in the broth will adhere to the chicken breast.  Remove, and strain the broth again.  Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.  It is useful to freeze any unused broth. 

This recipe yields 12 cups. 

Comments:  In Guangdong (Kwangtung) province in the South of China, there is a saying that "Broth to a cook is voice to a singer." 

As early as 1716, Li Yu, one of the best-known gourmets in Chinese literature, wrote:  "As long as there is rice there should be soup.  The relationship between soup and rice is like that between water and a boat.  When a boat is stranded on a sandbank, only water can wash it back to the river, rice goes down much better with soup.  I would go as far as to say that it would be better to go without all main dishes than to have no soup!"

                           Sweet And Sour Pork

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR PORK MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
  1              pound  pork shoulder or loin (fillet) -- cut into 1" pieces
                        === FOR THE COATING ===
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3                     egg yolks -- lightly beaten
                        === FOR THE VEGETABLES ===
  1             medium  carrot -- cut 1" triangles
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- cut 1" triangles
  1             medium  green bell pepper -- cut 1" triangles
  1             medium  white onion -- cut 1" triangles
  1                cup  pineapple pieces -- canned or fresh
     1/2           cup  Chinese mixed pickles
                        (available at Chinese stores)
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  white vinegar
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
  3        tablespoons  tomato ketchup
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch - (rounded)
     1/4           cup  pineapple juice
  4               cups  groundnut/peanut oil -- for deep frying

Combine the pork marinade ingredients and stir to coat the pork well.  Set aside while you prepare the remaining ingredients. 

Combine the two flours of the coating ingredients.  Lightly dry off the pork with some of the mixed flours.  Add the egg yolks, mix through to coat all of the meat, and then roll each piece of the pork into the remaining flours.  Set aside on a plate. 

Note:  Once the flour and the egg yolks have been applied to the meat, you must proceed with the deep-frying fairly soon thereafter. 

Blanch the carrot in boiling water for 2 minutes.  Assemble all of the vegetables on a plate. 

Mix the sauce ingredients in a bowl.  Combine the cornstarch and pineapple juice in another bowl. 

Working in 3 batches and separating the pork pieces, deep-fry the pork pieces in moderately hot groundnut oil in a wok until crisp and light golden, about 3 minutes.  Remove with a skimmer and drain on paper towels.  When you are ready for the second deep-frying, turn up the heat and refry in the hot oil for 2 minutes.  This time the meat pieces can go all in together. 

Drain off the oil, and wipe out the wok.  Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil to moderate.  Stir-fry the carrot, bell pepper, and onion for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the pineapple and pickles and quickly combine.  Add the sauce and stir for 1 minute.  Stir in the pineapple juice mixture until the vegetables are lightly coated with the sauce. 

Return the pork to the wok, and over high heat "marry" all the ingredients for 1 minute.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  The "Five Tastes" (sour, bitter, sweet, piquant or hot, and salt) play a unique role in the culture of Chinese cuisine in both the North and the South. 

Many sauces combining sweet and sour tastes have developed over the passage of time.  They are often teamed with meats, eggs and vegetables, although it is interesting to note that traditionally sweet and sour was almost exclusively reserved for fish dishes. 

The above dish has probably become one of the most renowned dishes outside its place of origin in southern China.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  tea leaves (your favorite type)
  4                     eggs
  2          teaspoons  dark soy sauce
  1              whole  star anise

Make a pot of tea in a 4-cup pot with the tea leaves. 

Boil the eggs in water to cover for 4 minutes.  Cool, then crack the shells all over by rolling the eggs across a work surface, or tapping the shells with the back of a metal spoon. 

Transfer the pot of tea, the dark soy and the star anise to a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Place the cracked eggs in the pot, cover, and cook gently for about 10 minutes.  Turn the eggs in the pot to color evenly.  Soak in the tea mixture for another 5 minutes.  Remove, cool and shell the eggs. 

The tea imparts an unusual flavor to the eggs, and the cracked shells allow the tea to seep through, producing a lovely marbled effect. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This unusual treatment of the egg is one of the many ways this valuable foodstuff is utilized.  Like soy sauce eggs, tea leaf eggs are served mainly cold, mostly as a snack food or sometimes as part of a cold selection of appetizers at the start of dinner.  Tea leaf eggs not only have a most unusual flavor, they look quite marvelous, with an elegant marbled appearance.

                            Wonton Noodle Soup

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === EGG NOODLES ===
                        Salt -- as needed
     1/2         pound  fresh Chinese egg noodles
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
                        === WONTONS ===
     1/2         pound  shrimp (prawns) -- peeled and deveined
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarse salt
     3/4         pound  medium-grind (minced) pork butt
  1         tablespoon  Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
  2          teaspoons  light soy sauce
  1                     green (spring) onion -- minced
  2        tablespoons  minced drained canned bamboo shoots
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
                        A big pinch freshly-ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  60                    wonton wrappers
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten
                        === SOUP ===
  6               cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
                        Light soy sauce -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  Asian sesame oil
                        Salt -- to taste
  1              pound  bok choy -- cut into 2" lengths
  1                     green (spring) onion -- chopped

Bring a large pot three-fourths full of water to a boil and salt it lightly.  Gently pull the strands of noodles apart, then drop them into the boiling water, stirring to separate the strands.  Bring to a second boil and cook for 1 minute longer.  Pour the noodles into a colander and rinse thoroughly with cold running water.  Drain well and transfer to a large bowl.  Toss with the oil to keep the strands from sticking together. 

To prepare the wontons, rinse the shrimp with cold water.  Drain.  Place in a bowl, add 1 teaspoon of the salt and toss well; set aside for 10 minutes.  Rinse the shrimp in cold water again; drain thoroughly, pat dry and chop coarsely. 

In a bowl, mix together the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, the shrimp, pork, wine or sherry, soy sauce, green onion, bamboo shoots, sugar, white pepper, sesame oil and cornstarch. 

To wrap the dumplings, work with 1 wrapper at a time, keeping unused wrappers covered with a kitchen towel.  Place 1 heaping teaspoon of filling in the center of a wrapper.  Moisten the wrapper edges with water and fold in half to form a triangle, enclosing the filling.  Bring the two long ends up and over to meet and slightly overlap over the top of the filling.  Moisten where the edges overlap with egg white and press together to seal.  Set on a baking sheet and cover with another kitchen towel.  Continue to form dumplings until all the filling has been used.  Set aside 3 dozen dumplings for this dish; wrap the remainder and any unused wrappers in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 2 months. 

To assemble the soup, in a saucepan, heat the chicken stock and season with the sugar, soy sauce and sesame oil.  At the same time, bring a large pot three-fourths full of water to a boil, salt lightly and add the bok choy.  Boil for 1 minute; then, using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer to a bowl and set aside.  When the stock is hot, drop in the noodles for a few seconds to reheat.  Using the spoon or tongs, scoop out the noodles and divide them among 6 warmed deep soup bowls; keep warm. 

Drop 3 dozen wonton dumplings into the boiling water.  Cook until they float to the top, about 3 minutes.  Using the spoon, scoop out the dumplings and place approximately 6 dumplings in each bowl.  Top with the bok choy and ladle over the hot stock.  Garnish with the green onion and serve hot. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Although this ubiquitous Chinese soup is served in every conceivable venue from food stalls to fancy restaurants, the best versions are generally found in the simplest settings.

Recipe By     :Elizabeth Chong, "The Heritage of Chinese Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Rice/Grains


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR MUSHROOM MARINADE ===
  1           teaspoon  light soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        Few drops sesame oil
  6                     Chinese dried mushrooms -- soaked 30 minutes,
                        stems discarded, and caps diced
  6        tablespoons  groundnut/peanut oil
  4                     eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  diced boneless chicken breast
     1/2           cup  diced uncooked peeled deveined shrimp
     1/2           cup  diced Chinese barbecued pork (char sieu)
                        or ham
  4                     scallions -- chopped
  4                cup  long-grain white rice -- boiled and chilled
     1/2           cup  frozen green peas
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Generous pinch freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry

For the Rich Fry, put fried pickled meat over rice that has been grown on a dry soil, and then enrich it with melted fat.  This is called the Rich Fry.  For the Similar Fry, put fried pickled meat over the millet grains and enrich it with melted fat.  This is called the Similar Fry. 

Combine the mushroom marinade ingredients, add the soaked and sliced mdushrooms and set aside to marinate. 

Meanwhile, heat a wok and add 1 tablespoon of the groundnut oil.  Tilt the wok so that the oil swirls around the sides of wok, and heat until slightly hazy. 

Pour in half of the beaten eggs, tilting the wok so that a thin omelet is formed.  Remove to cool, then cut into 1/4-inch shreds. 

Add 2 tablespoons of the groundnut oil to the wok, and when it begins to smoke, add the chicken and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the shrimp and cook for 1 minute.  Add the barbecued pork, and cook for 1 minute.  Toss together, then remove and set aside with the omelet. 

Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of groundnut oil, swirling the oil to coat the wok.  Add the mushrooms and half of the scallions and stir-fry for about 1 minute.  Return the meats to the wok and combine.  Push the ingredients to the sides of the wok to make a hollow.  Stir in the remaining eggs, and when the eggs are semi-cooked, add the rice. 

Fry the rice until hot, stir and gently press out all the lumps, while the eggs are being turned and combine with the rice.  Add the peas, salt, pepper, soy sauce, and wine.  Continue to stir-fry over high heat for another minute.  Toss through the remaining scallions. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  The people of Yangzhou (Yangchow) have many variations of this dish.  One of them has a generous amount of shrimp (prawns), and small pieces of meat, such as chicken and pork.  The Cantonese, although notoriously reluctant to adopt customs and dialects of neighboring provinces, have enthusiastically taken this recipe over as their own, and have created a classic rice dish.
