  1           teaspoon  McCormick Gourmet Collection ground cumin
  2                     McCormick Gourmet Collection bay leaves

     1/4           cup  butter or margarine - (1/2 stick)
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1                can  chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz)

  3        tablespoons  sliced green onion

Melt butter in large saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion; cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 to 2 minutes or until tender.  Stir in flour.  Gradually stir in broth and evaporated milk.
