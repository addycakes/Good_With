--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  achiote paste

  1           teaspoon  toasted cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  Mexican oregano
  2                     poussins or baby chickens
  4              large  hard dried Spanish chorizo links
  1                     Spanish onion -- diced
  5        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1              bunch  mustard greens -- cleaned, trimmed,
                        and roughly chopped
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
  1                     baking potato, like russet -- peeled, diced,

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COOKIE ===
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  3              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  lemon extract
  1 1/2           cups  milk
                        === FROSTING ===
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup
  2               cups  sugar
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  hot water
  2        tablespoons  unsweetened Dutch processed cocoa
  2        tablespoons  hot coffee

The Cookies:  Set 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.

In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar together for 15 seconds until smooth.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating until each is incorporated.  Add the vanilla and lemon extracts and continue beating until fluffy, about 2 minutes.

With the mixer on its slowest setting, gradually beat in 1/2 of the flour mixture.  Beat in the milk and then the remaining flour mixture.

On nonstick or parchment lined cookie sheets, drop 1/2-cup mounds of dough at 4-inch intervals.  Bake the cookies for about 11 minutes, turning once for even baking, until the cookies are lightly tanned.  Set the cookie sheets on a rack to cool.

The Frosting:  Fit a heavy-bottomed saucepan with a candy thermometer.  Over high heat, cook the water, corn syrup, sugar and cream of tartar until it registers 240 degrees (soft ball).

Off heat, vigorously whisk in the confectioners' sugar, vanilla and hot water until creamy looking.

Quickly spread half of the icing on 1/2 of each cookie.  Whisk the cocoa and hot coffee into the remaining icing.  Spread it on the other halves of the cookies.  Let set for 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 1 dozen big cookies.

     1/4         pound  chorizo sausage -- skinned, and
                        finely chopped
                        Bunuelo Dough
                        Oil -- for frying
                        === BUNUELOS DOUGH ===
  1                cup  water
  3        tablespoons  butter
     3/8      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  flour
  2                     eggs

Saute the chorizo in a skillet for a couple of minutes until it starts to give off its oil.  (Drain off some oil if there is a lot.)

To make the dough, place in a saucepan over medium heat the water, butter and salt.  When the water comes to a boil and the butter has melted, add the flour all at once.  Lower the heat and stir with a wooden spoon until the dough leaves the sides of the pan and forms a ball.  Continue cooking and stirring for 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn off the heat and beat in the eggs 1 at a time.  The dough will separate, then hold together again.  (This step may be done effortlessly in a food processor; once the flour has been added and forms a ball, transfer the dough to the processor.  Process for 15 seconds.  Add both eggs and beat for 45 seconds.)  Combine the Bunuelo dough with the chorizo.  (This can also be done in the processor.)  (May be prepared ahead.)

In a skillet heat the oil at least 1/2-inch deep to about 380 degrees.  Drop the dough by teaspoonfuls into the oil and fry over medium hear, turning occasionally, until puffed and golden.  Drain on paper towels.  (May be kept warm in 200 degree oven up to 30 minutes.)

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  1                     chorizo sausage - (abt 2 oz)
  12                    pitted dried dates
  3             slices  bacon -- cut into
                        quarters crosswise
                        Oil -- for frying
                        Flour -- for dusting
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water

Cut off ends of the chorizo and slice the sausage crosswise into 3 equal pieces, about 3/4-inch each in length (remove the skin if tough).  Cut each of these pieces in half lengthwise and in half again, to make a total of 12 "sticks."  (If your chorizo is thick, these pieces may be too large for the dates, in which case cut in half again.)

Insert each chorizo piece into a date and close the date around it.  Wrap a strip of bacon around each date.  Secure, if necessary, with a toothpick.  (May be prepared ahead.)

Place the wrapped dates in a skillet with the seam-side of the bacon down and saute until the bacon is golden.  Turn and brown on the other side.  Drain on paper towels.  You may now serve the dates, or proceed to coat and fry them.  If you are continuing, this step may also be done in advance.

Wipe out the skillet, then heat the oil at least 1/2-inch deep to about 380 degrees.  Dust the dates with flour, then dip them into the egg and immediately into the hot oil.  Fry until golden, turning once.  Or, better, use a deep-fryer.  Drain and serve right away.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE LAMB CHOPS ===
  4                     domestic loin lamb chops, 1 1/2" thick
  1           teaspoon  chopped rosemary
  1           teaspoon  chopped sage
  1           teaspoon  chopped thyme
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE POLENTA SALAD ===
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  polenta
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh garlic
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  baby arugula
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  white balsamic vinegar
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  garlic -- cut thin slivers
     1/2           cup  lamb stock*
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
                        Lemon juice

* Note:  Lamb stock is prepared in the same fashion as beef and chicken stock.  Consult your cookbook.

Combine herbs with a drizzle of olive oil and salt and pepper.  Rub onto chops.  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.

For the Polenta Salad:  Bring the stock to a boil.  Stir in polenta and lower heat.  Continue to stir until bubbling.  Add garlic, cheese, parsley and salt and pepper, to taste.  Stir well.  Pour into a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.

For the Sauce:  Warm olive oil over medium heat until hot but not smoking.  Remove from heat and add the garlic slivers.  Combine with the lamb stock, soy sauce and a few drops of lemon juice.  Keep warm.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

To assemble the plate, invert the polenta onto a cutting board and cut into 1-inch squares.  Grill or pan-roast the lamb chops to desired temperature, about 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare.  Warm the polenta "croutons" in the oven in a nonstick, ovenproof saute pan.  When hot, toss the croutons with the arugula, olive oil, vinegar and salt and pepper.

Arrange 2 lamb chops on each plate with some salad and spoon warm sauce over the meat.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIEROGIE DOUGH ===
  2               cups  flour
  4             ounces  sour cream
  2             ounces  butter -- softened
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FILLING ===
  2             pounds  Yukon gold potatoes -- peeled, quartered
  8             ounces  black truffle butter
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives
  1              pound  cleaned and diced lobster meat
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  butter

For the Pierogie Dough:  Place flour in bowl and form a well.  Add remaining ingredients and mix by hand.  Form in a ball, wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes.

Roll dough to 1/8-inch thick.  Cut dough into 2-inch circles.  Wrap and set aside.

Boil potatoes in salted water until tender and drain.  Place through ricer and fold in truffle butter and chives.  Fold in lobster meat.  Check seasoning.

To assemble:  Place a heaping teaspoon of the lobster mixture on half of each circle of dough.  Fold the circles in half to make half moon shapes and crimp the edges to seal.  Boil the pierogies in water until they float, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain.  Saute until golden brown in butter.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  very small sardines - (5" to 6" long) -- cleaned, with
                        heads, tails, and fins removed
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  oregano
  2                     bay leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Flour -- for dusting
                        Canola oil -- for frying
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten with
  2          teaspoons  water

Butterfly the sardines, leaving them joining at the back and pulling out the bone with your fingers.  In a shallow bowl large enough to hold the sardines, combine the water, vinegar, garlic, oregano, bay leaves, salt, and pepper.  Place the sardines skin-side up in this mixture and marinate for several hours, refrigerated.

Drain the sardines well on paper towels and fold them back together.  Dust with flour.

Heat the oil at least 1/2-inch deep to about 380 degrees.  Or, better, use a deep-fryer.  Coat the sardines with the beaten egg and place directly in the hot oil.  Fry until golden, drain, and serve.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Variation:  Sardines are also delicious without a marinade.  Simply coat with flour (not necessary to remove bones) and fry, or eliminate the flour and grill them.  Sprinkle with coarse salt.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  lemon juice
     1/4                olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

  2              whole  chickens -- quartered

Make marinade by combining lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper, and oregano.  Place chicken in a dish with tall sides and pour marinade over chicken.  Use spoon to baste chicken with marinade.  Refrigerate for 2 to 24 hours -- a longer marinade time will produce a more intense flavor.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Alex Garcia
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fresh ham - (6 to 8 lbs)
     1/4           cup  oregano
     3/4           cup  sour orange juice
     1/4           cup  chopped garlic
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  black beans
  5               cups  water
  1                     bay leaf
  1 1/2                 Italian peppers -- divided
                        = (1 diced, 1/2 in 1 piece)
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- diced
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled, divided
                        = (2 chopped, 2 crushed)
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano
  1              pound  white rice
                        Red wine vinegar -- to taste

First marinade the pork by combining the 1/4 cup oregano, sour orange juice, 1/4 cup garlic, 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper, to taste, and let it stand for 1 hour.

With a very sharp knife, cut ham across lengthwise exposing the bone.  Cut around the bone and remove it.  By making small cuts spread the ham until it is flat then trim into 4 equal rectangular shaped pieces.  Discard any excessive fat.  Season the meat with marinade and let sit for at least 2 hours, refrigerated.

Soak beans in water overnight.  Bring beans, bay leaf, and the 1/2 of pepper to a full boil.  Simmer until beans soften then strain and remove pepper.  Reserve the water (if necessary add more water to make 4 cups).

In a large pan saute 1 tablespoon olive oil, onion, diced pepper, chopped garlic and oregano until translucent.  Add the rice, beans, and water and bring to a boil.  Season to taste with salt.  Reduce heat and cook covered until rice is soft.

In a pan saute crushed garlic in the 4 tablespoons of olive oil until brown.  Remove the cloves and add them to the rice.  Season to taste with vinegar and let stand.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Place the rice in the middle of the ham and fold both ways until stuffing is fully covered.  Tie with string both lengthwise and across.  Place in a roasting pan and cook for 20 minutes per pound or until inside cavity reaches 150 degrees.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SOUR CREAM PASTRY ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  12       tablespoons  cold unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut into
                        pea-sized bits
     1/2           cup  sour cream
                        === DRIED FRUIT FILLING ===
  1                cup  pitted prunes
                        = (half of a 12-oz box)
     1/2           cup  prune juice
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1                cup  golden raisins
     1/2           cup  dried cherries
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped walnuts or pecans
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  water

Sour Cream Pastry:  Put the flour in the bowl of an electric mixer.  On slow, mix in the butter until it looks like very coarse meal.  Mix in the sour cream until it masses together to form a dough.  Pat into a rectangle, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight.

Dried Fruit Filling:   Coarsely chop the prunes.  In a small saucepan, cover the prunes with the prune juice and sugar.  Bring to a simmer for 3 minutes.  Place in a food processor with the vanilla and puree to a paste.  Mix in the raisins, cherries and walnuts.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a square 16 by 16 inches.  Place the filling in a log running along the bottom and roll up.  Pinch the ends closed.  Place on a parchment lined cookie sheet, seam-side down.

Mix the egg and water together to form a wash and paint the strudel.  Bake for 30 minutes until crisp and golden.  Let cool on a rack, then slice into 1 inch pieces.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This was my Grandma Bessie's baking specialty.  I haven't had this since she died but my brothers and I talk of it often, trying to re-construct what was in it.  I re-discovered it at the Golden Key in Brighton Beach.  Can be made on a rainy day with items in the pantry.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2             pounds  lean ground beef
     1/2           cup  chopped white onion
     1/2           cup  diced red bell pepper
     1/2           cup  diced yellow bell pepper

  4                     beef rib-eye steaks - (16 oz ea)
  1                can  chipotle adobo - (6 oz)
  4                     garlic cloves
  1                     lemon -- juiced

Heat up a pan with about 1-inch of oil.  Mix the remaining spice mix into 1 cup flour.  While the steaks are in the oven, dip the poblano and the onion rings in the buttermilk, and then dip into the seasoned flour.  Fry the rings in the heated oil, turning the rings on both sides until golden brown.

Arrange the steaks on a serving platter and top off with the onion and poblano rings.

Recipe By     :Alex Garcia
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  all-purpose flour
  3             ounces  powdered milk
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  baking powder
  4             ounces  solid vegetable shortening
  1                cup  ice water
                        Olive oil -- for frying, plus
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  9                     eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             medium  ripe plantains
  3              large  Spanish onions -- sliced
  2                     red peppers -- roasted, sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed garlic
  1           teaspoon  chopped cilantro

In a medium mixing bowl, sift together the flour, powdered milk, salt, and baking powder.  On a flat surface, make a well with the combined dry ingredients.  Place the shortening and 1 cup of water in the well.  Working your way inward, start to work the shortening and dry ingredients into a dough.  When dough is no longer sticky, cover with oiled plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 1 hour.

On flat floured surface, roll out the dough to a circle about 1/2-inch thick.  Using a 3-inch cookie cutter, cut round pieces from the dough.

Heat up about 2 inches of oil at 350 degrees, and then fry the dough for about 1 minute on each side until they puff.  Place in a warm oven only until the omelet is ready.

Whisk the eggs in a small bowl with a sprinkle each of salt and pepper.

Cut plantains on a bias and fry in very hot oil until golden on both sides, then remove from oil and set aside.

In a separate pan, saute 2 onions in 1 tablespoon of olive oil for about 2 minutes then add the fried plantains and pour the eggs in.  Turn the heat down to low and cook for about 8 minutes or until the top is almost thoroughly cooked.  Flip the omelet over and cook for about 6 more minutes.

Saute the remaining onion in 3 tablespoons of oil, add the roasted peppers, garlic, and cilantro.  Cook until tender then puree and season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Cut omelet into 4 equal quarters and serve on top of pepper sauce with the fried bread.

In a medium mixing bowl, sift together the flour, powdered milk, salt, and baking powder.  On a flat surface, make a well with the combined dry ingredients.  Place the shortening and 1 cup of water in the well.  Working your way inward, start to work the shortening and dry ingredients into a dough.  When dough is no longer sticky, cover with oiled plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On flat floured surface, roll out the dough to a circle about 1/2-inch thick.  Using a 3-inch cookie cutter, cut round pieces from the dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat up about 2 inches of oil at 350 degrees, and then fry the dough for about 1 minute on each side until they puff.  Place in a warm oven only until the omelet is ready.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk the eggs in a small bowl with a sprinkle each of salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut plantains on a bias and fry in very hot oil until golden on both sides, then remove from oil and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a separate pan, saute 2 onions in 1 tablespoon of olive oil for about 2 minutes then add the fried plantains and pour the eggs in.  Turn the heat down to low and cook for about 8 minutes or until the top is almost thoroughly cooked.  Flip the omelet over and cook for about 6 more minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Saute the remaining onion in 3 tablespoons of oil, add the roasted peppers, garlic, and cilantro.  Cook until tender then puree and season with salt and pepper, to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut omelet into 4 equal quarters and serve on top of pepper sauce with the fried bread.

Recipe By     :Wayne Harley Brachman

Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  rendered chicken fat (schmaltz) -- melted
     1/4           cup  chicken stock -- plus
  2             quarts  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  truffle oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4              large  eggs
  1                cup  matzoh meal
                        === SHIITAKE GRIBENES ===
                        Skin from 4 chicken thighs
  1              large  onion -- chopped large chunks
  2                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
  2             ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- cut in chunks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Mix together schmaltz, stock, truffle oil, salt, and eggs.  Thoroughly mix in matzo meal.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.  Form into golf balls and stuff with a teaspoon of shiitake gribenes in the center, and cook, covered, in 2 quarts of boiling chicken stock for 20 minutes until light as a feather but also heavy as a cannon ball.

You may substitute duck or goose schmaltz (not ortelon schmaltz, it's too bony).  You can use a little more salt, but it's not good for you.

For the Shiitake Gribenes:  Saute chicken skin until fat exudes and lightly golden.  Saute onion until deep golden brown.  Add garlic and saute for 2 minutes.  Strain to separate solids from oil and reserve both.  Saute mushrooms in 1 tablespoon of the oil in the pan until wilted.

Remove shiitakes and reserve for the matzoh balls.  Nosh on the gribenes, shmeared on rye bread.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                        === FILLING ===
  7 1/2           cups  ground walnuts
  2               cups  sugar
  5        tablespoons  honey
  2 1/2      teaspoons  anise seed -- toasted and ground
                        Oil -- for frying
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for decorating

Make the pastry dough:  Combine the flour and the salt.  Cut the butter into the flour and salt mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.  Add a cup of water and mix until the dough just comes together and leave it to stand for 30 minutes.

In the meantime, mix the ground walnuts, sugar, honey, and anise together well for the filling.  Roll out the dough thinly and cut it into 4- by 3-inch rectangular pieces.  Place some filling on each piece and wrap the dough around it.  Press the long sides of the dough together using a fork.

Fry the pastry pockets individually in hot oil.  Lift them out of the oil and drain on paper towels.  Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar before serving.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Variation:  The filled pastry pockets can also be coated with beaten egg, placed on a buttered baking sheet and baked in preheated oven at 350 degrees.

Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh yuca -- peeled, and
                        diced into large pieces
     1/2           cup  chopped scallion
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  1         tablespoon  parsley -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  1                     red onion -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  dry Mexican oregano

Over medium heat boil yuca in salted water until tender, approximately 20 minutes.  Make sure not to overcook.  Drain yuca and remove the stringy center portion.

Bring the yuca mixture to room temperature.  In a heavy bottom skillet heat 2 to 3 inches of oil to 375 degrees.  Shape batter in an ice cream scooper and fry the fritter until golden.  Place fritters on towel.  Season with salt and pepper.

Arrange fritters on a serving platter and top each fritter with a little pickled red onion on top.
