Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2               cups  chopped onions
  1                cup  diced carrots
  1                cup  diced celery
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             pounds  duck breast -- medium diced
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1                cup  dry red wine
  5               cups  veal reduction
  2                     bay leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1              pound  baby shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed
  3               cups  mashed sweet potatoes
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cubed

In a large saute pan, over medium heat, add the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the onions, carrots and celery.  Season with salt and pepper.  Saute for 2 minutes.  Add the duck to vegetables, season with salt and pepper and saute for 1 minute.  Dust the duck with the flour and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. 

Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 30 seconds.  Stir in the red wine and the veal reduction.  Add the bay leaves and thyme.  Bring the liquid to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, during the last 30 minutes add the mushrooms.  Remove from the heat and cool. 

Pour the mixture into a deep 9-inch oval dish.  Place spoonfuls of the sweet potatoes over the meat mixture.  Dot the top of the sweet potatoes with the butter.  Place in a preheated 350 degree oven and cook for about 30 minutes or until the potatoes are golden.  (Place a baking sheet under the dish in case the pie starts to bubble over.)  Remove from the oven spoon into serving plates and garnish with parsley. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE SALSA ===
     1/2           cup  blanched corn
  4                     ripe Italian plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
     1/2           cup  minced onions
  1           teaspoon  minced jalapeÒo peppers
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  1           teaspoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE ANDOUILLE POTATO CAKES ===
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
     1/4           cup  chopped celery
  2 1/2         pounds  white potatoes -- peeled and diced
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic -- plus
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  3               cups  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  Andouille sausage
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
                        Creole Seasoning -- to taste
  3                     eggs
  2               cups  fine dried bread crumbs

For the salsa:  Combine the corn, tomatoes, onions, jalapeÒos, cilantro, lime juice and lemon juice.  Mix well.  Season the salsa with salt and pepper.  Set the salsa aside. 

For the Andouille Potato Cakes:  Preheat the fryer.  In a saucepan, combine the onions, celery, potatoes, 2 teaspoons garlic and water.  Season with salt and pepper.  Bring the liquid to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are fork tender, about 10 to 12 minutes. 

In a large saute pan, brown the sausage, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Set aside. 

Remove the potatoes from the heat and drain.  Turn the potatoes into a mixing bowl.  Add the sausage, parsley, remaining tablespoon of garlic, 1 egg and cream.  Using a hand held masher, mash mixture until thoroughly blended.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cool the mixture completely.  Form the mixture into a log, 1-inch thick.  Cut the log into 2-inch pieces. 

In a small mixing bowl, add the flour and season with Creole seasoning.  In another small mixing bowl, whisk the remaining 2 eggs and 2 tablespoons milk together.  Season the mixture with salt and pepper.  In a third mixing bowl, add the bread crumbs and season with Creole seasoning. 

Dredge the potato cakes in seasoned flour, coating completely.  Dip each cake in the egg wash, allowing the excess to drip off.  Dredge the cakes in the seasoned bread crumbs, coating completely.  Fry the cakes until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, turning often for even browning. 

Remove the cakes from the oil and drain on paper towels.  Season the cakes with Creole seasoning.  Place 2 cakes in the center of each plate and spoon some salsa over the cakes. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10             large  egg whites -- at room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- sifted

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Using an electric mixer beat the egg whites on medium speed with the cream of tartar and the salt until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes.  Add the sugar and vanilla and beat until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes.  Add the flour and beat for 2 minutes, scrapping down the sides of the bowl as needed. 

Pour the batter into an ungreased angel food cake pan.  Bake until golden brown and springy when touched, 30 to 35 minutes.  (The top of the cake may crack a little.)  Remove the pan from the oven and turn it upside down over the neck of a bottle.  Let cool completely. 

This recipe yields 1 cake to serve 12.

  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1                cup  dry white wine
  7               cups  water
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     3/4         pound  cleaned calamari -- tentacles and bodies
                        removed, cut into rings
     1/8      teaspoon  vegetable oil

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2         pounds  beef tenderloin -- trimmed of fat
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  Creole Seasoning
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2         pound  fresh horseradish -- peeled and grated,
                        (abt 1 1/2 cups)
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  Emeril's Worcestershire Sauce -- or store bought
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1             recipe  Fresh Cranberry Compote -- (see recipe)
  1             recipe  Exotic Mushroom Bread Pudding -- (see recipe)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Rub the tenderloin with the oil and Creole Seasoning.  Heat a saute pan large enough to hold the tenderloin over high heat until the pan is very hot, about 2 minutes.  Sear the meat until evenly browned on all sides, about 2 minutes per side.  Remove from the heat. 

Line a shallow baking pan fitted with a wire rack with aluminum foil.  Place the tenderloin on the rack.  Rub the top and sides of the meat with the mustard.  Combine the horseradish, black pepper, garlic, salt in a small mixing bowl.  Using your hands, press the horseradish mixture evenly over the mustard on the top and sides of the tenderloin. 

Roast the tenderloin for about 30 minutes for rare.  And about 35 minutes for medium-rare.  Remove from the oven and rest for 5 minutes before slicing. 

To serve, spoon the Exotic Mushroom Bread Pudding in the center of each serving plate.  Arrange a few slices of the tenderloin around the pudding.  Spoon the Worcestershire sauce over the beef.  Garnish with parsley.  Serve the Fresh Cranberry Compote on the side. 

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             slices  white bread, 1/2" thick
  1                cup  water
  1              pound  ripe tomatoes, such as beefsteak -- peeled, seeded
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  Spanish olive oil
  1           teaspoon  sherry vinegar
  1                     hard-boiled egg -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped Spanish cured ham
  1              pound  eggplant -- peeled, and
                        cut crosswise into 1/4" strips
  2               cups  milk
  1                cup  flour
  1                cup  cornmeal

In a shallow bowl, add the bread.  Pour the water over the bread and allow to sit for a few minutes. 

In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine the tomatoes and the garlic.  Season with salt and pepper.  Process until smooth.   Remove the bread from the water and squeeze dry.  With the machine running, add the bread.  Add the vinegar and the oil.  Process until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  Remove and spoon into a serving bowl.  Sprinkle the top with chopped egg and ham. 

Season the eggplant with salt and pepper.  Place in a shallow bowl and add the milk.  Cover and allow to sit for 10 minutes. 

In an electric fryer or deep pot, preheat the olive oil to 365 degrees.  In a shallow bowl, combine the flour and the cornmeal.  Season with salt and pepper.  Remove the eggplant from the milk, letting the excess drip off.  Dredge each eggplant slice in the seasoned flour mixture, coating completely.  Fry the eggplant in batches, until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt and pepper. 

Serve the fried eggplant on a large platter with the Salmorejo Sauce.  Garnish with parsley. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  1                cup  sugar
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  buttermilk
  1               pint  fresh blueberries, rinsed, hulled,
                        and patted dry
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour - (to 4 cups)
  1              pinch  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking powder

     1/4           cup  milk
  2               cups  powdered sugar

In an electric mixer, fitted with paddle, cream the shortening and sugar.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time and beat until incorporated.  With the machine running, slowly add the buttermilk.  Switch the paddle attachment to a dough hook and add the blueberries.

In small bowl, whisk together the milk and powdered sugar.  Drizzle the glaze over each doughnut and allow to sit until the glaze sets.  Serve the doughnuts on a platter.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  balsamic vinegar
  6                     ripe cooking pears, such as Bosc
  1                     fresh lemon -- cut in half
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  3        tablespoons  butter
  24            slices  Proscuitto d Parma - (abt 1/2 lb)
  4               cups  arugula -- cleaned
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             ounces  Gorgonzola cheese

For the balsamic syrup:  In a medium-saucepan, over medium heat, add the balsamic vinegar.  Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.  Simmer until the liquid reduces by 3/4, about 30 minutes or until syrup-like consistency.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.  (Yields about 3/4 cup) 

Peel each pear, discarding the skin.  Slice each pear into quarters and remove the core.  Then slice each quarter in 2 (you should have 48 pieces).  While you are cutting the pears, place in a mixing bowl and toss with the a squeeze of the fresh lemon juice.  Season the pears with salt and black pepper.  Add the sugar and toss well, coating each piece completely. 

In a large stainless steel pan, over medium-high heat, melt the butter.  When the butter is hot, add the pears, sliced-side down, cook until the pears start to caramelize, about 2 to 3 minutes, flip over and caramelize the other side.  Remove the pears from the stove.  Toss the arugula with olive oil salt and pepper. 

To serve, place a small mound of arugula in the center of each plate.  Place 2 pear slices on each slice of prosciutto and roll prosciutto around the pears.  Place 3 prosciutto and pear bundles on each mound of arugula.  Crumble the cheese over the pears.  Drizzle each plate with some of the balsamic syrup. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

     1/2         pound  dried currants
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  dry sherry
  1             recipe  Basic Sponge Cake -- (see below)
  1                cup  toasted slivered almonds
  1             recipe  Creme Anglaise -- (see below)
  1                cup  sweetened whipped cream
  12                    fresh mint sprigs
                        === BASIC SPONGE CAKE ===
     1/4           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter
  8              large  eggs
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  bleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        === CREME ANGLAISE ===
  5              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract

In a medium-size saucepan over medium heat, combine the currants, sugar, and water.  Bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the sherry.  Let cool completely.  Spread the mixture evenly over the sponge cake, then sprinkle the almonds evenly over the currant mixture. 

Cut the cake horizontally into 1-inch-wide strips, then cut the strips into quarters.  Spoon the creme Anglaise into 12 dessert bowls, then in each bowl stack four pieces of the cake on top of each other.  Spoon over the whipped cream, and garnish with a mint sprig.  Serve immediately. 

For the Sponge cake:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a small saucepan, warm the milk and 2 teaspoons butter together over medium-low heat.  With an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip, beat the eggs and 1 cup of the sugar on medium-high speed until the mixture is pale yellow and thick, and has tripled in volume, about 8 minutes.  With the mixer on low, beat in the warm milk mixture. 

Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a medium-size mixing bowl.  Fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture and blend thoroughly until smooth.  Add the vanilla and mix gently. 

Grease a 17- by 12-inch baking pan or jellyroll pan with 2 teaspoons butter.  Sprinkle evenly with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.  Pour the batter into the pan, spreading it evenly.  Bake until the cake springs back when touched, about 15 minutes.  Cool for about 2 minutes, then gently flip it out onto a large wire rack or a large sheet of parchment paper.  Let cool completely.  (Makes 1 sponge cake) 

For the Creme Anglaise:  Put the yolks in a saucepan and add the sugar.  Beat with a wire whisk until thick and lemon colored.  Put the cream in a nonreactive saucepan and heat to the scalding point (when bubbles form around the edge of the pan).  Gradually add the cream to the yolk mixture, beating constantly.  Cook over low heat until the mixture thickens slightly.  Do not overcook or boil, as the sauce will curdle. 

Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a cold bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it down on the surface to prevent a skin from forming if not using immediately.  Will keep refrigerated for 24 hours.  Before serving, warm over low heat.  (Makes about 2 1/2 cups) 

This recipe yields 12 servings

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a medium-size mixing bowl.  Fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture and blend thoroughly until smooth.  Add the vanilla and mix gently. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Grease a 17- by 12-inch baking pan or jellyroll pan with 2 teaspoons butter.  Sprinkle evenly with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.  Pour the batter into the pan, spreading it evenly.  Bake until the cake springs back when touched, about 15 minutes.  Cool for about 2 minutes, then gently flip it out onto a large wire rack or a large sheet of parchment paper.  Let cool completely.  (Makes 1 sponge cake) 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;For the Creme Anglaise:  Put the yolks in a saucepan and add the sugar.  Beat with a wire whisk until thick and lemon colored.  Put the cream in a nonreactive saucepan and heat to the scalding point (when bubbles form around the edge of the pan).  Gradually add the cream to the yolk mixture, beating constantly.  Cook over low heat until the mixture thickens slightly.  Do not overcook or boil, as the sauce will curdle. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a cold bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it down on the surface to prevent a skin from forming if not using immediately.  Will keep refrigerated for 24 hours.  Before serving, warm over low heat.  (Makes about 2 1/2 cups)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     3/4           cup  chopped yellow onions
     1/4           cup  chopped green bell pepper
  1         tablespoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  1 1/2         pounds  peeled crawfish tails
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions or scallions -- (green part only)
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1              large  egg
     3/4           cup  fine dried bread crumbs
  1             recipe  Pastry - (see below)
                        Creole seasoning -- to taste
                        Oil -- for frying
                        === PASTRY FOR CRAWFISH PIES ===
  3               cups  bleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  6        tablespoons  vegetable shortening
  1              large  egg
     3/4           cup  milk

Preheat the fryer.  Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet.  Add the onions, bell pepper, salt, cayenne and cook for 2 minutes, stirring a few times.  Add the crawfish tails and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the green onions, garlic, and parsley and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Pour the mixture into a medium-size mixing bowl and let cool for about 3 minutes.  Add the egg and bread crumbs and mix well.  Set aside. 

Make the pastry.  Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder into a large mixing bowl.  With a pastry cutter or 2 knives, cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  In a small mixing bowl, beat the egg with the milk.  Gradually add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, working it to make a thick dough.  Divide the dough into 12 equal portions. 

On a lightly floured work surface, roll out each dough piece into a thin round about 5 inches in diameter.  Put about 1/4 cup of the crawfish mixture in the center of each round, fold the dough over, and crimp the edges together with a fork.  Fry the pies, 2 or 3 at a time, until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels, sprinkle with the Creole seasoning, and serve hot. 

This recipe yields 12 hand-sized pies.

Gradually add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, working it to make a thick dough.  Divide the dough into 12 equal portions. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;On a lightly floured work surface, roll out each dough piece into a thin round about 5 inches in diameter.  Put about 1/4 cup of the crawfish mixture in the center of each round, fold the dough over, and crimp the edges together with a fork.  Fry the pies, 2 or 3 at a time, until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels, sprinkle with the Creole seasoning, and serve hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  Yukon Gold potatoes -- halved
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12             small  garlic cloves
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  4               cups  vegetable oil
     1/2         pound  pancetta -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  thinly-sliced Vidalia onions,
                        or other sweet yellow onions
  2               cups  fresh sweet green peas
  4                     striped bass fillets - (4 to 6 oz ea)
  1                cup  flour
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.  Season the potatoes with salt and pepper.  Place the potatoes in a small, shallow baking pan.  Add the garlic, rosemary and oil.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover with foil and bake until tender, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and cool the potatoes completely in the oil. 

Remove the potatoes and garlic from the oil.  Reserve 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the oil.  In a large saute pan, over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of the potato oil.  When the oil is hot, add the pancetta.  Saute for 2 minutes.  Add the onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  Continue to saute for 2 minutes.  Add the peas, confit potatoes and confit garlic.  Season with salt and pepper.  Continue to saute for 3 to 4 minutes or until hot.  Set aside, keeping warm. 

Season the fish with salt and pepper.  Lightly dredge the fillets in the flour.  In a large saute pan, over medium heat, add 1/4 cup of the reserved oil.  Pan-fry the fish for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until the fish is golden and crispy.  Remove and drain on paper towels. 

To serve:  Spoon the potato mixture in the center of each plate.  Lay the fish directly on top of the potatoes.  Garnish with parsley. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions (green part only)

  2              large  eggs -- plus
  1                     egg -- beaten
  2               cups  fine dried bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  Creole Seasoning
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  8                     hamburger buns - toasted
  1             recipe  Tartar Sauce -- (see below)
                        Shredded lettuce
                        Sliced vine-ripened tomatoes
                        === TARTAR SAUCE ===
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions (green part only)
                        or scallions
  2          teaspoons  drained sweet pickle relish
  1                cup  vegetable oil
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  1         tablespoon  Creole or whole-grain mustard
  1           teaspoon  salt

For the Tartar sauce:  Put the egg, garlic, lemon juice, parsley, green onions, and relish in a food processor or blender and process for 15 seconds.  With the motor running, pour the oil through the feed tube in a slow steady stream.  Add the cayenne, mustard, and salt and pulse once or twice to blend.  Cover and let sit for 1 hour in the refrigerator before using.  Best if used within 24 hours.  (Yields about 1 1/4 cups) 

In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the onions, celery, bell pepper, salt, and cayenne.  Cook, stirring, until soft for about 6 minutes.  Add the shrimp and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. 

Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl and let cool slightly.  Add the garlic, green onions, 2 of the eggs, and 1 cup of the bread crumbs.  Stir to mix well.  Divide into 8 equal portions and form into patties. 

Put the flour in a shallow bowl and season with 1 teaspoon of the Creole seasoning.  Put the remaining 1 cup bread crumbs in another shallow bowl and season with the remaining 1 teaspoon Creole seasoning.  Put the beaten egg in yet another shallow bowl, add the water, and beat lightly. 

Heat the vegetable oil in 2 large skillets over medium heat.  Dredge each patty first in the flour, then in the egg mixture, then in the bread crumbs, turning to coat completely and shaking off any excess.  Cook 4 patties at a time in each skillet, until lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes on each side.  Drain on paper towels. 

To serve, spread both sides of each toasted bun with some of the tartar sauce, place a patty on the bottom half of the bun, dress with lettuce and tomatoes, and top with the other bun half. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  bacon -- cut 1/2" pieces
  3 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 3/4      teaspoons  cayenne
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  4                     bay leaves
  1                     beef bottom round, 2" to 3" thick -- (abt 3 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  3               cups  coarsely-chopped onions
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped carrots
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped turnips
  6             quarts  water
     1/2           cup  dry sherry
  1                     veal rump roast with bone - (abt 3 lbs)
  4                     garlic cloves
  3          envelopes  unflavored gelatin - (1/4 oz ea)
  1               loaf  French bread -- sliced 1/4" thick,
                        and toasted
  1                cup  Creole mustard

Render the bacon and drain on a paper towels.  In a small bowl combine 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper, thyme, garlic, and 2 bay leaves, crumbled.  Add the bacon to the spice mixture. 

With a sharp, pointed knife, make slits in the beef round, about 1-inch apart, being careful not to cut all the way through.  Insert 2 to 3 pieces of the seasoned bacon into each hole.  Season the beef with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne, and 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper. 

Heat the oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat and brown the beef for 4 to 5 minutes on each side.  Remove the beef from the pot.  Add 2 cups of the onions, carrots, and turnips.  Make a bed of the vegetables in the bottom of the pot.  Lay the beef on top and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly wilted.  Add 2 quarts of the water, or enough to cover the beef.  Add 1/4 cup of the sherry and bring to a boil.  Reduce to medium, cover and simmer, turning the beef several times, for about 3 hours, or until the meat is tender. 

Season the veal rump with 1 teaspoon of the salt, 1/4 teaspoon of the cayenne, and 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper.  Put the veal in a large pot and add about 4 quarts of the water, or enough to cover the veal.  Add the remaining 2 bay leaves, the garlic cloves, the remaining 1 cup onions, and the remaining 1/4 cup sherry and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer turning the veal several times, for about 3 hours or until tender. 

Remove the veal from the pot and skim off any fat that has risen to the surface.  Remove the bay leaves.  Pour off 1 cup of the broth and cool in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.  Remove any fat or gristle from the veal.  Shred the meat. 

Remove the beef from the pot.  With a slotted spoon, remove the vegetables from the beef broth.  Set aside.  Discard the bay leaves.  Skim off any fat that has risen to the surface. 

Combine 8 cups of the beef broth with the shredded veal and season with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, remaining 1/2 teaspoon cayenne, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. 

Add the gelatin to the cool veal stock.  Whisk to dissolve the gelatin and let stand for 1 minute.  Add this mixture to the beef stock and veal mixture and stir to combine. 

Lay 3 cups of the cooked vegetables in the bottom of a bowl large enough to accommodate the beef.  Place the beef on top of the vegetables.  Pour the beef broth and veal mixture over the beef.  Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours, or until the gelatin sets. 

To serve, invert the bowl very carefully onto a large serving platter and unmold.  The mold can be sliced and served on toasted slices of French bread with Creole mustard. 

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings or 50 appetizer servings.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Render the bacon and drain on a paper towels.  In a small bowl combine 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper, thyme, garlic, and 2 bay leaves, crumbled.  Add the bacon to the spice mixture. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;With a sharp, pointed knife, make slits in the beef round, about 1-inch apart, being careful not to cut all the way through.  Insert 2 to 3 pieces of the seasoned bacon into each hole.  Season the beef with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne, and 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Heat the oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat and brown the beef for 4 to 5 minutes on each side.  Remove the beef from the pot.  Add 2 cups of the onions, carrots, and turnips.  Make a bed of the vegetables in the bottom of the pot.  Lay the beef on top and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly wilted.  Add 2 quarts of the water, or enough to cover the beef.  Add 1/4 cup of the sherry and bring to a boil.  Reduce to medium, cover and simmer, turning the beef several times, for about 3 hours, or until the meat is tender. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Season the veal rump with 1 teaspoon of the salt, 1/4 teaspoon of the cayenne, and 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper.  Put the veal in a large pot and add about 4 quarts of the water, or enough to cover the veal.  Add the remaining 2 bay leaves, the garlic cloves, the remaining 1 cup onions, and the remaining 1/4 cup sherry and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer turning the veal several times, for about 3 hours or until tender. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Remove the veal from the pot and skim off any fat that has risen to the surface.  Remove the bay leaves.  Pour off 1 cup of the broth and cool in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.  Remove any fat or gristle from the veal.  Shred the meat. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Remove the beef from the pot.  With a slotted spoon, remove the vegetables from the beef broth.  Set aside.  Discard the bay leaves.  Skim off any fat that has risen to the surface. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Combine 8 cups of the beef broth with the shredded veal and season with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, remaining 1/2 teaspoon cayenne, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Add the gelatin to the cool veal stock.  Whisk to dissolve the gelatin and let stand for 1 minute.  Add this mixture to the beef stock and veal mixture and stir to combine. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Lay 3 cups of the cooked vegetables in the bottom of a bowl large enough to accommodate the beef.  Place the beef on top of the vegetables.  Pour the beef broth and veal mixture over the beef.  Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours, or until the gelatin sets. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To serve, invert the bowl very carefully onto a large serving platter and unmold.  The mold can be sliced and served on toasted slices of French bread with Creole mustard. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings or 50 appetizer servings.

Serving Size  : 24    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Candies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  egg whites
  2               cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup
     1/2           cup  water
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  pecans

Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until stiff.  Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper.  Put the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a medium-size heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir to dissolve the sugar, bring to a boil and cook until the temperature reaches 260 degrees on a candy thermometer, or the hard-ball stage, when a bit of the mixture dropped into cold water holds its shape, 10 to 15 minutes. 

Remove from the heat.  Pour in a thin steady stream into the beaten egg whites and beat with an electric mixer on high for about 3 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl.  Add the vanilla, and continue beating on high just until the candy starts to lose its gloss, 5 to 6 minutes.  When the beaters are lifted, the mixture should fall in a ribbon that mounds on itself. 

If the mixture flattens out, beat again for 1 minute more.  If the mixture is too thick to drop, beat in a few drops of hot water until the candy is a softer consistency.  Add the pecans, stir to mix, and quickly drop the mixture by tablespoons onto the prepared sheet.  Place the candies on a serving candy dish and pass. 

This recipe yields 24 pieces. 

TIP:  If the candy is poured into a pan and cut into squares, you should have about 48 pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  veal round -- ground
     1/2         pound  pork butt -- ground
     1/4         pound  chicken livers -- ground
     1/2         pound  boiled ham -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2                     bay leaves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  finely-minced onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
     1/2           cup  brandy
     1/2           cup  port wine
  1                     egg white
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  1             recipe  Pate Pastry Dough -- (see recipe)
  5                     soft-boiled eggs -- peeled
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1               loaf  brown bread or pumpernickel bread
  1              pound  Maytag Farms blue cheese
  2               cups  whole grain mustard
  1                cup  cornichons

Combine the veal, pork, livers and ham in a large mixing bowl.  Add the bay leaves, salt, thyme, oregano, pepper, onions and garlic.  Mix well.  Stir in the brandy and port.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.  Remove and drain well.  Stir in the egg white and parsley. 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line an earthenware terrine with the pastry dough.  Leave enough of the dough overlapping all sides of the pan so that the pastry will completely cover the top of the pate mixture when folded over.  Spoon half of the meat mixture evenly over the bottom of the crust.  Place the eggs down the center of the meat.  Spoon the remaining meat mixture over the eggs and press firmly.  Fold the overlapping dough over the top of the meat mixture, sealing the edges completely.  Using a sharp knife, cut a small circle out of the center of the pastry.  Lightly brush the top of the pastry with the beaten egg. 

Place the mold on a baking sheet and place in the center of the oven.  Bake for 1 1/2 hours or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.  Remove from the oven and cool completely.  Refrigerate the pate for at least 8 hours. 

The pate can be served either at room temperature or cold.  Slice the pate into 1-inch slices and serve with the brown bread, blue cheese, mustard and pickle 

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.  Remove and drain well.  Stir in the egg white and parsley. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line an earthenware terrine with the pastry dough.  Leave enough of the dough overlapping all sides of the pan so that the pastry will completely cover the top of the pate mixture when folded over.  Spoon half of the meat mixture evenly over the bottom of the crust.  Place the eggs down the center of the meat.  Spoon the remaining meat mixture over the eggs and press firmly.  Fold the overlapping dough over the top of the meat mixture, sealing the edges completely.  Using a sharp knife, cut a small circle out of the center of the pastry.  Lightly brush the top of the pastry with the beaten egg. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Place the mold on a baking sheet and place in the center of the oven.  Bake for 1 1/2 hours or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.  Remove from the oven and cool completely.  Refrigerate the pate for at least 8 hours. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;The pate can be served either at room temperature or cold.  Slice the pate into 1-inch slices and serve with the brown bread, blue cheese, mustard and pickle

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  baking potatoes -- peeled
  1             medium  onion -- julienned
  2                     eggs
                        Salt -- to taste

     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  2        tablespoons  matzah or all-purpose flour
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2             pounds  milk chocolate -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  Grand Marnier
  2             pounds  semisweet chocolate couverture -- melted

In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat until it just begins to simmer, about 5 minutes.  Add the chocolate.  With a wooden spoon, stir until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth, about 5 minutes.  Add the butter and stir to melt completely.  Add the liqueur and mix well. 

Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper.  Pour the chocolate into the pan, spreading it evenly with a wooden spoon.  Let it cool completely, then refrigerate until it sets. 

Remove the chocolate from the parchment paper, break it into pieces, and put it in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a wire whisk.  Beat at low speed for 1 minute, then increase the speed to medium and beat until it is creamy and smooth. 

Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag without a tip.  Pipe out 1/2-ounce truffles, each about the size of a walnut, onto a sheet of parchment paper.  Refrigerate the truffles for 4 hours. 

Use a four-prong fork to dip, then tip the truffles onto a sheet of parchment paper.  Avoid touching the dipped candies while they set.  If the truffles have not set in 15 minutes, then put in the refrigerator until set. 

After they set, put them in paper candy cups and store between sheets of parchment paper. 

This recipe yields 80 truffles.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  unsalted butter - (3 sticks) -- at room temperature
  1                cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  6              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  3               cups  bleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  bleached all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Assorted sprinkles
                        === BUTTERCREAM FROSTING ===
  4             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
     1/2         stick  butter -- softened
     3/4         pound  confectionersí sugar - (abt 3 cups) -- sifted
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  milk - (to 3 tbspns)
                        Red, blue, green and yellow food coloring

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle, on medium speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.  Cream the mixture until it is smooth and fluffy.  Add the egg yolks 1 at a time, mixing in between each addition.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Beat for 1 minute and add the vanilla. 

Combine the flour and the salt in a medium-size mixing bowl.  Mix well.  Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix on low speed until it is fully incorporated.  Increase the speed to medium and mix until the batter is thick and creamy, about 2 minutes.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the paddle. 

Lightly flour a flat surface.  Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thick.  Cut the dough into the desired shapes.  Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper.  Place the cookies on the baking sheet about 2 inches apart. 

Bake until lightly golden, about 20 minutes.  Remove the cookies from the oven and let cool completely in the pan.  Remove the cookies from the pan using a spatula.  Repeat the process until all the dough is used.  Frost each cookie and garnish with sprinkles. 

For the Buttercrean Frosting:  In a large mixing bowl, with an electric mixer, cream the cheese and butter.  Add the sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing after each addition.  Add the vanilla and milk and mix well.  Add a couple of drops of food coloring and mix well.  (Yields about 1 1/2 to 2 cups frosting) 

This recipe yields about 2 dozen cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  6                     eggs
     1/4           cup  melted butter
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
     1/2           cup  half-and-half
  6               cups  flour
                        === FILLINGS ===
  1 1/2           cups  sweetened whipped cream
  1 1/2           cups  vanilla pastry cream -- (see below)
  1 1/2           cups  raspberry filling - (see below)
                        Shaker powdered sugar
                        === VANILLA PASTRY CREAM ===
  5              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  cornstarch
  2 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
                        === RASPBERRY FILLING ===
  4               cups  raspberries
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
                        === POWDERED SUGAR GLAZE ===
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  3        tablespoons  milk
                        === CHOCOLATE GLAZE ===
     1/4           cup  cocoa powder
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  4        tablespoons  milk  - (to 5 tbspns)

In a small mixing bowl, combine the yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, and 1/4 cup of the warm water.  Stir to dissolve and set aside. 

In an electric mixer, beat the eggs and remaining 3/4 cup sugar until thick and pale yellow in color.  Change the mixer attachment to a dough hook.  With the machine running slowly add the yeast mixture, melted butter, salt, milk, and half-and-half.  Add the flour, 1 cup at a time.  Mix until the mixture forms a soft ball, leaves the sides of the bowl, and climbs up the dough hook. 

Remove the dough and turn into a lightly oiled bowl.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set the bowl in a warm, draft free space.  Let the dough rise until double in size, about 1 1/2 hours. 

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and dust the surface of the dough with flour.  With a rolling pin, roll out the dough, about 1/4-inch thick, in the shape of a rectangle.  Using a 3-inch round cutter, cut the dough into circles. 

Place the rounds on a baking sheet.  Cover the dough with a greased piece of plastic wrap (this will prevent the dough from sticking to the wrap) and let the dough rise until double in size, about 30 minutes. 

Preheat the fryer to 350 degrees.  Gently fry a couple of the circles at a time, until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, flipping occasionally for overall browning.  Remove the doughnuts from the oil and drain on a  paper towel-lined plate. 

For the Vanilla Pastry Cream:  In a mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, cornstarch, and 1 cup of the heavy cream.  Whisk to blend well.  Set aside. 

Combine the remaining 1 1/2 cups cream, sugar and vanilla extract in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.  Whisk to dissolve the sugar and bring to a gentle boil, about 10 minutes.  Slowly add the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly and cook until it thickens, about 5 minutes.  Be forewarned: the mixture will break.  Donít be alarmed.  Pour it into a glass bowl.  Press a piece of plastic wrap down over the surface of the mixture to prevent a skin from forming.  Let cool completely at room temperature. 

When cooled pour the mixture into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip.  Beat at a medium speed to combine the mixture.  If it will not combine, warm another 1/2 cup heavy cream and slowly add it to the mixture.  Whip until you have a thick and creamy custard. 

For the Raspberry Filling:  In a saucepan, combine raspberries, 3/4 cup of water and sugar.  Bring to boil.  Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until raspberries have broken down.  Remove mixture from the heat and strain out the seeds.  Return the strained mixture to the heat.  Dissolve the cornstarch in the remaining 1/4 cup of water.  Whisk the slurry into the raspberry mixture.  Bring the mixture back to a boil.  Simmer for 5 more minutes.  Remove from heat and cool completely. 

For the Powdered Sugar Glaze:  In a small bowl, combine the powdered sugar and the milk and whisk until smooth. 

For the Chocolate Glaze:  In a small bowl, combine the cocoa powder and the powdered sugar.  Add in the milk and whisk until smooth. 

Fit each pastry bag with small round tips.  Fill each bag with a different filling.  Pipe the doughnuts, alternately with the different fillings.  Sprinkle some of the filled doughnuts with powdered sugar.  Glaze the remaining donuts with the 2 different glazes.  Serve on a large serving platter. 

This recipe yields 2 dozen doughnuts.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Snails/Escargot


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  escargots - (6 dozen count)
  1 1/2           cups  dry red wine
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  3        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1        large sprig  fresh thyme
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- plus
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- at room temperature
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1              sheet  frozen puff pastry - (11" by 14") -- defrosted
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water

Remove the escargots from the can and drain well.  Put them in a large bowl, fill with cool water, and drain, then rinse again in cool water.  Drain well and return to the bowl.  Set aside. 

In a medium-size saucepan over medium heat, combine the wine, shallots, 1 tablespoon of the garlic, the thyme, bay leaves, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/8 teaspoon of the black pepper.  Bring to a boil and let boil for 5 minutes.  Remove the bay leaves and pour the mixture over the escargots and let stand at room temperature until completely cool.  Drain off 1/2 cup of the wine mixture and reserve.  Cover and refrigerate the escargots if not using immediately. 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  With an electric mixer set on low speed, beat the butter until smooth in a small mixing bowl.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons garlic and the parsley and beat to mix.  Add the reserved wine mixture and beat until incorporated.  Add the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper and beat to mix. 

Put 8 or 9 escargots in each of 8 (8-ounce) ramekins.  Put 2 heaping tablespoons of the butter mixture over the escargots in each ramekin.  Cut 8 (4-inch) rounds out of the puff pastry with a knife and cover the top of each ramekin with a pastry round.  With your fingers, press the pastry firmly over the rims and remove any excess.  Lightly brush the pastry with the beaten egg. 

Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake on the middle rack of the oven until the pastry is golden and puffed, 18 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before serving. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  12            slices  eggplant - (abt 1/4" thick)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  olive oil

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  diced ripe mango
  2 1/2           cups  diced ripe papaya
  2 1/2           cups  sugar
  5               cups  water
  1 1/2          pints  fresh strawberries
  12            slices  Angel Food Cake - (to 16 slices) -- cubed,
                        (see recipe)
                        Fresh mint sprigs

In two separate nonreactive saucepans, place the mango in one and the papaya in the other.  Add 1 cup of sugar and 2 1/2 cups of water to each pan.  Place over medium heat and bring to a boil.  Cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.

Season both sides of the potatoes with salt and pepper.  Fan the potatoes evenly over the onions.  Pour the cheese mixture evenly over the potatoes.  Spread evenly. 

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove from the oven and cool for 5 minutes before serving.  Slice the tart into 8 servings.  Garnish with parsley.

Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     catfish fillets - (abt 4 oz ea)
  12                    bamboo skewers - (10" long)
  1         tablespoon  Creole Seasoning
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
  2        tablespoons  Creole or whole-grain mustard
  1                cup  buttermilk
  4               cups  vegetable oil
  2               cups  bleached all-purpose flour
                        === REMOULADE SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions (green part only)
                        or scallions
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  prepared horseradish
  2        tablespoons  Creole or whole-grain mustard
  2          teaspoons  yellow mustard
  3        tablespoons  ketchup
  1           teaspoon  hot sauce
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1              large  egg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil

Cut each fillet lengthwise into 3 strips, each about 1 1/2 inches wide.  Thread each strip onto a skewer.  Lay them in a shallow bowl. 

Combine 1 teaspoon of the Creole seasoning, the salt, cayenne, mustard, and buttermilk in a small mixing bowl and stir to blend. Pour the mixture over the catfish, cover, and refrigerate for 8 hours. 

Remove the fish from the refrigerator.  Heat the oil to 360 degrees in a large deep cast-iron skillet.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and the remaining 2 teaspoons Creole seasoning.  Dredge 2 to 3 skewers at a time in the flour, shaking off any excess.  Fry them in batches until golden brown, about 4 minutes on each side.  Drain on paper towels.  Serve hot with the remoulade sauce. 

For the Remoulade Sauce:  Put the green onions, garlic, horseradish, mustards, ketchup, hot sauce, Worcestershire, lemon juice, egg, salt, and cayenne in a food processor or blender and process until smooth about 30 seconds.  With the motor running, slowly pour in the vegetable oil through the feed tube.  The mixture will thicken.  Transfer to a container, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour before using.  Best if used within 24 hours. 

This recipe yields 6 servings (2 skewers per person).

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  green bell peppers -- roasted and peeled
  1              pound  red bell peppers -- roasted and peeled
     1/2           cup  small-diced Spanish onions
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  2          teaspoons  sherry vinegar

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Ice Cream


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE ICE CREAM ===
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  3                     ripe bananas -- peeled, halved
                        lengthwise, crosscut 1/4" thick slices
  2        tablespoons  banana liqueur
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
  2               cups  milk
  2               cups  heavy cream
  6                     egg yolks
  2               cups  Chocolate Mousse -- (see below)
                        === FOR THE GARNISH ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  2              large  bananas -- peeled, and
                        sliced crosswise into 1/4" slices
  1                cup  Chocolate Sauce in a squeeze bottle -- (see below)
                        === QUICK CHOCOLATE MOUSSE ===
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        === CHOCOLATE SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  half-and-half
  1                     tablespoon butter
     1/2         pound  semisweet chocolate chips
     1/4      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract

In a large saute pan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the brown sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves.  Add the bananas and cook, stirring for 3 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and carefully add the liqueur and rum.  Return the pan to the stove and carefully ignite the alcohol and shake the pan until the flames die down, about 30 seconds.  Remove from the heat and cool completely. 

In a medium saucepan, over medium heat, combine the milk and cream.  Bring the mixture to a scalding point.  In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks.  Add the cream mixture about 1/4 cup at a time to the beaten eggs, whisking well after each addition.  Pour the mixture back into the saucepan, and cook, stirring, over medium heat until the mixture becomes thick enough to lightly coat the back of a spoon, 2 to 3 minutes. 

Remove from the heat and pour the mixture into a large glass mixing bowl.  Add the pureed bananas and stir to mix.  Cover the top with plastic wrap pressed against the surface and let cool.  Place the mixture in the refrigerator and chill completely. 

Pour the banana mixture into an ice cream machine and follow the manufacturerís instructions for the churning time.  If you leave the ice cream in the freezer for a while before completing the pie, be sure to let it soften up a bit first. 

For the Quick Chocolate Mousse:  Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan, over medium heat, and bring to a simmer.  Cook until the chocolate melts completely, whisking occasionally.  Remove from the heat, pour into a glass bowl and cool completely.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled.  In an electric mixer with a wire whip, beat until the cream forms firm peaks.  (Yields 2 1/2 to 3 cups) 

To assemble:  Line 1 cup molds with plastic wrap.  Spread 3/4 cup of the ice cream over the bottom and sides of the individual 1 cup molds.  Spoon 1/4 cup of the Chocolate Mousse in the center of the mold.  Fill the mold with the remaining ice cream.  Wrap the molds in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm. 

For the garnish:  In a saute pan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the sugar and stir to dissolve.  Cook the sugar mixture for 1 minute.  Add the bananas and continue to cook for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat. 

For the Chocolate sauce:  Combine the half-and-half and butter in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.  Heat the mixture until a thin paper-like skin appears on the top.  Do not boil.  Add the chocolate and vanilla and stir until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth.  Remove from the heat and let cool.  (Yields 1 1/2 cups) 

To serve, drizzle each plate with the Chocolate Sauce.  Unmold the bombes and place in the center of each plate.  Spoon the banana mixture over each bombe and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

<DirS>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a large saute pan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the brown sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves.  Add the bananas and cook, stirring for 3 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and carefully add the liqueur and rum.  Return the pan to the stove and carefully ignite the alcohol and shake the pan until the flames die down, about 30 seconds.  Remove from the heat and cool completely. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a medium saucepan, over medium heat, combine the milk and cream.  Bring the mixture to a scalding point.  In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks.  Add the cream mixture about 1/4 cup at a time to the beaten eggs, whisking well after each addition.  Pour the mixture back into the saucepan, and cook, stirring, over medium heat until the mixture becomes thick enough to lightly coat the back of a spoon, 2 to 3 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Remove from the heat and pour the mixture into a large glass mixing bowl.  Add the pureed bananas and stir to mix.  Cover the top with plastic wrap pressed against the surface and let cool.  Place the mixture in the refrigerator and chill completely. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Pour the banana mixture into an ice cream machine and follow the manufacturerís instructions for the churning time.  If you leave the ice cream in the freezer for a while before completing the pie, be sure to let it soften up a bit first. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;For the Quick Chocolate Mousse:  Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan, over medium heat, and bring to a simmer.  Cook until the chocolate melts completely, whisking occasionally.  Remove from the heat, pour into a glass bowl and cool completely.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled.  In an electric mixer with a wire whip, beat until the cream forms firm peaks.  (Yields 2 1/2 to 3 cups) 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To assemble:  Line 1 cup molds with plastic wrap.  Spread 3/4 cup of the ice cream over the bottom and sides of the individual 1 cup molds.  Spoon 1/4 cup of the Chocolate Mousse in the center of the mold.  Fill the mold with the remaining ice cream.  Wrap the molds in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;For the garnish:  In a saute pan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the sugar and stir to dissolve.  Cook the sugar mixture for 1 minute.  Add the bananas and continue to cook for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;For the Chocolate sauce:  Combine the half-and-half and butter in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.  Heat the mixture until a thin paper-like skin appears on the top.  Do not boil.  Add the chocolate and vanilla and stir until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth.  Remove from the heat and let cool.  (Yields 1 1/2 cups) 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To serve, drizzle each plate with the Chocolate Sauce.  Unmold the bombes and place in the center of each plate.  Spoon the banana mixture over each bombe and serve immediately.

          Fruit Terrine With Almond Cream And Three Fruit Coulis

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  butter -- plus
  1           teaspoon  butter -- at room temperature
  9              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1         tablespoon  pure almond extract -- plus
  1           teaspoon  pure almond extract
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  1 1/2           cups  almonds -- toasted, and
                        finely chopped in a food processor
     1/4           cup  Frangelica
                        === TO ASSEMBLE ===
  1                cup  fresh blackberries -- hulled
  1                cup  fresh raspberries -- hulled
  1                cup  halved large fresh strawberries
  1                cup  thinly-sliced peeled fresh mangos
  1                cup  fresh blackberry coulis or sauce
  1                cup  fresh strawberry coulis or sauce
  1                cup  fresh mango coulis or sauce
  2        tablespoons  chiffonade fresh mint

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease a 6-cup loaf pan with 1 teaspoon of the butter. 

For the Cake:  In a metal bowl set over a pot of simmering water, whisk 6 of the eggs with 3/4 cup of the sugar and 1 tablespoon of the almond extract.  Whisk constantly, occasionally removing the bowl from the heat when the mixture threatens to get too hot and scramble.  Whisk until a 3-second ribbon forms (lift the whisk and the mixture will fall from it like a ribbon that lasts 3 seconds, for about 5 minutes).  Remove the bowl from the heat and beat the mixture with an electric mixer until thick and frothy, for about 3 minutes. 

In a bowl combine the flour, baking powder, and 1 cup of the almonds, and mix well.  Gently fold the dry ingredients into the egg mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, until thoroughly incorporated.  Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake until spongy, for about 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool. 

Run a small knife around the inside of the pan and turn the genoise out onto a rack to cool.  Using a sharp bread knife, slice the genoise into 3 equal, horizontal layers, and set aside. 

To make the almond cream:  In a metal bowl set over a pot of simmering water, whisk together the remaining 3 eggs, the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and the remaining 1 teaspoon almond extract.  Reduce the heat to medium and whisk constantly, removing the mixture from the heat occasionally to ensure that the eggs donít scramble, until you get a 3-second ribbon.  Remove the bowl from the heat and beat the mixture with an electric mixer until itís thick and frothy, about 5 minutes.  Beat in the remaining 1/2 cup almonds and the remaining 8 tablespoons butter.  (Yields about 1 1/2 cups) 

Line the loaf pan with long pieces of plastic wrap overhanging the sides and place 1 layer of the cake in the bottom.  Sprinkle the bottom layer with 1 tablespoon of the Frangelica.  Spread 1/2 cup of the cream over the layer and arrange half of the fruit in layers over the cream.  Add the next layer of cake, sprinkle with another tablespoon Frangelica, and spread another 1/2 cup of the cream.  Layer the remaining fruits over the top and spread another 1/2 cup cream over the fruit.  Sprinkle the underside of the top layer with 1 tablespoon of the Frangelica and turn it over on the last layer of cream.  Sprinkle the top of the cake with the remaining 1 tablespoon Frangelica.  Wrap the plastic wrap tightly over the cake and press gently but firmly into the loaf pan.  Refrigerate overnight. 

Remove the pan from the refrigerator and unwrap it.  Carefully turn the cake out onto a platter and cut into 8 slices. 

To serve, spoon a pool of each of the three fruit coulis over the bottom of each serving plate.  Place 1 slice of the terrine on top of the coulis.  Garnish with the mint. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1                cup  vegetable shortening
  2               cups  sugar
  4              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  water
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  bleached all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  chopped walnuts
  4             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        === CHOCOLATE ICING ===
  1              pound  confectioners' sugar
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- at room temperature

Fold in the walnuts and chopped chocolate, then spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. 

Bake until the cake springs back when touched, about 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool for 30 minutes.  Spread the icing over the cake with a rubber spatula.  Let cool completely before cutting into squares to serve.  Slice and serve individual pieces on a large platter. 

This recipe yields about 20 brownies.

Combine the yeast and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Add the melted butter and warm water.  Beat at low speed for 1 minute.  With the mixer running, add the egg yolks, then beat for 1 minute at medium-low speed.  Add the flour, salt, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon zest and beat until everything is incorporated. 

Increase the speed to high and beat until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, forms a ball, and starts to climb up the dough hook.  Remove the dough from the bowl. 

Using your hands from the dough into a smooth ball.  Lightly oil a bowl with the vegetable oil.  Place the dough in the bowl and turn it to oil all sides.  Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 2 hours. 

For the filling:  In a large mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese and 1 cup of the confectionersí sugar.  Blend by hand or with an electric mixer on low speed and set aside. 

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and divide the dough into fourths.  Using your fingers, pat it out into a rectangle.  Spread the filling lengthwise over the bottom half of each dough, then flip the top half of the dough over the filling.  Seal the edges, pinching the dough together.  Shape each dough into a flat cylinder and form into a ring and pinch the ends together so there isnít a seam. 

Insert the bean into the ring from the bottom so that it is completely hidden by the dough.  Cover the rings with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft-free place.  Let the dough rise until double in size, about 20 to 25 minutes. 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Brush the top of the risen cake with 2 tablespoons of the milk.  Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool completely on a wire rack. 

Make the icing:  Combine the remaining 3 tablespoons milk, lemon juice, remaining 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and the remaining 3 cups confectionersí sugar in a medium-size bowl.  Stir to blend well.  With a rubber spatula, spread the icing over the top of each cake.  Slice each cake into individual slices and serve.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CREPES ===
  1 1/2           cups  buckwheat flour
  1                cup  bleached all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, and
                        slightly cooled
  2               cups  milk
  2              large  eggs
                        Clarified butter -- for frying
  16           squares  parchment or waxed paper - (6" by 6")
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
     1/2         pound  bacon -- chopped
  8              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves

Make the Crepes:  Combine the flours and salt in a large mixing bowl.  In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine the melted butter, milk, eggs and whisk until blended.  Add the liquid mixture a little at a time to the dry mixture, whisking to dissolve any lumps.  Whisk until smooth. 

Lightly brush a 6-inch nonstick skillet with butter and heat over medium heat.  When the pan is hot, remove it from the heat and pour in 1/4 cup of the batter.  Swirl the pan around to spread the batter evenly over the bottom.  Return the pan to the heat and cook until lightly golden, 30 to 40 seconds.  Turn the crepe over and cook the second side for about 15 seconds.  Remove from the pan. 

Repeat the procedure until all of the batter is used, stacking the crepes between the squares of parchment or waxed paper to prevent them from sticking together.  Set the crepes aside and keep warm. 

For the filling:  In a non-stick pan, over medium heat, render the bacon until crispy.  In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs until frothy.  Add the cream.  Season with salt and pepper.  Pour off some of the bacon fat and add the egg mixture.  Scramble the eggs until soft. 

Spoon some of the egg mixture in the center of each crepe.  Fold the crepes over and place on individual serving plates.  Garnish with parsley. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  ground veal
     1/2         pound  ground beef chuck
     1/2         pound  ground pork
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onion
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-chopped garlic
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped green onions (green part on
                        or scallions
  1              large  egg
     1/4           cup  fine dried bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  16             small  garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/4           cup  bleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  Creole Seasoning -- see * Note
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  2               cups  thinly-sliced yellow onions
  1             bottle  Abita amber or other amber beer - (12 oz)
  1                cup  water
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1         large loaf  French bread - (26" to 28" long)
  6        tablespoons  Creole or whole grain mustard
  6        tablespoons  mayonnaise
     1/2         pound  provolone cheese -- thinly sliced

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection. 

In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meats, chopped yellow onion, chopped garlic, green onions, egg, bread crumbs, Worcestershire, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne.  Mix well with your hands and form into 16 meatballs.  Insert a garlic clove in the center of each meatball and pinch the meat around it. 

Combine the flour and Creole Seasoning in a shallow plate.  Roll the meatballs evenly in the flour mixture, tapping off any excess.  Reserve any remaining flour. 

In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the meatballs and brown evenly, using a spoon to turn them.  Remove the meatballs from the pan and set aside. 

With a wooden spoon, scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen any brown bits.  Stir in the reserved seasoned flour.  Stir constantly for 3 to 4 minutes to make a dark brown roux.  Add the sliced onions and season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the onions are slightly soft, about 2 minutes. 

Slowly pour in the beer and water and mix well.  Bring to a boil and return the meatballs to the skillet.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for about 1 hour, until the gravy is thick, turning and basting the meatballs with the pan gravy about every 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and skim off any fat that has risen to the surface.  Add the parsley. 

Cut the loaf of bread lengthwise in half.  Spread one half with the mustard and the other half with the mayonnaise.  Arrange the provolone on the bottom half of the bread, overlapping the slices, then arrange the meatballs on top of the cheese.  Spoon the gravy over the meatballs.  Top with the remaining bread half, cut into 6 equal portions, and serve immediately. 

Yield: 6 servings

     1/2      teaspoon  salt

     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  12                    quail - (abt 3 1/2 oz ea) -- breastbones removed,

  2        tablespoons  Creole Seasoning -- see * Note
                        === FOR THE BEANS ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2               cups  chopped yellow onions
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2         pound  andouille or fresh pork sausage -- removed from casings
                        and crumbled
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  1              pound  dried field peas - (abt 2 cups), picked ov
                        and rinsed
  1                     bay leaf

  8               cups  beef broth

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection. 

Make the quail:  Put the wine, olive oil, cane syrup, mustard, onion, garlic, salt, black pepper and cayenne in a blender and process until smooth, about 30 seconds.  Season the quail evenly with the Creole Seasoning.  Put them in a large 2-gallon plastic storage bag and pour in the marinade.  Close the bag securely.  Carefully toss to coat the quail evenly and refrigerate for 12 hours. 

Make the beans.  In a large, heavy stockpot or soup pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and black pepper and cook, stirring, until the onions are soft and lightly golden, about 4 minutes.  Add the sausage and cook, stirring, until brown, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, dried peas, bay leaf and thyme.  Cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the broth and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and cook, uncovered, until creamy and soft, about 1 1/2 hours.  Remove the bay leaf.  Keep warm. 

Preheat the grill.  Remove the quail from the marinade.  Grill until cooked through, about 8 minutes total, turning them every 2 minutes. 

To serve, mound equal amounts of the beans in the center of each of 6 serving plates and top each with 2 quail. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        shells and cartilage
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
     1/2           cup  chopped pickled jalapeÒos
     1/4         pound  Monterey Jack cheese with jalapeÒos -- grated
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  hot sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  2             ounces  Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese - grated
                        === TOASTED CROUTONS ===
  1               loaf  French bread - (abt 8" dia by 15" long) -- ends trimmed,
                        cut crosswise into 1/4" thick slices
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

For the croutons:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Arrange the bread slices on the baking sheet and brush them with half of the olive oil, then sprinkle them with 1/8 teaspoon of the salt and 1/8 teaspoon of the black pepper.  Turn the slices over, and brush them with the remaining oil, and sprinkle with the remaining salt and pepper.  Bake for about 6 minutes, then turn the baking sheet around in the oven to ensure even browning.  Bake until the croutons are lightly browned, about 6 more minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool completely before serving.  (Yields about 32 croutons) 

For the crab dip:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Combine the crabmeat, garlic, jalapeÒos, Monterey Jack, Worcestershire, hot sauce, salt, and mayonnaise in a medium-size mixing bowl.  Toss gently to mix.  Spoon the mixture into a medium-size baking dish.  Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese evenly on the top of the crabmeat mixture.  Bake until golden brown and bubbly, about 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let sit for about 5 minutes before serving with the croutons. 

This recipe yields 8 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE MAYONNAISE ===
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  homemade hot-pepper sauce
                        (or use store bought)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1                cup  olive oil
                        === FOR THE SCALLOPS ===
  12             large  scallop shells - (available at
                        gourmet shops)
  24             large  sea scallops -- each cut
                        horizontally in half
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions or scallions -- green parts only

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 

In a blender, combine the egg, mustard, hot sauce, lemon juice, Worcestershire, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes.  Process until smooth, about 30 seconds.  With the motor running, pour in the oil in a slow, steady stream.  The mixture will thicken.  Refrigerate until ready to use. 

Put the scallop shells on a baking sheet.  Season both sides of the scallops with the salt and black pepper.  Place 2 scallops in each shell and spoon about 2 tablespoons of the mayonnaise over them.  Bake on the top rack of the oven until the mayonnaise is golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Garnish with the green onions and serve hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1                cup  simple syrup -- plus
  2        tablespoons  simple syrup
  1            package  unflavored gelatin
  1                cup  heavy cream -- chilled
  1                cup  Lemon Curd -- (see below)
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2               cups  sweetened whipped cream
                        Fresh mint sprigs
                        === SPONGE CAKE ===
     1/2           cup  milk
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  8              large  eggs
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        === LEMON CURD ===
  3                     lemons
  6              large  egg yolks
  1                cup  sugar
  6        tablespoons  butter -- cold

Line 6 (3-inch) metal pipe molds with parchment paper, having the parchment come 3 to 4 inches over the top of the mold (it should look like a mold for a frozen souffle).  Chill the bowl and wire whip of an electric mixer in the freezer. 

In a small saucepan combine the lemon juice, 2 tablespoons simple syrup and gelatin.  Stir to soften the gelatin.  Place over low heat and cook until the gelatin dissolves, stirring constantly.  Remove from the heat and pour into a mixing bowl. 

Remove the bowl and whip from the freezer and add the heavy cream.  Whip the cream until soft peaks form.  Combine the gelatin mixture and lemon curd.  Mix well.  Add the lemon mixture to the whipped cream.  Continue to beat until the cream forms stiff peaks.  Brush the sponge cake with the remaining 1 cup of simple syrup. 

Using a 3-inch round cutter, cut the cake into 6 rounds.  Place a cake round at the bottom of each of the molds.  Spoon 1 cup of the mousse into each prepared mold, on top of the cake.  Cover the molds with plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours or overnight until the mousse is firm. 

For the Sponge Cake:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a small saucepan, warm the milk and 2 teaspoons of the butter together over medium-low heat.  With an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip, beat the eggs and 1 cup of the sugar on medium-high speed in a large mixing bowl until the mixture is pale yellow, thick, and tripled in volume, about 8 minutes.  With the mixer on low speed, beat in the warm milk mixture. 

Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a small mixing bowl.  Add half the flour mixture to the egg mixture and blend thoroughly until smooth.  Repeat with the other half.  Add the vanilla and mix gently. 

Grease a 17- by 12-inch baking pan or jelly-roll pan with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter.  Sprinkle evenly with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.  Pour the cake batter into the pan, spreading it evenly.  Bake until the cake springs back when touched, about 15 minutes.  Cool for about 2 minutes, then gently flip it out onto a large sheet of parchment paper.  Let cool completely.  (Yields 1 (17- by 12-inch) sheet cake) 

For the Lemon Curd:  Zest all of the lemons and set aside.  Juice the zested lemons (should have 1/2 cup of juice) and strain the juice.  In a small mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and yolks until smooth.  Stir in the zest and lemon juice.  Pour the mixture into a nonreactive saucepan.  Over medium heat, bring to a simmer.  Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon.  Remove from the heat and pour into a glass bowl.  Stir in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Cool to room temperature.  (Yields 2 1/2 cups) 

To Serve:  Remove the molds from the refrigerator and carefully remove the ring molds and parchment paper.  Place the cakes on serving plates.  Garnish with the whipped cream and mint. 

This recipe yields 6 cakes.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Line 6 (3-inch) metal pipe molds with parchment paper, having the parchment come 3 to 4 inches over the top of the mold (it should look like a mold for a frozen souffle).  Chill the bowl and wire whip of an electric mixer in the freezer. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a small saucepan combine the lemon juice, 2 tablespoons simple syrup and gelatin.  Stir to soften the gelatin.  Place over low heat and cook until the gelatin dissolves, stirring constantly.  Remove from the heat and pour into a mixing bowl. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Remove the bowl and whip from the freezer and add the heavy cream.  Whip the cream until soft peaks form.  Combine the gelatin mixture and lemon curd.  Mix well.  Add the lemon mixture to the whipped cream.  Continue to beat until the cream forms stiff peaks.  Brush the sponge cake with the remaining 1 cup of simple syrup. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Using a 3-inch round cutter, cut the cake into 6 rounds.  Place a cake round at the bottom of each of the molds.  Spoon 1 cup of the mousse into each prepared mold, on top of the cake.  Cover the molds with plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours or overnight until the mousse is firm. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;For the Sponge Cake:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a small saucepan, warm the milk and 2 teaspoons of the butter together over medium-low heat.  With an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip, beat the eggs and 1 cup of the sugar on medium-high speed in a large mixing bowl until the mixture is pale yellow, thick, and tripled in volume, about 8 minutes.  With the mixer on low speed, beat in the warm milk mixture. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a small mixing bowl.  Add half the flour mixture to the egg mixture and blend thoroughly until smooth.  Repeat with the other half.  Add the vanilla and mix gently. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Grease a 17- by 12-inch baking pan or jelly-roll pan with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter.  Sprinkle evenly with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.  Pour the cake batter into the pan, spreading it evenly.  Bake until the cake springs back when touched, about 15 minutes.  Cool for about 2 minutes, then gently flip it out onto a large sheet of parchment paper.  Let cool completely.  (Yields 1 (17- by 12-inch) sheet cake) 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;For the Lemon Curd:  Zest all of the lemons and set aside.  Juice the zested lemons (should have 1/2 cup of juice) and strain the juice.  In a small mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and yolks until smooth.  Stir in the zest and lemon juice.  Pour the mixture into a nonreactive saucepan.  Over medium heat, bring to a simmer.  Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon.  Remove from the heat and pour into a glass bowl.  Stir in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Cool to room temperature.  (Yields 2 1/2 cups) 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To Serve:  Remove the molds from the refrigerator and carefully remove the ring molds and parchment paper.  Place the cakes on serving plates.  Garnish with the whipped cream and mint. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 6 cakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CREPES ===
  2               cups  bleached all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  confectionersí sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, and
                        slightly cooled
  2               cups  milk
  2              large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
  16           squares  parchment or waxed paper - (6" by 6")
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  1              pound  cream cheese -- at room temperature
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest
     1/2           cup  fresh orange juice
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        === ORANGE SAUCE ==
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- at room temperature
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  pecan pieces
  1                cup  fresh orange juice
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest
     1/2           cup  Grand Marnier
  2        tablespoons  Triple Sec

Make the Crepes:  Combine the flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl.  In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine the melted butter, milk, eggs, and vanilla and whisk until blended.  Add the liquid mixture a little at a time to the dry mixture, whisking to dissolve any lumps.  Whisk until smooth. 

Lightly brush a 6-inch nonstick skillet with vegetable oil and heat over medium heat.  When the pan is hot, remove it from the heat and pour in 1/4 cup of the batter.  Swirl the pan around to spread the batter evenly over the bottom.  Return the pan to the heat and cook until lightly golden, 30 to 40 seconds.  Turn the crepe over and cook the second side for about 15 seconds.  Remove from the pan.  Repeat the procedure until all of the batter is used, stacking the crepes between the squares of parchment or waxed paper to prevent them from sticking together.  Set the crepes aside. 

Make the Filling:  Put the cream cheese in a medium-size mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer until fluffy.  Add the sour cream, confectioners' sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and vanilla.  Beat to blend well, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. 

Put 3 tablespoons of the filling in the center of the lower third of each crepe.  Fold the bottom of the crepe over the filling and roll up gently but firmly.  Place the filled crepes on a large platter or baking sheet, cover lightly, and refrigerate for 1 hour. 

For the Orange sauce:  In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter.  Add the granulated sugar and pecan pieces and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the orange juice and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes.  Add the orange zest and cook for 1 minute.  Add the Grand Marnier and Triple Sec and simmer for 2 minutes. 

Add 8 of the filled crepes to the pan and cook for 1 minute, basting with the orange sauce.  Remove the crepes from the pan, set aside, and keep warm.  Add the remaining crepes and cook for 1 minute, basting with the orange sauce. 

To serve, crisscross 2 crepes on each dessert plate and drizzle with the Orange Sauce. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

           Orange Galettes With Citrus Cream And Caramel Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter -- room temperature
  1                cup  confectionersí sugar
  2              large  egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped orange zest
     1/2           cup  ground pecans
     3/4           cup  flour -- sifted
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
                        Shaker of confectionersí sugar
  1         tablespoon  chiffonade fresh mint
                        === CITRUS CREAM ===
  1                cup  orange curd
  1                cup  sweetened whipped cream
                        === CARAMEL SAUCE ===
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  1                cup  heavy cream

In mixing bowl, with a wooden spoon, cream the butter and sugar together.  Add the yolks, 1 at a time, and mix thoroughly.  Stir in the zest, pecans and flour.  Add the vanilla and mix well. 

Form the dough into a log, 2 inches in diameter and 4 inches long.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Remove from the refrigerator and cut into rounds, 1/4-inch thick.  Place on a parchment lined baking sheet, 2 inches apart.  Bake for about 10 minutes or until lightly browned on the edges.  Bake in batches.  Remove from the oven and cool on wire racks.  (Makes 1 dozen) 

For the Citrus Cream:  In a mixing bowl, fold the orange curd and whipped cream together.  (Makes about 2 cups) 

For the Caramel Sauce:  In a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is a deep caramel color and has the consistency of a thin syrup, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in the cream, return the saucepan to the high heat, and boil the sauce until it regains the consistency of a thick syrup, about 2 minutes.  Cool.  (Yields about 3/4 cup) 

To assemble, place galettes in the center of each of 4 plates.  Spoon some of the Citrus Cream mixture over the cookie.  Lay a second cookie on top of the cream.  Repeat with the remaining cream and cookies.  Drizzle the entire cookie with the Caramel Sauce.  Garnish with confectionersí sugar and the mint. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, fry the bacon until crisp, about 8 minutes.  Add the onions, salt, and cayenne and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and butter, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes until the butter melts.  Add the flour and, stirring slowly and constantly, cook for 2 minutes.  Add the milk and wine and stir to blend. 

Reduce the heat to medium, then add the mushrooms and shrimp.  Stir and fold to mix and cook until the mixture is very thick, about 12 minutes.  Add the lemon juice, green onions, and parsley and stir to mix well.  Remove from the heat, add the beaten egg yolks, and blend well.  Let cool to room temperature. 

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Arrange the reserved oyster shells on a bed of rock salt in 4 pie pans or on a large baking sheet.  Put an oyster in each shell and top it with about 2 heaping tablespoons of the sauce.  Or, the oysters can be put in a shallow pan (without the shells and rock salt) and topped with the sauce to bake.  Bake until the sauce is delicately browned and the oysters begin to curl at the edges, about 20 minutes.  Serve hot. 

This recipe yields 12 servings (3 oysters per person).

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             slices  white bread
  1                cup  water
     1/4         pound  ground veal
     1/4         pound  ground beef chuck
     1/4         pound  ground pork
     1/4           cup  minced onions
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped green onions
  2             quarts  beef stock
     1/2         pound  dried pasta sheets -- broken small pieces
  1              pound  Swiss chard -- cleaned, stemmed,
                        and shredded
  4             ounces  Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- grated

Form the mixture into a small ball and blanch in the water for 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the water, cool slightly and taste.  Adjust the seasoning accordingly. 

Form the meat mixture into small balls, about the shape of quarter.  Bring the beef stock to a simmer, add the meat balls and cook for 25 to 30 minutes.  Add the pasta and Swiss chard, continue to cook until the pasta is tender, about 6 to 8 minutes. 

To serve, ladle the soup into individual bowls.  Garnish with the cheese. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     eggs -- separated
  1 3/4           cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  milk
  4               cups  fresh raspberries
  8             sprigs  fresh mint

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Whip the egg yolks and 1 cup of the sugar until it reaches the ribbon stage.  Add the flour and mix well.  Whisk in the lemon juice, salt, and milk until completely combined. 

In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Add 1/2 cup of the sugar, and whip until stiff peaks form.  Gently fold the egg whites into the lemon mixture. 

Pour the batter into a parchment lined 9 by 13-inch cake pan and bake for 30 minutes, or until lightly browned.  Remove the cake from the oven and let cool slightly, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour. 

Place a piece of plastic wrap over the pudding cake and flip it onto a flat surface.  Cut into 8 (3-inch) circles with a ring cutter. 

To prepare the sauce:  Reserve 16 raspberries for a garnish.  Puree the remaining raspberries with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar for 2 minutes or until smooth.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve. 

To serve, spoon some of the raspberry sauce in the center of each plate and top with a circle of pudding cake.  Place 2 raspberries and a mint sprig in the center of each cake. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2      teaspoon  unsalted butter -- plus
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- at room temperature
     1/2      teaspoon  bleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  1 1/2           cups  bleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  4              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1              pinch  salt
                        === VANILLA-PRALINE ICE CREAM ===
  2               cups  milk
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  sugar
  1                     vanilla bean -- split, scraped
  6              large  egg yolks
  8                     Peanut Butter And Chocolate Pralines -- crumbled
                        == PEANUT BUTTER AND CHOCOLATE PRALINES ==
  1              pound  light brown sugar
                        (abt 3 firmly packed cups)
     3/4           cup  evaporated milk
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  creamy peanut butter
  2          teaspoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2               cups  pecan pieces

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour a 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan with 1/2 teaspoon of the butter and 1/2 teaspoon of the flour. 

In a large mixing bowl, cream the remaining 1/2 pound (2 sticks) butter and the sugar together with an electric mixer until smooth.  Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating after each addition.  Beat in the vanilla. 

Into a medium-size mixing bowl, sift the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour, the cocoa, baking powder, and salt together.  Add 1/3 of the flour mixture at a time to the butter-sugar mixture, beating after each addition.  Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and bake until it springs back when touched, about 50 minutes. 

Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then remove it from the pan and let cool completely on the rack. 

Vanilla-Praline Ice Cream:  In a medium-size, nonreactive saucepan over medium heat, combine the milk, cream, sugar, and vanilla bean and pulp.  Whisk to dissolve as the mixture heats.  Heat the mixture to the scalding point (when bubbles form around the edges of the pan); do not let it boil.  Remove from the heat. 

Beat the egg yolks in a large mixing bowl.  Add the hot cream mixture about 1/4 cup at a time to the beaten yolks, whisking well after each addition.  Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook, stirring over medium heat until the mixture becomes thick enough to lightly coat the back of a spoon, 2 to 3 minutes, do not let it boil.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a glass bowl.  Cover the top of the mixture with plastic wrap (this will keep a skin from forming) and let cool. Place the mixture in the refrigerator and chill completely. 

Pour the mixture into an ice cream machine and follow the manufacturer's instructions for the churning time.  Once the ice cream is almost ready, about 5 minutes before the churning time is complete, add the crumbled pralines through the ingredients spout.  Continue to churn until the ice cream freezes. 

Line an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2- by 2 1/2-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap.  Scoop the ice cream into the pan, smooth the top, cover, and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.  When ready to assemble the ice cream sandwiches, lift the ice cream out with the plastic wrap. 

Peanut Butter and Chocolate Pralines:  Combine the brown sugar, milk, salt, butter, peanut butter, and cocoa in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir to dissolve as the mixture heats.  Continue to cook, stirring, until the mixture begins to bubble around the edges of the pan and reaches 234 degrees to 240 degrees on a candy thermometer, or the soft ball stage (that is, when a bit of the mixture is dropped into cold water, it forms a soft ball that flattens), about 12 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the pecans. 

Drop the mixture by the tablespoonful onto a waxed or parchment paper on a baking sheet and let cool completely.  Lift the pralines off the paper with a thin knife.  Pralines can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.  Makes about 1 1/2 dozen pralines) 

To Assemble:  After the ice cream is firm, remove it from the pan.  Cut the ice cream into 16 slices.  Place 1 slice of ice cream between 2 slices of pound cake, forming a sandwich.  Repeat the process until all of the cake is used.  Wrap each sandwich in plastic wrap and freeze until ready to serve.  To serve, unwrap the sandwiches and serve each with a praline on the side. 

This recipe yields 16 ice cream sandwiches.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  baking potatoes -- washed
                        Oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  egg
     1/2           cup  flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  milk
  1                cup  water
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1              pound  gorgonzola cheese

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Season the potatoes with the oil, salt and pepper.  Place on a baking sheet and bake until tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Remove from the oven and cool completely. 

Peel the potatoes, discarding the skin, and place in a bowl.  With a hand potato masher, mash the potatoes until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the egg and 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the flour. 

Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup flour on a baking sheet, lined with parchment paper.  Turn the dough onto the floured surface and roll into a log, about 1-inch thick.  Cut the dough into 1-inch pieces.  Roll each piece across the tines of a fork. 

In a large saucepan, combine the milk, water, 1 teaspoon olive oil, salt and pepper.  Bring the liquid just to a boil.  Add the gnocchi and poach for 5 minutes.  Remove the gnocchi with a slotted spoon and drain. 

Place the cream in a saucepan over medium heat.  Bring to a simmer.  Whisk in the cheese and season with salt and pepper.  Toss the gnocchi with the cream sauce.  Spoon onto a large serving platter.  Garnish with black pepper. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  2        tablespoons  milk
  8        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic

Sprinkle the bread crumbs over the potatoes and continue to saute for 1 minute.  Remove the fish from the pan and drain on paper towels. 

Wipe out the skillet.  Melt the remaining butter.  Add the almonds.  Season with salt and pepper.  Saute for 1 minute or until the almonds are golden.  Remove from the heat and add the lemon juice and the chopped parsley. 

Fry the parsley sprigs until crispy.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt and pepper.

  6                     squabs - (abt 1 lb ea)
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  chopped yellow onions
  1                cup  chopped carrots
  1                cup  chopped celery

  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions (green part only)
                        or scallions
                        === ORANGE RICE ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2               cups  chopped yellow onions
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  2             medium  navel oranges -- peeled, white pith
                        removed, and chopped, with their juice -- (abt 1 1/2 cups)
  3                     bay leaves
  1              pound  long-grain rice - (abt 2 cups)
  4               cups  water
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves

Trim the birds, removing the heads, feet, and first joints of the wings.  (If your birds come without heads and feet, ask for them from your butcher.)  Remove the livers and hearts from the cavities and discard.  Rinse the birds well under cool running water.  Set the birds aside. 

For the Sauce:  In a medium-size saucepan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil.  Add the bird trimmings along with the salt and black pepper and cook, stirring, until well-browned, about 15 minutes. 

Add the onions, carrots, celery, bay leaves, and thyme and cook, stirring to loosen any brown bits from the bottom of the pan, for 5 minutes.  Add the tomato paste, stir to mix, and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the wine, stir, and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the water, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer for 1 hour. 

Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into another saucepan or a gravy boat.  Skim off any fat that rises to the surface. 

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Rub the birds with the olive oil and season with the salt and black pepper.  Put the birds breast-side down on a rack fitted over a baking sheet.  Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes (and the internal temperature is 150 degrees).  Remove from the oven and let sit for 10 minutes. 

For the Orange Rice:  In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil.  Add the onions, salt, and cayenne and cook, stirring, for 4 minutes.  Add the oranges and their juice, the bay leaves, and rice and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the water and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until all the water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.  Remove the bay leaves and let stand with the lid on for 10 minutes before serving.  Remove from the heat, add the green onions and parsley, and stir gently to mix. 

To carve, cut each bird lengthwise, in half, then cut out the backbone.  To serve, arrange an equal portion of the rice in the center of each serving plate, put half a squab on top of the rice, and then drizzle with about 2 tablespoons of the sauce. 

This recipe yields 12 servings.

<DirS>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Trim the birds, removing the heads, feet, and first joints of the wings.  (If your birds come without heads and feet, ask for them from your butcher.)  Remove the livers and hearts from the cavities and discard.  Rinse the birds well under cool running water.  Set the birds aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;For the Sauce:  In a medium-size saucepan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil.  Add the bird trimmings along with the salt and black pepper and cook, stirring, until well-browned, about 15 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Add the onions, carrots, celery, bay leaves, and thyme and cook, stirring to loosen any brown bits from the bottom of the pan, for 5 minutes.  Add the tomato paste, stir to mix, and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the wine, stir, and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the water, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer for 1 hour. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into another saucepan or a gravy boat.  Skim off any fat that rises to the surface. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Rub the birds with the olive oil and season with the salt and black pepper.  Put the birds breast-side down on a rack fitted over a baking sheet.  Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes (and the internal temperature is 150 degrees).  Remove from the oven and let sit for 10 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;For the Orange Rice:  In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil.  Add the onions, salt, and cayenne and cook, stirring, for 4 minutes.  Add the oranges and their juice, the bay leaves, and rice and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the water and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until all the water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.  Remove the bay leaves and let stand with the lid on for 10 minutes before serving.  Remove from the heat, add the green onions and parsley, and stir gently to mix. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To carve, cut each bird lengthwise, in half, then cut out the backbone.  To serve, arrange an equal portion of the rice in the center of each serving plate, put half a squab on top of the rice, and then drizzle with about 2 tablespoons of the sauce. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 12 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  red snapper or redfish - (abt 6 1/2 lbs) -- cleaned, scaled
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  Creole seasoning
  1                box  kosher salt - (3 lbs)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh parsley leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh tarragon leaves
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
     1/4           cup  grated lemon zest
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest
                        Juice of 2 oranges - (abt 1/2 cup)
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6               cups  cooked sticky rice -- warm
                        Fresh Orange And Tomato Salsa -- (see recipe)
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  With a sharp knife, make 5 slits, at an angle and about 1 1/2 inches apart, on each side of the fish.  Rub 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over each side of the fish, then season each side with Creole seasoning.  Place the fish on the prepared baking sheet. 

Combine the kosher salt, herbs, lemon zest, and juice, orange zest and juice, and black pepper in a large mixing bowl.  Mix well.  Mound the mixture evenly on the surface of the fish, leaving the head and tail uncovered.  With your fingers, firmly press the mixture into the flesh. 

Bake for 1 1/2 hours.  Remove from the oven and cool for 2 minutes.  With the back of a heavy spoon or a mallet, lightly pound the salt crust to crack it open, beginning at the tail end.  Carefully pull off the salt crust.  Then, with a small spatula or wide knife, remove the flesh from the bone from the top side of the fish.  Remove the back bone, then serve the flesh from the bottom sides of the fish. 

Spoon the rice in the center of each serving plate.  Lay the fish on top of the rice.  Spoon some of the Fresh Orange And Tomato Salsa over each serving.  Garnish with parsley. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Season the tenderloin with olive oil and Creole seasoning.  Heat a medium skillet over medium heat.  Add the tenderloin and sear for 2 minutes on each side.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.  Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and place in the freezer and freeze for 1 hour. 

Remove from the freezer and slice into 6 equal pieces.  Place each piece between two sheets of plastic wrap.  Using a meat mallet, pound out each piece very thin.  Keep between the plastic wrap until ready to use.  Place in the refrigerator until ready to use. 

Trim off the leaves of the artichokes.  Using a mandoline, slice the artichoke into thin slices.  Lightly toss the artichokes with lemon juice to prevent browning.  Season with salt and pepper. 

To serve, place the carpaccio over each serving plate.  Place a thin layer of the artichokes over the meat.  Garnish with a drizzle of the truffle oil and the cheese. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    sugarcane swizzle sticks, each cut into
                        about 3" pieces
  8             pounds  spiral-sliced hickory smoked ham -- (to 10 lbs)
                        (no bone, water added, cooked)
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1                cup  Steen's 100% Pure Cane Syrup
     1/2           cup  dark molasses
     1/2           cup  dark corn syrup
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/8      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/4           cup  water
  1 1/2         pounds  Granny Smith apples - (abt 4)
  1 1/2         pounds  Bartlett pears - (abt 4)
  2              dozen  medium buttermilk biscuits

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line a shallow baking pan with parchment or waxed paper.  Insert the sugarcane sticks into the ham at 3 to 4-inch intervals.  Tie the ham, using kitchen twine, at two inch intervals horizontally and vertically to keep it together.  Place on a wire rack in the baking pan. 

In a mixing bowl, combine all of the ingredients together except for the mustard and water.  Mix well.  In a small bowl, dissolve the mustard in the water, then add to the spice mixture.  Blend well.  (Yields: 2 1/2 cups) 

Brush the entire ham with the glaze, coating it evenly.  Wash, core, and halve the fruit.  Place all around the ham.  Baste the ham a second time and baste the fruit with the glaze.  Bake for 45 minutes.  Baste the ham and fruit again.  Bake another 45 minutes. 

Remove the ham from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes.  Remove and discard the string and swizzle sticks.  Serve the apples and pears on a platter with the ham.  Serve everything warm or at room temperature.  Serve the biscuits on the side. 

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PASTRY ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  lard -- cold
  6        tablespoons  ice cold water - (to 7 tbspns)
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
     1/2         pound  pork shoulder -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/2         pound  veal shoulder -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/2         pound  beef shoulder -- cut 1/2" cubes
  4             ounces  salt pork -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1                cup  finely-chopped onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2             medium  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        diced 1/2" cubes
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     egg -- beaten

In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt.  Mix well.  Add the shortening and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the water and let sit for 1 minute.  Using either a fork or your hands, carefully press the mixture together forming a soft ball.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 

Using a meat grinder or an electric mixer fitted with a medium course die, grind the meat and fat together.  In a mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, onions, garlic, salt and pepper.  Mix well, cover and refrigerate overnight. 

Place the potatoes in a medium bowl and cover with water, cover and refrigerate overnight. 

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured surface.  Cut the dough in half and roll the dough out on the floured surface into a circle about 12 inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick. 

Combine the meat and potatoes together and mix well.  Preheat the oven 350 degrees. 

Gently fold the circle of dough in half and then in half again so that you can lift it without tearing it, and unfold into a 9- by 2-inch deep-dish pie pan.  Spoon the meat mixture into the pie crust.  Lay the second pie crust over the meat mixture.  Crimp the edges and place in the oven.  Bake for 30 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 300 degrees and continue to cook for 1 1/2 hours. 

Remove from the oven and cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.  Slice the pie into individual servings.  Garnish with parsley. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  unbleached strong white flour -- plus
  14            ounces  unbleached strong white flour
  2             ounces  rice flour or corn flour
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1              ounce  fresh yeast
  3 3/4            cup  warm water
     3/4           cup  brown ale
  4          teaspoons  warmed clear honey
                        A little oil for greasing

Mix the flours and salt in a warm bowl.  Blend the yeast to a cream with a little of the water, then mix in the ale, honey and 2 1/2 cups of the remaining water.  Stir the liquid into the flour mixture and mix to a firm dough, adding more water if it does not cohere. 

On a board or work-top, knead the dough for about 8 minutes.  Shape into a ball.  Oil the inside of the bowl, add the dough and cover it loosely with oiled greaseproof paper.  Leave in a warm place to double in bulk. 

Punch down the dough and cut it in half.  Shape 1/2 into 2 equal sized round loaves and the other half into rolls.  Make a cross-cut in the top of each loaf.  Place on oiled baking sheets, well apart, cover loosely with oiled grease-proof paper and leave to proof in a warm place. 

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Bake the rolls until golden, about 15 to 17 minutes and the loaves for 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool slightly before serving. 

This recipe yields 2 round loaves and 8 to 10 rolls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  6             pounds  wild boar stew meat -- cut into pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  chopped onions
  1                cup  chopped carrots
  1                cup  chopped celery
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1                     bay leaf
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1                cup  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
  1              quart  beef stock
  1                     Foie Gras lobe, grade B -- cleaned
  2           packages  Knox Gelatin
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
  2              dozen  pumpernickel toast points
     1/2           cup  whole grain mustard

In a large saucepan, over medium heat, add the oil.  Season the boar with salt and pepper.  When the oil is hot, sear boar for 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Remove from the pan and set aside. 

Add the onions, carrots, and celery to the pan.  Season with salt and pepper.  Saute for 2 minutes.  Stir in the garlic, bay leaf and tomatoes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Continue to saute for 2 minutes. 

Stir in the beef stock and add the reserved stew meat.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the meat is tender, about 4 hours, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.  Remove the stew meat and set aside. 

Strain the liquid, discarding the vegetables.  Place the liquid back over the heat and reduce to 1 cup.  Dissolve the gelatin in 1/2 cup of cold water.  Add to the reduced liquid.  Shred the meat, discarding fat. 

Line a 12-inch long by 4 inches wide by 3 inches deep terrine mold with plastic wrap.  In a hot saute pan, over medium heat, sear the foie gras for 1 minute on each side.  Remove from the heat and drain on paper towels.  Strain the foie gras fat and set aside. 

Line the terrine mold with half of the meat.  Lay the foie gras over the meat.  Place the remaining meat over the foie gras and press firmly.  Slowly pour the foie gras fat and gelatin mixture over the terrine, letting the liquid soak into the terrine.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. 

Carefully place the terrine mold in warm water to loosen the mold.  Unwrap the plastic wrap and place on a serving platter.  Slice the terrine into individual servings garnish with parsley and serve with the toasted bread and mustard. 

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne -- to taste
     1/2         pound  large shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        and cut into 1/2" pieces
  3                     eggs -- beaten
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3 1/4           cups  flour
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
                        Crystal Hot Sauce -- to taste
                        Worcestershire sauce -- to taste
  1              pound  fresh zucchini -- grated
                        Solid vegetable shortening -- for deep-frying
                        Creole seasoning (Essence) -- to taste
                        Roasted Red Pepper Emulsion -- (see recipe)

Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onions.  Season with salt and pepper and sautÈ for about 3 minutes, or until slightly wilted.  Season the shrimp with salt and pepper.  Add the shrimp and sautÈ until the shrimp turn pink, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove and set aside to cool. 

Make a batter by combining the eggs, milk, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and the cayenne.  Add the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, beating and incorporating until all is used and the batter is smooth.  Stir in the parsley.  Season the batter with hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce.  Season the zucchini with salt and pepper.  Add the shrimp mixture and grated zucchini to the batter and fold to mix. 

Heat the shortening to 360 degrees.  Drop the batter, a heaping tablespoon at a time, into the hot oil.  When the fritters pop to the surface, roll them around with a slotted spoon in the oil to brown them evenly.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with Creole seasoning and serve with the Roasted Red Pepper Emulsion. 

This recipe yields about 2 dozen.
