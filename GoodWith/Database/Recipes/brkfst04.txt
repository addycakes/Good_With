--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  baking potatoes
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine -- plus
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine

Scrub potatoes; prick each several times with a fork.  Bake at 400 degrees for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until tender; cool slightly.

                           Anaheim Chile Strata

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 9     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     Anaheim peppers -- roasted
  2               cups  grated Monterey Jack cheese
  2               cups  grated Cheddar cheese
  4        tablespoons  whole wheat flour
  8             ounces  Carnation evaporated milk
  1                     container sour cream - (8 oz)
  4                     eggs
  12            ounces  roasted boneless skinless chicken breasts
  16            ounces  Ortega salsa - thick & chunky (medium)

To roast peppers:  Roast peppers by placing them under the broiler, holding them over a gas flame or roasting them on the stovetop in a cast-iron skillet until charred.

In the broiler:  Preheat broiler; place peppers on broiler rack and broil, turning frequently, until bubbly and blackened on all sides, 15 to 20 minutes.  Transfer peppers into a paper bag; close bag and set aside until cool, about 15 minutes.

Over a gas flame:  (If only one or two peppers are being roasted, this method may be preferable.)  Holding the pepper in tongs over a medium-low to medium flame, turn pepper as it bubbles and blackens, about 15 minutes.  Transfer pepper into a paper bag; close bag and set aside until cool, about 15 minutes more.

In a cast-iron skillet:  Heat large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, using no oil; when hot, place peppers in skillet and roast, turning frequently, until bubbly and blackened on all sides, 15 to 20 minutes.  Transfer peppers into a paper bag; close bag and set aside until cool, about 15 minutes.

After cooling, peel peppers by gently pulling off skin; remove seeds.

To prepare strata:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly spray a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish with vegetable baking spray.  Lay chiles flat, cut-side up in prepared baking dish.  Combine Monterey Jack and cheddar in a mixing bowl, toss lightly to mix.  Sprinkle evenly over chilies; set aside.

Mix flour with milk in a large mixing bowl; stir in sour cream.  Beat in eggs, one at a time with an electric mixer or whisk.  Dice chicken; add chicken to mixing bowl and stir to combine well.

Pour mixture into baking dish; bake for 30 minutes.  Remove from oven, spread salsa over top; bake an additional 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 9 servings.

Tip:  Poblano chiles and banana peppers can each be used in place of Anaheim; treat them the same way.  However the banana pepper can be a little bit hot.  Wear rubber gloves when working with any hot chile; wash hands thoroughly after working with chiles.

Description:
  "Reminiscent of the famous chiles rellenos, Anaheim Chile Strata is a
  layered version rich in cheese, milk, sour cream and egg.  Roasted
  Anaheim chiles, tender and sweet nestle in this creamy dish perfect
  for brunch or lunch."

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             slices  white bread
  1         tablespoon  butter -- softened

                Egg Dishes                      Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  French bread -- diced
  3        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  1              pound  Monterey Jack cheese -- shredded
     1/4         pound  salami -- sliced
  10                    eggs
  1 1/2           cups  2% milk
     1/3           cup  white wine
  3                     green onions -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  brown mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1                cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese

In a greased 13- by 9-inch baking dish, spread French bread cubes and drizzle with butter.  Sprinkle on cheese and salami.

In a medium bowl beat together eggs, milk, wine, green onions, mustard, pepper and red pepper flakes.  Pour over casserole, cover, and refrigerate overnight.

Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Bake, covered, for 1 hour.  Uncover, spread sour cream on top, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Bake, uncovered, an additional 10 minutes or until lightly browned.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  If calories are a concern, don't be shy about making a few substitutions.  Cut back on some of the Monterey Jack cheese, use egg substitute in place of 4 to 6 of the eggs, and try low-fat sour cream at the end.  But don't cut out all of the fat, or this yummy casserole won't bake properly and you'll have a gooey mess to serve!

Description:
  "Salami and white wine set this breakfast strata apart from the rest. 
  A creamy layer of sour cream and Parmesan cheese baked on at the end
  send it out into orbit!"

  1                can  condensed cream of celery soup - (10 oz)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     potatoes -- peeled, sliced
  2          teaspoons  corn oil
  1              pound  andouille sausage -- cut 1/4" rounds
     1/2                green bell pepper -- seeded, diced
     1/2                red bell pepper -- seeded, diced
     1/2      teaspoon  seasoning salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     onion -- peeled, diced

Place sliced potatoes in a large bowl of cold water and allow to sit for 10 minutes.  Drain, rinse and replace water and allow to sit for an additional 10 minutes; drain.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add sausage to skillet and sautÈ for about 2 minutes.  Add potatoes, peppers, seasoning salt and pepper.

Cover, lower heat to medium, and continue to cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add onion and cook mixture until ingredients are tender, about 3 more minutes.  Serve warm.

Comments:  Spicy andouille sausage makes this dish authentic with Cajun flavor.  However, any spicy sausage would be great in this hearty dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BISCUITS ===
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  double-acting baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  cold unsalted butter -- cut into bits
     2/3           cup  grated sharp cheddar
  2        tablespoons  milk
                        === HAM AND EGGS ===
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2              large  eggs
  2             slices  cooked ham
                        Sliced green onions -- for garnish

To make the Biscuits:  Into a bowl sift together the flour, baking powder salt.  Cut in the butter, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Stir in the cheese and then add the milk, stirring, to form a soft sticky dough.

On a floured surface pat the dough out into a 6-inch square and cut out 4 rounds with a 2 3/4-inch round cutter dipped in flour.  Put 2 of the rounds on top of the remaining 2 rounds, press them together gently, and bake the biscuits on a buttered baking sheet in the middle of a preheated 425 degree oven for 15 minutes or until they are pale golden.  (Makes 2 large biscuits)

To make the Ham And Eggs:  While the biscuits are baking, in a large skillet heat the butter over moderate heat, swirling the skillet, until it just begins to turn golden brown, slide the eggs carefully into the skillet, and cook them, basting them with the butter, until the yolks are just set and the whites are slightly crisp around the edges.

Halve the biscuits horizontally, arrange a ham slice, folding it, on each lower half, and top it with an egg.  Drizzle the butter over the eggs, sprinkle the eggs with the chopped green onion, and top them with the upper biscuit halves.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  chicken stock
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2           cups  regular grits
  1                cup  crumbled cooked drained smoked bacon
                        = (abt 1 lb uncooked)
  1 3/4           cups  shredded Monterey Jack
  4                     green onions -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  Tabasco jalapeÒo sauce
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large, heavy saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a boil.  Adjust the heat to a simmer.  Add 1 tablespoon of the butter.  When it has melted, begin to pour in the grits with one hand while constantly whisking long-handled wooden spoon and stir until the grits become thick and absorb the liquid.  This should take from 7 to 10 minutes.

Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, bacon, cheese, green onions and Tabasco.  Combine everything thoroughly and season with salt and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter an 8-inch square pan, or other similar-sized baking pan, and spread the grits into the pan.  Bake for 30 minutes or until they are heated through.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

In a large, heavy saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a boil.  Adjust the heat to a simmer.  Add 1 tablespoon of the butter.  When it has melted, begin to pour in the grits with one hand while constantly whisking long-handled wooden spoon and stir until the grits become thick and absorb the liquid.  This should take from 7 to 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, bacon, cheese, green onions and Tabasco.  Combine everything thoroughly and season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter an 8-inch square pan, or other similar-sized baking pan, and spread the grits into the pan.  Bake for 30 minutes or until they are heated through.  Serve hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             large  ripe tomatoes (not beefsteak)
  12         teaspoons  white Worcestershire sauce
                        = (1 tspn per tomato)
  3          teaspoons  curry powder
                        = (1/4 tspn per tomato)
                        Minced fresh dill
  12       tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        = (1 tbspn per tomato)
  3          teaspoons  minced chives
                        = (1/4 tspn per tomato)
  3          teaspoons  thyme
                        = (1/4 tspn per tomato)
  12             large  eggs

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a baking sheet and set aside.

Cut off the top of each tomato.  If necessary, cut a very thin slice off bottom of each tomato to make a flat base to make more stable.  Carefully scoop out enough pulp to leave room for each egg.

Option 1:  Place 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and 1/4 teaspoon of curry into each tomato cup.  Break an egg into each tomato cup.  Sprinkle a bit of dill on top.

Option 2:  Break an egg into tomato cup.  Sprinkle each egg with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese and 1/4 teaspoon each chives and thyme.

Bake for 40 minutes, or until eggs have set but are not hard.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 servings.
