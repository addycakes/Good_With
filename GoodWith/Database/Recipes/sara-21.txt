Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Jasper White
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/4           cups  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  2        tablespoons  dark molasses
  2          teaspoons  salt
  3 1/2           cups  bread flour
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
                        Butter or vegetable oil -- for greasing the
                        bowl and loaf pans
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  2        tablespoons  water -- for egg wash

Combine the yeast, sugar, and 1/4 cup of the warm water in the mixer bowl or in a large mixing bowl and mix well.  Set aside for about 10 minutes, while the yeast "blooms."  When the yeast looks frothy, add the melted butter, molasses salt, flour, and cornmeal.  Slowly add up to 1 cup more warm water, mixing with the dough hook or a wooden spoon.  The amount of liquid may vary, depending on the flour, so add just enough water to form a soft, but not sticky dough.  Knead by machine for about 10 minutes, or by hand for about 15 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic.

Lightly oil or butter a large bowl.  Shape the dough into a ball, place it in the bowl, and turn it once so it is lightly greased all over.  Cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and place in a warm, draft-free spot.  (An oven that has been heated to 200 degrees and then turned off is a perfect spot).  Let the dough rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Grease 2 (9 1/2- by 5-inch) loaf pans.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Cut it in halves and shape each half into a loaf.  Place each in the greased loaf pans, return to the warm spot, and let the loaves rise until they are about doubled in size, 20 to 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Brush the top of the loaves with the egg wash and bake for 1 hour, or until deep golden brown.  To test for doneness, remove the hot bread from 1 pan and knock on the bottom of the loaf: you will hear a hollow sound if the bread is done.  If necessary, return to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes.  Turn both loaves out of the pans and cool on a rack for at least 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 2 loaves.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Meatballs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ground lean beef
     1/2         pound  ground veal
     1/2         pound  ground pork
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  freshly-grated Pecorino Romano cheese
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
     1/2         small  garlic clove -- peeled, and
                        minced, (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  bread crumbs -- method follows
  4               cups  lukewarm water
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Bread Crumbs:  Unless you make your own bread crumbs, you wonít be following Raoís kitchen tradition.  Use the finest quality Italian bread you can find.  Allow it to dry for at least two days.  Then grate, using a handheld grater or a food processor fitted with a metal blade.  Shake and push the bread crumbs through a medium strainer to get an even texture.

Meatballs:  Combine beef, veal, and pork in a large bowl.  Add eggs, cheese, parsley, garlic and salt and pepper to taste.  Using your hands, blend ingredients together.  Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture.  Slowly add water, 1 cup at a time, until the mixture is quite moist.  Shape the mixture into balls (approximately 2 1/2- to 3-inches in diameter).

Heat oil in a large saute pan.  When oil is very hot but not smoking, fry meatballs in batches.  When bottom half of meatball is very brown and slightly crisp turn and cook top half.  Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.

Lower cooked meatballs into simmering Marinara Sauce (see recipe) and cook for 15 minutes.  Serve over pasta or on their own.

This recipe yields 12 meatballs.

        Asian Pear Salad With Tamari Pecans And Maytag Blue Cheese

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Michel Nischan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  pear vinegar
  1         tablespoon  pear syrup -- plus
  1           teaspoon  pear syrup -- (fresh pear juice
                        reduced to a syrup)
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin lemon oil
  6               cups  assorted full-flavored greens -- (baby mustard,
                        lovage, arugula, dandelion, mizzuna, etc.)
     1/4           cup  Tamari Pecans -- (see below)
     1/4           cup  dried currants or chopped raisins
     1/4           cup  cold maytag blue cheese -- crumbled
  1                     ripe Asian pear -- cored, and
                        thinly sliced
                        === TAMARI PECANS ===
  1         tablespoon  high-quality tamari
  2          teaspoons  molasses
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  shelled pecan halves

Place the pear vinegar and pear syrup in a small mixing bowl.  Whisk in the lemon oil and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the greens, tamari pecans, and currants.  Sprinkle over with the blue cheese, then drizzle over with the dressing.  Toss the salad gently and briefly, as you do not want the cheese crumbles to begin sticking together.

Divide the salad onto the center of 4 chilled salad plates and garnish by fanning the pear slices around each salad.

For the Tamari Pecans:  Combine the tamari and molasses.  Season to taste with salt and cayenne pepper.  Toss with the pecans until they are well coated.  Transfer the pecans onto a kitchen towel and allow to briefly drain.

Roast the pecans in a preheated 350 degree oven on an icing rack until the pecans are fairly dry and toasted.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.  Chop the pecans into 1/4-inch pieces.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                          Baked Clams Oreganate

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Raoís Restaurant
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  36                    fresh littleneck, small cherrystone or
                        manilla clams - (2" to 2 1/2")
  2               cups  bread crumbs -- method follows
     1/2    tablespoon  minced flat-leaf parsley
     1/8      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano - (to 1 tspn) -- see * Note
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     3/4           cup  chicken broth - (to 1 cup)
  6                     lemon wedges
  6             sprigs  flat-leaf parsley

* Note:  This dish requires a definite oregano taste, so you should sample as you add the herb, keeping in mind that dried oregano varies tremendously in intensity.

Bread Crumbs:  Unless you make your own bread crumbs, you wonít be following Raoís kitchen tradition.  Use the finest quality Italian bread you can find.  Allow it to dry for at least 2 days, then grate, using a handheld grater or a food processor fitted with a metal blade.  Shake and push the bread crumbs through a medium strainer to get an even texture.

Baked Clams:  Have your fishmonger open your clams if you are not comfortable doing the job yourself.  Leave the clams on the half shell and refrigerate until ready to use.

Place broiler tray on the lowest rack and preheat broiler.  Combine bread crumbs, parsley, garlic, oregano, and salt and pepper.  Add olive oil and toss mixture until crumbs are evenly coated.  Add the broth and continue to mix until very well blended.  The mixture should be quite wet.

Put approximately 1 heaping teaspoon of bread crumb mixture on each clam.  Smooth over the top, making sure that the edges are sealed.  Using the edge of a teaspoon, cut ridges into the topping.

Pour 1/8-inch cold water into a cookie sheet with sides (to keep the clams moist while broiling) and broil for about 7 minutes or until the bread crumb topping is well browned and crisp.

Put 6 clams on each of 6 small, warm serving plates.  Garnish each plate with 1 lemon wedge and parsley sprig and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  Thai black rice
  3               cups  water
  4                     roasted garlic cloves - (to 6)
     1/3           cup  basmati rice
  3               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated horseradish

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the Thai black rice and 3 cups of water in a medium saucepan and simmer over a medium-low heat, stirring constantly.

In addition to the garlic, add the horseradish to the basmati juk before passing through mesh strainer.  The basmati juk should take 30 minutes less in total cooking time.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  red cabbage head
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     onion -- chopped
  3             medium  tart cooking apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/8"-thick wedges
  5               cups  boiling water
     2/3           cup  red wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar

Wash the head of cabbage under cold running water, remove the tough outer leaves, and cut cabbage into quarters.  To shred the cabbage, cut out the core and slice the quarters crosswise into 1/8-inch-wide strips.

In a heavy 4- to 5-quart casserole, heat the oil over moderate heat.  Add chopped onions and cook, stirring frequently for 5 minutes, or until the onions are lightly browned.

Add the cabbage, stir thoroughly, add the apples, pour in the boiling water.  Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally, and reduce the heat to very low.  Add red wine vinegar, salt and sugar, stir to combine.

Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the cabbage is tender.  Check from time to time to make sure that the cabbage is moist and tender.  If it seems dry, add a tablespoon of boiling water.

When the cabbage is done, there should be almost no liquid left in the casserole.  Taste for seasoning, then transfer the entire contents of the casserole to a heated platter or bowl and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
  1             medium  vanilla bean -- split, seeds scraped
  2               cups  milk
  2               cups  heavy cream
  12                    egg yolks
  1              pinch  salt
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, over medium heat, cook the sugar, water and vanilla bean until it turns a deep caramel color.  Swirl pan to color evenly, do not stir.

When caramel in color, turn off the heat and slowly add milk and cream.  Be careful, it will splatter.  If caramel hardens, turn on the heat and stir until harden caramel dissolves and the mixture boils.  Once it reaches a boil, remove from the heat.

In a bowl, mix yolks, salt and vanilla extract.  Slowly temper in caramel mixture, adding a small amount at a time, to prevent yolks from scrambling.  Mix to combine, then strain through a fine mesh strainer.

Fill 6 (4-ounce) ramekins with the creme mixture.  Place them in a high-sided baking dish and fill baking dish 1/2 full with boiling water.  Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for about 25 minutes or until set.  The middle should jiggle slightly.

Remove, let cool and refrigerate.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SOUP ===
     1/2         pound  bacon -- sliced, or cut
                        into 1/2" dice
  1                     onion
  1                     celery stalk -- cut 1/2" dice
  1              small  carrot -- cut 1/2" dice
  1             medium  parsnip, peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  1             medium  Idaho potato -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  2             pounds  fresh chestnuts -- boiled, peeled
  12                    thyme sprigs -- tied together
  1                cup  Ruby Port wine
  1                cup  red wine
  4               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  2             ounces  butter
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced chanterelles or
                        hedgehog mushrooms
     1/4           cup  sliced chestnuts
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                     carrot -- peeled, diced fine
     1/2         ounce  chives -- chopped fine
  6              large  celery leaves -- thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Over medium-low heat in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until the bacon has slightly browned and has started to render its fat.  Add the onion, celery and carrot and cook slowly, until soft and translucent.  Add the parsnip, potato, chestnuts, thyme, port and red wine and simmer on low heat until it is almost reduced completely.

Add the chicken stock and continue to cook until the chestnuts have completely softened, about 30 minutes.  Finish with heavy cream, remove the thyme springs and puree in the blender.  Strain the soup through a fine sieve and adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper.

For the Garnish:  In a large saute pan or nonstick skillet, heat the butter on low.  Add the chanterelles, chestnuts, white wine and carrots and cook on low heat until soft, about 7 minutes.  Add the chives.

To serve, place the warm garnish mixture in the center of a warm soup bowl.  Sprinkle with celery leaves, and carefully pour the soup around the garnish mixture.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  shelled and skinned roasted chestnuts
  2             ounces  sliced pancetta or bacon -- finely chopped
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onions
  1              large  garlic clove -- smashed
     1/4           cup  water
  1                     Granny Smith apple
  2         tablespoon  finely-grated Parmesan
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  48                    won ton wrappers
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh sage

Coarsely chop the chestnuts.  Cook the pancetta in 3 tablespoons butter in a large heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp on the edges, about 5 minutes.  Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until onion is softened.  Add the chestnuts and water and simmer, stirring, until liquid is reduced by 1/2.  Discard the garlic clove.

Transfer mixture to a bowl and mash to a coarse paste with a fork.  Peel 1/2 of the apple and cut enough into 1/4-inch dice to measure 3 tablespoons.  Reserve remaining (unpeeled) apple.  Stir diced peeled apple into chestnut mixture with Parmesan, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.

Put 1 won ton wrapper on a work surface, keeping remaining wrappers in plastic wrap, and mound 1 scant tablespoon of filling in center.  Lightly brush edges of wrapper with water and top with a second wrapper, pressing down around filling to force out air.  Trim excess dough with cutter and seal edges well, pressing them together with your fingertips.  Transfer ravioli to a dry kitchen towel, make more in same manner.

Cut remaining unpeeled apple into 1/4-inch dice.  Toss 3 tablespoons of diced apple with lemon juice.

Heat remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a large heavy skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides and butter begins to turn brown.  Stir in sage and cook, stirring, until sage is crisp and butter is golden brown.  Season with salt and pepper.

Add ravioli to a 6-quart pot of salted boiling water, then cook at a slow boil, stirring gently occasionally, until tender, 3 to 5 minutes.  Carefully transfer ravioli with a slotted spoon to a colander to drain.

Slide ravioli into sage butter and cook over moderate heat, stirring gently for 1 minute.  Sprinkle ravioli with remaining diced apple and season with pepper.

This recipe yields 8 first-course servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  crabmeat, any kind -- picked free of shell
  8             ounces  cream cheese -- cut large dice
  1           teaspoon  hot sauce -- or to taste
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  prepared horseradish -- or to taste
  2        tablespoons  Creole mustard or other coarse mustard

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  water
                        Salt -- to taste
  1                cup  coarse polenta
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- at room temperature
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  mixed fresh wild mushrooms -- trimmed, sliced
  3               cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- for dusting polenta
  1                cup  olive oil -- for frying

Bring 6 cups of water and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium and slowly add the cornmeal in a shower, whisking constantly until the mixture thickens, 3 to 5 minutes.

Change to a wooden spoon and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the spoon stands in the polenta, 15 to 25 minutes.  Add the Parmigiano and 2 tablespoons of the butter and mix well.  Season with salt and pepper.

Immediately spread the polenta in a buttered 9- by 9-inch pan.  Smooth the top with a rubber spatula and refrigerate.

Combine the parsley and garlic and chop together until very fine.

In a large skillet, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter with the extra virgin olive oil over high heat.  Add the wild mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and the mushrooms and liquid has evaporated, 7 to 10 minutes.  Remove the mushrooms and set aside.

Add the chicken stock, cream, garlic, and parsley to the pan and simmer to reduce by half, 6 to 8 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Score the polenta into 3- by 4 1/2-inch squares.  Halve each square diagonally to make 2 triangles.  Remove from the pan and toss the polenta triangles carefully in flour to dust them lightly.

Heat 1/2-inch of olive oil until a tiny piece of polenta turns golden on contact, 375 degrees.  Add a few of the polenta triangles and cook, turning occasionally, until golden on both sides.  Drain on paper towels.

To serve, place 2 hot polenta triangles on each plate.  Warm the mushroom ragout and spoon over the polenta.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

              Duck Confit On Country Toast With Fig Chutney

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Barbara Lynch
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     duck legs
  6               cups  duck fat
  1                     loaf crusty Italian bread
                        === SALT MIXTURE ===
  1                cup  salt
  1           teaspoon  crushed bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  peppercorns
                        === FIG CHUTNEY ===
  20                    fresh figs -- cut in halves
  1 1/2           cups  red wine
  1                cup  water
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
  1                     cinnamon stick
  4        tablespoons  mascarpone cheese -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the duck legs in a shallow roasting pan, generously sprinkle with salt mixture (combine ingredients) and pour over enough duck fat to cover.  Cook in a preheated 275 degree oven for about 2 1/2 hours or until the meat is fork tender.  Remove the legs from the fat to cool.  Strain the fat and save for other uses (it will last a couple of weeks in the refrigerator).

Slice the Italian bread into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Sprinkle with some extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper.  Toast in a 300 degree oven until golden.

For the Fig Chutney:  Put all of the ingredients except the mascarpone cheese in a heavy-bottom saucepan over low heat and cook until most of the liquid is evaporated.  Stir occasionally.  Season to taste with salt and pepper

To serve, place fig chutney on a slice of the toasted Italian bread and top with a dollop of the mascarpone cheese.  Serve the duck on the side.  Or you might remove the bone from the leg, trying to keep the meat intact and serve it on top of the chutney.  The duck legs will remain crisp if you prepare them the same day you will be serving them and keep them at room temperature for up to 3 hours.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  1              piece  Parmesan cheese - (3 oz)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves

If the fennel still has its stalks, trim them away.  Cut the bulbs into quarters, top to bottom, and remove the core and any unattractive outer leaves.  Cut the fennel quarters against the grain into paper-thin slices.

Place the oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper in a large bowl and whisk to combine.  Add the fennel and toss to coat each slice with some of the vinaigrette.

Mound the salad attractively on a platter or divide among 4 plates.  Shave the Parmesan over the salad using a mandoline or truffle shaver.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  sifted cake flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              large  egg -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  light molasses
     1/4           cup  dark corn syrup
     1/2           cup  water
  4             ounces  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  2          teaspoons  lemon zest - (abt 1 lemon)
  2          teaspoons  grated fresh ginger
     1/4           cup  unsifted powdered sugar

Position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Generously grease the bottom and sides of a ring mold pan and dust generously with flour.

Pour the flour, baking soda and salt in that order into a triple sifter.  Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper and set aside.  Crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk just to combine the yolk and the white.  Pour the molasses, corn syrup and water into a liquid cup measure and stir to combine.  Place the butter in the bowl of a heavy duty mixer.

With the paddle attachment, cream the butter on medium speed until it clings to the sides of the mixing bowl and has a satiny appearance.  Add the sugar and scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Continue to cream at medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes or until the mixture is lighter in color and fluffy.

Keeping the mixer at a medium speed, add the egg, a tablespoon at a time, to the butter mixture.  Continue to cream, stopping the mixer and scraping down the sides of the bowl at least once.

After about 1 or 2 minutes, when the mixture is light and fluffy and has increased in volume, remove the beater and bowl from the mixer.  Scrape batter off the beater.  Stir in the lemon zest and the grated ginger.

Using a rubber spatula, stir in a quarter of the flour mixture.  Then add 1/3 of the molasses mixture, stirring to blend together.  Repeat, alternating dry and liquid ingredients and ending with the flour.  Scrape the sides of the bowl often and mix until smooth after each addition.

Pour the batter into the ring mold and spread it slightly higher toward the outer edge so it will bake more evenly.  Bake for about 35 to 37 minutes, or until the sides begin to contract from the mold, the surface springs back slightly when lightly touched in the center and a wooden toothpick inserted comes out clean.

Place the cake on a rack to cool for 5 to 10 minutes.  With mitts, tilt and rotate the mold and gently tap it on the counter to see if the cake is releasing from the sides of the mold.  If not, run a small metal spatula or the blade of a table knife around the outer edge to loosen the cake from the mold.  Place an 8 inch wide strip of parchment paper, then a rack on the top of the cake, invert and carefully remove the ring mold.  Cool completely.

To make a pattern for decorating the cake, place a cooling rack on top of the cake.  Pour the powdered sugar into a sieve and gently sprinkle the sugar evenly over the cake.  Remove the top cooling rack and transfer cake to a serving platter.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     shank-end-half fully-cooked cured ham -- (7 to 8 lbs)
     1/3           cup  chopped preserved ginger in syrup
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  3        tablespoons  dark rum
                        Parsley sprigs -- for garnish

If the ham comes with the skin still attached, remove most of it with a sharp knife, leaving a layer of fat and a collar of skin around the shank bone.  Trim the fat, leaving a layer about 1/3-inch thick, and score the layer remaining into diamonds.

Bake the ham on a rack in a roasting pan in a preheated 350 degree oven for 55 minutes.

In a blender blend together the ginger, the brown sugar, and the rum, spoon the glaze over the ham, spreading it, and bake the ham for 30 to 35 minutes more, or until the glaze is brown and bubbly.

Transfer the ham to a platter, garnish the platter with the parsley, and let the ham stand for 15 minutes before carving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  sweetened shredded coconut - (7 oz)
  2              large  eggs
  1              pinch  salt
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2                     cookie sheets or jelly roll pans -- covered with
                        parchment or foil

Set racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  In the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade, pulse the coconut about 6 or 8 times at 1-second intervals to chop, not grind, it.

In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs with the salt until they are combined.  Whisk in the sugar in a stream, then the vanilla.  Fold in the coconut.  Drop rounded tablespoons of the macaroons onto the prepared pans.  Leave about 2 inches all around between each.

Bake for about 12 to 15 minutes, or until macaroons are a deep golden color and still soft within.  Slide the papers from the pans to racks.

Store the cooled macaroons between sheets of parchment or waxed paper in a tin or plastic container with a tight-fitting cover.

This recipe yields about 40 macaroons.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  1                cup  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1              large  egg
     1/4           cup  brewed coffee -- cold, or milk
  1 1/4           cups  dark raisins
  3             ounces  coarsely-chopped walnut pieces - (abt 2/3 
  3                     to 4 cookie sheets or jelly roll pans -- covered with
                        parchment or foil

In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, salt, and spices; stir well to mix.  In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter and brown sugar until combined.  Beat in the egg until the mixture is smooth.  Lower the speed and beat in half the flour mixture, then all the cold coffee.  Scrape the bowl and beaters well, then beat in the remaining flour mixture.  Stir in the raisins and walnuts.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill the dough for 1 hour.

About 20 minutes before you are ready to bake the cookies, set the racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Drop teaspoonfuls of the dough 2 or 3 inches apart onto the prepared pans.  Bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they spread and become firm.  Slide the papers off the pans onto racks.

After the cookies have cooled, detach them from the paper and store them between sheets of parchment or waxed paper in a tin or plastic container with a tight-fitting cover.

This recipe yields about 70 cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     egg white -- beaten
  1                     box puff pastry
  1                     box tin foil

Gather a long sheet of tin foil and scrunch it up into the shape of a cornucopia (solid form).  Approximately 12 inches long and as thick as you desire.  Make it big, so you can add lots of desserts or other foods.  Next roll out puff pastry and cut into 1-inch strips.  Begin constructing the cornucopia by wrapping each strip of pastry around and around the tin foil.  After approximately 20 strips, the entire foil inner will be covered.

Cut out decorative leaves with the remainder of dough and decorate the top of the cornocopia.  When it's finished brush with egg wash.  Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven until golden, about 20 minutes.  Once it has cooled, pull the inner tin foil out from the inside.  You can fill it with brownies, squares and cookies.

This recipe yields 1 servings.

                 Lacy Chocolate Oatmeal Cookie Sandwiches

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Nick Malgieri
Serving Size  : 30    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted
  1                cup  rolled oats (regular oatmeal) -- finely chopped in,
                        food processor, but not ground to powder
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  orange juice, strained
  6             ounces  semisweet or bittersweet chocolate -- melted, cooled,
                        for sandwiching the cookies
  3                     to 4 sheets or jelly roll pans -- covered with
                        buttered foil

Set the racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Pour the melted butter into a bowl; 1 at a time, stir in the remaining ingredients, except the chocolate, stirring smooth after each addition.

Use a 1/2 teaspoon measure to drop the batter on the prepared pans.  Space the cookies about 3 inches apart in all directions, to allow room for them to spread.  Bake the cookies for about 8 to 10 minutes, or until they have spread and are brown around the edges and lighter toward the center.  Slide the paper or foil onto racks to cool the cookies.

When the cookies are completely cool, peel them off the foil and arrange half of them bottom-side up on a pan.  Use a small offset spatula to spread about 1/2 teaspoon of chocolate on each inverted cookie.  Top with another cookie, bottom to bottom.  Store the finished cookies between sheets of parchment or waxed paper in a tin or plastic container with a tight-fitting cover.

This recipe yields about 30 sandwich cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cans  Italian plum tomatoes with basil -- (28 oz ea), imported
                        preferably San Marzano tomatoes
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             ounces  fatback or salt pork -- (optional)
  6        tablespoons  minced onion
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled, minced
                        Salt -- to taste
  12                    fresh basil leaves -- torn, (optional)
  1              pinch  dried oregano
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Remove tomatoes from the can, reserving the juice in which they are packed.  Using your hands, crush the tomatoes, gently remove and discard the hard core from the stem end and any skin or tough membrane.  Set aside.

Put oil in a large, nonreactive saucepan over medium-low heat.  If using fatback, cut it into small pieces and add to the pan.  Saute for about 5 minutes or until all fat has been rendered.  Remove and discard fatback.

Add onion and saute for 3 minutes or until translucent and just beginning to brown.  Stir in garlic and saute for 30 seconds or until just softened.  Stir in tomatoes, reserved juice, and salt.  Raise heat, and bring to a boil.

Immediately reduce heat to a very low simmer and cook for about 1 hour or until flavors have combined and sauce is slightly thickened.  If you prefer a thicker sauce, cook for an additional 15 minutes.

Stir in basil, oregano, and pepper, and cook for an additional minute.  Remove from heat and serve.

This recipe yields 7 cups.

  2               cups  mashed potatoes
  1              large  egg -- beaten lightly
  6        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - 91 stick) -- softened
  1                cup  sugar
  1              large  egg
     1/2           cup  buttermilk or sour milk
  1                     pan - (9" by 13" by 2") -- buttered, and
                        lined with buttered parchment or foil

Set a rack in the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.

Measure the flour, nutmeg, baking soda, and salt into a mixing bowl and stir well to combine.  In the bowl of an electric mixture, beat the butter and sugar together, using the paddle attachment on medium speed.  Beat in the egg and continue beating until the mixture is smooth.

Lower the mixer speed and beat in half the dry ingredients.  When this is incorporated, slowly add the buttermilk and beat until smooth.  Then beat in the rest of the dry ingredients.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir the batter well with a rubber spatula.  Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top evenly.

Bake the cake about 25 to 30 minutes, until well risen and a light golden color, and a toothpick or small knife inserted in the center emerges clean.  Remove from the oven and cool on a rack for 10 minutes, then, using the paper, lift the cake from the pan onto a rack and let cool completely.

To cut the bars, use the paper to transfer the cake onto a cutting board.  Slide a long knife or spatula under it to loosen the paper or foil, then pull it away.  Use a ruler to mark, then cut the cake into 2-inch squares.

The squares will keep between sheets of parchment or wax paper in a tin or plastic container with a tight-fitting cover for several days.  Freeze for longer storage.

This recipe yields 1 (9- by 13- by 2-inch) pan, about 24 (2-inch) squares.

Set a rack in the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Measure the flour, nutmeg, baking soda, and salt into a mixing bowl and stir well to combine.  In the bowl of an electric mixture, beat the butter and sugar together, using the paddle attachment on medium speed.  Beat in the egg and continue beating until the mixture is smooth.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lower the mixer speed and beat in half the dry ingredients.  When this is incorporated, slowly add the buttermilk and beat until smooth.  Then beat in the rest of the dry ingredients.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir the batter well with a rubber spatula.  Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top evenly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the cake about 25 to 30 minutes, until well risen and a light golden color, and a toothpick or small knife inserted in the center emerges clean.  Remove from the oven and cool on a rack for 10 minutes, then, using the paper, lift the cake from the pan onto a rack and let cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To cut the bars, use the paper to transfer the cake onto a cutting board.  Slide a long knife or spatula under it to loosen the paper or foil, then pull it away.  Use a ruler to mark, then cut the cake into 2-inch squares.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The squares will keep between sheets of parchment or wax paper in a tin or plastic container with a tight-fitting cover for several days.  Freeze for longer storage.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 1 (9- by 13- by 2-inch) pan, about 24 (2-inch) squares.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  meaty salt pork -- rind removed,
                        and cut into 1/3" dice
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1             medium  onion - (abt 7 oz) -- cut 3/4" dice
  3                     to 4 sprigs fresh summer savory, or thyme -- leaves removed
                        and chopped - (1/2 tbspn)
  1                     dried bay leaf
  1              pound  Yukon gold, Maine, PEI, or
                        other all-purpose potatoes -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/3" thick
  2 1/2           cups  Traditional Fish Stock -- (see recipe), or
                        chicken stock, or water as a last resort
                        Kosher or sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  skinless haddock or cod fillets, preferabl
                        over 1" thick -- pinbones removed
     3/4           cup  heavy cream - (to 1 cup)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh Italian parsley -- for garnish
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh chives -- for garnish

Heat a 2- to 3-quart heavy pot over low heat and add the diced salt pork.  Once it has rendered a few tablespoons of fat, increase the heat to medium and cook until the pork is a crisp golden brown.  Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cracklings to a small ovenproof dish, leaving the fat in the pot, and reserve until later.

Add the butter, onions, savory or thyme, and bay leaf to the pot and saute, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, for about 8 minutes, until the onions are softened but not browned.

Add the potatoes and stock.  If the stock doesnít cover the potatoes, add just enough water to cover them.  Turn up the heat and bring to a boil, cover, and cook the potatoes vigorously for about 10 minutes, until they are soft on the outside but still firm in the center.

If the stock hasnít thickened lightly, smash a few of the potato slices against the side of the pot and cook for 1 or 2 minutes longer to release their starch.  Reduce the heat to low and season assertively with salt and pepper (you want to almost over season the chowder at this point to avoid having to stir it much once the fish is added).

Add the fish fillets and cook over low heat for 5 minutes, then remove the pot from the heat and allow the chowder to sit for 10 minutes (the fish will finish cooking during this time).

Gently stir in the cream and taste for salt and pepper.  If you are not serving the chowder within the hour, let it cool a bit, then refrigerate; cover the chowder after it has chilled completely.  Otherwise, let is sit for up to 1 hour at room temperature, allowing the flavors to meld.

When ready to serve, reheat the chowder over low heat; donít let it boil.  Warm the cracklings in a low oven (200 degrees) for a few minutes.

Use a slotted spoon to mound the chunks of fish, the onions, and potatoes in the center of large soup plates or shallow bowls, and ladle the creamy broth around.  Scatter the cracklings over the individual servings and finish each with a sprinkling of chopped parsley and minced chives.

This recipe yields 4 main-course servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  parsnips or 2 large parsnips -- peeled, quartered
  2             medium  carrots -- peeled, quartered
  8              small  red potatoes -- halved if large
  2              small  white turnips -- quartered
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     white pearl onions -- peeled
  4                     garlic cloves -- trimmed, but unpeele
  1              large  portobello mushroom -- stemmed, and
                        cut into 8 wedges
  8                     Brussels sprouts -- trimmed, halved
  8                     shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- diced
  1         tablespoon  thyme leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped flat-leafed parsley leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a large bowl, toss the parsnips, carrots, potatoes and turnips, in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, plus a little salt and pepper, until coated.  Arrange the vegetables cut-side down on a large baking sheet and roast on the bottom shelf of the oven for 20 minutes or until the vegetables are beginning to brown.  Turn the vegetables 2 or 3 times during cooking to prevent burning.

In the same bowl, toss the pearl onions, garlic and portobello mushroom with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, plus a little salt and pepper, until coated.  Add this mixture to the baking sheet of vegetables and gently stir to combine.  Continue roasting for 7 to 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring a small saucepan of salted water to boil and blanch the Brussels sprouts for 1 to 2 minutes.  Cool thoroughly under cold running water and drain.  Set aside separately.

In a small bowl, combine the shiitake mushrooms and the Brussels sprouts and toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, plus a little salt and pepper, until coated.  Add them to the baking sheet of vegetables, stirring to combine.  Dot the butter over the vegetables and sprinkle with 1/4 cup wine.  Roast for another 7 to 10 minutes.

Remove the vegetables from the oven and gently mix them with the thyme and parsley before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  Idaho potatoes - (abt 2 lbs total) -- peeled
  1              small  onion -- peeled
  1              large  carrot -- peeled
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  fine dry bread crumbs

Preheat the oven to its lowest setting.  Using either the largest holes of a hand-grater or the shredding blade of a food processor, grate the potatoes, onion, and carrot.  Place the mixture in a sieve and press to remove as much liquid as possible.

Combine the potato mixture in a large bowl with the eggs, parsley, salt, and pepper.  Using your hands or a wooden spoon mix well.  Stir in 1/2 of the bread crumbs, then add the remainder slowly, stopping when the mixture is just thick enough to hold its shape, but not so loose that it dribbles off a spoon.

Pour oil to a depth of 1/4-inch into a large, heavy skillet and heat over medium heat until a tiny drop of the batter sizzles upon contact.  Using a 1/3-cup metal measure as a scoop, ladle the batter into the hot oil in the skillet, pressing each mound of batter into a small flat pancake: do not crowd the skillet.  Fry the pancakes until nicely browned on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side.

Transfer the pancakes to a platter and keep warm in the oven while you fry the remaining pancakes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pheasant - (abt 3 lbs), or same weight
                        of pheasant thighs and drumsticks
  4             quarts  water - (about)
  4                     fresh thyme sprigs
  2              large  onions - (12 oz ea) -- 1 unpeeled, coarsely
                        chopped; 1 peeled and cut into 3/4" dice
  2                     carrots - (2 to 3 oz ea) -- 1 coarsely chopped;
                        one sliced 1/3" thick rounds (split thick
                        ends lengthwise and cut into half-moons)
  1              large  celery stalk -- coarsely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed
  2                     dried bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns - (heaping)
  2                     whole cloves
  4             ounces  slab (unsliced) bacon -- remove rind (reserve
                        it for the stock) and cut into 1/3" dice
                        Kosher or sea salt -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4      teaspoon  caraway seeds -- finely chopped
  1              pound  Yukon gold, Maine, PEI, or
                        other all-purpose potatoes -- halved, and
                        sliced 1/3" thick
  8             ounces  Savoy cabbage -- cut 3/4" pieces
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley -- for garnish

With a cleaver, heavy chefís knife, or kitchen shears, split the pheasant in half, then cut the thighs and legs from the breasts.  Place the 4 pieces of pheasant in a 6- to 8-quart stockpot and cover with the water.  Bring to a boil, skimming off the white foam as it rises to the surface.  (Using a ladle and a circular motion, push the foam from the center to the side of the pot, where it is easy to remove).  Lower the heat so the broth is at a slow simmer.

Meanwhile, remove the leaves from 3 springs of thyme, reserving the stems, chop, and reserve (you should have 1 teaspoon).  Add the thyme stems and the remaining thyme sprig to the broth.  Also add the coarsely chopped onion and carrot, the celery, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and cloves, along with the reserved bacon rind, to the pot.  Season lightly with salt, partially cover, and simmer slowly for 2 hours.

Remove the broth from the heat.  With tongs, transfer the pheasant pieces to a plate.  When they are cool enough to handle, pull the meat off the bones, discarding the bones, and tear the meat into bite-sized pieces.  Or cut the meat with a knife into rectangular strips that are approximately 1/2- by 1-inch.  (If you used whole pheasant, you will have about 1 pound of meat).  Cover and refrigerate until needed.

Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer; you should have about 8 cups.  If you are not making the chowder right away, let the broth cool a bit, then refrigerate; cover the broth after it has chilled completely.  (The broth and meat can be prepared a day in advance if you like)

Heat a 4- to 6-quart heavy pot over low heat and add the bacon.  Once it has rendered a few tablespoons of fat, increase the heat to medium and cook until the bacon is crisp and golden brown.  Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat, leaving the bacon in the pot.

Add the butter, the diced onion, the sliced carrot, the reserved thyme leaves, and the caraway seeds and saute, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the onion is softened but not browned.

Add the potatoes and the reserved pheasant broth, bring to a simmer, and simmer over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked through but still firm.  Add the cabbage and simmer for 5 minutes more, until it just begins to soften (it will continue to cook after the chowder is removed from the stove).

Remove the chowder from the heat, stir in the pheasant meat, and season to taste with salt and black pepper.  If you are not serving the chowder within the hour, let it cool a bit, then refrigerate; cover the chowder after it has chilled completely.  Otherwise, let it sit at room temperature for up to 1 hour, allowing the flavors to meld.

When ready to serve, reheat the chowder over low heat; donít let it boil.  Use a slotted spoon to mound the pheasant, cabbage, onions, and potatoes in the center of large soup plates or shallow bowls, and ladle the clear broth around.  Sprinkle each serving with a generous spoonful of chopped parsley.

This recipe yields about 12 cups, or 6 to 8 main-course servings.

With a cleaver, heavy chefís knife, or kitchen shears, split the pheasant in half, then cut the thighs and legs from the breasts.  Place the 4 pieces of pheasant in a 6- to 8-quart stockpot and cover with the water.  Bring to a boil, skimming off the white foam as it rises to the surface.  (Using a ladle and a circular motion, push the foam from the center to the side of the pot, where it is easy to remove).  Lower the heat so the broth is at a slow simmer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, remove the leaves from 3 springs of thyme, reserving the stems, chop, and reserve (you should have 1 teaspoon).  Add the thyme stems and the remaining thyme sprig to the broth.  Also add the coarsely chopped onion and carrot, the celery, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and cloves, along with the reserved bacon rind, to the pot.  Season lightly with salt, partially cover, and simmer slowly for 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the broth from the heat.  With tongs, transfer the pheasant pieces to a plate.  When they are cool enough to handle, pull the meat off the bones, discarding the bones, and tear the meat into bite-sized pieces.  Or cut the meat with a knife into rectangular strips that are approximately 1/2- by 1-inch.  (If you used whole pheasant, you will have about 1 pound of meat).  Cover and refrigerate until needed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer; you should have about 8 cups.  If you are not making the chowder right away, let the broth cool a bit, then refrigerate; cover the broth after it has chilled completely.  (The broth and meat can be prepared a day in advance if you like)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a 4- to 6-quart heavy pot over low heat and add the bacon.  Once it has rendered a few tablespoons of fat, increase the heat to medium and cook until the bacon is crisp and golden brown.  Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat, leaving the bacon in the pot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the butter, the diced onion, the sliced carrot, the reserved thyme leaves, and the caraway seeds and saute, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the onion is softened but not browned.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the potatoes and the reserved pheasant broth, bring to a simmer, and simmer over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked through but still firm.  Add the cabbage and simmer for 5 minutes more, until it just begins to soften (it will continue to cook after the chowder is removed from the stove).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the chowder from the heat, stir in the pheasant meat, and season to taste with salt and black pepper.  If you are not serving the chowder within the hour, let it cool a bit, then refrigerate; cover the chowder after it has chilled completely.  Otherwise, let it sit at room temperature for up to 1 hour, allowing the flavors to meld.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, reheat the chowder over low heat; donít let it boil.  Use a slotted spoon to mound the pheasant, cabbage, onions, and potatoes in the center of large soup plates or shallow bowls, and ladle the clear broth around.  Sprinkle each serving with a generous spoonful of chopped parsley.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 12 cups, or 6 to 8 main-course servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     pork chops, 1" thick - (abt 10 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots
  1              small  garlic clove -- minced
  2        tablespoons  brandy
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
                        Squeeze of fresh lemon juice
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  mixed chopped fresh herbs, such as
                        chives, flat-leaf parsley, tarragon,
                        and/or chervil leaves

In a skillet large enough to hold the pork chops in a single layer, heat the oil over medium-high heat until it just begins to smoke.  Add the chops and saute until well browned on each side, 4 to 5 minutes per side.  Transfer to a platter and cover to keep warm.

Discard the oil in the skillet, then wipe out the skillet with a paper towel.  Set over medium heat and add the butter.  When itís melted, add the shallots and garlic and saute until aromatic but not browned, about 1 minute.

Remove the skillet from the heat and add the brandy; be careful here, because the brandy may ignite.  Add the cream and mustard to the skillet and return the skillet to the heat, increasing the heat to high.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.

Return the pork chops to the skillet, along with any accumulated juices, and simmer until the sauce has reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon and the chops are just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes.  Turn the chops in the sauce once as they cook.

Remove the skillet from the heat and season the chops with lemon juice and salt and pepper.  Transfer the chops to a serving platter, spoon sauce over them, and serve immediately, sprinkled with the chopped fresh herbs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Sour Cream Pastry Dough -- (see Recipe)
                        === PUMPKIN CREAM CHEESE FILLING ===
  6             ounces  cream cheese
     1/4           cup  pumpkin puree -- fresh or canned
  1              large  egg
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-grated orange zest
     1/2           cup  unsifted powdered sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

Divide the pastry into 3 (5-inch) squares about 5/8-inch thick.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 4 hours.

To make the filling, process all of the filling ingredients in a food processor bowl until mixture is smooth and blended.

Remove 1 pastry square from the refrigerator.  Set aside for 10 minutes before rolling it.  On a floured work surface, roll the pastry into a rectangle until less than 1/8-inch thick.  With a ruler and a pastry wheel, trim the ragged edges and then cut the pastry into 3-inch squares.

Lay the pastry squares across the top of an ungreased 12 cup miniature muffin pan, each cup measuring 1 1/2 inches across and 3/4-inch deep, centering each square over one cup.  Spoon 1 heaping teaspoon of filling on each square then bring opposite corners to the center and press lightly to seal.  This process will also ease the pastry into each cup.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.  Roll and shape the remaining pastry squares in the same fashion.

Adjust rack to lower third of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Bake 2 or 3 pans at a time for about 20 to 25 minutes or until pastries are light brown.  Remove pan from oven to a wire rack for about 10 minutes.  Remove pastries from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.

Sift powdered sugar and cinnamon together and sprinkle pastries before serving at room temperature.  If not serving the same day, stack the pastries in airtight plastic containers and freeze for up to 2 weeks.  To serve, reheat to freshen in a 325 degree preheated oven for about 7 to 12 minutes or until warm, cool slightly and decorate with powdered sugar and cinnamon.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 to 3 dozen 1 1/2-inch pastries.

<IngR name="unsifted powdered sugar" unit="cup" qty="1/2"></IngR>
<IngR name="ground cinnamon" unit="teaspoon" qty="1/2"></IngR>
<DirS>
<DirT>
Divide the pastry into 3 (5-inch) squares about 5/8-inch thick.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 4 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the filling, process all of the filling ingredients in a food processor bowl until mixture is smooth and blended.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove 1 pastry square from the refrigerator.  Set aside for 10 minutes before rolling it.  On a floured work surface, roll the pastry into a rectangle until less than 1/8-inch thick.  With a ruler and a pastry wheel, trim the ragged edges and then cut the pastry into 3-inch squares.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lay the pastry squares across the top of an ungreased 12 cup miniature muffin pan, each cup measuring 1 1/2 inches across and 3/4-inch deep, centering each square over one cup.  Spoon 1 heaping teaspoon of filling on each square then bring opposite corners to the center and press lightly to seal.  This process will also ease the pastry into each cup.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.  Roll and shape the remaining pastry squares in the same fashion.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Adjust rack to lower third of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Bake 2 or 3 pans at a time for about 20 to 25 minutes or until pastries are light brown.  Remove pan from oven to a wire rack for about 10 minutes.  Remove pastries from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sift powdered sugar and cinnamon together and sprinkle pastries before serving at room temperature.  If not serving the same day, stack the pastries in airtight plastic containers and freeze for up to 2 weeks.  To serve, reheat to freshen in a 325 degree preheated oven for about 7 to 12 minutes or until warm, cool slightly and decorate with powdered sugar and cinnamon.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 1/2 to 3 dozen 1 1/2-inch pastries.

                        Raoís Famous Lemon Chicken

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Raoís Restaurant
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     broiling chickens - (2 1/2 to 3 lbs) -- halved
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        === LEMON SAUCE ===
  2               cups  fresh lemon juice
  1                cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the Lemon Sauce:  Whisk together juice, oil, vinegar, garlic, oregano, and salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.  Whisk or shake vigorously before using.

Chicken:  Preheat broiler at least 15 minutes prior to using.  Broil chicken halves, turning once, for about 30 minutes or until skin is golden-brown and juices run clear when bird is pierced with a fork.  Remove chicken from broiler, leaving broiler on.

Using a very sharp knife, cut each half into about 6 pieces (leg, thigh, wing, 3 small breast pieces).  Place chicken on a baking sheet (that will fit in the broiler) with sides.  Pour lemon sauce over the chicken and toss to coat well.  If necessary, divide sauce in half and do this in 2 batches.

Return chicken to broiler and broil for 3 minutes.  Turn each piece and broil for an additional minute.  Remove from broiler and portion the chicken onto each of 6 warm serving plates.

Pour sauce into a heavy saucepan.  Stir in parsley and place over high heat for 1 minute.  Pour an equal amount of sauce over each chicken and serve with lots of crusty bread to absorb the sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2         large  fennel bulb - (6 oz)
  1                     red bell pepper

Add chicken and chickpeas to vegetable mixture and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, about 6 minutes.  Stir in parsley and salt and pepper.

  1              large  onion - (12 oz) -- cut 1/2" dice
  2                     to 3 fresh thyme sprigs -- leaves removed,
                        and chopped - (1 tspn)
  1                     dried bay leaf
  5               cups  chicken stock, chicken broth, or water
  1              pound  ripe tomatoes -- peeled, and cut
                        into 1/2" dice, with their juice
                        (or 1 1/2 cups diced 1/2" canned
                        tomatoes with their juices)
  2        tablespoons  dark molasses
                        Kosher or sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     scallions -- thinly sliced,
                        for garnish

Shuck the beans and discard any that are soft or blemished.  You should have about 3 cups.

Heat a 3- to 4-quart heavy pot over low heat and add the diced bacon.  Once it has rendered a few tablespoons of fat, increase the heat to medium and cook until the bacon is crisp and golden brown.

Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the onion, thyme, and bay leaf and saute, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, for about 8 minutes, until the onion is tender but not browned.

Add the beans and stock.  Partially cover the pot and bring to a simmer.  Cook the beans at a steady simmer over medium heat for 20 to 25 minutes, until they are tender.  Reduce the heat to low.

Remove 2 cups of the chowder from the pot and puree in a food mill held over the pot so it falls directly back into the chowder, or puree in a food processor and return to the chowder.  Add the tomatoes and their juices, along with the molasses, and let the chowder simmer slowly for another 15 minutes.

Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper.  If you are not serving the chowder within the hour, let it cool a bit, then refrigerate; cover the chowder after it has chilled completely.  Otherwise, let it sit at room temperature for up to an hour, allowing the flavors to meld.

When ready to serve, reheat the chowder over low heat, stirring occasionally so it doesnít stick.  Ladle the chowder into cups and sprinkle with the slice scallions.

Variations:

Dried Bean Chowder:  Substitute 8 ounces dried shell beans, limas, or other white bean for the fresh shell beans.  Soak them overnight in enough water to cover generously; drain.  Depending on the bean you choose, the cooking time may be doubled or even longer.  Follow the recipe and simmer until the beans are tender, adding water as necessary (about 1 cup) to compensate for the evaporation during the longer cooking time.

Cider And Bean Chowder:  This idea also comes from the Shakers, who used sweet apple cider as the liquid in several of their soups.  It adds a new dimension to the sweet-and-sour flavor of this chowder.  Cider is pressed from late August through November, so you can try this in either the fresh or dried bean versions.  Substitute 3 cups apple cider for 3 cups of the chicken stock (you will still use 2 cups of chicken stock).

This recipe yields about 7 cups, or 6 main-course servings.

Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  shiitake mushrooms -- sauteed
     1/2           cup  chopped Napa cabbage -- blanched
     1/2                inch piece gingerroot -- peeled, chopped
  1                     garlic clove minced
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  Oriental sesame oil
  1              large  egg -- beaten lightly
     1/4           cup  water chestnuts -- rinsed, chopped fine
  2        tablespoons  minced scallions
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped cilantro
  1            package  Gyoza round wonton wrappers
                        Cornstarch for dusting baking sheet
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        === SESAME DIPPING SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Asian (toasted) sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  black or white sesame seeds -- toasted lightly

In a food processor, pulse to fine chop first 7 ingredients.  Transfer filling to a bowl and fold in water chestnuts, scallions and cilantro.

Place 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center of 1 of the wrappers and moisten the edges with water.  Gather the edge of the wrapper up and around the filling and form a waist with the wrapper, pushing the dumpling from the bottom and keeping the filling level with the top of the wrapper.  (The filling should not be enclosed.)  Continue to make dumplings with the remaining wrappers and filling in the same manner and arrange them in one layer on a baking sheet lined with waxed paper dusted lightly with the cornstarch.

In a large non-stick skillet heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over high heat until it is hot but not smoking.  Fry half the dumplings, flat-side down, over moderately-high heat for 1 minute, or until the undersides are golden.  Add 1/2 cup water and steam the dumplings, covered, over moderate heat for 3 minutes, or until filling is cooked through.

Serve immediately or transfer to serving plate and cover with foil to keep warm.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet and cook the remaining dumplings in the same manner.

For the Sesame Dipping Sauce:  In a small bowl whisk together all ingredients, serve with pot stickers.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Desserts                        Pastry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  unsifted all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  8             ounces  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/4" slices
     1/2           cup  sour cream

Put the flour and salt in a 3-quart bowl and stir to blend.  Scatter the butter slices over the flour, and cut in with a pastry blender until the mixture consists of particles that vary in size from small peas to bread crumbs.

Stir in the sour cream with a fork.  The pastry will appear dry because the sour cream is thick and does not disperse easily.  With your hands, manipulate dough into a ball.

Divide dough as recipe directs.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 4 hours and up to 3 days.  The dough can be frozen for up to 1 month.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         large  butternut squash -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              small  onion -- peeled, minced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                     fresh thyme sprig -- leaves only
                        (or 1/8 tspn dried thyme)
  8             ounces  shiitake mushrooms
  1                cup  chicken broth
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Parmesan cheese
  1             recipe  Spaetzle -- (see below)
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped toasted walnuts
                        === SPAETZLE ===
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  3              large  eggs -- beaten
  1                cup  cold water

In a steamer basket, steam the squash for 10 minutes, or until tender and puree in blender or with immersion blender.  Set aside

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Saute the onion, garlic and thyme until the onion is limp and translucent.  Clean, trim and slice the shiitakes.  Add them to skillet.  Turn the heat up to high, and saute until the mushrooms are soft and golden.  Add the squash puree, chicken broth and cream and season with salt and pepper.  Bring the cream to a gentle simmer, gently tossing the ingredients to mix.  Grate a handful of Parmesan cheese into the sauce and continue to cook until the cream reduces slightly.

Meanwhile, (following the recipe below) cook the spaetzle in abundant boiling salted water until al dente.

For the Spaetzle:  Sift flour into a large bowl.  Add salt.  Make a well in the center.  In another bowl whisk together the eggs and water.  Add to dry ingredients and beat with spatula until smooth and elastic.

Push batter through spaetzle maker into a large pot of boiling salted water and cook, uncovered, just until spaetzle is firm, floats to the top and no longer tastes of raw flour, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain spaetzle well before using.

Quickly drain the spaetzle and place it in the pan with the sauce.  Add the walnuts and gently toss the pasta with the sauce over low heat just until it has absorbed some of the sauce.  Place the pasta in a serving bowl.  Dust with more Parmesan cheese and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  water
  5               cups  fresh or frozen speckled butter beans
     1/4         pound  country ham with fat removed -- cut small pieces
                        === LEMON VELOUTE ===
  1 1/2                 cups chicken stock
  3        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  flour
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste

In a heavy pan, bring the water to a boil and add the butter beans.  When the water returns to a boil, turn the heat down and let the beans simmer for about 45 minutes, or until the skins are tender and the insides creamy, and most of the water has boiled off.

While the beans are simmering, make the Lemon Veloute.  In a small pan, heat the chicken stock.  Fill the bottom of a double boiler with water, and bring to a boil.  Meanwhile, in the top of the double-boiler, set directly over low heat, melt the butter and whisk in the flour.  Cook, whisking, for five minutes, then slowly whisk in the hot stock.  Place over the boiling water and cook for 45 to 50 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep a crust from forming on top.

When the beans are done, add the country ham pieces and cook until the ham is just warmed.  Meanwhile, remove the veloute from the heat, add the lemon juice, and salt to taste.  Remove the beans from the heat, pour the veloute over the beans, and mix well.  Serve immediately.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  pecans -- finely ground
                        to yield 1 3/4 cups
  1         tablespoon  unsweetened cocoa powder
     1/2      teaspoon  powdered instant espresso
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  cardamom
     1/4      teaspoon  finely-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  powdered cloves
  6              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract

Adjust rack in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line a 10- by 15-inch jellyroll pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang at each short end.

Mix the ground nuts with the cocoa, espresso, spices, salt and pepper in a small bowl.

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar to combine.  Rest the bowl in a hot water bath (hot to the touch, about 120 degrees) and whisk until slightly above body temperature (100 degrees).

Remove bowl from the water bath and using a heavy-duty mixer, whip mixture, preferably with a whisk attachment at medium speed until it is light ivory in color and very fluffy, about 6 minutes.

Add the vanilla extract in the final minutes of whipping.  Fold in half of the ground pecan mixture until incorporated and then fold in remaining pecan mixture.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly.  Bake 8 to 11 minutes or until the cake is set on top and springs back when lightly pressed in the center.

Remove pan from the oven, run a knife around the edges to loosen the cake from the sides of the pan.  Lift the cake by the foil overhang to remove from pan and transfer to a wire rack to cool.  Cover the cake with a sheet of aluminum foil, folding the foil in a tent-like fashion so that it does not stick to the cake but keeps the moisture in while the cake cools.  Cool for 30 to 60 minutes.

Lift the cake in its foil off the wire rack to the work surface.  Roll the cake until it forms the shape of a log.  Wrap securely in aluminum foil and freeze.

About 30 minutes before serving, remove cake from freezer to a serving plate; discard foil.  Sprinkle top of roll with powdered sugar.  Using a serrated knife, cut slices, diagonally.  Center each portion onto individual powdered sugar over slices.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Mix the ground nuts with cocoa, spices, salt and pepper in a small bowl.  In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar to combine.  Rest the bowl in a hot water bath that is hot to the touch, about 120 degrees.  Whisk egg and sugar mixture until it reaches about 100 degrees.

Remove the bowl from the water bath and whip mixture in a heavy-duty mixer at medium speed until it is light ivory in color and very fluffy, about 6 minutes.  Add the vanilla extract during the final minutes of whipping.

Fold in half of the ground pecan mixture until incorporated and then fold in the remaining half.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly.  Bake 8 to 11 minutes or until the cake is set on top and springs back when lightly pressed in the center.

Remove pan from the oven, run a knife around the edges to loosen the cake from the sides of the pan.  Lift the cake by the foil overhang to remove from pan and transfer to a wire rack.  Cover the cake with a sheet of aluminum foil, folding the foil in a tent-like fashion so that it does not stick to the cake but keeps the moisture in while the cake cools.  Cool for 30 to 60 minutes.

Lift the cake in its foil off the wire rack to the work surface.  Allow ice cream to soften.  Spread it evenly over the cake with an offset metal spatula all the way to the edges except for one of the long edges of the rectangle, leave about an inch before reaching that edge.

Starting with the opposite long edge of the cake, roll the cake off of its foil until it forms the shape of a log.  Wrap the roll securely in aluminum foil and freeze.  Remove cake from freezer 30 minutes before serving.  Remove foil and slice with a serrated knife. Sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE BASS ===
  6                     wild striped bass - (6 oz ea) -- skin on, scaled
                        (or substitute rockfish fillets)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Peanut oil -- for sauteing
                        === FOR THE STEW ===
  1               pint  shucked oysters
  2             ounces  country ham -- sliced thin,
                        and cut into 1/4" dice
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
     1/2           cup  onion in small dice
     1/4           cup  small-diced seeded red bell pepper
     1/4           cup  celery in small dice
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4           cup  bourbon
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  chopped sage
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Lemon juice -- to taste
     1/2           cup  cross-sliced scallions white and green par

Preparation for the stew:  Strain the oysters and reserve the oyster liquor; refrigerate the oysters until ready to use for final assembly.

In a medium saucepan, cook the ham in the peanut oil until lightly caramelized.  Add the onion, red bell pepper, and celery and cook until caramelized.  Add the garlic, red pepper flakes, and bay leaf; cook 1 minute.

Add the bourbon, lemon juice, wine, and reserved oyster liquor.  Cook until greatly reduced and nearly syrupy, stirring frequently.  Add the chicken stock and simmer over medium heat, skimming as necessary, until reduced by 1/2.  Cool and reserve until preparing the bass.   Remove the bay leaf.

Assembly:  Remove the bass from refrigeration and dry thoroughly with paper towels.  With a sharp knife, score an X in the skin side to prevent it from curling when the fish is cooking.  Season the flesh side with salt and pepper; rub the skin side with some of the softened butter.

Return the stew to a low heat and add the heavy cream; bring to a slow simmer.

Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes.  Add a film of peanut oil, then carefully lay the fillets in the pan, skin-side down.  Reduce the heat to medium and press firmly on the fillets with the back of a metal spatula to flatten slightly and aid in the searing; cook 3 to 5 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets.  When the edges of the fillets begin to show doneness, turn carefully and cook 1 minute longer.  Remove the fillets and keep warm.

Raise the heat on the stew to medium-high, stir in the oysters and butter, and cook just until the oysters are plumped and beginning to curl.  Remove from the heat, stir in the sage, and season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste.

Warm 6 wide, shallow bowls.  Place a fillet in each bowl.  Spoon the stew around the fillets, dividing the oysters equally between the bowls.  Sprinkle liberally with scallions and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ROAST PORK SHOULDER AND BEEF CHUCK ===
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2 1/4         pounds  boneless pork shoulder roast
  2 1/4         pounds  boneless beef chuck roast
                        === FOR THE PIES ===
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  red burgundy wine
  1                cup  chopped button mushrooms
  1                     small bunch fresh basil -- chopped (abt 1/4 cup
     1/2                small bunch fresh parsley -- chopped (abt 3 tbspn
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  demi-glace
  3             pounds  puff pastry (homemade or store-bought)
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a small bowl, mix together the oil, salt, and pepper.  Rub the oil mixture over the meats.  Roast the pork shoulder about 1 hour.  Roast the beef chuck about 1 1/2 hours, until a meat thermometer registers 170 degrees for each meat.  Remove the meats from the oven and let cool for 20 minutes.  Cover and refrigerate up to one day or until ready to use.  (Makes 3 pounds cooked meat)

Cut the roast meats into 1/2-inch cubes.  In a large skillet, saute the precooked beef and pork cubes, onions, and garlic in the butter over high heat for 5 minutes, until the onions are golden brown.  Add the red wine to deglaze the pan, loosening any browned bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Add the mushrooms, basil, parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper and cook until the liquid has evaporated.  Stir in the demi-glace and cook about 5 minutes more, until all liquid has evaporated again.  Remove from the heat.  Spread the mixture out onto a baking sheet and let it cool for 10 minutes.  Refrigerate the mixture about 1 hour to cool completely.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to 1/8-inch thickness.  Cut out 6 (6- to 8-inch) squares and brush the edges with the egg mixture.  Place 1 cup of the meat mixture in the center of each square.  Fold each square over diagonally to form a triangle and press the edges firmly to seal.  Using a fork, gently prick the center of each triangle to allow steam to escape.  Lightly brush the edges again with the egg mixture.

Arrange the triangles 2 inches apart on a greased baking sheet.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown.

This recipe yields 8 large or 24 small triangles.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  16       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
  2 1/2           cups  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  2              large  eggs
  4             ounces  coarsely-chopped slivered almonds - (abt 1
  3                     to 4 cookie sheets or jelly roll pans -- lined with
                        parchment or foil - (you will need to
                        cool and reuse them)

In a bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir will to mix.  In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on medium speed until well mixed, about 1 minute, then beat in the vanilla.  Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, beating smooth after each addition.  Scrape the bowl and beater well and beat in the flour mixture followed immediately by the almonds.

Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and shape and squeeze it into two rough cylinders, each about 10 inches long and 2 inches in diameter.  Roll a piece of parchment or waxed paper around each piece of dough and tighten by pressing it in with the side of a cookie sheet or a piece of stiff cardboard.  Chill the dough until firm.  Or, at this stage, it can be double-wrapped in plastic, frozen, and kept for up to several weeks.

When you are ready to bake the cookies, set the racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Slice the cookies 1/4-inch thick, rotating the roll of dough often as you slice so it doesnít become squashed from the weight of the knife.  Arrange the cookies on the prepared pans about 1-inch apart in all directions and bake them for about 12 to 15 minutes, until they have puffed somewhat and have become dull and are firm to the touch.  Slide the papers from the pans onto racks.

After the cookies have cooled, store them between sheets of parchment or waxed paper in a tin or plastic container with a tight-fitting cover.

This recipe yields about 80 cookies.

In a bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir will to mix.  In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on medium speed until well mixed, about 1 minute, then beat in the vanilla.  Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, beating smooth after each addition.  Scrape the bowl and beater well and beat in the flour mixture followed immediately by the almonds.

Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and shape and squeeze it into two rough cylinders, each about 10 inches long and 2 inches in diameter.  Roll a piece of parchment or waxed paper around each piece of dough and tighten by pressing it in with the side of a cookie sheet or a piece of stiff cardboard.  Chill the dough until firm.  Or, at this stage, it can be double-wrapped in plastic, frozen, and kept for up to several weeks.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  onions - (abt 3/4 lb ea)
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  cooked turkey stuffing
  6        tablespoons  cranberry sauce
  2               cups  chopped cooked turkey
     1/2           cup  turkey gravy or chicken broth
  1 1/3           cups  mashed potatoes

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Cut the top 1/2-inch from each onion, peel the onions, and with a melon-ball cutter scoop out the centers, reserving the onion pieces, leaving 2 layers of onion or 1/3-inch-thick shells, leave the bottoms slightly thicker.

Transfer the reserved onion pieces to a 13- by 9-inch glass baking dish.  Drizzle the broth over them, and arrange the onion shells, inverted on top.  Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake the onions in the middle of the oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the shells are just tender.  Remove and reserve the shells.

Into the onion pieces stir the cream, the sugar, and salt and pepper to taste, and bake the mixture, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 25 minutes.

While the onions are baking, in each reserved onion shell layer 1/4 cup of the stuffing, 1 1/2 tablespoons cranberry sauce, and another 1/4 cup of the turkey.  Holding each shell in one hand pack the layers lightly.

Arrange the stuffed onions on top of the baked creamed onions and pour 2 tablespoons of the gravy into each stuffed onion.  Top each stuffed onion with 1/3 cup of mashed potatoes, mound them and score with a fork.  Bake the onions, stirring the creamed onions occasionally, for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the potatoes are golden.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TART SHELL ===
  1 1/4           cups  flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  8        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  1              large  egg yolk -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  milk
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten,
                        reserved for baking
                        === FILLING ===
  4                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  orange juice
     1/2           cup  lemon juice
                        Grated zest of 1 lemon
                        Grated zest of 1 orange
     1/4           cup  heavy cream

In a food processor, pulse together the flour, sugar, and salt.  Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add the egg yolk mixture and pulse just until the dough can be gathered into a ball.  Flatten into a 6-inch disc, wrap in plastic, and chill several hours or overnight.  Let the dough soften slightly at room temperature before rolling.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 13-inch round.  Fit the dough into a 10 1/2-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  Trim the dough flush with the rim and freeze the tart shell until firm.  Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Line the shell with foil or parchment, and fill with pie weights, rice or dried beans.  Bake for 20 minutes until set.  Remove the foil and weights and bake an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until lightly golden.  Remove the shell from the oven and immediately brush the hot pastry with the egg white.

For the Filling:  When the pastry is almost done baking, assemble the filling.  Whisk together the eggs, sugar, orange juice, lemon juice, lemon zest, orange zest and cream until smooth.

Transfer the tart shell to a preheated 350 degree oven.  Place the filling in a pitcher and slowly pour into the shell as high as possible without overfilling.  There might be a bit of filling left over.

Bake the tart for approximately 25 minutes, until the filling is barely set.  Check the tart after 20 minutes and keep checking it every few minutes after that.  It is crucial to not overbake this filling.  Cool to room temperature before serving.

This recipe yields 1 (10 1/2-inch) tart, 8 to 12 servings.

Pack the neck cavity with 1 lemon wedge, 1 thyme sprig and 1 slice of bread.  Fold the neck skin under the body, and fasten it with a skewer.

Fill the body cavity with apple, onion, 3 thyme sprigs, lemon wedge and remaining slice of bread.  Truss the turkey.

Rub turkey with remaining 3 thyme sprigs, then rub turkey with softened butter.  Place on rack in roasting pan.

Roast in a 425 degree oven for 30 minutes, then reduce temperature to 325 degrees and add water to roasting pan.  Roast the turkey, basting it every 20 minutes, for another 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until a meat thermometer inserted in the fleshy part of the thigh registers 180 degrees and the juices run clear when the thigh is pierced.

Transfer the turkey to a heated platter, reserving the juices in the roasting pan, discard the string, and keep the turkey warm, covered loosely with foil.

For the Gravy:  Skim all the fat from the roasting pan juices, reserving 1/3 cup of the fat, and add the cider and vinegar to the pan.  Deglaze the pan over moderately-high heat, scraping up the brown bits, and boil the mixture until it is reduced by 1/2.

In a saucepan, combine the reserved fat and the flour and cook the roux over moderately-low heat, whisking, for 3 minutes.  Add the cider mixture and the stock in a stream, whisking, bring the mixture to a boil, whisking, and simmer the gravy, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.

Season the gravy with salt and pepper and transfer it to a heated sauceboat.  Garnish the turkey with the herb sprigs and serve it with the gravy.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fish frames (bones) from sole, flounder,
                        halibut, and/or turbot -- cut 2" pieces,
                        and rinsed clean of any blood
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1              quart  water - (about)
  1             medium  onion -- very thinly sliced
  2                     celery stalks -- very thinly sliced
  1             medium  carrot -- very thinly sliced
  1                     dried bay leaf
  2        tablespoons  roughly-chopped fresh Italian parsley -- leaves and stems
  3                     to 4 fresh thyme sprigs
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns
                        Kosher or sea salt -- to taste

In a 3- to 4-quart stockpot, combine the fish bones, white wine, and just enough water to cover (you wonít need the full quart of water here).  Bring to a boil, skimming off the white foam from the top of the stock as it approaches boiling, then reduce the heat so the stock simmers.  (Using a ladle and a circular motion, push the foam from the center to the outside of the pot, where it is easy to remove).

Add the onions, celery, carrots, bay leaves, parsley, thyme, and peppercorns and stir them into the liquid.  If the ingredients are not covered by liquid, add a little more water.  Allow the stock to simmer gently for 20 minutes.

Remove the stock from the stove, stir it again, and allow it to steep for 10 minutes.  Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and season lightly with salt.  If you are not going to be using the stock within the hour, chill it as quickly as possible.  Cover the stock after it has completely cooled and keep refrigerated for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 2 months.

This recipe yields about 1 quart of stock.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     turkey carcass -- broken large pieces
  2                     celery ribs -- chopped coarse
  3                     carrots -- chopped coarse, plus
  2               cups  sliced carrots -- pre-cooked
  3                     garlic cloves
  2              small  onions -- quartered
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns
  1                can  plum tomatoes - (28 oz) -- chopped coarse,
                        and drained well in a colander
  6             ounces  wide egg noodles
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Make sure all the meat has been removed from the carcass.  Set aside.

In a large kettle or stockpot combine the carcass, the celery, the carrots, the garlic, the onions, the peppercorns, and enough water to cover the mixture by 2 inches (about 6 quarts) and simmer the mixture, uncovered, for 3 hours.

Strain the stock through a large sieve into a large bowl, leaving the solids in the sieve, return the stock to the kettle, and boil it until it is reduced to about 10 cups.  When the solids in the sieve are cool enough to handle, remove any turkey meat from the carcass and add it to the stock with carrots, crushed lightly, discarding the remaining solids.

Add the tomatoes and bring the soup to a boil.  Stir in the noodles, boil the soup, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the noodles are tender, and stir in the parsley and salt and ground black pepper to taste.  The soup may be made in advance, cooled completely, uncovered, and kept covered and chilled for 2 days or covered and frozen for 2 months.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whole milk
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1                     vanilla bean -- scraped
  4              large  egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  Jamaican rum

In a 2-quart heavy saucepan bring 2 cups of the milk, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, and the scraped vanilla bean to a boil over medium heat.

In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar.  Slowly pour 1 cup of the hot milk mixture, whisking constantly, into the egg yolk-sugar mixture.  (Do not pour the entire yolk-sugar mixture into the boiling milk mixture, as it will curdle the eggs.)  Whisk in the remaining milk.  Pour the milk-yolk mixture into the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture coats the back of a spoon.  Do not boil.

Remove from the heat and stir in the rum.  Strain the mixture through a fine wire sieve into a heat-proof bowl.  Place the sauce in an ice bath.  When cool, transfer the sauce to a bowl.  Cover the surface with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator, until ready to use.  Sauce will keep in the refrigerator for 4 to 5 days if well sealed.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 cups.

  2        tablespoons  grapeseed or extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  diced onion
  1                cup  butternut or delicatta squash - (to 2 cups -- peeled, and

Use a carving knife to cut thin slices off the pumpkin.  Arrange the slices around the bread then ladle some of the stew over the bread.  Sprinkle the freshly cut rim of the pumpkin with more spice mixture and the stew with more herbs.  Repeat the process until the stew and pumpkin are gone.
