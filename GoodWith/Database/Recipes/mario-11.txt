                Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  canola oil -- for frying
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  milk
  1                cup  flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  kirsch
  6                     green apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced into 1/2"-thk rounds
  2               cups  Vanilla Gelato -- (see below)
                        Cinnamon -- to dust fritters
                        === VINILLA GELATO ===
  3               cups  milk
  1                cup  heavy cream
  14                    egg yolks
  1                cup  sugar -- divided half-cups
  1                     vanilla bean -- split, scraped

In a tall-sided pot, heat the oil to 375 degrees.

In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk.  Slowly add flour to the mixture, 3 tablespoons at a time, until it is all incorporated.  Stir in the sugar and kirsch and allow the mixture to stand for 10 minutes.

Dip each apple slice into batter and cook in the hot oil, 3 or 4 at a time.  Cook until golden brown, then remove with a slotted spoon or tongs to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.

Continue until all are done.  Place 5 slices on each of four plates, in an overlapping circle.  Place 1 scoop Vanilla Gelato in the center of each circle of fritters, sprinkle with cinnamon, and serve immediately.

Vanilla Gelato:  In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the cream, half-cup sugar and vanilla bean and bring just to a boil.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the yolks and 1/2-cup sugar and whisk well until the yolks are pale yellow.

Remove the milk from the heat and slowly whisk about 1/3 of the milk into the yolk mixture.  Stir well and return the whole lot to the pan and return the pan to the heat.  Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture begins to thicken, after which time you should switch to a wooden spoon and cook for an additional two minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain into a clean, cool container that has been set in an ice bath.  Stir to facilitate cooling.

Run the cooled mixture through an ice cream machine according to the manufacturers' instructions and freeze.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     round young artichokes -- trimmed, and
                        stalks peeled
  1              liter  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Hold the artichokes in acidulated water after trimming, to keep from discoloring.

In a heavy-bottomed, tall-sided pot, heat the oil to 300 degrees.

Meanwhile, drain the artichokes and press them "face" down against a hard surface so that they open like flowers.  Season the inside of each choke with salt and pepper.

Fry each choke in the hot oil, working in batches, keeping them submerged with a slotted spoon or spider.

After 10 minutes, increase the heat to 350 degrees to finish cooking.  Remove from the oil, drain on paper towels and, if necessary, season with salt and pepper again.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  cipolline or small (1 1/2") onions
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  sweet butter
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  water
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves

Peel the onions, leaving and washing any root strands you may find.

In a 12- to 14-inch sautÈ pan over a medium high flame, heat the olive oil until just smoking.  Add the butter and cook until the foam subsides.  Add the onions and sautÈ until light golden brown on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the sugar, vinegar, rosemary, and water and bring to a boil.

Cook the onions uncovered, until just al dente, about 10 minutes.  If the liquid dissipates too quickly, add more water, 1/4 cup at a time, realizing that it is essential not to overcook the onions.  The sauce should just adhere to the onions.

Remove from the sautÈ pan to an earthenware dish and hold in a warm place, or allow to cool if you are serving them later or as an antipasto.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fresh ham - (5 to 7 lbs)
  4                     lemons -- juiced
  8                     laurel (or bay) leaves
  2        tablespoons  fresh rosemary leaves
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  white wine
     1/2           cup  grappa
  1                cup  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the ham in a large, oven proof casserole.  In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice, laurel leaves, rosemary and garlic and pour the mixture over the ham, rubbing all over to make sure that it is evenly covered.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 12 hours.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Cover the ham with aluminum foil and bake in the oven 1 1/2 hours, turning it occasionally.  Remove from the oven, baste with the wine and grappa and return to the oven to cook uncovered for another 1 1/2 hours.

Remove the ham from the oven and place it on a rack to cool.  Remove the excess grease from the pan and place the pan over low heat.  Add the chicken stock and stir with a wooden spoon over medium-low heat to dislodge the browned bits from the pan.  Whisk in the flour and butter and continue to stir over low heat until the pan juices thicken and form a gravy.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and remove to a small bowl or gravy boat.

Slice the ham and serve immediately with the gravy.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  lean beef round
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     carrot -- coarsely chopped
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     celery rib -- coarsely chopped
  1                cup  red wine
  1 1/2           cups  tomato puree
  1 1/2         pounds  ziti
  1              pound  fresh ricotta
     1/2         pound  fresh caciotta -- cut small dice
     1/4         pound  Parmigiano-Reggiano

Tie the meat and season aggressively with salt and pepper.  In a Dutch oven, heat the oil over high heat until smoking.  Brown the meat on all sides, then add the carrot, onion and celery and cook until vegetables are browned.

Add the wine and cook over high heat until the wine has reduced by half, about 5 minutes.  Add the tomato puree, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and cover the pan.  Continue to cook over low heat until the meat is very tender.

Remove the meat from the pan and cut it into 1-inch cubes.  Set aside in a large mixing bowl.  Keep the pan juices warm, and remove any extraneous grease with a ladle.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the ziti in the boiling water according to the package directions, until tender yet al dente.

While the pasta is cooking, place the ricotta in a bowl and add a ladle of the pasta cooking water to melt it.  Drain the pasta and add it to the bowl with the meat.  Add the ricotta and the caciotta and stir to combine.

Brush the insides of a large casserole with extra-virgin olive oil.  Place a ladle of sauce in the bottom of the casserole, followed by a layer of the pasta and meat mixture.  Grate some of the Parmigiano-Reggiano over, then repeat with another layer of sauce, then pasta and meat, the Parmigiano until all ingredients are used up and casserole is full.

Bake in the oven 15 minutes.  Serve in warmed pasta bowls.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  baking potatoes, like russets
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                     extra-large egg
  1              pinch  salt
     1/4           cup  grated smoked ricotta salata
  1         tablespoon  bitter cocoa
  1              pinch  cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
     1/4           cup  candied citrus peel -- chopped
     1/4           cup  raisins -- rehydrated
     1/2           cup  butter -- melted

Boil the whole potatoes until they are soft, about 45 minutes.  While still warm, peel the potatoes and pass them through vegetable mill onto clean pasta board.

Make a well in the center of the potatoes and sprinkle all over with the flour, using all the flour.  Place the egg and salt in the center of the well and using a fork, stir into flour and potatoes, just like making normal pasta.  Once the egg is mixed in, bring dough together, kneading gently until a ball is formed.  Knead gently another 4 minutes until ball is dry to the touch.

Divide the dough into 6 large balls.  Roll each ball into 3/4-inch diameter ropes and cut the ropes into 1-inch long pieces.  Flick the pieces off of a fork or along the concave side of a cheese grater to score the sides.  Drop the dough pieces into the boiling water and cook until they float to the surface, about 1 minute.

Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, cocoa, cinnamon, sugar, and a pinch of salt and stir well.

Drain the gnocchi and place them in the bowl with the cocoa mixture.  Toss to coat and remove from the bowl.  Place in a clean serving bowl with the citrus peel and raisins, drizzle with the melted butter and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     sheets parchment - (18" by 14" ea)
  2                     orata, sea bream, or porgy - -- (2 to 3 lbs ea),
                        cleaned, gutted, and left whole
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  red chile flakes
     1/2         bunch  thyme leaves
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1                     egg white -- beaten
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Fold both sheets of parchment paper in half, making them large enough to hold the fish with a few inches of margin, when folded in half like a book.  Aggressively season the fish inside and out with salt and pepper.

Place 1 fish inside of each "book".  Sprinkle each fish with the garlic slices, chile flakes, thyme leaves, olive oil, lemon juice, and wine.  Seal the edges of the parchment together with the egg white and fold to form a closed compartment.

Place the packages on a sheet tray and bake in the oven 20 minutes.  Remove, slash the package to release steam and serve immediately, 1 fish for 2 servings.  Drizzle with good oil and serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Fold both sheets of parchment paper in half, making them large enough to hold the fish with a few inches of margin, when folded in half like a book.  Aggressively season the fish inside and out with salt and pepper.

Place 1 fish inside of each &quot;book&quot;.  Sprinkle each fish with the garlic slices, chile flakes, thyme leaves, olive oil, lemon juice, and wine.  Seal the edges of the parchment together with the egg white and fold to form a closed compartment.

Place the packages on a sheet tray and bake in the oven 20 minutes.  Remove, slash the package to release steam and serve immediately, 1 fish for 2 servings.  Drizzle with good oil and serve with lemon wedges.

                Casserole Of Sardines And Artichokes - ...

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4         pounds  very fresh sardines
  6                     artichokes
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Clean the sardines, removing the heads but leaving the fillets connected.  Rinse the insides and set aside.

Remove all leaves and choke from artichoke and slice thin, holding slices in water acidulated with lemon juice until ready to cook.

Rub the inside of a non-reactive casserole with the olive oil.  Remove half of the artichoke slices from the acidulated water, pat them dry with paper towels and lay a single layer on the bottom of the casserole.  Cover this with a layer of sardines.  Dust the sardines with some of the parsley and some salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil.

Remove the remaining artichokes from the acidulated water, patting them dry, and lay them over the sardines.  Lay down a second layer of sardines, sprinkle with the remaining parsley and salt and pepper.  Drizzle with olive oil, add the bread crumbs in an even layer across the top and bake in the oven for 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

               Chestnut Flour Crepes With Ricotta And Honey

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  chestnut flour
                        = (available in specialty stores)
  2                     extra-large eggs
  1 1/4           cups  water
  2               cups  fresh sheepís or cowís milk ricotta
     1/2           cup  chestnut or orange blossom honey
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Sift the flour into a mixing bowl and beat in the eggs, 1 at a time.  Add the water, whisking until smooth.  Allow to stand 15 minutes.

Place the ricotta in a mixing bowl and stir in half the honey.

Heat a 6- to 8-inch cast iron skillet or nonstick crepe pan over medium heat and brush with some of the olive oil.  Add 2 tablespoons crepe batter and roll pan to distribute evenly and thinly.  Cook until the crepe is firm on the underside and is curling up at the edges, about 1 minute; flip the crepe and cook on the raw side for about 30 seconds.

Continue making crepes until all the batter is finished, stacking each finished crepe on top of the previous one, to keep them warm.  To speed up the crepe making process use 2 skillets.

To serve, spoon 2 tablespoons of the ricotta honey mixture in the center of each crepe, fold in half, drizzle with 1 teaspoon of the remaining honey.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2           cup  cold unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into cubes
  1                     egg
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
     1/4           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar -- for dusting
                        === RED GRAPES IN SYRUP ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1              bunch  large seedless red grapes -- removed from vine
                        === CARAMELIZED CHESTNUTS ===
  1              pound  whole fresh chestnuts in the shell
  6        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a cookie sheet.

Combine the flour, sugar and baking powder in a food processor and pulse quickly to blend.  Add the cold butter and pulse quickly until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg, almond extract and milk until smooth.  With the food processor running, add the liquid all at once and blend 10 to 15 seconds, until the dough just forms a ball.

Transfer the dough to a well-floured cutting board and shape into a log about 14 inches long and 1 1/2 inches thick.  Form the log into a ring in the center of the cookie sheet.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until light golden brown.  Remove, transfer to a rack and cool to room temperature.

Cut the cake into slices about 1-inch thick, top with a tablespoon each of the red grapes in syrup and the caramelized chestnuts.  Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve.

Red grapes in syrup:  Combine sugar, water and wine in a saucepot.  Bring up to a boil dissolving all the sugar in the liquid.  Add the grapes and cook until they just barely burst.  Keep warm until ready to serve.

Caramelized chestnuts:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  With a paring knife, score the bottom of each chestnut with an "x".  Roast the cut chestnuts on a baking sheet for 20 minutes.  Remove chestnuts from oven and wrap in a dishtowel until cool enough to handle.  Peel off chestnut shells.

In a large sautÈ pan, melt the butter and add the chestnuts.  Cook over a low flame for about 5 minutes.  Once evenly browned, add the sugar and toss.  Allow to caramelize for another 5 to 6 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sugar
  6                     sardines -- cleaned, scaled,
                        and filleted
  1                cup  Kosher salt -- plus more to taste
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lime juice -- plus
                        Zest of 1 lime
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice -- plus
                        Zest of 1/2 grapefruit
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice -- plus
                        Zest of 1 orange
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided, plus
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1 1/2           cups  bulgar wheat
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice -- plus
     1/2    tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  celery leaves
     1/4           cup  parsley leaves
     1/4           cup  chives in 1/2" lengths
     1/4           cup  roughly-chopped fennel fronds

Place the sugar in a shallow casserole.  Place each sardine fillet in the bowl and toss lightly in the sugar.  Pat off the excess, discard the sugar and follow the same procedure with the salt.  Discard excess salt, place the fillets in 1 layer in the casserole, cover tightly and refrigerate.

Remove from the casserole, and rinse the salt from the fillets.  Set on a plate lined with paper towels to remove excess moisture.

In a shallow casserole, combine the citrus juices and zests.  Place the fillets in the casserole, making sure that each fillet is completely covered with juice.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 days, agitating occasionally to keep fillets moist and add more liquid if necessary, maintaining the 1:2:1 ratio of lime to orange to grapefruit.

Remove the fillets from the citrus bath and discard the liquid.  Drizzle the fillets with 1/4 cup of the olive oil and set aside.

Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil.

Place the bulgar in a medium-sized pot with a lid.  Pour the boiling water over the bulgar and immediately cover with the lid.  After 5 minutes, remove the lid and fluff the bulgar with a fork, testing it to make sure that it is tender and chewy.  Remove to a tray and spread out in a thin layer to cool completely.

When the bulgar has cooled, place it in a large bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 3/4 cup olive oil and salt and pepper, to taste.

Place the leaves, herbs and fronds in a separate bowl and toss with the remaining olive oil and lemon juice and salt and pepper, to taste.

To assemble the dish, place a mound of the bulgar in the middle of each of 6 chilled dinner plates.  Criss-cross 2 sardine fillets over each mound of bulgar, top with a small handful of the salad and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  boneless pork shoulder -- excess fat trimmed
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus
     3/4      teaspoon  salt -- plus more to taste
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper, plus more to 
  1         tablespoon  red chile flakes
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2                     onions -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced peeled ginger
  3                     bay leaves
  5                     oranges -- cut 5 slices each
  2               cups  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  2               cups  water
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  anise-flavored liquor, like Sambuca
  2             quarts  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Season the pork with 1 tablespoon each of salt, black pepper and red chile flakes.  Place the meat in a roasting pan with the onions, ginger and bay leaves and roast in the oven for 30 minutes, until the onions are soft.  Add water to cover and roast 2 1/2 hours, until the meat is very tender.  Remove from the oven and set aside, keeping the meat in the braising liquid.

Reduce the ovenís heat to 275 degrees.

Meanwhile, lay the orange slices out in a single layer in a shallow casserole.  In a large bowl, combine the orange juice, water, honey and sambuca and whisk to combine.  Pour the mixture over the oranges, cover with plastic wrap, then aluminum foil and bake 2 hours.  Uncover, increase the ovenís heat to 375 degrees and cook for 1 hour, until the tops of the oranges are caramelized.  Reserve the liquid and set aside.

Place the oranges on a clean sheet pan to cool.  Place the pork braising liquid in a 12- to 14-inch sautÈ pan and cook over high heat until reduced by half.  Add half of the orange cooking liquid, cook a few minutes and season with salt and pepper.

Portion the meat into 6 pieces and return to the braising liquid.  Cook over medium heat until warmed through.

Meanwhile, in a tall-sided pot, heat the olive oil to 360-degrees.  Working 1 or 2 pieces at a time, pat the meat dry and deep-fry in the oil for 20 to 30 seconds, until crisp.  Remove with a slotted spoon, let drain briefly on a paper towel then serve on warmed dinner plates with the sauce spooned over and the caramelized oranges on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4         pounds  duck breasts
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  2                     Empire apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/4" dice
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  10                    pink peppercorns - (to 15)
                        === POTATO GOULASH ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  onion -- sliced 1/4" rings
  2             pounds  small waxy potatoes -- cut into quarters
  2        tablespoons  paprika
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste

Season the duck breasts with salt and pepper.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the butter over high heat until it foams and subsides.  Add the seasoned duck breasts and cook for 1 minute on each side.  After 1 minute of cooking on the second side, add the apples and cook for an additional 4 minutes.

Add the vinegar and swirl the pan to mix the vinegar with the duck fat and butter.  Add the peppercorns and cook for another 2 minutes, adding more vinegar if necessary to keep the pan from getting to dry.

Slice the breasts on a severe bias and serve with Potato Goulash.

Potato Goulash:   In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the onions and reduce the heat to low.  Cook the onions over low heat for 30 minutes, so that the onions are very soft and caramelized.

Add the potatoes and most of the paprika.  Stir well to combine and season well with salt and pepper.  Add enough water to the pot to just cover the potatoes and stir in the tomato paste.  Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  Stir in the remaining paprika and serve immediately.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  flour -- divided
  1              whole  egg -- beaten, plus
  2                     egg yolks -- beaten
     1/4           cup  butter -- plus more
                        for buttering the mold
  6        tablespoons  sugar -- divided
  1         tablespoon  Marsala
  1                cup  almonds, peeled -- toasted,
                        and finely chopped
     3/4           cup  almond liqueur

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Mound 3 cups of the flour in the center of the work space.  Form a well in the center of the flour and place the egg yolks, butter, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, and Marsala in the center of the well.  Working quickly, incorporate the ingredients into the flour, working the dough as little as possible to ensure a light crust.

Roll the dough out with a rolling pin to slightly larger than the tart pan youíll be using.  Butter and flour the mold and fit the dough inside.  Set aside for 30 minutes.

Combine the almonds, remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, and 1 tablespoon of the almond liqueur.  Set aside.

Combine the remaining 1 cup flour with the beaten egg and knead well.  Roll the dough using a pasta machine out to a 1/16-inch thickness, and, using a very sharp knife, cut it into very fine ribbons.  Blanch tagliatelle and shock in ice water bath.  Remove and drain.

Place a layer of the tagliatelle on the bottom of the tart shell.  Cover with a layer of the almond mixture, followed by another layer of the tagliatelle, alternating until both fillings have been used up.

Bake in the oven for 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven and drizzle the tart with the remaining almond liqueur.  Allow to cool, and serve at room temperature, in wedges with nocino and espresso.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                     Fried Clouds - {Gnoccho Fritto}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  pastry flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4         ounce  yeast -- mixed with
     3/4           cup  warm water
  4        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  1                     splash sparkling water
                        Olive oil -- for frying

Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the yeast mixture, melted butter and sparkling water.  Using a fork begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board, and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.   Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Heat 4 inches of olive oil in a deep pot to 350 degrees.

Pull off 1/2 of the rested and risen dough, and with a rolling pin, roll it out to a rectangle, about 1/8-inch thick.  With a pizza wheel cut the dough into 4-inch squares.  Fry them 3 at a time in the hot oil until puffed and golden brown on both sides.  Transfer hot clouds to paper towels to drain for 2 to 3 minutes.

Serve warm with Italian cold cuts.

This recipe yields 24 to 36 clouds; 6 to 8 servings.

  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped basil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley

Season with salt and pepper and mix well to combine.  Add 1/4 cup of the bread crumbs and stir in.

Divide the mixture evenly among the eggplants, filling the shells, and then place a slice of provola in the center of each eggplant.  Dredge each eggplant lightly in the flour, then the beaten egg, then the remaining bread crumbs.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil until almost smoking.  Add the eggplants and fry on both sides until cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Drain on a plate lined with paper towels and serve.

  1              pound  golden creamer potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  12                    zucchini flowers
  1                     egg
     1/4         pound  marinated anchovy fillets -- rinsed, drained,
                        and roughly chopped
  2                     scallions -- thinly sliced
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil, divided
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     lemon -- cut into wedges

Boil potatoes in salted water for 10 minutes, until soft but not water-logged.  Drain, allow to cool 10 minutes, and mash to a somewhat smooth consistency.  Add the egg, anchovies, scallions, 4 tablespoons of the oil, lemon juice, thyme and salt and pepper, to taste.

Pick through open zucchini flowers to remove stamens and check for bugs.  Using a small teaspoon, stuff each blossom with 2 teaspoons of the filling.

In a 10- to 12-inch non-stick saute pan, heat the remaining olive oil until smoking.  Place 4 flowers into the pan at a time and cook until golden brown on both sides.  Season with salt and pepper.

Arrange 3 blossoms on each of 4 warmed dinner plates and serve immediately, with bruschetta drizzled with best-quality extra-virgin olive oil, and lemon wedges.

  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped rosemary
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped sage
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2    tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

In a mixing bowl, season the eggs with salt and pepper.  Add half the marjoram, parsley, and basil and all of the thyme, rosemary, and sage and beat together until light and fluffy.

In a 8- to 10-inch non-stick saute pan, melt the butter over medium heat until just turning brown.  Add the egg mixture and cook slowly for 12 to 15 minutes, until set on bottom.  Carefully flip over and continue cooking 6 to 7 minutes, until set.

Once the frittata is done, allow to cool for 10 minutes.  After the frittata has cooled, combine the remaining herbs in a medium-sized bowl.  Add the vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper, and toss well.  Taste the salad and adjust the seasonings if necessary.

Serve the frittata cut into wedges, alongside the dressed herb salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
     1/4           cup  light red or white wine, such as
                        Fiano del Avellino
     3/4           cup  warm water
  1 1/2         ounces  yeast
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- roughly chopped
  1              pinch  red chile flakes
  1              pound  red ripe tomatoes -- peeled, and
                        roughly chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the dough:  Place the wine, water and yeast in a large bowl and stir until dissolved.  Add the honey, salt and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and mix thoroughly.  Add 1 cup of flour and mix with a wooden spoon until it becomes a loose batter.  Add 2 more cups of flour and stir with the spoon for another 2 to 3 minutes, to incorporate as much of the flour as possible.

Bring the dough together with your hands and turn it out onto a floured board or marble surface.  Knead for about 6 to 8 minutes, until you have made a firm, smooth dough.  Place it in a clean, lightly-oiled bowl and cover it with a towel.  Let it rise in the warmest part of the kitchen for 45 minutes.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

For sauce:  In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil over high heat.  Cook the garlic and chile flakes for 2 minutes, then add the tomatoes and salt and pepper, to taste.  Simmer for about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, divide the dough into several pieces and roll out by hand to resemble long strands of spaghetti.  Cook in the boiling water 5 minutes, drain and add to the sauce.  Toss over heat 1 minute and divide evenly among 4 warmed pasta bowls and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  hard-wheat flour
  1              pinch  salt -- plus more to taste
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  8                     celery ribs -- finely chopped
  2              large  onions -- finely chopped
  2             ounces  pancetta -- finely chopped

Divide evenly among 4 warmed pasta bowls and top with freshly grated Pecorino Romano.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  lamb sweetbreads -- cleaned

                        plus
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  4               cups  white wine
  2               cups  white wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  mustard seed
  1           teaspoon  fennel seed
  1           teaspoon  celery seed
  1              pinch  red chile flakes
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns -- plus
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus more to taste
  2             quarts  water
  1           teaspoon  thyme leaves
  5                     sage leaves
  1                     rosemary sprig
  1              liter  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
  1                cup  semolina flour
  1                cup  quick mixing flour
  3                     lemons -- cut into quarters

Soak the sweetbreads in several changes of cold water for 2 hours.  Remove from the water bath and press between 2 plates.

In a large fish poacher or other pot, combine the chopped fennel, carrots, celery, 6 cloves garlic, chopped onion, wine, vinegar, mustard seed, fennel seed, celery seed, chili flakes, peppercorns, salt and water and bring to a boil.  Immediately reduce to a simmer and cook 20 minutes.

Add the thyme, sage and rosemary and cook 5 minutes more.  Strain out the solids and return to a boil.  Add the sweetbreads and return to a simmer.  Cook about 10 minutes, then drain and set aside.

In a tall-sided pot, heat the olive oil to 375 degrees.

Combine the semolina and quick mixing flour in a shallow bowl or plate.  Dredge the sweetbreads, sliced onion, sliced fennel and 2 of the lemons in the flour mixture and cook in the hot oil until golden brown, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan.  Remove the fried foods with a spider or slotted spoon, season with salt and pepper and serve with the uncooked lemon wedges on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  baking potatoes, like russets
     2/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- melted
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano -- for grating

Place the whole potatoes in a saucepan with water to cover.  Bring to a boil and cook at a low boil until they are soft, about 45 minutes.  While still warm, peel the potatoes and pass them through a vegetable mill onto a clean pasta board.

Make a well in the center of the potatoes and sprinkle all over with the flour, sugar, and cinnamon.  Bring the ingredients together to form a homogenous dough.  Knead for 4 minutes, until the ball is dry to the touch.

Divide the dough into 6 large balls.  Roll each ball into 3/4-inch-diameter ropes and cut the ropes into 1-inch-long pieces.  Flick the pieces off of a fork or along the concave side of a cheese grater, to score the sides.

Drop the dough pieces into the boiling water and cook until they float to the surface, about 1 minute.  Drain the gnocchi and transfer to a mixing bowl.  Toss with the melted butter, grate Parmigiano-Reggiano over, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     eggs
  1                cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
                        === OPTIONAL ADDITIONS ===
  3        tablespoons  fennel seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves

In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, sugar, and oil and mix thoroughly.  Add the flour, baking powder, and optional flavorings, and mix well to form a homogenous batter.  Set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Heat a pizzelle iron until very hot.  Pour 2 tablespoons batter onto the iron, close it, and return to heat.  Cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Repeat until all the batter is used.

Remove pizzelle from iron and mold it around a pointed dowel to form a gelato cone.  Or make 2 pizzelles and spread softened ice cream or gelato and sandwich them together.  Then dip 1 end into chocolate sauce and enjoy.

This recipe yields about 12 pizzelle.

     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- cut 1/4" dice
  2               cups  Arborio rice
     1/2         ounce  dried porcini -- broken into pieces
                        with your hands
     1/2           cup  white wine
  3 1/2           cups  chicken stock -- hot
     1/2         pound  fresh porcini -- cleaned, and
                        thinly sliced
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus more
                        for sprinkling

In a 12- to 14-inch skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and cook until softened and translucent but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes.  Once the onions are translucent add the rice and stir with a wooden spoon until toasted and opaque, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the dried porcini.

Add the wine to the toasting rice, and then add a 4- to 6-ounce ladle of stock and cook, stirring, until it is absorbed.  Continue adding the stock a ladle at a time, waiting until the liquid is absorbed before adding more.

Just before adding the last 4 to 6 ounces of stock add the freshly sliced porcini.  Cook until the rice is tender and creamy and yet still a little al dente, about 15 minutes.

Stir in the butter and cheese until well mixed.  Portion risotto into 4 warmed serving plates, serving with extra cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fritters

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  cake yeast
  1              pound  baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks, for boiling
  4                     eggs
     3/4           cup  flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1              quart  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/8           cup  Campari
  1                     orange -- zested and juiced
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

In a small saucepan, heat the milk over low heat until warm.  Crumble the cake yeast in the milk and let sit 15 minutes, until it is foaming.

Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a large pot, cover with water and bring to a boil, cooking until tender.  Drain and pass through a food mill or ricer and place in a large bowl.

Add the eggs, flour, sugar, 1/2 cup olive oil, Campari and juice and zest of orange and mix well to combine.  Add the yeast mixture and knead well, adding more flour if necessary to keep the batter from being too sticky.  Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 hour.

Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and roll each one out to form a 1 1/2-inch thick dowel.  Cut the dowels into 5-inch lengths and form little doughnuts.  Place the doughnuts on a well-oiled baking sheet and let rise until they double in volume.

In a tall-sided pot heat the liter of olive oil to 375 degrees.  Working in batches, fry the doughnuts in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and allow to drain on a plate lined with paper towels.  Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve.

          Potato Ravioli Stuffed With Meat - {Ofelle Triestine}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  potatoes
  1                     egg
     3/4           cup  flour
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
     1/2         pound  ground veal
     1/4         pound  sweet sausage -- removed from casing
  1              pound  spinach -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  butter -- melted
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano -- grated

Boil the potatoes whole in water until very tender.  Drain and, while still warm, peel, and run through a ricer or food mill.  Place the potatoes in a large bowl and add the egg, a pinch of salt, and enough flour to make a dough that is the same consistency of gnocchi dough.  Knead the dough for 5 minutes, then let rest for 30 minutes.

In a large sautÈ pan, heat the olive oil over high heat, then add the onion, veal, and sausage, and brown over medium-high heat until it is nicely browned.  Add the spinach, season with salt and pepper and cook over high heat until the spinach is well cooked and most of the liquid has evaporated.  Let cool.

Roll the pasta dough out on a pasta machine down to the thinnest setting, and cut 3-inch squares from the dough.  Place a scant tablespoon of the filling in the middle of 1/2 of the squares, and top them with the other squares, pressing the edges together to seal.  Set aside.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the ravioli in the boiling water until they are tender and cooked through, about 4 minutes.  Drain and place in a serving bowl.  Drizzle the butter over, top with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and serve.

     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- cut 1/4" dice
  2               cups  Arborio rice

In 3 batches, add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, whisking well in between each addition.  Fold in the rice, pine nuts, sultana raisins, and currants until they are evenly dispersed throughout the batter.  Let the batter rest for 10 minutes while the oil heats.

In a tall-sided pot, heat the olive oil to 375 degrees.  Drop the batter by the tablespoonful into the hot oil and cook until golden brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on a plate lined with paper towels and sprinkle with confectionersí sugar.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

              Ricotta Gnocchi With Sausage And Fennel - ...

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  Italian sausage -- removed from casing,
                        and crumbled
  1         tablespoon  fennel seeds -- toasted, ground
  1         tablespoon  red chile flakes
  1                     red onion -- finely chopped
  1                     fennel bulb -- finely chopped
  1                     carrot -- finely diced
  1                     celery rib -- finely diced
  4                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Pecorino Romano -- grated
                        === RICOTTA GNOCCHI ===
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh goat-milk ricotta
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- or as needed
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg

In a heavy-bottomed pan, cook the sausage over high heat until it begins to brown in its own fat.  Add half of the fennel seeds and chile flakes.  Remove the sausage from the pan when cooked through and add the onions, fennel, carrots, celery and garlic.

Cook the vegetables until theyíre well browned and return the sausage to the pan.  Add the tomato sauce and remaining fennel seeds and chile flakes.  Simmer 1/2 hour, until vegetables and sausage are very tender.  Season well with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Gently slip as many gnocchi at a time as will float freely into a pot of boiling water, stirring gently with a wooden spoon as you do.  Cook until the gnocchi rise to the surface, about 7 minutes.  (Test 1 for doneness by cutting into the center; the gnocchi should be the same color and consistency all the way through.)  Scoop them out with a wire skimmer as soon as they are cooked.  Drain and add to the pan with the hot ragu, tossing gently 1 minute to coat.  Top with Pecorino Romano and serve immediately.

Ricotta Gnocchi:  Place the ricotta in a fine sieve over a bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or overnight.  In a medium-sized bowl, stir the drained ricotta, 1 cup of the flour, the eggs, parsley, salt, pepper and nutmeg together gently but thoroughly until a soft dough forms, adding a little more of the flour if the dough is sticky when poked.

Forming the gnocchi:  Dip 2 tablespoons in cool water.  Using 1 spoon, scoop up a heaping tablespoon of the ricotta mixture and use the other spoon to form it into a smooth, pointed oval.  (Alternatively, you can roll the mixture into balls with well-floured hands, using about 2 tablespoons ricotta mixture for each ball.)  Place the gnocchi on a baking sheet lined with a lightly-floured kitchen towel.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- cut 1/4" dice
  1           teaspoon  saffron threads
  3 1/2           cups  chicken stock -- hot
  2               cups  arborio rice
     1/2           cup  white wine
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus more
                        for sprinkling

In a 12- to 14-inch skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and cook until softened and translucent but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes.  Meanwhile add the saffron to the stock, stirring to infuse.  Once the onions are translucent add the rice and stir with a wooden spoon until toasted and opaque, 3 to 4 minutes.

Add the wine to the toasting rice, and then add a 4- to 6-ounce ladle of the saffron-infused stock and cook, stirring, until it is absorbed.  Continue adding the stock a ladle at a time, waiting until the liquid is absorbed before adding more.  Cook until the rice is tender and creamy and yet still a little al dente, about 15 minutes.

Stir in the butter and cheese until well mixed.  Portion risotto into 4 warmed serving plates, serving with extra cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1              bunch  mint leaves -- finely chopped

In a large pot combine the tripe, vinegar, vanilla and enough water to cover the tripe by 2 inches.  Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until the tripe is very tender, about 1 to 1 1/4 hours, replenishing the water as necessary.

Drain the tripe, reserving the cooking liquid, and allow to cool.  Slice the tripe into 1-inch strips.

In a 14- to 16-inch skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat until almost smoking.  Add the onion, garlic and tripe and sautÈ 3 minutes.  Add the Basic Tomato Sauce, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the grated cheeses and the mint and stir to combine.  When the tripe is finished, divide evenly among 6 warmed bowls and top with the cheese and mint mixture.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                  Roulade Of Potatoes And Escarole - ...

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  baking potatoes, like russets
                        Salt -- as needed
  1                cup  unbleached flour
  6                     eggs -- slightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  1              pound  escarole -- washed, drained,
                        and finely chopped
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2             quarts  water
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

Cook the potatoes in lightly salted water to cover until the potatoes are very soft.  Drain and allow to cool slightly, then peel, mash by hand and let cool further.  Add 1 teaspoon salt, the flour and eggs and mix well to form a smooth paste.  Spread this mixture onto a sheet of clean cheesecloth, to form a rectangle measuring 15 by 12 inches.

In a large skillet, heat the oil over high heat.  Add the onion and cook until soft.  Add the escarole, pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until most of the moisture has evaporated.  Spread this mixture over the potato rectangle, leaving a 1/2-inch margin on the perimeter.

Roll the short way, using the cheesecloth as a rolling tool, so that the potato rectangle is shaped like a jelly roll.  Wrap the roll in the cheesecloth and fasten the ends with string.

In a fish poacher or pot large enough to hold the roll, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt.  Gently lower the roll into the water and return to the boil.  Lower to a simmer, and cover.  Cook 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Transfer the roll to a warm dish and let rest 10 minutes.  Remove the cheesecloth, cut the roll into 12 slices and drizzle the melted butter and cheese over.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4        pounds  rye flour
  1               cups  boiling water - (to 2)
  1              pinch  salt
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped
  2             pounds  cuttlefish -- cleaned, and
                        cut into rings
     1/4         pound  Gaeta olives -- pitted, halved
  1                cup  dry white wine
     3/4           cup  tomato puree
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice

Combine the rye flour, pinch of salt and 1 cup of the water, stir to combine and then knead to form a firm, smooth dough, adding more water if necessary to achieve the desired consistency.  Cut the dough into 4 equal-sized pieces, roll each into a dowel 1/2-inch thick, and cut into 1-inch pieces.  Roll with the tines of a fork and set aside.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil over high heat.  Add the onion and garlic and cook until golden brown.  Add the cuttlefish and olives and cook over medium-low heat.  Add the wine and let it evaporate, then add the tomato puree, season with salt and pepper and cook, covered, over a low flame, for 20 minutes.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Add the parsley to the sauce and cook another 10 minutes.  Just before the sauce is done, add the gnocchi to the boiling water and cook until they float aggressively, about 2 minutes.  Toss in the pan with the sauce and the lemon juice and let cook together 1 minute.  Divide evenly among 4 warmed pasta bowls and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Mushrooms                       Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  fresh whole porcini mushrooms
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2            bunches  arugula -- washed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  baccala -- soaked 48 hours in
                        four changes of water
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2                     Spanish onions -- chopped 1/2" dice
  4                     salted anchovies -- fillets removed,
                        and soaked in milk for 4 hours
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  3               cups  milk, plus more,
                        if necessary
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
                        === SOFT POLENTA ===
  4               cups  water
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1                cup  polenta or cornmeal
     1/2           cup  stracchino -- cut into cubes

Cut soaked baccala into 2-inch squares and check for any bones.

In a 12-inch frying pan, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat.  Add onions, anchovies and cinnamon, and cook until onions are very soft but have not browned, 10 to 12 minutes.  Add baccala pieces, wine, and milk and bring to a boil.  Lower heat to simmer and cook 1 hour, adding more milk if mixture becomes dry.  Add chopped parsley, check for seasoning, and serve with Soft Polenta.

Soft Polenta:  In a 3-quart saucepan, heat water and salt until boiling.  Drizzle in polenta in a thin stream, whisking constantly, until all polenta is incorporated and mixture begins to thicken.  Switch to a wooden spoon, pull off heat, and continue to stir until thick as paste.

Stir in the cheese and continue to stir until it is melted and incorporated.

Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                     lemon, zested
  4                     egg yolks -- divided
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1             recipe  Basic Pastry Dough -- (see below)
  8             ounces  sour cherry jam
  1         tablespoon  confectioners' sugar
                        === BASIC PASTRY DOUGH ===
  2               cups  flour -- plus additional
                        for rolling out pastry
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar
     3/4           cup  butter -- cut small cubes,
                        and chilled
  1              whole  egg -- plus
  1                     egg yolk
  2        tablespoons  vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a saucepan, combine the milk, sugar and lemon zest and bring to a boil.  In a medium-sized bowl, combine 3 of the egg yolks, the vanilla, and the cornstarch and whisk well to combine.  Add the hot milk in a stream, whisking constantly.  Return this mixture to the pan and cook over a low flame for 10 minutes, stirring constantly.

Roll out the pastry dough, reserving a piece the size of a babyís fist.  Line an 8-inch tart pan with the dough.  Cover the bottom with half the cooked cream mixture, then spread the jam over that.  Add the remaining cream mixture.

Roll out the reserved dough to form a top for the tart, and gently lay it over the tart, pinching the edges.  Brush the top with the remaining egg yolk and bake 45 minutes.  Let cool, then sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.

Pastry Dough:  In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar.  Cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  In a small bowl, combine the egg, the yolk, and the vanilla, and stir this mixture into the flour mixture with a fork until it just comes together.

Turn the mixture onto a floured board and gently work the mixture until a dough is formed.  Press the dough into a disc shape about 4 inches across, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                   Squash Gnocchi - {Gnocchi Di Zucca}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  acorn squash
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  fresh marjoram leaves
  4                     radicchio leaves -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated smoked ricotta

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut the squash in half or thirds and place on aluminum foil in the oven.  Bake until tender when stabbed with a fork, usually 30 to 35 minutes.  Remove from the oven and, when it is cool enough to handle, scoop out and discard the seeds and membrane.  Scoop the flesh into a strainer placed over a large bowl.  Place in the refrigerator so that the squash cools and the liquid drains away.  Leave for at least 6 hours or overnight.

Pass the drained squash through a ricer and then transfer to a large bowl.  Add the eggs and salt.  Stir well and add the flour, a little at a time, stirring to amalgamate all the ingredients.  The result should be soft but not runny.

Bring a large pot of cold water to a boil.  Add a pinch of salt and allow the water to return to a boil.  With a teaspoon, scoop up some of the dough.  Use your fingers to form the gnocchi, which should be about the size and shape of a spoon.

Cook the gnocchi in the boiling water and cook until they rise to the top of the pot.  While the gnocchi cook, heat the butter over medium-high heat until it foams and subsides.  Add the marjoram and radicchio, and sautÈ over high heat for 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Drain the cooked gnocchi and add them to the pan with the radicchio.  Toss very gently to coat.  Divide the dressed gnocchi evenly among 4 warmed pasta bowls, top with the grated ricotta and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut the squash in half or thirds and place on aluminum foil in the oven.  Bake until tender when stabbed with a fork, usually 30 to 35 minutes.  Remove from the oven and, when it is cool enough to handle, scoop out and discard the seeds and membrane.  Scoop the flesh into a strainer placed over a large bowl.  Place in the refrigerator so that the squash cools and the liquid drains away.  Leave for at least 6 hours or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pass the drained squash through a ricer and then transfer to a large bowl.  Add the eggs and salt.  Stir well and add the flour, a little at a time, stirring to amalgamate all the ingredients.  The result should be soft but not runny.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring a large pot of cold water to a boil.  Add a pinch of salt and allow the water to return to a boil.  With a teaspoon, scoop up some of the dough.  Use your fingers to form the gnocchi, which should be about the size and shape of a spoon.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the gnocchi in the boiling water and cook until they rise to the top of the pot.  While the gnocchi cook, heat the butter over medium-high heat until it foams and subsides.  Add the marjoram and radicchio, and sautÈ over high heat for 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain the cooked gnocchi and add them to the pan with the radicchio.  Toss very gently to coat.  Divide the dressed gnocchi evenly among 4 warmed pasta bowls, top with the grated ricotta and serve immediately.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- cut 1/4" dice
  1              small  acorn or butternut squash -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut 1/4" dice
  2               cups  Arborio rice
     1/2           cup  white wine
  4               cups  chicken stock -- hot

             Stinging Nettle Tagliatelle With Frutti Di Mare

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  stinging nettles
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     extra-large eggs
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  semolina flour
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     scallions -- thinly sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  hot chile flakes
  16                    New Zealand cockles
  16                    mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2         pound  rock shrimp -- cleaned
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil.

Meanwhile, using plastic gloves, separate nettle leaves and stems and discard stems.  Set up an ice bath next to the stove and drop nettle leaves into boiling water.  Allow cooking for 1 minute, drain and immediately immerse in ice bath.  Drain leaves by pressing between 2 plates to remove all moisture.  Place in the bowl of a food processor.  Blend with olive oil until mixture has emulsified into a paste.

In a medium-sized bowl, combine nettle paste and eggs.  Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg and nettle mixture.  Using a fork, begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Using a pasta rolling machine, roll dough to thinnest setting and cut into 1/8-inch ribbons.  Line a sheet tray with parchment paper and sprinkle liberally with semolina.  Gently place pasta on top of semolina, cover and set aside.

Bring 6 quarts water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 12- to 14-inch sautÈ pan heat olive oil till smoking.  Add the scallions, garlic, and chilis and cook until light brown, about 1 minute.  Add the clams and mussels and saute 2 minutes.  Add the wine, bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer two minutes.

Drop pasta into boiling water and cook until just tender, about 2 minutes.  Meanwhile add the shrimp and raise the heat to high.  Add the butter and stir carefully so as not to remove the mussels and clams from their shells.

Drain the pasta and toss into the pan with the shellfish mixture, add the parsley and toss to dress well and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, using plastic gloves, separate nettle leaves and stems and discard stems.  Set up an ice bath next to the stove and drop nettle leaves into boiling water.  Allow cooking for 1 minute, drain and immediately immerse in ice bath.  Drain leaves by pressing between 2 plates to remove all moisture.  Place in the bowl of a food processor.  Blend with olive oil until mixture has emulsified into a paste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium-sized bowl, combine nettle paste and eggs.  Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg and nettle mixture.  Using a fork, begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a pasta rolling machine, roll dough to thinnest setting and cut into 1/8-inch ribbons.  Line a sheet tray with parchment paper and sprinkle liberally with semolina.  Gently place pasta on top of semolina, cover and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring 6 quarts water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 12- to 14-inch sautÈ pan heat olive oil till smoking.  Add the scallions, garlic, and chilis and cook until light brown, about 1 minute.  Add the clams and mussels and saute 2 minutes.  Add the wine, bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer two minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drop pasta into boiling water and cook until just tender, about 2 minutes.  Meanwhile add the shrimp and raise the heat to high.  Add the butter and stir carefully so as not to remove the mussels and clams from their shells.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain the pasta and toss into the pan with the shellfish mixture, add the parsley and toss to dress well and serve.

  2                     Dover soles - (1 lb ea) -- filleted, heads
                        and bones reserved
  1                     onion -- stuck with
  1                     whole clove
  1                     carrot
  1                     celery stalk
  1                     bay leaf
  6                     peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4         pound  baby spinach leaves
     1/4         pound  lump crab meat
  2        tablespoons  golden raisins -- rehydrated in
                        hot water and drained
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts
  25                    strands Spanish or Italian saffron
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  Prosecco or other sweet sparkling wine
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut small cubes

In a large saucepan, combine the fish heads and bones, the onion with the clove, carrot, celery, bay leaf, peppercorns, salt, and wine.  Add 1-quart water and bring to a boil.  Boil for 30 minutes, until the liquid is reduced by a little less than half.  Strain the liquid into a small saucepan and discard the solids.

Season the sole fillets with salt and pepper on both sides.  Lay a few spinach leaves on 1 side of each fillet.  Divide the crab meat evenly among the four fillets and spread it over the spinach.  Top with some of the raisins and pine nuts and roll up each fillet.  Secure with a toothpick or string.

In a mortar and pestle, combine the saffron strands with the sugar and crush together to form a sandy paste.  Set aside.

In a 12- to 14-inch sautÈ pan, heat the olive oil over high heat until almost smoking.  Add the stuffed sole fillets and cook on all sides until light golden brown, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring the fish broth to a boil.  Remove the fish bundles to a plate and add the boiling fumet, scraping the bottom of the sautÈ pan with a wooden spoon to dislodge any browned bits.

Add the saffron mixture and the Prosecco and bring to a boil.  Cook until reduced by half, then add the butter, bit by bit, until it is all absorbed.  Return the fish bundles to the pan to heat through, then serve immediately.

Lower the heat to medium and add the fish in a single layer, if possible.  Baste with the sauce and cook, covered, for 7 minutes.  Uncover and simmer until the liquid is greatly reduced and the fish is in a thick, flavorful sauce.  Sprinkle with parsley.  Serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  butternut squash -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1/4"-thk slices
  1              pound  zucchini -- cut 1/4" slices
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  raisins
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     red onions -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts
  2                     whole cloves
  1              pinch  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/2           cup  dry white wine

Combine the squash and zucchini in a large bowl, sprinkle with salt and set aside so that the excess water will be exuded.  Drain and pat dry.

Meanwhile, soak the raisins in 1 cup boiling water for 15 minutes to re-hydrate them, then drain and set aside.

In a large skillet, heat 1/2 cup oil over high heat until almost smoking.  Working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan, cook the squash and zucchini in the oil until they are browned around the edges, about 5 minutes, turning once to cook evenly.  Remove the cooked slices to a plate lined with paper towels to drain the excess oil.  Cook all the squash and zucchini in this manner.  Once all vegetables are drained, place in a shallow casserole and set aside.

In a 12- to 14-inch sautÈ pan, heat the remaining olive oil over high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion and cook until soft and stewed, adding in small amounts of hot water so that the onion stews.  After 20 minutes, add the raisins, pine nuts, cloves, cinnamon, and lemon zest.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Cook for 2 minutes while stirring ingredients together.

Add the vinegars and wine and bring to a medium boil.  Cook for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and immediately pour over the squash and zucchini.  Let cool, then refrigerate for 2 days before eating.  Serve at room temperature.

  1                cup  dry white wine

  1              small  bay leaf
  1              sprig  thyme

     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- diced
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  grated baking chocolate
     1/4           cup  raisins -- soaked in water,
                        and squeezed dry
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
                        Candied zest of 1 orange -- (see below),
                        finely chopped
                        === CANDIED CITRUS ZEST ===
  8               cups  sugar
  5               cups  water
                        Zest of 4 oranges
                        = (or 3 grapefruits, or 8 lemons)
                        Superfine sugar -- for sprinkling

In a small saucepan, combine 2/3 of the wine, 1/3 cup of the vinegar, 1 scallion, 1 clove garlic, 1 carrot, the cloves, bay leaf and thyme and bring to a boil over high heat for 5 minutes.  Let cool completely.  Put the boar meat in a non-reactive casserole and pour the cooled marinade over.  Let marinate in the refrigerator for 2 days, turning often.

After 2 days, remove the meat and reserve the marinade.  Pat the meat dry, roll it and tie it with butcherís twine.  Season aggressively with salt and pepper.

In a Dutch oven, heat the lard over high heat and brown the meat on all sides.  Add the remaining scallions, garlic, carrots, along with the celery and prosciutto and cook five minutes.  Add the remaining wine and just cover the meat with the reserved marinade and boiling water, if necessary.  Simmer until the meat is cooked through and is fork-tender, about 1 hour.  Remove the meat from the Dutch oven and keep it warm.

Transfer all pan juices to a blender or food processor and puree smooth.  Return to the stovetop and stir in the sugar, chocolate and remaining vinegar.  Cook 3 minutes over medium-high heat, then add the raisins, pine nuts and candied zest and remove from heat.  Slice the meat and serve with the sauce poured over.

Candied Citrus Zest:  In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil, making sure all sugar is dissolved.  Remove from heat.

In a large saucepan, combine the zest and enough cold water to cover and bring to a boil.  Remove the zest, rinse with cold water and repeat the process 2 more times.

Place the blanched zest in a saucepan and pour the syrup over the zest, adding an extra inch to cover the zest.  Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until the zest is translucent and tender.  Remove from heat and cool.  Drain the syrup and lay the zest out on a cooling rack.  Toss in sugar and store in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TAGLIATELLE ===
  1 3/4           cups  cake flour  - (to 2)
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour - (to 2)
  4                     eggs
                        === RAGU ===
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  butter
  1                cup  small-chopped onions
     1/2           cup  small-chopped celery
     1/4           cup  small-chopped carrots
     1/4         pound  pancetta -- ground
                        = (you can ask your butcher to do this)
  1              pound  ground veal
     1/2         pound  ground beef
  1              pound  ground pork
  2               cups  whole milk
  1                cup  white wine
     1/2           cup  tomato paste
                        === TOPPING ===
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano

Tagliatelle:  Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and the olive oil.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Roll or shape as desired.

Ragu:  In a large Dutch oven or saucepan, add olive oil and butter and heat.  Add onions, celery and carrots and cook until very soft and beginning to caramelize.  Mix together all of the meats.  Add the meats to the pan and begin to brown.

When the meat begins changing color and releasing its own liquids, add the milk.  Cook until the milk is almost totally evaporated -- it should just be moist around the edges of the meat, about 15 minutes.

Add the wine.  Add the tomato paste and stir well.  Bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat to low and cook for 2 hours.

Roll out pasta dough to the thinnest setting on a pasta machine.  Cut into strips that are 4-inches wide and 8 inches long.  Starting with the 4-inch side, loosely roll the pasta into a tube that is about 4-inches long and 2 1/2-inches wide.  Cut the open side into 1/4-inch wide strips.  Unroll the pasta and place in small bundles.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil.  Add salt to the water and return to a boil.  Add the tagliatelle and cook for 5 minutes.  Drain the tagliatelle and add to the bolognese sauce.  Thin with a little pasta water, if necessary.  Toss for 1 minute.

Immediately serve in warm pasta bowls.  Top with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped roasted chestnuts
  8             ounces  goat milk ricotta cheese
  1              large  egg
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  1              pinch  grated nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === TORTELLONI AND SAUCE ===
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe),
                        rolled to thinnest setting
  6                     sage leaves
  5        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large bowl, combine the chestnuts, ricotta, egg, parsley, nutmeg, and salt.  Blend to form a loose paste.  Cut the pasta into 4-inch squares and place 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each square.  Fold into triangles, pressing out any air around the filling.  Press to seal the edges.  Bring the points of the long side of the triangle together, forming a ring (or a hat) and seal between your fingers.

Bring about 6 quarts of water to a boil and add about 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop the tortelloni in the boiling water and cook for 8 to 10 minutes at a high simmer.

In a sautÈ pan, heating with medium-low flame, melt the butter and sage slowly, combining the flavors.  Once tortelloni are done, drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta water.

Place tortelloni in the sautÈ pan with the melted butter and sage.  Add the reserved pasta cooking water and toss to combine.  Heat for about 30 seconds, seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.  Serve.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/4           cups  milk
  1                     lemon -- zested
                        (or 1 vanilla bean, scraped)
  7                     egg yolks
  7             ounces  sugar
  7             ounces  flour
  1 3/4         ounces  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1 3/4         ounces  unsweetened chocolate pistoles
  24                    ladyfingers
     1/4           cup  alchermes liqueur
     1/4           cup  sassolino liqueur
     1/4           cup  mandorla amara liqueur

In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the milk and the vanilla bean or lemon zest and heat over medium-high heat to a very high simmer but do not allow to boil.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the egg yolks, flour and sugar and whip with a whisk until the mixture is pale yellow and forms a ribbon when the whisk is lifted from the bowl.

Once the milk has simmered, remove the pan from the stovetop and pour 1/2 of the milk into the egg mixture, stirring constantly.  Return this mixture back to the pan with the milk and stir over high heat with a wooden spoon until the mixture coats the back of a spoon.

Pour half the cream into a stainless steel bowl set atop an ice bath to cool, and stir the cocoa and chocolate in to the remaining cream, making sure that it has completely dissolved into the mixture.  Pour the chocolate cream into a separate bowl that has been set atop an ice bath to cool.

Cut each ladyfinger in half lengthwise and sprinkle the halves with the 3 liqueurs.  Once the creams have cooled, in a large casserole, place a layer of the soaked ladyfingers, followed by a layer of the vanilla cream, followed by a layer of ladyfingers, followed by a layer of the chocolate cream, repeating this procedure until all ingredients are used up.  Let sit for 1 hour, then serve.

         Veal Chops, With Balsamic Vinegar Artichokes And Treviso

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lemons
  4              small  artichokes
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     bone-in rib veal chops, 1/2" thick
  1              small  treviso head -- leaves separated
                        from stem
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To prepare the artichokes:  In a large pot combine the juice of 1 lemon and 3 quarts of water and bring to a boil.  Pull off the outer layers of deep green leaves from each artichoke and discard.  With a paring knife keeping the artichoke intact peel the tough fibrous dark green layer from the stem.  Rub each cut with wedges from the remaining lemon.

Place the artichoke on its side, cut off the top third, and discard.  Place artichokes in the boiling water and cook until tender approximately 10 to 15 minutes.  Once cooked place artichokes in an ice bath until completely cooled.  Drain and reserve artichokes.

To prepare the veal:  Heat a large sautÈ pan with the 3 tablespoons of olive oil.  Season each veal chop with salt and pepper.  Place chops in hot sautÈ pan and begin to brown.  Once brown on 1 side turn over and continue to brown for 1 minute.

Add artichokes and let cook for 1 minute.  Add whole leaves of triviso and deglaze with the balsamic vinegar.  Cook about 1 minute and then add the butter swirling the pan to emulsify.  Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.  Serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        warm water
  2               cups  red currant jelly
  1                     cinnamon stick - (2" long)
     1/2           cup  red wine
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar

In a large bowl, combine 6 1/2 cups wine, the vinegar, garlic, onions, and spices.  Add the venison, and stir the whole mixture together.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to rest in the refrigerator for 24 to 36 hours, stirring occasionally.

Remove the venison from its bath, patting the pieces dry, and reserve the marinade.  In a Dutch oven or other large, ovenproof vessel, sautÈ the pancetta in the olive oil for a few minutes, then remove to a plate lined with paper towels.  Add the venison chunks, working in batches, and sear on all sides, adding more oil if necessary.  When the meat is done, remove it to the plate with the pancetta and season well with salt and pepper.

Return the pancetta, meat and marinade to the Dutch oven and bring to a simmer.  Cover the pot loosely and braise the meat over a very low flame for 1 1/2 hours, until the meat is very tender.

With a slotted spoon or tongs, remove the meat to a serving plate.  Add the grappa to the braising liquid and reduce over a medium flame for 15 minutes.  Strain the sauce through a chinois, pressing down on the solids left in the strainer to extract the maximum juice and flavor.

Return the strained sauce to the pan and stir in the butter.  Season with salt and pepper and add the remaining 1/2 cup red wine to the sauce.  Serve the meat with the sauce poured over and the Prune Jam on the side.

Prune Jam:  Place all the ingredients in a saucepan and cook over medium-low heat until the prunes expand with heat and moisture and the wine and jelly meld and thicken, about 8 minutes.  Let sit for 10 minutes, then remove the cinnamon stick and serve a few tablespoons with each portion of meat.  (Makes 2 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

        Whole Wheat Pasta With Chickpeas - {Langanelli Con I Ceci}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  whole-wheat flour
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  4                     extra-large eggs
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided, plus
                        more for drizzling
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     celery rib -- coarsely chopped
  1                can  chickpeas - (16 oz) -- rinsed, drained
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Mound the flours in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly re-flour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.

Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Roll out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine and cut into irregular shapes.  Set aside.

In a 12- to 14-inch sautÈ pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over high heat and add the onion and celery.  Cook until browned, then add the chickpeas and cook 5 minutes more.  Place the mixture in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until pureed.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and return to the pan to keep warm.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the pasta in the boiling water until tender yet al dente, about 2 minutes.  Drain the pasta and add to the chickpea puree.  Toss over high heat 1 minute to coat, drizzle with olive oil and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
