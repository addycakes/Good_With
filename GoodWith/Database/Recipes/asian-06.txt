Serving Size  : 3     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Japanese                        Rice/Grains


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  dried shiitake mushrooms
  2               cups  rinsed short- or medium-grain rice -- preferably shinmai
  2 1/3           cups  water (use 3 tblspns less water if using
                        shinmai)
  1                jar  chestnuts in heavy syrup - (7 oz) -- drained
  1              small  sweet potato -- peeled and diced
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce (usukuchi shoyu)
  2        tablespoons  mirin
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame seeds
                        Radish sprouts (kaiwari daikon) -- (optional)

Soak mushrooms in a bowl of warm water 30 minutes.  Squeeze dry; cut off stems.  Dice mushrooms. 

In a 3-quart saucepan, combine rinsed rice and water; soak 15 minutes.  Rinse chestnuts to remove syrup.  Drain well; cut into quarters.  Add mushrooms, chestnuts, sweet potatoes, salt, soy sauce and mirin to saucepan with rice; stir.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low.  Cover saucepan with a tight-fitting lid.  Simmer 15 minutes. 

Remove from heat.  Let stand, covered and undisturbed, 10 minutes.  Carefully break up rice mixture with a dampened wooden rice paddle or spatula.  Spoon rice mixture into serving bowls.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds and radish sprouts. 

This recipe yields 3 or 4 servings. 

Comments:  Typhoons and red dragonflies are harbingers of Japanese autumn.  So are burnished red maple leaves and shinmai, the first rice of the season. 

Celebrate the majesty of fall and serve this bountiful rice dish, with chestnuts, sweet potatoes and shiitake mushrooms.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     7/8         pound  boneless beef rump -- thinly sliced
  2 1/2         ounces  string beans
     1/2                carrot
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Sesame oil -- as needed
  1                     burdock root (gobo)
                        Cornstarch
                        Cooking oil
                        === MARINADE ===
  4        tablespoons  soy sauce (shoyu)
  2        tablespoons  sweetened cooking sake (mirin)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  Japanese rice wine (sake)
                        === SIMMERING LIQUID ===
     5/8           cup  kelp-flavored fish stock (nidashijiru)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce

Mix ingredients for marinade in bowl.  Marinate beef in it for about 30 minutes. 

String the beans.  Pare and cut carrot into matchstick-size pieces.  Boil string beans and carrot for 1 to 2 minutes and drain in colander.  Heat sesame oil in frying pan and saute string beans and carrot, season with salt and pepper.  Remove and let cool. 

Wash burdock and scrape off thin brown skin with back of knife.  Cut into quarters lengthwise and soak briefly in water containing vinegar to prevent discoloration.  Boil for a few minutes in fresh water containing vinegar and drain in colander. 

Mix ingredients for simmering liquid and boil in pot.  Add burdock and continue cooking until soft.  Remove burdock and let cool. 

Divide beef into thirds, flatten one by one on cutting board, flour with cornstarch and roll with string beans, carrots  and burdok inside.  Wet rolled edge and press to seal well. 

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Lightly grease oven plate with cooking oil.  With rolled edge down, place beef rolls on oven plate and bake for 10 to 12 minutes (when baking in high-speed gas oven), until brown.  Baste beef with remaining marinade every 4 to 5 minutes.  Can also be panbroiled thoroughly in a frying pan. 

Cut beef rolls into bite-size pieces and place on serving plate.  Garnish with leaves and/or pickled vegetables cut decoratively (for example, like flowers). 

This recipe yields 3 rolls.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Japanese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  cellophane noodles
  3        tablespoons  suet or peanut oil
  6                     scallions -- cut into 1" slices
  10                    shiitake mushrooms - (abt 8 oz)
  8             ounces  Chinese cabbage -- thinly sliced
  4             ounces  snow peas
                        (or sliced bamboo shoots or bean sprouts)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2         pounds  top sirloin, prime or choice grade -- very thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  sake
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  2               cups  beef stock -- or more as necessary
  8             ounces  firm tofu
  1              bunch  trefoil - (3 oz of leaves)
                        Short-grain sticky rice

Cook the noodles al dente according to the package directions.  Rinse under cold water and cut into 2-inch lengths. 

Heat half of the suet in a large heavy saute pan or wok over medium-high heat until it begins to melt.  Cooking the ingredients in 2 batches, add half of the scallions, mushrooms, cabbage, and snow peas, and toss to coat with hot fat.  Stir in half of the sugar and caramelize the vegetables for about 2 minutes.  Push the vegetables to the side and add some of the beef in 1 layer, sear until browned on all sides, about 1 to 2 minutes, and then push it aside as it cooks and add more of the beef until you have used half of it; do not overcook. 

Add 1/4 cup each of sake and soy sauce, about 1 cup of the stock, and half of the tofu.  Bring to a boil.  Turn down the heat to medium-low, add half of the noodles and trefoil, and simmer briefly, until the vegetables are just cooked, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Keep warm while you prepare the second batch, repeating the process.  Serve in warm bowls with the rice on the side. 

Notess:  Cellophane noodles are called for in this recipe, but traditionally, shiratake -- a thin starchy noodle made from a root vegetable -- is used.  Shiratake is hard to find unless you have a good Japanese market nearby.  One option with this recipe is to double the amount of noodles and omit the rice. 

Suet is a little-used ingredient these days, but it gives the dish a richness that the oil does not.  Traditionally, raw egg is used with sukiyaki, as a dip; it cooks immediately on contact with the hot food.  However, due to health concerns, the egg is often omitted and it is not recommended if you are preparing the dish in your kitchen to bring to the table.  If you prefer to omit the tofu, add more beef or vegetables. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Sukiyaki is a Japanese stir-fry that is traditionally prepared at the table in a special pan.  Guests use chopsticks to serve themselves out of the pan or to cook the meat in the simmering broth, as with fondue.  This recipe has been adapted so that it can be prepared quickly in your kitchen.  It uses trefoil, a member of the parsley family, which has a long thin stem with many 3-pointed leaves.  It has a light flavor somewhat similar to sorrel or celery.  Trefoil can be found in some Asian markets but if it is not available, use 3 ounces of sorrel or spinach.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  cubed beef
     1/2          head  cabbage -- sliced
     1/2         dozen  scallions -- cut 1/2" slices
  1              large  sweet potato -- peeled, sliced
  2                     bell peppers -- quartered
                        Lots of small mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds
  1           teaspoon  hot red pepper
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  rice vinegar

Combine sesame seeds, pepper, garlic, soy sauce, sugar and rice vinegar into a marinade.  Marinate meat for one hour. 

Cook over charcoal, on a griddle or under a broiler.  Dip veggies in marinade and grill.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Until the 1500s, meat (niku) was virtually unknown in the Japanese diet.  Indeed, it was regarded with something between scorn and contempt as a bizarre Western aberration.  But once it was introduced into the diet by Portuguese and Dutch explorers and missionaries, it slowly became a standard part of Japanese cuisine, beginning first in port towns, and spreading ultimately through the society. 

These days, beef has become an object of great desire, raised with care, cultivated at great expense, served at extraordinary cost.  There are those who argue that Japanese beef is the best in the world.  And like the finest beef, it's cooked with much care, to maintain as much of its basic, primordial flavor as possible.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     burdock root (gobo)
                        Vinegar -- as needed
     1/4         pound  sliced bacon
                        Salad oil -- as needed
     3/4         bunch  young spinach (horenso) leaves
  2                     lettuce leaves
  1                     celery stalk
  4                     radishes
                        === MAYONNAISE DRESSING ===
  1                     egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
     1/4           cup  salad oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Wash burdock and scrape off thin brown skin with back of knife.  Cut into 1 1/2-inch matchstick-size pieces, placing them to soak in water-vinegar solution as you cut, to prevent discoloration.  Boil for a few minutes in water containing vinegar and drain in colander. 

Cut bacon into 1-inch pieces.  Heat salad oil in frying pan, add bacon and fry until crisp.  Drain on paper towels. 

Wash spinach and tear some into bite-size pieces (remaining whole leaves will be arranged on serving plate).  Tear lettuce into same size as spinach. 

Cut celery into 1 1/2-inch matchstick-size pieces, about the same size as burdock.  Cut radishes in a decorative way (for example, like a flower). 

Mix ingredients for mayonnaise dressing in bowl, add burdock, bacon, spinach, lettuce and celery and toss together. 

Arrange whole spinach leaves on serving plate, place tossed ingredients atop them and decorate with radishes. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

               Chicken And Egg Over Rice - {Oyako Donburi}

Recipe By     :Hiroyuki Sato
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Japanese
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4        medium  yellow onion -- thinly sliced
  2             ounces  chicken breast -- sliced
                        Shiitake mushrooms (fresh or dry) -- thinly sliced
  2                     or 3 snow peas -- julienned
  2                     green onion stalks -- chopped 1" to 2"
                        lengths
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1            serving  freshly-cooked Japanese-style rice
                        === DASHI ===
     1/2      teaspoon  dashi no moto -- dissolved in
     1/2           cup  water
                        (or use 1/2 cup chicken stock)
  2        tablespoons  or more soy sauce -- as needed
  1         tablespoon  or more brown sugar -- to taste

In a small skillet, place the sliced yellow onion, sliced shiitake mushrooms and dashi.  Cook for 2 to 3 miniutes until the onion is tender.  While cooking, add the chicken slices and green onion. 

When the chicken is cooked, spread the beaten egg over the vegetables and meat.  Sprinkle the julienned snow peas on top immediately.  Cook until the egg hardens partially or completely, as you like.  Pour a little of the sauce on top. 

To serve, you may put the rice on a dinner plate and place your gu on top of the rice.  Or you may serve it in the same way in a donburi.  If you cook for two or more, use a large skillet, divide the gu (topping), then serve. 

This recipe yields 1 serving. 

Comments:  This dish belongs to the ten-ya-mono category of Japanese recipes.  A tenyamono usually consists of gu (topping) which is placed on top of freshly cooked warm rice in a donburi (porcelain bowl).  The gu can be any of following: tempura; tonkatsu; beef cutlet; quick-cooked vegetables with with beef, pork, or chicken (sometimes cooked with a beaten egg); or some types of seafood including sashimi (sliced tuna or other variety).  O-yako means parent and child, reflecting the use of chicken and egg in this dish.

                    Chicken Stew - {Tori No Mizutaki}

Recipe By     :Ken Iisaka
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Japanese
                Poultry                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  chicken drumsticks -- chopped 1" pieces
  1              pound  tofu -- pressed, drained,
                        and cut into 1" pieces
  1             bundle  watercress
  1                     Chinese cabbage -- cut 2" pieces
  2               cups  shirataki (or substitute bean vermicelli)
  2               cups  spring onions in 2" pieces
  1                cup  diagonally thin-sliced carrots
  8                     dried shiitake mushrooms -- soaked in water
                        reserving this water
  1              piece  kombu seaweed, 2" by 6"
                        (or 2 tspns dashi powder (not for
                        purists))
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
  1                cup  Kikkoman soy sauce
     1/2           cup  rice vinegar
  1                     lemon

Add 1 inch of water to a 12-inch table-top skillet (electric or gas, whatever is available).  Add the kombu and boil.  Just before it starts to actually boil, remove the kombu.  If you are using dashi powder, add it now.  If you soaked the shiitake mushrooms, dump that water in here, too.  Anyway, just put whatever you want to eat in the water to cook it until ready.  Serve with dipping sauce (just mix what's shown above) and lots of steamed rice.  It will make you very warm. 

If you have the luxury of obtaining shichimi togarashi, sprinkle in a bit for added flavour. 

When you are finished, dump some rice into the remaining water and cook gently to make congee. It's so good in the morning. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

If you are using dashi powder, add it now.  If you soaked the shiitake mushrooms, dump that water in here, too.  Anyway, just put whatever you want to eat in the water to cook it until ready.  Serve with dipping sauce (just mix what&apos;s shown above) and lots of steamed rice.  It will make you very warm.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  dried harusame noodles
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  3              small  cucumbers
     3/4         block  kamaboko fish cake

Cut the kamaboko crosswise into 1/4-inch strips, then cut again to make 1/4-inch squares.  Add to noodle mixture.  Pour the dressing over the salad, and toss well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  Ichiban Dashi -- (see recipe)
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  soy sauce
                        Several fresh parsley leaves
  4             slices  kamaboko (fish cake)

Bring dashi to a boil.  Add salt and soy sauce.  Divide parsley leaves and fish cakes between four bowls.  Add dashi.  If fish cakes aren't available, almost anything can be added instead, from fresh vegetables (mushrooms are a nice touch, as are snow peas), to chicken and fish, though traditionalists will argue that's a bit avant garde.

          Cold Chinese-Style Noodles - {Hiyashi Chuuka Noodles}

Recipe By     :Hiroyuki Sato
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Japanese                        Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TARE SOUP ===
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  white vinegar
  5        tablespoons  chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  Chinese or Japanese hot mustard -- (optional)
                        === GU ===
  2                     eggs -- fried crepe-style
                        (like a thin omelette),
                        then cut into thin strips
  2                     ham slices -- julienned (2 to 3)
     1/2                cucumber -- julienned
                        Thinly-sliced lettuce -- (optional)
  1              small  carrot -- julienned
  2                     cabbage leaves -- thinly sliced
  8             ounces  angel hair spaghetti

Boil both the prepared carrot and cabbage separately and let cool before serving. 

Cook the spaghetti and keep it cool.  Prepare the tare soup and the gu as described above.  Place cold spaghetti on a plate and garnish with gu.  Pour the tare soup over the noodles just before eating. 

This recipe yields 2 servings. 

Comments:  This is an imitation of hiyashi chuuka soba, a favorite summertime dish.  (Despite its name, actually made with ramen noodles, not soba.)  The only difference from the genuine hiyashi is the use of spaghetti noodles instead of ramen noodles.  You will be surprised that you won't taste that much of difference at all if you have tasted real hiyashi before.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  This is an imitation of hiyashi chuuka soba, a favorite summertime dish.  (Despite its name, actually made with ramen noodles, not soba.)  The only difference from the genuine hiyashi is the use of spaghetti noodles instead of ramen noodles.  You will be surprised that you won&apos;t taste that much of difference at all if you have tasted real hiyashi before.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Japanese                        Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried soba noodles
  2             sheets  nori (dried seaweed)
  1 1/2           cups  Tsuke-Jiru -- (see below)
  2                     green onions
                        Wasabi (horseradish powder) -- mixed with
                        Water -- into a paste
                        === TSUKE-JIRU ===
  2        tablespoons  mirin (sweet rice vinegar)
     1/4           cup  low sodium soy sauce
  1                cup  dashi (Japanese soup stock)
     1/4           cup  katsuobushi (dried bonita shavings)

Cook noodles in boiling water for seven minutes.  Drain, rinse under cold water.  Divide into four bowls. 

Toast seaweed over low heat, and garnish noodles.  Serve with thinly sliced green onions and wasabi, which can be mixed in sauce.  Dip noodles in sauce.  Enjoy. 

Tsuke-jiru (Dipping Sauce):  Combine ingredients, bring to a boil.  Strain through fine sieve.  Cool to room temperature. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  They do a great job of eating noodles in Italy, where the stuff is definitely everybody's idea of a real good time.  But they get really crazy about noodles (menrui) in Japan, to the point that noodles are a way of life, almost as much of a semi-religious totem as golf.  If you were among those who saw the wonderful film called Tampopo, you have some sort of idea of just how obsessed the Japanese are with their menrui.  In Tampopo, a cowboy/trucker/eccentric stops at a small noodle shop for a meal, and discovers that the woman running the place hasn't the foggiest notion as to what she's doing.  Along with a team of odd fellows, he teaches her to make a proper bowl of noodles -- a perfect bowl of noodles -- transforming her into a master of soba and udon.  The thing that amazes in the film is the attention to even the most miniscule of details; the winemakers at Chateau Margaux taste their product with no more discernment than these noodle aficionados.  Their tastebuds are perfectly attuned to every nuance of texture and temperature. 

In Japan, noodles are consumed winter or summer, hot in broth or cold in dipping sauce.  There are four main branches in the Japanese noodle family.  Soba, which translates as "nearness," is a thin noodle made from buckwheat flour, good hot or cold.  Chubby udon, made from wheat flour, is usually served hot, with tempura.  Hiyamugi is a medium-thickness wheat noodle, usually eat cold, served on a bed of ice, with fishcakes and chopped boiled eggs.  Somen, a very thin wheat noodle is also served cold with a dipping sauce, often with green shiso leaves, ginger and toasted sesame seeds.  It's considered to be very good form to loudly slurp your noodles.  It's a way of telling your host you approve of the cooking.

                           Cold Tofu Appetizer

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Japanese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  tofu -- cubed
  1           teaspoon  grated ginger
  1                     scallion -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sake (rice wine)

Divide the tofu into four cups.  Mix together the sauce ingredients and sprinkle them on top.  Flavor with chili pepper flakes if desired.  You can also sprinkle the tofu with dried bonita flakes. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Tofu -- bean curd -- is one of those things that you either growing up loving, or you spend much of the rest of your life trying to acquire a taste for -- a taste not easily acquired.  Which is a pity, for tofu is one of the healthiest products on earth, an ingredient made by grinding soybeans into pulp, draining the soy milk, then pressing it into a sort of "soy cheese" in much the same way that cottage cheese is made.  Tofu is high in protein, calcium and B vitamins, yet low in fat.  Like the potato, it has very little taste of its own, instead taking on the flavor of whatever it's cooked with.  And it's a ubiquitous part of the Japanese diet, eat cold with soy and ginger, or hot in any number of stews.  As a simple salad or appetizer, it can't be beat.  All you have to do is cut it into small cubes, and sprinkle it with any number of basic sauces.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Japanese                        Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     eggs
  2 3/4           cups  cooled soup stock -- see * Note
  4             slices  gu (filling, such as fishcake, shiitake
                        mushroom, or chicken breast, parboiled)
  4                     cilantro leaves (Chinese parsley)

* Note:   Chicken stock and fish-based stock (powdered or liquid form acceptable) plus dash of sake and soy sauce. 

Gently beat the eggs using a fork or chopsticks, not an eggbeater.  Add soup stock a little at a time while you stir the eggs.  It can be lukewarm but not hot. 

Place a slice of the gu in each cup, and pour in the mixture of egg and soup stock.  Place a cilantro leaf on top. 

Boil water in a steamer, and turn the heat down to medium.  Place the cups in the steamer, and steam for approximately 12 minutes. 

Try not to overcook; good chawan-mushi shouldn't have any air bubbles. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dried soybeans
                        water -- as needed
  1            package  commercial natto -- see * Note

* Note:  Please read the entire recipe first and make a note of the ingredients and utensils that will be needed.  The starter culture must be obtained from store-bought natto, unless you have other sources such as rice straw. 

Soak two cups of dried soybeans overnight in ten cups of water.  Put the soybeans in a stainless steel basket (or colander) and cover it with a piece of cloth slightly larger than the basket.  Put the above in a pressure cooker with 3 cups water, and place it on the stove.  Turn on the stove. 

After the pressure cooker starts hissing, turn down the flame so that the hissing is at its minimum level.  Cook for 15 minutes (measured from the time the hissing has started). 

DO NOT OPEN the pressure cooker yet.  Allow the pressure cooker and its contents to cool down.  If waiting is not your style, place the pressure cooker in the sink filled with cold water.  (The soy beans are considered to have cooled down as long as its temperature is below 140 degrees) 

Make sure that the kitchen counter and its surrounding area are absolutely clean.  Sterilize a tablespoon with boiling water.  Wash your hands and arms -- long-sleeved shirts not recommended. 

Have a package of commercial natto ready.  Open the lid of the pressure cooker, peel back the cloth cover to one end of the basket, and using the tablespoon, quickly mix in about two spoonfuls of natto starter with the beans.  Replace the cloth cover. 

Close the pressure cooker lid with its air relief hole uncovered.  Place the cooker in a picnic ice-chest and place an electric heating pad over it.  Replace the ice-chest cover. 

The natto will be ready in between 24 and 48 hours, depending on the temperature of the heating pad.  As an alternate heat source, a 7.5-watt lightbulb may be used.  If you don't have a pressure cooker, a regular pot may be used.  In this case, the cooking time will need to be increased to about two hours, and the amount of cooking water to about six cups. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

              Fried Rice With Chicken - {Tori No Yakimeshi}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Japanese                        Rice/Grains


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  light vegetable oil (safflower is good)
  5               cups  cooked rice
  2               cups  shredded cooked chicken
     1/2           cup  diced onion
     1/2           cup  diced celery
     1/4           cup  diced bell pepper
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2                     eggs -- well beaten
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce

Heat oil.  Stir-fry rice.  Add chicken, onion, celery, bell pepper, garlic.  Stir-fry until well blended.  Stir in beaten eggs and soy sauce.  Serve while hot. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  It would be hard to imagine Japanese cooking without rice (gohanmono).  In fact, it would be downright impossible, for the two are linked even more tightly than Italian cooking and pasta.  So vital is rice to the Japanese diet that the word for rice, "gohan," also means "meal."  And that "meal" is not quite like the rice eaten in the West.  For while Americans prefer long-grained rice, Japanese lean strongly towards short-grained, rather stubby rice, that emerges from the rice cooker in a slightly sticky state -- the better for the making of sushi. 

There isn't a meal during the Japanese day that isn't accompanied by rice; it's eaten for breakfast, and it's eaten for dessert.  It's carried about rolled in balls as a snack.  And it's always finished, every grain; wasting rice is considered to be very bad form in Japan. 

Many Japanese cooks simply use a rice cooker, a basic electric kitchen device into which you pour rice and water, close the top, turn it on, and about half an hour later, you've got a potful of perfect rice.  Just like that.

     7/8         pound  boneless chicken fillet
     1/2                leek (shironegi)

                           Grilled Miso Chicken

Recipe By     :Susan Fuller Slack, "Japanese Cooking for the American Table
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Japanese
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce (usukuchi shoyu)
  2        tablespoons  sakÈ
  2        tablespoons  mirin
  2        tablespoons  light miso
  2                     green onions -- crushed and
                        slivered
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger root
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  8                     boned chicken thighs -- skin intact
  1         tablespoon  seven-spice powder -- (optional)

Blend soy sauce, sakÈ, mirin, miso, green onions, ginger root and garlic in a rectangular baking dish.  Coat chicken with mixture.  Marinate 1 hour or refrigerate overnight, turning several times. 

Preheat a hibachi, portable tabletop grill or charcoal grill.  Shake marinade off chicken; pat dry.  Place skin-down on hot grill.  Grill 4 to 5 minutes.  Turn chicken; grill second side 4 to 5 minutes or until golden brown and done inside.  When chicken is done, sprinkle with sesame seeds and spice mixture. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Miso marinade adds a rich flavor to this country-style grilled chicken.  Thigh meat stays moist and tender, but boned chicken breasts are delicious, too.  The chicken can be sautÈed in a skillet.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              piece  dried kelp (kombu)
  6               cups  water
  1 1/2           cups  dried bonita shavings

Combine kelp and water.  Bring to a boil.  Add bonita shavings.  Return to a boil.  Allow to cool. Strain through a sieve. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  In its own way, soup (shirumono) is as basic to the cuisine of Japan as rice.  Come summer or especially winter, it's the rare meal that doesn't begin with a bowl of refreshing broth, a dish usually served so automatically, it's not even mentioned on most Japanese restaurant menus -- it just arrives, as naturally as bread in a French or Italian restaurant.  Soup is used in the preparation of an innumerable assortment of Japanese dishes; it's one of the building blocks of the cuisine.  It's ubiquitous, and then some. 

The most basic of Japanese soups is dashi, a broth made with dried bonita shavings (katsuobushi) and dried kelp (kombu).  It's a clear, very mild soup, to Japanese cooking what a light chicken soup is to the cuisines of China and Europe.  And it's one of the easiest dishes in the world to make; all you have to know how to do is boil water.

Soup is used in the preparation of an innumerable assortment of Japanese dishes; it&apos;s one of the building blocks of the cuisine.  It&apos;s ubiquitous, and then some. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;The most basic of Japanese soups is dashi, a broth made with dried bonita shavings (katsuobushi) and dried kelp (kombu).  It&apos;s a clear, very mild soup, to Japanese cooking what a light chicken soup is to the cuisines of China and Europe.  And it&apos;s one of the easiest dishes in the world to make; all you have to know how to do is boil water.

                Japanese Potato Dumpling - {Curry Korokke}

Recipe By     :Hiroyuki Sato
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dumplings                       Japanese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  ground meat
  1              pound  potatoes
     1/2        medium  yellow onion -- minced
     1/2                egg -- beaten for potato
  1           teaspoon  curry powder -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Nutmeg -- to taste
     1/2           cup  flour
  1                     egg -- beaten for korokke
  2               cups  bread crumbs
                        Canola oil -- for deep-frying
  8                     cabbage leaves -- thinly sliced, and
                        soaked in cold water until serving time

Boil or microwave the unpeeled potatoes. 

Place the oil in a frying pan and add the onion.  Saute until the onion is tender.  Add the ground meat, salt, pepper, nutmeg and curry powder, then saute about 3 minutes until crumbled.  Set the meat aside while you peel and mash the potatoes. 

Thoroughly mix the potatoes and the meat in a large bowl.  Divide the potato mixture into eight parts, and shape each portion into a 1/2-inch thick ellipse.  Dredge each portion in the flour and pat off the excess flour.  Dip them into the egg and then into the bread crumbs on a plate.  Deep- fry them at 350 degrees for about 3 minutes on each side until lightly browned.  Drain them on paper towels. 

Serve with thinly sliced cabbage and your favorite sauce (i.e. A1 steak sauce, ketchup, Heinz 57 or Japanese tonkatsu sauce). 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This looks a lot like a knish; it's basically a piece of dough stuffed with potatoes, meat, or cheese and baked or fried.  If my memory is right, it was invented in Japan by a chef who cooked for the Meiji Emperor.  I believe the Japanese version of curry rice is also one of his creations. 

This recipe uses beef or pork, but substituting canned salmon or tuna should work great.  Also, cod roe, which has to be baked, can be used, if you care for tiny pink fish eggs.

     1/3                Japanese radish (daikon)
                        Sesame oil (goma-abura) -- for frying
                        === MARINADE ===

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  yellow onion -- sliced
  2                     or 3 potatoes -- cut into big
                        or small chunks
  2                     carrots -- diced
  1                cup  whole mushrooms
     3/4         pound  beef or other meat -- cut bite-size
  1                box  curry roux (Japanese brand)
                        Warm freshly-cooked rice

Heat a deep pan and add one or two tablespoons of oil.  Saute the sliced onion over medium heat until it softens.  Brown the meat separately, then add it to the onion.  Add water as specified, add a bay leaf, and simmer for 2 hours.  Then add the potatoes, carrots and mushrooms and continue simmering. 

When the potates and carrots are tender add the curry roux.  Simmer gently for 15 minutes while stirring.  Serve with rice. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Read the instruction on the box of commercial curry roux and find out what ingredients you need first.  You may increase or decrease the amount of vegetables and meat by as much as 50% if you wish.  However, the amount of water you add should not be decreased.  If the consistency of the curry stew is too thick, adjust it by adding water at the end.  The commercial curry roux contains everything, so you do not need to add salt or pepper.  Typical ingredients are listed above.

  1              pound  russet potatoes
     1/2                cucumber -- see directions
     1/2         small  white or yellow onion -- thinly sliced,
                        soaked in cold water
  1           teaspoon  yellow mustard (a touch of
                        Dijon mustard is also nice)
  3              large  sandwich slices of ham -- cut small squares
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Boil the unpeeled potatoes.  Meanwhile, cut the cucumber lengthwise and remove the seeds.  Cut the cucumber into thin slices and place them in a small bowl.  Add one teaspoon salt and mix well. 

Cut the onion into thin slices and soak them in cold water until you're ready to use them. 

When the potatoes are done, remove the skins and cut the potatoes lengthwise, then cut them into pieces about 1-inch wide.  Wash the cucumber with water and squeeze the water out.  Also squeeze the water from the onion. 

Place the potatoes, cucumber and onion slices, ham, and the rest of the ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This potato salad tastes very close to the kind you buy in Japan.  You could also add chopped apple slices to surprise your taste buds.

                           Miso Soup Varieties

Recipe By     :Hiroyuki Sato
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Japanese                        Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  30                    half-inch cubes tofu
  4                     mushrooms -- sliced
  2             stalks  green onions -- chopped
  4               cups  water
  2          teaspoons  dashi (nomoto)
  3        tablespoons  miso - (to 4 tbspns) -- to taste

Boil 4 cups of water and dashi.  Add tofu and mushrooms, simmer gently about 3 minutes.  Add miso and dissolve completely.  Immediately turn off the heat and add chopped green onions, then serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This soup is served every morning in Japan, with the flavors of seasonal vegetables.  There are several different kinds of miso paste available in the United States.  Shiro-miso paste is a mild one and is low in salt.  On the other hand, aka-miso is very salty and has a different, stronger fragrance than shiro-miso.  Miso soup base is made out of a fish stock called dashi.  You can purchase dashi at any Oriental food shop.  You can enjoy almost any vegetable with this soup, from lettuce to snow pea pods.  Here's a list of vegetables you might want to try in the miso soup. 

Types of gu and preparation suggestions

The above recipe uses tofu, green onions, and mushrooms. 

Note:  You have to cook the hard vegetables(*) longer, ten minutes or so.  If you have a combination of soft and hard vegetables, add the soft vegetables later.  The miso flavor will weaken if you overcook the miso.

                         Nipponese Chicken Wings

Recipe By     :Hiroyuki Sato
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Chicken
                Japanese                        Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  chicken wings -- cut off wing tips
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  sake or white wine
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  ginger root -- minced
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1         tablespoon  ginger root -- minced
  4        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2                     or 3 green onion stalks -- finely chopped
                        Tabasco to taste -- (optional)

Prepare the sauce at least 2 to 3 hours before intended use. 

Marinate chicken wings at least 1 hour.  Drain off the marinade and bake the wings at 400 degrees on the top shelf of the oven for about 40 to 60 minutes.  Turn the wings a couple of times while baking. 

Arrange the chicken wings on a plate and pour the sauce over the wings.  Cheers! 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Soy-sauce based chicken wings, hot or mild, can be a great appetizer for your party.  Marination takes some time but the rest is very easy to prepare.  Then beer or sake would be mighty good.

                        Octopus Balls - {Takoyaki}

Recipe By     :Robb Satterwhite and Kenji Mitsuyama
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Japanese                        Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  chopped boiled octopus
                        Cooking oil
                        Pickled ginger (benishoga) -- to taste
                        Chopped negi (or scallions) -- to taste
                        Tenkasu (or rice crispies) -- to taste
                        === BATTER ===
  2               cups  water
  1              piece  kelp (konbu), 4" square
     1/2         ounce  powdered katsuo-bushi (shaved dried
                        bonito)
  1 5/8           cups  flour
  2                     eggs
                        === SAUCE ===
                        commercial takoyaki sauce
                        or Worcestershire sauce
                        or bulldog sauce
                        or mayonnaise (Best Foods or Hellman's)

For the batter:  Clean the konbu by wiping it lightly with a cloth.  Cut the konbu into 3/4- to 7/8-inch-wide partial strips against the grain, but don't cut all the way to the edge. 

Add the water and konbu to a pot, and cook uncovered over a slow fire.  Just before the water starts to boil, remove the konbu from the pot.  The liquid should be a light yellowish or greenish color. 

Add shaved katsuobushi to the water as it starts to boil.  After the liquid has been boiling a minute or two, turn off the heat.  Quickly remove the shaved katsuobushi from the liquid with a filter or strainer or cloth.  Try to remove the katsuobushi while it's still floating on the surface, before it has a chance to sink. 

Allow the liquid to cool, then add the liquid, flour and eggs to a bowl and mix. 

For the takoyaki:  Make a small test batch of 4 or 5 takoyaki at first, to check the consistency of the batter.  Add more flour or water as needed. 

Oil the takoyaki pan.  Add pieces of chopped octopus to each cup  Pour in the batter.  Add benishoga, negi and tenkasu to taste. 

Cook the takoyaki pieces until they achieve the desired degree of firmness, turning them over frequently.  Remove from the pan and serve with sauce and/or mayonnaise. 

This recipe yields 50 to 60 pieces for 4 to 5 servings. 

Comments:  Takoyaki (octopus balls) are usually served at street stands, but they can also be made at home.  However, it will help if you have a takoyaki grill, or a similar device with 1-inch-diameter cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  cabbage -- cut small pieces
  1                     cucumber -- thickly sliced
  4        tablespoons  salt
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar

Combine ingredients in a jar, and store in the back of the refrigerator for several days, until ready to eat. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  There are few culinary pleasures greater than wandering around the pickle (tsukemono) section of a Japanese market.  Anything and everything can and is pickled in Japanese cuisine, from cucumber to eggplant, from plums (umeboshi) to fish. 

Traditionally, pickles are used as the closing dish in a meal, something to nibble on while you sip your tea, instead of gobbling a rich, creamy dessert.  As a final palate treat, it does make sense.  And it's as much fun to make yourself as to buy at the market, though at the market you usually have the chance to taste samples of every pickled item sold, which makes for a fine treat in the middle of shopping.

                         Pork Cutlet - {Tonkatsu}

Recipe By     :Hiroyuki Sato
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Japanese                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  pork sirloin, 1" thick -- (1/2 to 3/4 lb ea)
  1                     egg -- beaten
  2               cups  bread crumbs
  1                cup  flour
                        Peanut or canola oil -- for deep frying
  1                     lemon -- (optional)
                        Hot yellow mustard
                        Tonkatsu sauce -- see * Note 1
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Cabbage or lettuce leaves -- see * Note 2

* Note 1:  Use your favorite steak sauce and mix with ketchup to sweeten.  You can also mix in lemon juice, to add a touch of sourness.  A-1 or 76 steak sauce, or even Worcestershire sauce alone, goes well, too. 

* Note 2:  To prepare cabbage slices: Thin-slice 8 cabbage leaves and soak in cold water.  Drain well and use them as a garnish for the tonkatsu. 

Tenderize the meat and flatten to about 1/2-inch thick.  Season the pork with salt and pepper.  Coat the meat with flour and shake off the excess.  Dip the meat into the egg, then the bread crumbs on a platter.  Chill the meat in the freezer for 20 minutes or in the refrigerator for 2 hours.  This chilling process gives the tonkatsu a crispy crust. 

Deep-fry (350 degrees) until each side is light to medium golden brown.  Drain the oil well and serve with the garnish.  Slices of tomato will add some color. 

To tonkatsu-fry seafood or other types of meat, follow the same directions.  Of course, you have to peel the shells of shrimps.  Oysters are our favorite choice.  In Japan a bowl of miso soup usually comes with this dish.  Bon Appetit! 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This recipe also works very well with beef, chicken, oysters, and large shrimps or prawns. 

Japanese-Style Potato Salad (see recipe) goes very well with this dish.  Coleslaw would be nice, too.  Also, Japanese or Chinese yellow (hot) mustard can give some sensation to your taste buds. 

You can prepare biifu-katsu (beef cutlet) using the same directions.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;* Note 1:  Use your favorite steak sauce and mix with ketchup to sweeten.  You can also mix in lemon juice, to add a touch of sourness.  A-1 or 76 steak sauce, or even Worcestershire sauce alone, goes well, too. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;* Note 2:  To prepare cabbage slices: Thin-slice 8 cabbage leaves and soak in cold water.  Drain well and use them as a garnish for the tonkatsu. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Tenderize the meat and flatten to about 1/2-inch thick.  Season the pork with salt and pepper.  Coat the meat with flour and shake off the excess.  Dip the meat into the egg, then the bread crumbs on a platter.  Chill the meat in the freezer for 20 minutes or in the refrigerator for 2 hours.  This chilling process gives the tonkatsu a crispy crust. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Deep-fry (350 degrees) until each side is light to medium golden brown.  Drain the oil well and serve with the garnish.  Slices of tomato will add some color. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To tonkatsu-fry seafood or other types of meat, follow the same directions.  Of course, you have to peel the shells of shrimps.  Oysters are our favorite choice.  In Japan a bowl of miso soup usually comes with this dish.  Bon Appetit! 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  This recipe also works very well with beef, chicken, oysters, and large shrimps or prawns. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Japanese-Style Potato Salad (see recipe) goes very well with this dish.  Coleslaw would be nice, too.  Also, Japanese or Chinese yellow (hot) mustard can give some sensation to your taste buds. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;You can prepare biifu-katsu (beef cutlet) using the same directions.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Kelp (kombu) -- as needed
  1              pound  beef sirloin, preferably grain-fed -- sliced very thin
                        (Beer-fed Kobe beef is the best)
  8                     shiitake mushrooms
     1/2         pound  enoki mushrooms
     1/2         pound  shimeji mushrooms
     1/2         pound  shirataki
  1              pound  chinese cabbage
     1/2         pound  watercress -- to substitute for
                        spring chrysanthemum leaves
  1              pound  tofu -- cut 1" cubes,
                        pressed and drained
                        Any other ingredients you want to use
                        Hot steamed rice -- for serving
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
  2              parts  soy sauce
  1               part  lemon juice

On a portable range, place a medium-sized pot (1/2 gallon should do).  Place a couple of slices of kombu (a sort of kelp) and cover with cold water.  Gently bring the water to a boil and remove the kombu just before it actually starts to boil.  When the water is boiling very, very gently, you're set. 

Simply take one of the items, swish it around in the hot water for from a few seconds for beef to a few minutes for vegetables.  Serve with hot steamed rice.  Enjoy! 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Shabu-shabu means "swish-swish," referring to the swishing action when you cook a very thin slice of beef in hot water.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              dozen  clams
  1              pound  sea bass -- cubed
  1              piece  dried kelp

  1                     tofu cake -- cubed

Steam clams.  Save broth and add water to make one quart of liquid.  Pour into large pot, add all ingredients.  Boil gently until lightly cooked.  Serve in four individual bowls.

Comments:  Actually, Westerners know the one-pot cuisine of Japan well, only not by that name, or its Japanese name of nabemono (which means, literally, "one-pot cooking").  What Westerners know best is the nabemono dish called sukiyaki, a name that's been spoiled as the title of a hit song, and which many Westerners consider to be about as authentic a dish as chop suey.  And yet sukiyaki (which translate roughly as "grilled on a plough") is a venerable Japanese winter dish.  As are one-pot classics like yosenabe and shabu shabu, dishes that warm the soul as they heat the body.

As are one-pot classics like yosenabe and shabu shabu, dishes that warm the soul as they heat the body.

                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  well-marbled beef
  1             medium  nappa cabbage
  1                can  bamboo shoots - (15 oz)
  7                     green onions
  1              bunch  spinach
  12                    shitake mushrooms
     1/2         pound  shirataki (yam noodles)
  1                     tofu cake
                        === PONZU SAUCE ===
  1                cup  lemon juice
     1/3           cup  rice vinegar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1                cup  dark soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  tamari sauce
  3        tablespoons  mirin -- alcohol burned off
     1/3         ounce  dried bonito flakes
  1                     two-inch square konbu

Buy well marbled sirloin beef or lamb loin roast.  Have your butcher cut the meat into paper-thin slices.  Slices should be no larger than 8 inches by 3 inches.  This make convenient bite-sized portions. 

Notch decorative cross in the shitake mushroom caps.  Chop the green onions diagonally into 1 1/2-inch lengths.  Prepare the cabbage by trimming the bottom, and separating the leaves.  Parboil the leaves 2 to 4 minutes until tender. 

Cut the tofu in 1 1/2-inch squares.  Bamboo shoots should be washed, and parboiled to remove any lime deposits.  They should be cut into half-moon slices about 1/4-inch thick. 

Arrange the meat attractively on one platter, so it is easy to pick up with chopsticks.  Arrange the vegetables on another platter. 

Put a 4 inch square of konbu in a large donabe.  Fill the pot 3/4 full of water.  Add vegetables.  Bring to a boil, remove kelp.  Each diner then should be shown how to swish the meat back and forth in the broth.  It is from this swishing sound that shabu-shabu gets its name.  When meat and vegetables are finished, add the shirataki, and each diner can enjoy a bowl of noodle soup. 

Ponzu sauce:  Mix all the ingredients, and let stand for 24 hours.  Strain thru cheesecloth, and mature 3 months in a cool dark place, or refrigerate.  Good for 1 year. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Boil Japanese radish:  Wash Japanese radish, cut into 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-inch thick rounds and remove thick skin.  Peel very thin strip from edge of each slice; make a shallow crisscross on one side of each slice.  Boil in water that was used to rinse rice.  Turn off heat before radish becomes tender. 

Put kelp in pan and arrange Japanese radish over it.  Cover with water and cook until soft.  To test, insert chopstick. 

Prepare sesame-miso topping:  Toast sesame seeds; grind well in Japanese grinding bowl with pestle until seeds give off delightful aroma.  Put shiro-miso, sesame seeds, sugar, sake and stock in pan; mix well over low heat until smooth. 

Prepare chicken-miso topping:  Heat salad oil in frying pan and stir-fry ground chicken, stirring constantly to prevent chicken from sticking together.  Add chopped Japanese mushroom and stir-fry.  Add aka-miso, sugar, sake, water and cook over low heat, mixing well.  Add grated citron peel. 

Prepare plum-miso topping:  Wash ume, chop with knife and mash.  Put shiro-miso, sugar, sweetened cooking sake and stock in pan and cook over low heat, mixing well.  Add ume and mix until smooth. 

Serve diakon and toppings on separate plates; spoon favorite topping over Japanese radish at table.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  scallions
  1                cup  salt
  1 1/2           cups  vinegar
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  mirin (rice wine)
  1                cup  water
  1                     or 2 togarashi dried red chili peppers

Clean and wash the scallions, save the white part only.  In a large crock, alternate scallions and salt.  Mix together 1/2 cup vinegar, and 1 cup water.  Pour over scallions.  Cover with a plate or board, and top with a 10 pound weight. 

Within a few days the scallions will become limp.  At this time a lighter weight may be used.  After 2 weeks the scallions will loose their bitter flavor.  Drain them and dry on a cloth in a cool area for about 8 hours. 

Pack the scallions in a jar with the togarashi.  Combine 1 cup vinegar, sugar, mirin.  Stir until the sugar is dissolved.  Pour over the scallions.  Put a lid on the jar, and refrigerate. 

The pickles are ready in 2 weeks.  Good for 3 months in the refrigerator. 

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Trout
  1                     daikon -- shredded
  1                     carrot -- cut into curls
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  wasabi (horseradish)
     1/2           cup  dark soy sauce

You will need a fresh trout.  It is very important to use a fresh fish.  On a cutting board, cut the head off using a sashimi slicer.  Gut the fish and wash it in cold running water.  Use your free hand to keep the fish from slipping while you fillet it.  Keep the blade horizontal, and cut just above the skeleton of the fish from head to tail.  Turn the fish over and cut the second fillet.  Remove the rib bones from the fillets.  Remove any remaining bones with tweezers.  Remove the skin. 

Hint: Place the fillet skin-side down on a damp cutting board with the tail end facing you.  Make a cut beginning at the tail end.  When the blade reaches the skin, pull the skin to the left, while sawing with the blade to the right.  The aim is to cut away only the skin. 

Cut the fillets into 1/8-inch slices.  Place sashimi in a bowl of cool water, and rinse, then plunge it into an ice bath for 1 minute.  Arrange the slices in a row on a bed of finely shredded daikon and garnish with carrot curls. 

Serve early in the meal so it's subtle flavor may be enjoyed while your palate is still fresh.  Sashimi is ususally served on individual shallow dishes.  This is a dish that goes well with sake.

Comments:  It would be unthinkable to imagine the Japanese diet without fish (sakana).  The cuisine could survive the removal of meat and poultry, and even of noodles.  But without fish, it would cease to be Japanese cooking.  Rice and seafood are the two pillars upon which the food of Japanese is built.  And as an island nation, if it swims in the waters for hundreds of miles around, it's consumed in Japan.  There probably isn't anything that lives in the ocean that hasn't been tried, and turned into an object of remarkable tastiness through clever preparation.  Sushi and sashimi are just the beginning; in the Japanese kitchen, anything from the sea can be cooked so as to make it taste fresh and new.  And very delicious.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  It would be unthinkable to imagine the Japanese diet without fish (sakana).  The cuisine could survive the removal of meat and poultry, and even of noodles.  But without fish, it would cease to be Japanese cooking.  Rice and seafood are the two pillars upon which the food of Japanese is built.  And as an island nation, if it swims in the waters for hundreds of miles around, it&apos;s consumed in Japan.  There probably isn&apos;t anything that lives in the ocean that hasn&apos;t been tried, and turned into an object of remarkable tastiness through clever preparation.  Sushi and sashimi are just the beginning; in the Japanese kitchen, anything from the sea can be cooked so as to make it taste fresh and new.  And very delicious.
