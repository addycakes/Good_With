                         Apple Cider Gingerbread

Recipe By     :Mary Engelbreit
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2           cup  apple cider
                        = (or apple juice)
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  molasses
  1         tablespoon  cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  minced crystallized ginger
                        === LEMON SAUCE ===
  1                cup  sour cream
                        = (or plain yogurt)
                        Grated zest of 1 lemon
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Into an 8-inch round cake pan, sift together the flour, brown sugar, ground ginger, and baking soda.  Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the apple cider, oil, molasses, vinegar, and crystallized ginger.  With a fork, stir just until the batter is smooth.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Transfer the cake to a wire rack.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together the sour cream, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla.  Refrigerate.

Cut the warm gingerbread into wedges and serve accompanied by the lemon sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Gingerbread may be the world's best cold-weather dessert, and baking doesn't get simpler than this.  The cake is mixed and baked in the same pan, so your kids will be perfect helpers here.  Keep in mind that gingerbread tastes best when it's fresh from the oven -- put it in to bake when you sit down to dinner and you will have fragrant, moist gingerbread just in time for dessert.

                      Asparagus With Walnut Dressing

Recipe By     :Bettina Vitell
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  walnuts
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  sake
  1              pound  asparagus

Crush the walnuts in a food processor or suribachi, leaving small chunks.  Add the soy sauce, sugar, and sake and blend for 5 or 10 seconds, just until well combined.

Trim and discard the woody bottom portions of the asparagus stalks.  Cut them into 1 3/4-inch pieces.  Steam the asparagus for no longer than 2 minutes.  You'll know it's perfectly cooked when you smell its faint aroma escaping from the steamer.  Rinse it with cold water and drain.

For each serving, arrange stems and tips in a mound, with tips aiming upward.  Drizzle with the dressing, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This tangy walnut dressing is delicate enough not to overshadow the taste of the asparagus.  (It also goes well with steamed spinach.)  Serve this springtime dish in individual bowls or plates that complement the color and shape of the asparagus.

             Banana Sherbet With Yogurt And Strawberry Sauce

Recipe By     :Pierre Franey
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Ices/Sorbets

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     ripe but firm bananas
  5        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  plain lowfat yogurt
                        Strawberry Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Fresh strawberries -- for garnish
                        Fresh mint leaves -- for garnish

Peel the bananas, cut them into 1/4-inch slices, and place them on a platter in a single layer.  Cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 4 to 5 hours or more.

Place the frozen banana slices in a food processor, add the sugar, and blend at high speed for about 10 seconds.  Add the yogurt and continue blending at high speed until a fine and smooth consistency.  The whole process should take no more than 40 seconds.  Remove, place in a bowl, and put in the freezer.  Stir occasionally with a rubber spatula.  Keep in freezer until ready to serve.

To assemble, place 1 ball of banana sherbet in the center of each of 4 cold plates.  Place the Strawberry Sauce around and place fresh strawberries over the sherbet, with a few fresh mint leaves on the side or on the sherbet for garnish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This dessert can be made ahead of time.  However, it is important to stir the sherbet occasionally so that it does not freeze solid.  If it does, thaw it briefly and remix it by hand.  0ther fresh fruit, such as raspberries or blackberries, can be substituted for the strawberries.

Peel the bananas, cut them into 1/4-inch slices, and place them on a platter in a single layer.  Cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 4 to 5 hours or more.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the frozen banana slices in a food processor, add the sugar, and blend at high speed for about 10 seconds.  Add the yogurt and continue blending at high speed until a fine and smooth consistency.  The whole process should take no more than 40 seconds.  Remove, place in a bowl, and put in the freezer.  Stir occasionally with a rubber spatula.  Keep in freezer until ready to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble, place 1 ball of banana sherbet in the center of each of 4 cold plates.  Place the Strawberry Sauce around and place fresh strawberries over the sherbet, with a few fresh mint leaves on the side or on the sherbet for garnish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This dessert can be made ahead of time.  However, it is important to stir the sherbet occasionally so that it does not freeze solid.  If it does, thaw it briefly and remix it by hand.  0ther fresh fruit, such as raspberries or blackberries, can be substituted for the strawberries.

                       Basil Polenta With Tomatoes

Recipe By     :Jean Galton
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  low-fat (2%) or whole milk
  1                cup  cold water
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  imported instant polenta - (abt 6 oz)
  4                     plum tomatoes -- halved, seeded,
                        and cut into 1/4" dice
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  grated smoked mozzarella cheese - (4 oz)

In a medium-size heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the milk, water, basil, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper to a boil over high heat.  Slowly add the polenta while whisking constantly in one direction.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for 2 to 4 minutes, or until very thick.

Pour the polenta onto an ungreased baking sheet and spread into an 8-inch round.  Set aside until firm.

Preheat the grill to high and brush with oil.

In a small bowl, combine the tomatoes, garlic, 2 tablespoons of the oil, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper.  Set aside.

Cut the polenta into 8 triangles.  Brush the triangles with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil.  Grill the polenta for 3 minutes, or until browned on the underside.  Turn the polenta triangles over and sprinkle with the mozzarella.  Cover the grill and cook for 2 to 3 minutes longer, or until the cheese has melted.  Transfer to serving plates, top with the tomato mixture, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  When grilled, polenta becomes deliciously crusty on the outside while remaining creamy and tender on the inside.  Here it's topped with garlicky tomatoes -- a terrific way to start a summer meal.  Since polenta has a tendency to stick to the grill, generously oil both the grill and the polenta wedges, or you'll never pry them off the grill.

  8             ounces  beef fillet -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  2        tablespoons  Chinese rice wine
  1         tablespoon  water

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  all-purpose potatoes
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  4          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     3/4         pound  well-trimmed top round of beef, 1 1/2" thk
                        = (or beef sirloin)
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     scallions -- very thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  brine- or oil-cured black olives -- pitted, slivered
  2                     navel oranges -- peeled, sectioned
  1                     red bell pepper -- cut thin slices
  10            ounces  fresh spinach leaves -- torn

In a large pot of boiling water, cook the potatoes until tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain well.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and the cayenne.  When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them and cut them into 1-inch chunks.  Transfer the potatoes to the bowl with the vinegar mixture, tossing well to combine.

Preheat the broiler.  Rub the beef with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, the oregano, and black pepper.  Broil 6 inches from the heat for about 4 minutes per side, or until medium-rare.  Place the beef on a plate and let it stand for 10 minutes.  Cut the beef into I x 114-inch-thick strips, reserving any juices on the plate.

Add the beef, beef juices, scallions, olives, orange sections, bell pepper, and spinach to the bowl with the potatoes.  Toss well, divide among 4 plates, and serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  beets
  1             medium  waxy potato, such as Yukon Gold
  1 1/2           cups  plain nonfat yogurt
  1                     Vidalia onion -- minced
                        = (or 2 green onions, including greens)

In a glass or ceramic mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, onion, garlic, dill, dllantro, lemon juice, beets, and potato.  Season with salt and pepper.

Cover and refrigerate until chilled through, about 1 hour.  Serve cold.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving (1/2 cup):  72 calories;  4.5g protein;  0g fat (3% calories from fat);  13.5g carbohydrates;  1.1mg cholesterol;  61.5mg sodium.  Good source of Vitamin C;  calcium.

Comments:  Not quite salad, not quite salsa, raitas straddle the space between side dish and condiment.  A cooling accompaniment for curries, raita can be spooned right on the dish, or eaten as a chaser.

Refreshing and sweet, it's wonderful with grilled foods and with all kinds of curries (especially "My Favorite Chickpeas," see recipe).

                         Carrot Puree With Yogurt

Recipe By     :Ghillie Basan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  carrots -- peeled, sliced
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  caraway seeds
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  4        tablespoons  thick yogurt
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed with salt
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh mint
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh dill
                        Salt -- to taste

Steam the carrots until soft.

Prepare the sauce:  In a small bowl mix the yogurt with the lemon juice, garlic, and herbs.  Add a little salt to taste.

In a bowl, mash the cooked carrots with a fork and add the lemon juice, olive oil, and caraway seeds (or blend together in an electric mixer).  Season to taste.

Spoon the carrot mixture onto a serving dish and make a well in the center.  Spoon the yogurt sauce into the well and serve immediately with bread, while the carrots are still slightly warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving:  31 calories (13% calories from fat);  2.7g protein;  0.5g tat (0.1g saturated fat);  4.7g carbohydrates;  0mg cholesterol;  142mg sodium.

Comments:  A Turkish carrot can be as long as a flute and as sweet as honey.  Used in many meat and vegetable dishes, they are particularly pleasant as side dishes.  This can vary from a simple arrangement of long strips of carrot, dressed in salt and lemon juice, sprouting out of a jug like a vase of rigid flowers, to slices of carrot deep-fried and served warm with cool garlic-flavored yogurt.  This refreshing version is from the Marmaris region.

                            Cherry Clafouti II

Recipe By     :Georgeanne and Ethel Brennan
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BATTER ===
  3                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  1 1/4           cups  milk
  1                cup  flour
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        = (or 1 vanilla bean)
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  cherries -- pitted
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch square baking dish that is at least 2 inches deep.

To make the batter, whisk together the eggs and milk in a bowl until blended.  Slowly whisk in the flour; do not hurry this step or lumps may form.  Mix in the vanilla extract, or split the vanilla bean lengthwise and, using the tip of a knife, scrape the seeds into the batter.

Cover the bottom of the baking dish with the cherries.  Pour the batter over the cherries, being careful not to dislodge them.  Dot the batter with the butter.  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the batter has nearly tripled in size, the top is golden brown, and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.  Remove from the oven and serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Traditionally made during cherry season in France, this classic dessert can also be made with other fruits, such as halved figs, plums, apricots, and quartered peaches.  Children can help pit the cherries and whisk togather the batter, and it is fun for them to see the clafouti rise to nearly three times its original height in the oven before collapsing the moment it begins to cool.

                Cherry Tomato Pasta With Fresh Goat Cheese

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  halved very ripe sweet cherry tomatoes -- preferably a
                        mixture of red and yellow
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  minced fresh basil
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  10            ounces  dried fettuccine or other pasta
  2             ounces  fresh goat cheese -- crumbled

Place the cherry tomatoes in the bottom of a pasta serving bowl and stir in the garlic, salt, pepper, half of the basil, and the olive oil.  Set aside.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boll.  Add the pasta and cook until just tender.  Drain.

Immediately add the hot pasta to the bowl holding the tomatoes and stir in the goat cheese.  Toss until the cheese has melted and a sauce has formed.

Garnish with the remaining basil and serve at once.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Comments:  The fresh goat cheese added to the hot pasta and fresh tomatoes will melt and bind with the tomatoes' juice and olive oil to form a creamy yet delicate sauce.

                              Chickpea Pilaf

Recipe By     :Ghillie Basan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  chickpeas -- soaked overnight
  6             ounces  long-grain rice
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  clarified or ordinary butter
  1               pint  water or chicken or beef stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Drain the chickpeas and cook in fresh water for about 45 minutes, until tender.  Drain well.  Wash the rice and soak if necessary.

Soften the onion in the fat.  Stir in the chickpeas and the drained rice.  Pour in the stock, season with the salt and pepper, and bring the liquid to the boil.  Reduce the heat and cook until almost all the liquid has been absorbed.  Remove the pan from the heat, cover with a dry dish towel, and press the lid down tightly on top.  Leave to steam for 15 to 20 minutes.

Fluff gently with a fork and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Every Friday when Mahmut Pasha, the famous Grand Vizier of Mehmet the Conqueror, invited his ministers to lunch he would serve an intriguing mound of rice and chickpea pilaf as the climax to the meal.  Intriguing, because dispersed amongst the chickpeas would be solid-gold balls, molded by his goldsmiths to resemble chickpeas, which would bring good fortune to the guests lucky enough to procure them in their spoons.  Finely chopped leek or spinach can be added to this pilaf.

Recipe By     :Ethel Brennan and Georgeanne Brennan
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Unsalted butter -- for popover pans
                        All-purpose flour -- for popover pans
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  1                cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  butter -- melted
  2                     fresh serrano chiles -- seeded, minced
  3             ounces  goats' milk feta cheese - (to 4) -- crumbled into
                        pea-sized pieces - (1/2 to 2/3 cup)

Preheat oven to 475 degrees.

Grease 12 muffin cups with butter and then dust with flour, tapping out any excess.

In a medium bowl, sift together the 1 cup flour and salt.  In a small bowl, gently stir together the eggs, milk, and melted butter.  Fold the egg mixture into the flour mixture and stir with a fork until smooth; be careful not to overmix.  The batter will be the consistency of heavy cream.  Gently stir in the chiles and feta.

Pour the batter into the prepared muffin cups, dividing it evenly.  They should be two-thirds full.  Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to bake until the popovers have doubled in size and are barely browned, another 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and prick the tops.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 popovers.

Comments:  Airy popovers are an alternative to potatoes or bread, suitable for serving alongside meats or ragouts.  Here the faint saltiness of the feta complements the subtle spiciness of the chiles.  If the feta is overly salty, soak it in cold water for 15 to 20 minutes.

                          Chocolate Almond Torte

Recipe By     :Helene Siegel and Karen Gillingham
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped
  6                     egg yolks
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  finely-ground almonds
  1         tablespoon  rum
                        = (or vanilla extract)
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
  8                     egg whites
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting
                        = (or whipped cream)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat a 9-inch springform pan with butter and line with parchment.

Melt the chocolates together in a bowl over simmering water or in the microwave.  Cool.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat together the egg yolks, sugar, and almonds.  Beat in rum or vanilla and the almond extract.  Pour in melted chocolate and beat well to combine.

In another bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Gently stir whites into chocolate mixture -- this is a thick, lumpy batter -- and pour into pan.  Bake about 50 minutes, until cake is set but moist -- the tester should come out clean.  Cool in pan on rack.  Remove sides and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar or serve with dollops of whipped cream.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  Combining chocolates gives this elegant, flourless cake extra complexity and flavor.  This is a good choice for Passover.

                            Chocolate Boulders

Recipe By     :Marcel Desaulniers
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  pecan pieces
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped 1/4" pieces
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped 1/8" pieces
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter -- cut 1-oz pieces
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (tightly packed)
  3              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Toast the pecans on a baking sheet in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.  Remove the nuts from the oven and set aside to cool to room temperature before using.

Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat.  With the heat on, place the 1/4-inch pieces of chocolate in the top half of the double boiler.  Use a rubber spatula to stir the chocolate until completely melted and smooth, about 4 to 6 minutes.  Transfer the melted chocolate to a 1-quart bowl and set aside until needed.

Place the butter and brown sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle.  Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes until soft.  Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl, then beat on high for 2 minutes until fairly smooth.  Scrape down the bowl.  Add the eggs and the vanilla extract and beat on medium for 3 minutes until smooth.  Scrape down the bowl.  Beat on high for 2 minutes until very smooth.  Add the melted chocolate and beat on medium for 1 minute until incorporated.

Operate the mixer on low speed while gradually adding the flour, baking soda, and salt and mix until incorporated, about 30 seconds.  Stop the mixer and add the chocolate chopped into 1/8-inch pieces and the toasted pecans, and mix on low for 30 seconds.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to finish mixing the dough until thoroughly combined.

Using a heaping tablespoon of dough for each cookie (approximately 1 3/4 ounces), portion 12 cookies, evenly spaced, onto each of 3 nonstick baking sheets.  Place the baking sheets on the top and center racks of the preheated oven and bake for 12 to 14 minutes, rotating the sheets from top to center halfway through the baking time (at that time also turn each sheet 180 degrees).  Remove the cookies from the oven and cool to room temperature on the baking sheets, about 30 minutes.  Store the cooled cookies in a tightly sealed plastic container.

This recipe yields 3 dozen 2 1/2-inch cookies.

Comments:  If you love sweets but haven't put in many hours in the kitchen (and prefer to keep it that way), these cookies are for you.  Chocolate Boulders are best eaten within a day or two of baking.  In fact, they are at their best when served within a few hours of being removed from the oven.

Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2         pounds  boiling fowl
  9               cups  water
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1              small  onion
  1                     fresh parsley sprig
  1                     fresh thyme sprig
  1                     mace blade
     1/2      teaspoon  black peppercorns
  2              whole  allspice
  1                     bay leaf
  1 1/2         pounds  leek
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Allspice -- to taste
  12                    pitted prunes

Carefully wash the chicken inside and out and pat dry with paper towels.  Pour the water into a large pot, add the chicken and the salt.  Peel the onion, cut it in half, add it to the pot, and bring to a boil.  Add the parsley and the thyme.  Tie the mace, peppercorns, and whole allspice in a small linen bag and add to the pot.

Cut off the upper green leaves from the leeks and discard.  Halve the leeks lengthwise, wash carefully, and cut into pieces about 2 inches long; add a quarter of them to the soup.  Skim the foam from the surface and continue to cook slowly over a medium heat for 1 1/2 hours.

Remove the tender cooked chicken, skin it, take the meat off the bones and cut it into pieces.  Strain the broth, add the rest of the leek, and bring back to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until the leek is cooked.  If necessary, adjust the seasoning with ground pepper and allspice.  Add the chicken and the prunes.  Remove the pot from the heat and leave to infuse for approximately 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This chicken soup originated in Scotland.  As in the case of most traditional recipes, there are many different versions in circulation, but the basic ingredients are always the same, namely a boiling fowl, fresh leeks, and prunes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PATE SUCREE ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  cold unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  1                     egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream -- plus
  1           teaspoon  heavy cream
                        === FILLING ===
  5        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/2           cup  corn syrup
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- plus
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1              pinch  salt
  1                     egg
  1                     egg yolk
     1/4           cup  dried cranberries
  2 1/2         ounces  walnut pieces -- toasted

Pate Sucree:  Using an electric mixer on low speed, combine the flour, butter, sugar, and salt until it forms pebble-size balls.  Combine the egg yolk and cream, add it to the flour, and mix just until the dough comes together.  Remove the dough from the mixer, pat into a disc, and cover in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate to chill thoroughly before rolling.

Roll out the Pate Sucree to 1/16-inch thickness.  Place six 3-inch-diameter by 1/2-inch-high tart rings on a parchment-lined sheet pan.  Cut six 4-inch circles from the dough and press them into the rings.  Refrigerate until firm, then trim the excess dough.

To make the tarts:  Combine the sugar, brown sugar, and corn syrup.  Brown the butter until it is smoky and has a nutty aroma.  Remove from the heat, immediately add the butter to the sugar mixture, and mix well.  Add the vanilla and salt and mix thoroughly.  Allow the mixture to cool, then add the egg and egg yolk.  Evenly distribute the cranberries and walnuts among the tart rings.  Fill the tarts one-third to halfway full with the sugar mixture (about 2 tablespoons per tart).

Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This make-ahead dessert can be served either warm or at room temperature.

Pate Sucree:  Using an electric mixer on low speed, combine the flour, butter, sugar, and salt until it forms pebble-size balls.  Combine the egg yolk and cream, add it to the flour, and mix just until the dough comes together.  Remove the dough from the mixer, pat into a disc, and cover in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate to chill thoroughly before rolling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out the Pate Sucree to 1/16-inch thickness.  Place six 3-inch-diameter by 1/2-inch-high tart rings on a parchment-lined sheet pan.  Cut six 4-inch circles from the dough and press them into the rings.  Refrigerate until firm, then trim the excess dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the tarts:  Combine the sugar, brown sugar, and corn syrup.  Brown the butter until it is smoky and has a nutty aroma.  Remove from the heat, immediately add the butter to the sugar mixture, and mix well.  Add the vanilla and salt and mix thoroughly.  Allow the mixture to cool, then add the egg and egg yolk.  Evenly distribute the cranberries and walnuts among the tart rings.  Fill the tarts one-third to halfway full with the sugar mixture (about 2 tablespoons per tart).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                              Creme Caramel

Recipe By     :Gerald Hirigoyen with Cameron Hirigoyen
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
  3              whole  eggs
  9                     egg yolks
                        Seeds from 1 vanilla bean
  1                cup  crËme fraiche
  3               cups  milk

Combine  1/2 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons water in a small shallow saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir constantly with a wooden spoon until the liquid caramelizes completely, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Immediately pour the liquid into a 6 1/2-inch soufflÈ mold and carefully (don't burn yourself with the hot caramel!) coat the bottom and sides of the mold as evenly as possible; set aside.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, using a wire whisk, combine the whole eggs, egg yolks, remaining 1 cup sugar, and vanilla bean seeds until frothy.  Add the crËme fraiche and milk.  Whisk for another minute until well combined.  Pour the ingredients into the mold.

Place the mold in a bain-marie in a baking pan, adding enough hot water to reach about halfway up the mold, and put it in the oven to bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until firm throughout.

Allow the crËme caramel to cool for 15 to 20 minutes before removing it from the mold onto a serving platter.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  CrËme caramel is immensely popular on both sides of the French-Spanish border.  In fact, it would be unusual to find a Basque menu anywhere without koka on it.  This particular koka has a silken texture and floats in a pool of deeply delicious caramel.

                             Deviled Biscuits

Recipe By     :Pat Chapman
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter - (to 4)
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  English mustard powder
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  curry masala mix
     1/3      teaspoon  salt
                        Lemon wedges

Mix the butter with the powders until it is creamy.

Spread it onto the biscuits.  Place them in a hot oven or under a hot broiler for 2 or 3 minutes.  Serve piping hot, with a wedge of lemon.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is a crafty recipe.  It uses up slightly stale cream cracker biscuits.  Best are small dainty ones, and of course, they do not have to be stale to start with.  A virtually instant "sauce" is spread on the biscuits, and they are oven-baked or put under the broiler.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (abt 3 1/2 lbs)
     1/2           cup  cilantro leaves
  4                     garlic cloves
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  ground chile
                        = (such as New Mexico Dixon)
     3/4           cup  salsa
                        = (chunky bottled salsa may be used)
     1/2           cup  Mexican beer

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Coat Dutch oven with oil.

Rinse the chicken, remove the innards, and cut off any large pieces of fat or skin about the vent.  Blot the chicken dry with paper towels.

Combine the cilantro, garlic, salt, and ground chile in a food processor.  Chop to a coarse purÈe.  Rub 1 tablespoon of the mixture inside the chicken.  Gently work your fingers under the skin of the breast to loosen it, then rub more of the mixture under the skin over the breast.  Rub the remaining mixture over the outside of the bird.

Place the chicken, breast up, in the Dutch oven.  Pour 1/4 cup of the salsa into the cavity of the chicken, then pour the remaining salsa over the bird.  Add the beer to the pan, cover, and bake for 1 hour.  Uncover and roast 10 to 15 minutes longer, basting the chicken with the pan juices a couple of times.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Comments:  Nothing could be easier -- and few dishes could taste better -- than this simple baked chicken from Jacqueline McMahan.  A blend of cilantro, garlic, and chile powder is rubbed inside and outside a whole chicken, then the bird is baked in a savory blend of salsa and Mexican beer.  The hardest part about this recipe is waiting for the chicken; the cooking aromas may drive you wild.  Serve with plain steamed rice or a basic rice pilaf to collect the delicious juices.  Leftovers are perfect for soft chicken tacos.

                       Fennel And New Potato Gratin

Recipe By     :Joanne Weir
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  red new potatoes -- unpeeled, and
                        well scrubbed
  3                     fennel bulbs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  heavy cream -- or as needed
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Cut the potatoes crosswise into slices 1/4-inch thick.  Bring a large saucepan three-fourths full of salted water to a boil.  Add the potatoes and boil until tender yet crisp, 10 to 12 minutes.  Drain well.

Meanwhile, cut off the feathery tops and stems from the fennel bulbs and discard.  Trim away any yellowed or bruised outer leaves.  Cut in half lengthwise and cut out the tough core portions.  Then cut crosswise into slices 1/4 inch thick.  Bring a large saucepan three-fourths full of salted water to a boil.  Add the fennel and boil until tender, 5 to 10 minutes:  Drain well.

Position a rack in the upper part of an oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.

Arrange a row of fennel slices along one short end of the prepared baking dish.  Arrange a row of potato slices slightly overlapping the fennel.  Continue to form overlapping rows of the fennel and potato slices until the vegetables are used up and the dish is filled.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

In a bowl, whisk together 2 cups cream and the mustard.  Pour as much of the cream mixture as needed over the fennel and potatoes to bring the liquid almost level with the vegetables.  If the liquid is not deep enough, add more cream as needed.  Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the top.

Bake until most of the cream has been absorbed and the top is golden, 30 to 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  At their best in early spring, new potatoes are immature tubers measuring only about 1 inch in diameter.  Their youth gives them thin, soft skins and, because their sugars have not yet turned into starch, a sweet flavor and crisp, waxy texture -- all qualities highlighted by this oven baked recipe that pairs them with bulb fennel.  Use feathery fennel fronds as a garnish, if you wish.

Their youth gives them thin, soft skins and, because their sugars have not yet turned into starch, a sweet flavor and crisp, waxy texture -- all qualities highlighted by this oven baked recipe that pairs them with bulb fennel.  Use feathery fennel fronds as a garnish, if you wish.

                 Fettuccine With Shrimp And Tomato Sauce

Recipe By     :Jill Norman
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  20             large  uncooked shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely sliced
  2          teaspoons  chopped lemon thyme
  1                cup  canned chopped tomatoes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12                    green olives -- pitted and halved
  1                     red pepper -- peeled, seeded,
                        and sliced
     3/4         pound  fresh fettuccine
                        A large handful of basil -- shredded

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a skillet and cook the shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes, until they curl and turn pink.  Remove them and set aside.

Add the garlic to the pan and cook over low heat until soft, but do not let it burn.  Meanwhile, heat a large pan of salted water for the fettuccine.

Add the thyme to the garlic, then pour in the tomato and season with salt and pepper.  Simmer for a few minutes, then add the olives and red pepper.  When the pasta water comes to a boil, reduce the heat under the sauce so that it barely bubbles and add the shrimp.

Cook the fettuccine until al dente, then drain well.  Put it in a serving bowl and toss with the remaining oil.  Toss the basil into the sauce, pour it over the pasta, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Tuna or swordfish, cut into cubes, makes an excellent alternative to shrimp.  Cook 8 to 10 ounces in the sauce for 8 to 10 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE VINAIGRETTE ===
  2                     shallots -- minced
  1         tablespoon  champagne or white wine vinegar -- or more to taste
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE SALAD ===
  1              pound  fingerling potatoes)
                        = (or other waxy new potatoes
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chervil or parsley
     1/2         small  fennel bulb -- stalks removed

To make the vinaigrette:  In a small bowl, whisk together shallots, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and olive oil.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Set aside for 20 minutes to marry flavors.

Put potatoes in a large saucepan with salted water to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then adjust heat to maintain a simmer.  Cover partially and cook until a knife pierces the potatoes easily, 12 to 15 minutes.  Drain and peel while hot.  Slice potatoes about 1/4 inch thick.  Transfer to a large bowl, add half the vinaigrette (about 2 tablespoons) and 1 tablespoon chervil, and toss gently to coat.  Taste and adjust seasoning.

Cut fennel bulb in half to make 2 wedges.  Cut away the core.  Slice wedges crosswise as thinly as possible.  (A mandoline or other manual vegetable slicer is helpful.)  In a bowl, combine fennel with remaining vinaigrette and remaining tablespoon chervil.  Toss gently, then taste and adjust seasoning.

One hour before serving, combine potatoes and fennel and toss gently.  Taste and adjust seasoning.  It may need more salt.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                 Fresh Pea Soup With Lemon Creme Fraiche

Recipe By     :Joanne Weir
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PEA SOUP ===
  4 1/2         pounds  fresh garden peas
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  10                    green onions -- thinly sliced
  2 1/2           cups  chicken stock
  2               cups  water
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE LEMON CR»ME FRAICHE ===
     1/2           cup  crËme fraiche
  1         tablespoon  milk - (to 2)
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Fresh lemon zest -- (optional)
                        Fresh chive blossoms -- (optional)

Shell the peas, reserving 8 of the pods.  You should have about 5 1/2 cups peas.  Set the peas and pods aside.  Have ready a large bowl of ice water in which a soup pot can be nested.

In the soup pot over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the green onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes.  Increase the heat to medium-high and add the peas, the reserved pods, chicken stock, and water.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the peas and pods are tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and nest the pot in the bowl of ice water.  Stir occasionally until cool, about 20 minutes.

Using a blender and working in batches, purÈe the cooled pea mixture on high speed until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes for each batch.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean saucepan.  Stir in the cream.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

To make the lemon crËme fraiche, in a bowl, whisk together the crËme fraiche and enough of the milk to make a barely fluid mixture.  Add the zest and lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper.

To serve, place the soup over medium heat and reheat to serving temperature.  Ladle into warmed bowls and drizzle with the lemon crËme fraiche, dividing it evenly.  Garnish with lemon zest and chive blossoms, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  It is essential to use very fresh, tiny, young spring peas for this soup, as the larger ones are starchy.  Cooling the soup in an ice-water bath will ensure that it keeps its bright-green color.  This soup can also be served cold.

Using a blender and working in batches, purÈe the cooled pea mixture on high speed until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes for each batch.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean saucepan.  Stir in the cream.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the lemon crËme fraiche, in a bowl, whisk together the crËme fraiche and enough of the milk to make a barely fluid mixture.  Add the zest and lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, place the soup over medium heat and reheat to serving temperature.  Ladle into warmed bowls and drizzle with the lemon crËme fraiche, dividing it evenly.  Garnish with lemon zest and chive blossoms, if desired.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  It is essential to use very fresh, tiny, young spring peas for this soup, as the larger ones are starchy.  Cooling the soup in an ice-water bath will ensure that it keeps its bright-green color.  This soup can also be served cold.

                              Garden Gratin

Recipe By     :Georgeanne and Ethel Brennan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              small  yellow onion -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme
  1                     globe eggplant -- cut 1/4"-thk rounds
  3              small  zucchini -- cut 1/4"-thk rounds
                        = (or other summer squashes)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3                     tomatoes -- sliced crosswise
                        into 1/4"-thk rounds
  1                cup  grated GruyËre cheese
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4           cup  fine dried bread crumbs

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion and thyme and sautÈ until the onion begins to turn translucent, about 3 minutes.  Add the eggplant, zucchini, salt, and pepper and turn them in the pan two or three times to coat them with the oil.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the eggplant and zucchini are tender and can easily be pierced with the lines of a fork, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

To assemble the gratin, layer about one-quarter of the eggplant mixture in an ungreased, shallow 8- by 8-inch baking dish.  Top with a layer of tomatoes and then one-quarter of the GruyËre and Parmesan cheeses.  Repeat the layering process until you have used up the vegetables, creating three to four layers.  Cover the top with the remaining cheese and the bread crumbs, and drizzle with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil.

Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until tender all the way through when pierced with a knife.  The juices should be bubbling at the sides.

Serve immediately directly from the dish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Children who are comfortable using knives and working at the store can make this simple dish on their own with adult supervision.  If children are new to the kitchen, put them in charge of grating the cheese and bread crumbs with a handhold grater and assembling the dish before baking.

Recipe By     :Jean Galton
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     red bell peppers -- halved, cored,
                        and seeded
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1             medium  russet potato -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  2               cups  chicken or vegetable broth
  1                cup  cold water
  2 3/4      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  12             small  shrimp - (abt 6 oz) -- peeled, deveined
  2        tablespoons  julienned fresh basil

Preheat the grill to high and brush with oil.

Place the peppers on the grill, skin side down.  Grill, turning occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly charred on both sides.  Let cool, then coarsely chop the unpeeled peppers.

In a large saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the peppers, onion, and garlic and cook, stirring, for 4 to 6 minutes, or until the onion is softened.  Stir in the potato, broth, water, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to a medium-low and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the potato is very tender.

In a food processor or blender, purÈe the soup, in batches, until smooth.  Return the soup to the saucepan, cover, and keep hot over very low heat.

Sprinkle the shrimp with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper, and drizzle with the remaining 1 teaspoon oil.  Grill the shrimp, turning once, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until bright pink and firm to the touch.  Ladle the soup into serving bowls, arrange the shrimp in the center of each bowl, and scatter the basil over.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Ham Basted With Dark Lager

Recipe By     :Michael Jackson
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ham                             Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pounds  cured ham - (to 8)
  1 3/4           cups  sweet dark lager
  1 1/2           cups  soft dark brown sugar
  24                    whole cloves

Soak the ham in cold water for 2 to 3 hours.  Remove the ham and place it in a very large pan.  Cover it with fresh water, and add 1 1/2 cups beer, and 1 cup sugar.

Bring the ham to the boil, cover, and simmer for 3 to 4 hours.  Turn off the heat, and leave the ham in the liquid until cool.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Lift out the ham, wipe and dry it thoroughly with a clean, absorbent cloth, and trim off the skin.  Run a sharp knife over the skin, forming 1-inch-wide squares.  Insert a clove in the center of each square, then cover the ham with the remaining brown sugar.

Bake the ham for 30 minutes, or until it is golden brown.  Baste the ham with the remaining dark lager at least twice during the cooking period.  Allow the ham to rest, and cool, before carving.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  The German, and especially Bavarian, passion for smoked pork and ham seems to know no bounds.  Bavarian hams are often basted with dark brews.  A knuckle may be served, or a whole ham sliced at the table, often with a second serving coming along behind.  A caramelized onion "chutney" or orange marmalade will enhance the savory/sweet interplay; so will sweet Bavarian mustard.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  nonfat plain yogurt
  1                     scallion -- cleaned, and
                        finely minced - (1 tbspn)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1              small  garlic clove -- peeled, crushed,
                        and finely chopped - (1/2 tspn)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Toast, crackers, or bread -- for serving

Place the yogurt in a fine strainer set over a bowl, and refrigerate it for 8 hours to allow the moisture to drain out.

Discard the liquid, and place the yogurt in a mixing bowl.  Add the green onion, parsley, garlic, pepper, and salt.  Mix well.

Transfer the mixture to a 12-inch-square piece of cheesecloth.  Gather up the edges of the cheesecloth so that the mixture inside forms a ball.  Tie the cloth together and refrigerate.

When ready to serve, unwrap the cheese, invert onto a plate, and serve with toast, crackers, or regular bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving:  41.7 calories;  4.6g protein;  0g total fat (0g saturated fat);  4.6g carbohydrates;  0mg cholesterol;  175.7mg sodium.

Comments:  This is an herbed cheese that is easy and fun to make; you simply drain off the liquid in the yogurt to create a thick cheese.  Although this recipe calls for nonfat plain yogurt, you can use a partially defatted or a regular yogurt instead, depending on your own preferences and requirements.

  2        tablespoons  sweet soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  annatto seed oil
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
                        === MARINADE III ===
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil

Combine all the Marinade I ingredients.  Rub into the inside of the chicken and close with a needle or a bamboo stick.  Marinate for 1 hour.

Set chicken in a baking pan.  Combine Marinade II ingredients.  Pour over chicken.  Place in oven at 375 degrees.

Mix the Marinade III ingredients.  Baste the chicken with this marinade every 10 to 15 minutes.  Bake until skin is a golden brown and chicken is well cooked.

Cut up the chicken and assemble on a serving platter.  Serve with deep-fried sweet buns or steamed sticky rice.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This recipe works well with any type of fowl or game.  Since considerable time is involved with the marinades and cooking, it is probably best suited for a large bird and special occasion.

Helpful Hint:  Basting is the secret to this recipe.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2                     carrots -- cut 1" lengths
  2                     parsnips -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" lengths
  2                     turnips -- peeled, and
                        cut into 8 wedges
     1/2         pound  small red potatoes -- quartered
     2/3           cup  quick-cooking barley
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4         pound  green beans -- cut 1" lengths
  1                cup  frozen peas

In a large saucepan, heat the oil until hot but not smoking over medium heat.  Add the carrots, parsnips, and turnips and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Add the potatoes, barley, salt, thyme, and pepper, stirring to coat.  Add 3 1/3 cups of water and bring to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until the vegetables and barley are tender, about 10 minutes.

Stir the green beans into the pan, cover, and cook until the green beans are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the peas and cook, uncovered, until heated through, about 2 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Helpful Hint:  Quick-cooking barley, which has been precooked by steaming, is ready in less than 15 minutes, while regular pearl barley takes nearly an hour to cook.

                Sandwiches                      Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ground turkey
     1/2         pound  ground pork
     1/4           cup  diced onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  fennel seeds -- roughly chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh basil
  2        tablespoons  drained chopped sun-dried tomatoes
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red chile flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Olive oil -- for coating

Gently combine turkey, pork, onion, garlic, fennel, basil, sun-dried tomatoes, and red chile flakes in bowl.  Lightly form into patties.  Season all over with salt and pepper.

Preheat the grill or place cast-iron skillet over high heat.  Lightly coat grill or skillet with olive oil.  Sear patties until blackened on bottom, refraining from pressing.  Flip and cook second side until well seared for medium-rare.  (For medium or well-done, reduce heat to medium and cook a few minutes longer on each side.)  Drain on paper towels.  Serve hot on buns.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  For Italian sausage lovers -- these juicy burqers carry many of the same flavors.  They would be nice with a tart Italian green like arugula as topping.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
                        more for garnish
  1              small  carrot -- peeled, diced
     1/2                Spanish onion -- diced
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              small  celery stalk -- diced
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes - (to 1/2)
     1/2                cinnamon stick
  5        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
  1                cup  brown lentils -- rinsed, picked over
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
                        = (or 1/2 tbspn dried rosemary)
  4               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  honey - (to 1 1/2)
                        = (depending on how sweet you like it)
  1         tablespoon  sesame tahini
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  chopped scallions -- for garnish

Place a medium-size saucepan over medium-high heat and when it is hot, add 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Add the carrot, onion, garlic, celery, pepper flakes, cinnamon stick, and 2 tablespoons of the cilantro, stirring well after each addition.  Cook until the onion is soft, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add the lentils, rosemary, and water and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and cook until the lentils are very soft and the mixture is thick, about 1 1/2 hours.

Remove the cinnamon stick and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the honey, tahini, salt, and black pepper.  Transfer the mixture to a food processor fitted with a steel blade and purÈe until completely smooth.  Place the mixture in a fine-wire-mesh strainer and strain into a bowl, pressing with the back of a wooden spoon.  Discard the solids.

Place in a serving bowl and drizzle olive oil over the top.  Garnish with the remaining 3 tablespoons cilantro and the chopped scallions.

This recipe yields about 1 cup.

Comments:  Serve this as a dip with pita toasts or cruditÈs or as a spread for a grilled swordfish or salmon sandwich.

Wash lentils in a colander or a strainer under cold running water.  Be sure to get rid of any pebbles and dust -- keep rinsing the lentils until the water runs clear.

                 Marinated Steak Salad In Potato Baskets

Recipe By     :Carol Foster
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/3           cup  red-wine vinegar
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
  12            ounces  flank steak
  4                     Potato Baskets -- (see recipe)
  6               cups  shredded iceberg lettuce
  2               cups  thinly-sliced mushrooms - (abt 4 oz)
  2               cups  cherry tomatoes - (abt 16) -- sliced in half

In a small bowl, blend together oil, vinegar, soy sauce, mustard, garlic, and Tabasco sauce.  Transfer 1/4 cup of dressing to a shallow dish.  Add steak and turn once to coat.  Cover and refrigerate meat and remaining dressing separately for 1 to 3 hours.

Light a hot fire in a barbecue grill or preheat broiler.  Grill steak on an oiled rack or broil 4 to 6 inches from heat, turning once, until browned outside and still pink and juicy inside, 4 to 6 minutes per side.  Transfer steak to a cutting board and let rest at least 5 minutes.  Slice thinly against grain.  Turn and cut strips into 1-inch lengths.

Place a potato basket on each of 4 plates.  Divide lettuce and then mushrooms among baskets.  Arrange steak over mushrooms.  Sprinkle tomatoes on top and drizzle dressing over salad.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Soy sauce adds depth of flavor to a vinaigrette that serves as both marinade and dressing in this hearty salad with a distinctive presentation.  The potatoes, first cooked like a pancake and then baked into a basket shape, make a dramatic appearance, cradling the entire salad.

                           Minted Chicken Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  small red potatoes -- halved
                        = (or quartered if large)
     1/2         pound  green beans -- cut 2" lengths
  1                cup  reduced-sodium chicken broth -- defatted
     3/4         pound  boneless skinless chicken breasts
     3/4           cup  low-fat (1.5%) buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh mint
  12            ounces  fresh spinach leaves - (abt 8 packed cups)
  2               cups  cherry tomatoes -- halved
  1                cup  crumbled feta cheese - (3 oz)

In a medium pot of boiling water, cook the potatoes until firm-tender, about 10 minutes.  Add the green beans for the last 2 minutes of cooking time.  Drain well.

Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, bring the broth to a boll over medium heat.  Reduce to a simmer, add the chicken, and cook, turning once, until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes.  With a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to a plate.  (Reserve the broth for another use.)  When cool enough to handle, cut the chicken on the diagonal into 1/2-inch slices.

In a large bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, lemon juice, honey, salt, and cayenne.  Add the mint and whisk again.  Add the potatoes and green beans, chicken, spinach, and tomatoes, tossing to combine.  Divide among 4 plates, top with the feta, and serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving:  362 calories;  35g protein;  8g fat (4.1g saturated fat);  43g carbohydrates;  71mg cholesterol;  680mg sodium.

Helpful Hints:  You can make the salad up to 8 hours in advance; do not sprinkle the feta over until just before serving.  If you're watching your sodium intake, rinse the feta under cool water and drain it well before crumbling it.  This will wash away some of the brine the cheese is packed in.

Recipe By     :Helene Siegel
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  cornmeal
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg
  1                cup  milk
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1 1/2           cups  corn kernels
                        Oil -- for frying
                        Salsa -- for garnish
                        Sliced avocado -- for garnish

Combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder and soda, and salt in large mixing bowl.

In another bowl, whisk together egg, milk, sour cream, and honey.  Pour into dry mixture and stir to blend.  Gently stir in corn.

Heat large heavy skillet over medium-high heat and pour in oil to 1/4-inch depth.  Drop batter, 1/4 cup at a time, into pan and fry until well browned and crisp on both sides, about 5 minutes total.  Drain on paper towels.  Serve topped with salsa and sliced avocado.

This recipe yields 12 corn cakes; 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Topped with good spicy salsa and some sliced avocado, these sturdy corn pancakes make a nice vegetarian main course.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  whole-wheat flour
  1                cup  unbleached white flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2           cup  butter
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt
                        Sugar or cinnamon sugar -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 475 to 500 degrees.

Combine the flours, salt, soda, and baking powder, and cut in the butter until it is in small lumps.  Make a well in the center and put in the vanilla, egg, and yogurt.  Mix these together with a fork, then lightly, minimally mix in the flour.  (Overmixing will make the biscuits tough.)

Roll out on a floured board to about 1/2-inch thickness.  Fold in thirds.  Repeat this twice.  Then roll out to 1/2-inch thickness, and using a biscuit cutter, glass, or cup, cut into biscuits.  Dip the cutter in flour, if necessary, so that the biscuits will not stick to it.  Place the cut biscuits on an ungreased. baking sheet.  Gather up the remains and reroll to make more biscuits.

Sprinkle the tops with sugar or sugar mixed with cinnamon for a touch of sweetness.

Bake on the top rack of a very hot oven, 475 to 500 degrees, for 8 to 10 minutes.  The biscuits are done when they are brown on the bottom.  Lift one up to check.  Don't wait for them to get brown on top; then they will be too dried out.

This recipe yields about 1 dozen biscuits.

                       Noodles With Mustard Butter

Recipe By     :Judie Geise
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Noodles

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  egg noodles
     1/2    tablespoon  salt
                        === MUSTARD BUTFER ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1               dash  cayenne pepper
                        A small handful chopped fresh parsley

Bring 3 or 4 quarts of water to a boil.

In the meantime prepare the mustard butter.  Cream the butter with the remaining ingredients by hand, or use a food processor or blender.

Add the noodles and salt to the boiling water.  Cook the noodles until al dente.  (The time needed will depend greatly upon the thickness of the noodles, so the best test is to simply bite into a noodle to determine whether it is done.)

Drain the noodles thoroughly and toss with the prepared butter until each strand is coated.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a delightful variation on the old buttered-noodle theme.  For added texture, you could toss the seasoned noodles with bread crumbs (preferably homemade) that have been sautÈed in butter until they are crisp and golden.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  sunflower oil
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1              pinch  saffron or turmeric -- (optional)
  2               cups  long-grain rice
                        = (preferably brown basmati)
     1/4           cup  unblanched almonds
  3        tablespoons  pine nuts
                        = (or sunflower or pumpkin seeds)
  3                     celery stalks -- finely sliced
     1/2         pound  fresh or frozen cherries -- pitted
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
     1/2           cup  chopped scallions
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill or mint
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Sea salt -- to taste

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil, add the onion, and cook gently for 10 minutes, uncovered.

Add the butter, saffron or turmeric, if using, either ordinary long-grain or basmati rice, whole unblanched almonds, and pine nuts or sunflower or pumpkin seeds to the onion and stir for 2 to 3 minutes.

Add the celery, cherries, and cinnamon.  Add double the volume of water for ordinary long-grain rice or 3 1/4 cups water for basmati rice.  Bring to a boll.  Stir once, cover, reduce the heat to the lowest setting, and simmer for 20 to 45 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed.

When the rice is cooked, stir in the lemon juice, scallions, and fresh herbs.  Season to taste and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Central Asia has hundreds of recipes for pilafs, which are colorful, aromatic rice dishes.  They blend long-grain rice or bulgur wheat with different fruits, herbs, or nuts and, sometimes, meat.

Heat the oil in a skillet, sweat the garlic until translucent, add the olives, and fry over a reduced heat, turning regularly.

Add half the oregano, pour the lemon juice and white wine on top, season with pepper, and continue to simmer until the liquid is reduced by half.  Add the remaining oregano and sprinkle with coarse salt just before serving.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Fried olives are among the most popular antipasti in southern Italy and Greece.  They are also enjoyed as a snack with fresh crusty white bread and a glass of wine.  In Italy the olives are seasoned with fresh or dried oregano; in Greece the local variety of oregano is used, and usually a sprig of rosemary too.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  frozen whole red raspberries in
                        light syrup -- thawed
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  6             ounces  white chocolate -- chopped 1/4" pieces
  12            ounces  unsalted butter -- cut 1-oz pieces
  10            ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped 1/4" pieces
  5              large  eggs
  1 1/4           cups  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  sour cream

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Place the raspberries in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade.  Pulse until liquefied, about 1 minute.  Strain the raspberries through a fine strainer into a 5-quart bowl, using a rubber spatula to press down on the seeds to extract as much purÈe as possible (about 1/4 cup purÈe).  Discard the seeds.  Set the purÈe aside until needed.

In a sifter, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt.  Sift onto a large piece of wax paper and set aside until needed.

Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat.  Place the white chocolate and 4 ounces of butter in the top half.  Use a rubber spatula to stir the chocolate and butter until completely melted and smooth, about 5 minutes.  Transfer the melted white chocolate and butter to an empty 5-quart bowl and set aside until needed.

Again heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat.  Place the semisweet chocolate and the remaining 8 ounces of butter in the top half of the double boiler.  Use a rubber spatula to stir the chocolate and butter until completely melted and smooth, about 7 minutes.  Transfer the melted semisweet chocolate and butter to an empty 5-quart bowl and set aside until needed.

Place the eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a balloon whip.  Whisk on high for 2 minutes until soft.  Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl, then whisk on high for 4 minutes until slightly thickened and lemon-colored.  Operate the mixer on low while gradually adding the sifted dry ingredients until incorporated, about 30 seconds.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and add the sour cream.  Use a rubber spatula to mix the ingredients until thoroughly combined.

Portion 2 cups of the batter into the bowl containing the purÈed raspberries and stir until smooth.  Portion 1 cup of the batter into the bowl containing the melted white chocolate mixture and stir until smooth.  Portion the remaining 2 cups of batter into the bowl containing the melted semisweet chocolate mixture and stir until smooth.  Pour the dark chocolate batter into a 9- by 13- by 2-inch nonstick baking pan and spread evenly over the bottom.  Pour the white chocolate batter onto the top of the dark chocolate batter in swirls.  Pour the raspberry batter over the other two batters in the same manner.  Use the blade of a paring knife to swirl the batters together in a fanciful pattern (you should be having fun doing this).

Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Remove the brownies from the oven and allow to cool in the pan at room temperature for 1 hour.

Use a serrated knife with rounded tip to cut the brownies into 24 (2-inch) squares.  For a clean cut, heat the blade of the knife under hot running water and wipe the blade dry before making each cut.  Refrigerate the brownies for 2 to 3 hours before serving.

This recipe yields 2 dozen 2-inch brownies.

Comments:  The swirling of the batters should create an attractive and colorful paisley look.  If you over-swirl, the brownies will have a less-defined look but will still be quite delicious.

Paisley Brownies will keep for several days if stored in a tightly sealed plastic container in the refrigerator.  Serve the brownies directly from the refrigerator.

        Pan-Grilled Swordfish Steaks With Warm Salmoriglio, Capers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  4                     garlic cloves -- lightly mashed with
                        the handle of a knife and peeled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  fresh oregano
                        = (or 1 tspn dried oregano)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             pounds  swordfish steaks, 1" to 1 1/4"-thk
  1         tablespoon  chopped capers

Into a small bowl put the lemon juice, garlic, salt, liberal grindings of black pepper, and oregano and beat with a fork until the salt has completely dissolved.

Add the olive oil in a thin trickle, beating it in with a fork as though you were making mayonnaise by hand.

Heat up the cast-iron griddle or skillet.  It should sizzle instantly on contact with the fish.  Slip in the swordfish steaks.  As soon as they have formed a thin but dark crust on the side next to the griddle, use a broad spatula to turn them over.  As soon as the steaks have a crust on both sides, transfer them to a warm platter.

Choose a regular skillet that can accommodate the swordfish steaks on a single level without overlapping, put in the fish, pour the lemon juice and oregano mixture over them, and turn on the heat to high.  Cook for about a minute, turning the steaks once.  Off heat, add the capers.  Transfer the full contents of the pan to a very warm platter and serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Marcella Hazan Comments:  Salmorigilo is a blend of olive oil, lemon juice, and oregano that, in Sicily, you brush on hot, thin, grilled swordfish steaks.  The recipe appears in an earlier book of mine, and it is one that I have known readers and friends to be very fond of.  The more familiar salmoriglio is poured cold, like a dressing, but there is also the version that you find above, in which heat is applied briefly to bring the fish and its dressing together.  An additional ingredient here is the capers, added off heat.

Do not exceed the recommended thickness of the swordfish steak.  You are pan-searing it and to keep the fish juicy you need to do it quickly, but at the same time you don't want to serve it partly raw inside, which might happen if the slice is too thick.

<DirT>
Into a small bowl put the lemon juice, garlic, salt, liberal grindings of black pepper, and oregano and beat with a fork until the salt has completely dissolved.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the olive oil in a thin trickle, beating it in with a fork as though you were making mayonnaise by hand.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat up the cast-iron griddle or skillet.  It should sizzle instantly on contact with the fish.  Slip in the swordfish steaks.  As soon as they have formed a thin but dark crust on the side next to the griddle, use a broad spatula to turn them over.  As soon as the steaks have a crust on both sides, transfer them to a warm platter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Choose a regular skillet that can accommodate the swordfish steaks on a single level without overlapping, put in the fish, pour the lemon juice and oregano mixture over them, and turn on the heat to high.  Cook for about a minute, turning the steaks once.  Off heat, add the capers.  Transfer the full contents of the pan to a very warm platter and serve at once.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Marcella Hazan Comments:  Salmorigilo is a blend of olive oil, lemon juice, and oregano that, in Sicily, you brush on hot, thin, grilled swordfish steaks.  The recipe appears in an earlier book of mine, and it is one that I have known readers and friends to be very fond of.  The more familiar salmoriglio is poured cold, like a dressing, but there is also the version that you find above, in which heat is applied briefly to bring the fish and its dressing together.  An additional ingredient here is the capers, added off heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Do not exceed the recommended thickness of the swordfish steak.  You are pan-searing it and to keep the fish juicy you need to do it quickly, but at the same time you don&apos;t want to serve it partly raw inside, which might happen if the slice is too thick.

Recipe By     :Jill Norman
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     large bunche flat-leaf parsley
  1         tablespoon  virgin olive oil
  6                     scallions -- thinly sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  3 3/4           cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  1              large  potato -- thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/4           cups  heavy cream or plain yogurt
                        Lemon zest -- to garnish
                        Chopped parsley or mint -- to garnish

Strip the leaves from the parsley.  Heat the oil and cook the scallions, garlic, and parsley stems slowly for about 15 minutes, until soft.

Add the stock, potato, and seasonings.  Simmer for about 20 minutes, until the potato is soft enough to be crushed with the back of a spoon.

Meanwhile, bring a large pan of water to a boil.  Add the paisley and, as soon as the water returns to a boil, drain and refresh it under cold water to retain the bright green color.  PurÈe together the parsley leaves and soup base, then pass through a sieve.  Check the seasoning.

If the soup is to be served hot, stir in the cream and reheat gently.  If serving the soup chilled, let it cool completely, then stir in the cream.  Garnish with lemon zest and parsley or mint.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This vivid green soup has a fine parsley flavor.  It can be eaten hot or cold.

                        Penne With Broccoli Sauce

Recipe By     :Janet Fletcher
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts
     1/2         pound  broccoli crowns
  16                    fresh basil leaves - (to 18)
  1                     garlic clove -- thinly sliced
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
  6        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  dried penne or fusilli

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Toast pine nuts on a baking sheet until they are golden brown and fragrant, 12 to 15 minutes.  Cool.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boll over high heat.  Add broccoli and cook 3 minutes, then transfer with tongs to a sieve and drain well.  Reserve the boiling water for cooking the pasta.

Cut broccoli into large chunks and place in food processor with basil and garlic.  Process until finely chopped, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl once or twice.  With motor running, add olive oil and cream through feed tube, processing until mixture is well blended and nearly smooth.  Add pine nuts and process again until they are finely chopped.  Transfer mixture to a bowl and stir in cheese and salt and pepper to taste.

Add pasta to the same boiling water used to cook the broccoli.  Cook until al dente.  Just before pasta is done, remove 1 cup of the boiling water.  Whisk enough of the water into the broccoli mixture to make a sauce that will coat the pasta nicely.

Drain pasta and return it to pot.  Add about two-thirds of the sauce and toss well.  Add more sauce, if desired, and toss again.  Serve on warm plates.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This recipe calls for broccoli crowns -- the tightly bunched, deep-green florets with just about an inch of stem attached.  If the broccoli you buy at the farmer's market has more stem, don't throw it away.  Pare the stem down to its pale heart and enjoy it as a crisp, raw nibble, or dice and add to a salad.  If you have leftover sauce, enjoy it the following day as a spread on warm toasts.

                Peppered Salmon With Snow Peas And Ginger

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  snow peas (mangetouts) -- ends trimmed
                        = (or sugar snap peas)
  1         tablespoon  finely-ground Sichuan peppercorns -- (optional)
  6                     salmon fillets - (5 to 6 oz ea) -- skinned
  2          teaspoons  corn oil
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        = (if not using Sichuan peppercorns)
  6                     green onions -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  grated peeled fresh ginger
     1/3           cup  dry sherry
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  unseasoned rice vinegar

Bring a large pot three-fourths full of salted water to a boil.  Add the peas and simmer until bright green, about 1 minute.  Drain and set aside.

If using the ground Sichuan pepper, sprinkle it on both sides of each salmon fillet, distributing it evenly.

In a wide, nonstick frying pan large enough to hold the salmon in a single layer without crowding, warm the corn oil and sesame oil over medium-high heat.  Add the salmon fillets and cook until lightly golden on one side, about 4 minutes.  Turn, season with salt and, if the Sichuan pepper has been omitted, with black pepper as well.  Continue to cook until lightly golden on the second side and opaque throughout when pierced with a knife, about 4 minutes longer.  Transfer the salmon to a warmed platter or individual plates and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm.

Place the same pan over medium-high heat.  When it is hot, add the peas, green onions, and ginger and toss and stir constantly until the green onions soften, about 1 minute.  Add the sherry, soy sauce, and vinegar and bring to a boil.  Boil until the liquid reduces by one-fourth, 20 to 30 seconds.

Remove from the heat and pour the vegetables and sauce over and around the salmon.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Snow peas are available year-round, but they are at their most tender and sweet in the spring.  The entire legume is edible, which accounts for the French name mangetout, meaning "eat it all."  These are not to be confused with sugar snap peas, the crisp chubby pods filled with immature peas available at the same time of year.  For this recipe, either variety can be used.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  lean freshly-ground beef chuck
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        = (or coarsely cracked black peppercorns)
     1/8      teaspoon  hot red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
     1/4           cup  fresh or canned chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley

Place the meat in a mixing bowl.

Heat the oil in a small cast-iron skillet, add the onion and cook, stirring, until wilted.  Add the garlic and cook briefly, stirring.  Do not let the garlic bum.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

Add the cooled onion mixture, chili powder, cumin, ground pepper, red pepper flakes, Worcestershire sauce, and salt to the meat and blend well.  Divide the mixture into 4 patties of equal size.

Heat a heavy cast-iron skillet large enough to hold all the patties in one layer.  Do not add fat of any kind.  When the skillet is quite hot and smoking, add the patties.  Cook until well browned on one side, then turn and cook 3 minutes more on the second side for medium-rare.  Cook longer if desired.  Transfer to a warm platter.

Heat the butter in a small skillet.  Add the shallots and cook, stirring. for 1 minute.  Add the wine and broth and let cook until reduced about 1/4 cup.  Check for seasoning and sprinkle with parsley.  Serve immediately.

Comments:  If a heavy black cast-iron pan is not available, use a heavy-bottomed fry pan.

                          Pollo Alla Cacciatora

Recipe By     :Christian Teubner et al
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (abt 4 1/2 lbs)
                        === FOR THE PASTE ===
  3        tablespoons  fine olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  fresh rosemary leaves
  1           teaspoon  fresh oregano
                        Zest of 1/2 lemon
  2                     garlic cloves
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/3           cup  diced onion
  2                     tomatoes
  16                    pitted black olives
  2                     anchovy fillets
  2          teaspoons  salted capers

Wash the chicken inside and out, and pat dry.  Cut into 4 or 8 pieces.  In a mortar, grind together all the ingredients for the paste, and coat the chicken pieces with it.  Leave to marinate in a covered dish for 1 to 2 hours.

Heat the 2 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan, fry the marinated chicken pieces one after the other on all sides until crispy and browned; remove and keep warm.

Add the diced onion to the spicy oil in the frying pan, and sweat them.  Blanch the tomatoes, remove the skin, and dice the flesh.  Add to the onions, cook for 2 to 3 minutes, and return the chicken pieces to the pan.  Cover and braise for approximately 20 minutes.

Cut the olives into halves, if desired, and cut the anchovies into pieces.  Add to the pan at the same time as the capers and braise for a further 10 to 15 minutes, until the meat is tender.  Risotto is a classic accompaniment.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A chicken dish with this name is found in most Italian provinces, but each region has its own recipe.  In all of them, however, the chicken is spiced with plenty of garlic, and black olives are an essential ingredient.  It is the latter in particular that give this dish its unmistakable Mediterranean taste.  Capers and anchovies are often also added.

Recipe By     :Carol Foster
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  russet potatoes -- peeled, grated
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  oil

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray underside of 4 (6-inch) ovenproof bowls with nonstick vegetable cooking spray and place them underside up on a baking sheet.  In a large bowl, mix potatoes and salt until well blended.

Cook until golden underneath, about 3 minutes.  Turn  carefully and cook until second side is golden, about 3 minutes.  With a wide spatula, transfer cooked potatoes to underside of a bowl.  If needed, press edges of potatoes onto dish to form basket shape.  Repeat with remaining potato mixture.

Bake until baskets are firm and golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Let cool on bowls at least 10 minutes and remove each carefully just before serving.  Use within an hour or cover and refrigerate overnight.  Recrisp over bowls in a 350 degree oven to 15 minutes.

                 Rack Of Spring Lamb With Roasted Garlic

Recipe By     :Joanne Weir
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              heads  garlic
  2 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  water
  3        tablespoons  whole-grain mustard
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- plus
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- plus
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  fresh white bread crumbs
  3                     lamb racks - (abt 1 1/2 lbs ea), excess fa
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Discard the excess papery sheath from the garlic heads and place in a small baking dish.  Drizzle with 1/2 tablespoon of the olive oil and the water.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake until soft, about 45 minutes.  Let cool slightly.  Leave the oven set at 400 degrees.

Separate the garlic cloves and squeeze the pulp from the skins into a small bowl; discard the skins.  Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, the mustard, lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper.  In another bowl, season the bread crumbs with salt and pepper to taste.

Lay the racks of lamb in a roasting pan side by side and fat side up.  Roast for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and immediately rub the garlic mixture over the fat side of each rack.  Then spread the bread crumb mixture over the garlic mixture.  Drizzle with the melted butter and return the lamb to the oven.  Continue to roast until the crumbs are lightly golden and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of a rack away from the bone registers 130 to 135 degrees for medium-rare, or the meat is pink when cut into with a sharp knife, about 25 minutes longer.  Remove from the oven, cover with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  For this recipe, you (or your butcher) must first "french" the racks: Trim off 2 inches of fat and membrane between the ribs to expose the tops of the bones, then cut through the backbone between the ribs to make carving easier.  Fresh spring vegetables, such as asparagus, baby carrots, and new potatoes, make a delicious accompaniment.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Discard the excess papery sheath from the garlic heads and place in a small baking dish.  Drizzle with 1/2 tablespoon of the olive oil and the water.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake until soft, about 45 minutes.  Let cool slightly.  Leave the oven set at 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Separate the garlic cloves and squeeze the pulp from the skins into a small bowl; discard the skins.  Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, the mustard, lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper.  In another bowl, season the bread crumbs with salt and pepper to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lay the racks of lamb in a roasting pan side by side and fat side up.  Roast for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and immediately rub the garlic mixture over the fat side of each rack.  Then spread the bread crumb mixture over the garlic mixture.  Drizzle with the melted butter and return the lamb to the oven.  Continue to roast until the crumbs are lightly golden and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of a rack away from the bone registers 130 to 135 degrees for medium-rare, or the meat is pink when cut into with a sharp knife, about 25 minutes longer.  Remove from the oven, cover with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.

<DirT>
Comments:  For this recipe, you (or your butcher) must first &quot;french&quot; the racks: Trim off 2 inches of fat and membrane between the ribs to expose the tops of the bones, then cut through the backbone between the ribs to make carving easier.  Fresh spring vegetables, such as asparagus, baby carrots, and new potatoes, make a delicious accompaniment.

                         Raspberry-Spinach Salad

Recipe By     :Jane Rodmell
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ALMOND TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  silvered almonds
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  water
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  poppy seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  raspberry vinegar
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped onion
     1/4      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        === SALAD ===
  1              pound  fresh spinach
  2               cups  fresh raspberries

Combine topping ingredients in a large frying pan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar melts to a golden brown and coats almonds, about 5 minutes.  Turn out onto a square of greased foil.  Cool, then break up into small pieces.

Combine all dressing ingredients in a container with a tight-fitting lid.  Shake well to blend, then shake again before using.

Wash and dry spinach, and place in a large bowl with raspberries.  Add dressing and toss.  Add almonds; toss lightly and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Prepare a few batches of almonds and dressing ahead of time and keep on hand.  Hide the topping in a safe place, though, or it may disappear.

Comments:  Crunchy caramelized almonds add the crowning touch to this simple, beautiful-looking, and delicious summer salad.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh rhubarb -- cut 1" lengths
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar -- plus
  3        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached white flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  unbleached white flour
                        Zest of 1 orange
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed orange juice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  1                cup  buttermilk

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Combine the rhubarb with 3/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, orange zest, orange juice, and cinnamon.  Toss well.  Pour into a buttered 2-quart baking dish and bake for 10 minutes.

While the rhubarb is baking, prepare the cobbler batter.  Sift together the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 1/2 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a bowl.  Cut in the butter using a fork, pastry blender, or your fingers until it resembles coarse meal.  Stir in the buttermilk with a fork, mixing until the ingredients are just blended and form a soft dough.

Remove the rhubarb from the oven and drop spoonfuls of the batter on the surface of the hot fruit.  Replace in the oven and continue to bake for another 25 to 30 minutes until the dough is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling in the center.  Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.  Serve with lightly beaten whipped cream, crËme fraiche, or vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                Roasted Cornish Game Hens With Fresh Herbs

Recipe By     :Diane Morgan, Dan Taggart, and Kathleen Taggart

Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10                    Cornish game hens - (abt 18 oz ea) -- thawed*
     1/2           cup  fresh tarragon leaves - (packed loose) -- minced
                        = (abt 1 medium bunch)
  1                cup  flat-leaf parsley leaves - (packed loose) -- minced
                        = (abt 1 medium bunch)
  1                cup  Dijon-style mustard
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Thaw frozen birds for 2 days in refrigerator or under very slowly running cold water in a large pot for several hours.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Remove giblets from hens and reserve for another use.  Rinse each bird inside and out under cold running water, and dry with paper towels.  Line 1 or 2 baking pans (about 12 by 16 inches) on which the birds will fit with aluminum foil to make cleanup easier.  Place a roasting rack or a baker's wire rack in pan.

In a small mixing bowl, combine herbs, mustard, salt, and plenty of freshly ground pepper.  Use your hands to spread mixture evenly over birds.  Arrange birds breast-side up on rack.  Roast until thigh juices run clear when pricked with a small knife or an instant-read thermometer inserted between thigh and body registers 170 degrees, about 1 hour.  Allow to rest 5 minutes before serving on individual plates with rice pilaf.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta
                Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    cherry tomatoes - (to 14)
  24                    scallions
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        sliced very, very thin
     1/2                jalapeÒo chili pepper -- or more to taste,
                        cut thin rounds
                        Salt -- to taste
  1              pound  pasta
                        = (such as spaghettini or narrow penne)

Wash the tomatoes and cut them in half -- any particularly large ones in quarters.  Set aside.

Trim away any roots from the scallion bulbs and any wilted or bruised ends from the green tops.  Cut the scallions into 2-inch lengths, dividing the white part in half lengthwise.  Soak the pieces in cold water, then rinse under naming water.

Put the scallions, olive oil, sliced garlic, chili pepper, and salt in a medium skillet and turn the heat on to medium.  Cook for 10 or 15 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the scallions are very soft.

Add the cut-up tomatoes, turn over all ingredients using a wooden spoon, and cook for 10 or 15 minutes longer, stirring occasionally.  Taste and correct for salt and chili pepper.

Cook and drain the pasta; toss it immediately and thoroughly with the entire contents of the pan.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Ahead-Of-Time Note:  The sauce may be prepared up to a day in advance, but there is not much to be gained by doing so because it can be made practically in the same time that it takes the water for the pasta to come to a boil and the pasta to cook.

Marcella Hazan Comments:  The Italian version of this sauce, which I had in Amalfi during a wine event my husband and I attended there, requires both very ripe, sweet cherry tomatoes and young onions, cipollotti.  Cipolloti are onions at an early stage of development when the bulbs are small and tender.  They are sold with their green shoots still on.  I have never seen them in an American market, but I always see scallions, which are rare in Italy.  Having made that substitution I also opted for jalapeÒo peppers, rather than the fresh small red chili pepper -- pepperoni -- that Italians are accustomed to using.  JalapeÒo is an unusual example of a nontraditional ingredient whose fresh and attractive aroma finds a ready welcome in an Italian dish.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef
  1         tablespoon  Cajun spice mix for meat
                        Vegetable oil -- for coating
  1                cup  lightly steamed and drained greens
                        = (such as collards, mustard, or kale)
                        Tabasco sauce -- to taste
                        Caramelized Onions -- (see recipe)

Lightly combine the ground beef and spice mix.  Gently form into patties.

Preheat the grill or place cast-iron skillet over high heat.  Lightly coat with oil.  Grill or fry patties until charred on bottom.  Flip and finish cooking, refraining from flattening with spatula.  Drain on paper towels.

To broil burgers, preheat broiler and position rack about 4 inches from heat.  Lightly oil tray if meat is lean and cook as per grilling, moving away from flame for longer cooking.

Comments:  Sharp-tasting greens make these spicy burgers special enough to serve to guests.

                        Spaghetti Sauce With Vodka

Recipe By     :Michael Bauer and Fran Irwin
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     white onions -- peeled, chopped
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- or as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Lots of freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  vodka -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  vinegar
  2             pounds  lean ground beef
  2                     large cans whole tomatoes
                        Basil - (fresh or dried) -- to taste
  1              pound  mushrooms -- cleaned and sliced
  1                jar  pimiento-stuffed green olives  - (8 oz) -- sliced, plus
                        the juices from the jar
                        Chopped fresh Italian parsley

SautÈ the onions and garlic in olive oil until limp, about 10 minutes.  While the onions are cooking, season them with salt and a generous amount of pepper, and add the vodka mixture in 3 additions, letting it reduce to a glaze after each addition.  Add the beef to the onion mixture and sautÈ until browned.

PurÈe (or crush) the tomatoes and their juices and add to the beef mixture, along with basil, mushrooms, olives and their juices, and parsley.  Simmer for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally.  Taste before serving.  The sauce should be on the salty side.

This recipe yields 12 to 13 cups; 12 servings.

Comments:  Michael Bauer adapted this recipe.  The onions and garlic are sautÈed, then reduced with vodka, which gives a complex peppery flavor to the ground meat and tomato sauce.  Green olives and fresh mushrooms round out the sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  unsifted all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  vegetable shortening
  1              large  egg
  1                cup  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  raisins
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar -- for the tops

Adjust the oven rack to the lower third of the oven.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease and flour a large baking sheet.

Sift the dry ingredients (except the brown sugar) into a large bowl.  Add the brown sugar, shortening, egg, and buttermilk and beat with an electric mixer until the batter is blended and smooth, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir in the raisins.

Drop the batter by the heaping tablespoonful onto the prepared baking sheet.  Sprinkle each mound with 1/2 teaspoon sugar.

Bake about 15 minutes, or until the buns are golden brown.

Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 18 buns.

Comments:  These buns are a cross between scones and muffins but quicker to make than either one, says Flo Braker.

                          Spicy Sicijuan Noodles

Recipe By     :Ken Hom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Noodles

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  minced pork
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  salt
  8             ounces  peanut oil
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped peeled fresh ginger root
  5        tablespoons  finely-chopped green onions
  2        tablespoons  sesame paste
                        = (or peanut butter)
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  chill oil
  2          teaspoons  salt
  8             ounces  chicken stock
  12            ounces  fresh Chinese thin egg noodles
                        = (or dry Chinese thin egg noodles)
  1         tablespoon  Sichuan peppercorns -- roasted and ground

Combine the pork, soy sauce, and salt in a small bowl and mix well.  Heat a wok or frying pan until hot.  Add the oil and deep-fry the pork, stirring with a spatula to break it into small pieces.  When the pork is crispy and dry, about 4 minutes, remove it with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Pour off the oil, leaving 2 tablespoons in the wok.  Reheat the wok or pan and add the garlic, ginger, and onions and stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Then add the sesame paste or peanut butter, soy sauce, chili oil, salt, and chicken stock and simmer for 4 minutes.

Cook the noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 2 minutes if they are fresh or 5 minutes if they are dried.  Drain the noodles well in a colander.  Divide the noodles into individual bowls or put them in a large soup tureen.  Ladle on the sauce, garnish with the fried pork and Sichuan peppercorns, and serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings as part of a chinese meal, or 2 to 4 single dish servings.

Comments:  Everywhere in China, noodle dishes, xiao chi, or "small eats" are found in hole-in-the-wall restaurants, food stalls, and places selling snacks.  This is a typical Sichuan dish that is now popular throughout China, especially in the north.  There are many versions of it and they are all easy to make, tasty, and quite filling.  This is an exceptionally delicious one sampled by Ken Horn at a tiny street restaurant in Chengdu, Sichuan.

                          Spring Vegetable Stew

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12                    baby carrots
                        = (or 2 carrots peeled and thinly sliced)
     1/2           cup  snow peas
  6                     radishes, including 1/2" of stems -- halved
  18                    three-inch asparagus tips
  6                     green onions, including the stems -- cut 3" lengths
  2                     broccoli stems -- thickly peeled, and
                        sliced diagonally
  4              small  peeled turnips -- cut into sixths
                        = (or 2 rutabagas and 2 turnips)
  4        tablespoons  butter
  4                     thyme sprigs
                        = (preferably lemon thyme)
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  10                    sorrel leaves -- (optional), sliced
                        into ribbons
  1         tablespoon  snipped chives
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  chopped tarragon

Bring 3 quarts water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt.  One type at a time, blanch the vegetables until barely tender, then remove to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking.  When all are blanched, reserve 1 cup of the cooking water.  Drain the vegetables. (This can be done ahead of time.)

In a wide skillet, melt the butter with the thyme sprigs and reserved  liquid.  Add the vegetables and simmer until they're warmed through.  Add the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.  Add the sorrel and herbs and cook for 1 minute more.

Serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Cooking the vegetables separately, then combining them, makes it possible to have everything ready in advance.  Radishes and broccoli stems may be surprising, but they really give this dish an exceedingly fresh spring look.  Popovers or fresh herb noodles are good accompaniments.

              Steamed Scallops On Spinach With Walnut Sauce

Recipe By     :Jacques Pepin
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === WALNUT SAUCE ===
  4                     walnuts -- shelled, and the
                        nut meats cut into 1/4" pieces - (1/4 cup)
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon rind
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === SCALLOPS ===
  1              pound  spinach -- tough stems removed
                        = (abt 14 oz cleaned)
  12            ounces  sea scallops - (16 to 20 scallops) -- washed in cool
                        water

Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan.  Add the walnuts, and bring the water back to a boil.  Boil for 30 seconds, and drain.  Combine the walnuts in a bowl with the lemon juice, lemon rind, olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Mix well, and set aside.

At serving time, wash the spinach leaves thoroughly in a basin of cool water, lifting the spinach from the water, and drain in a colander.  Place the damp spinach leaves in a large (12-inch) saucepan, and cook over high heat for about 2 minutes, until the spinach starts to steam and wilt.  Arrange the scallops on top of the spinach in the saucepan, cover, and cook over high heat for another :3 minutes.  By then, the scallops should be just firm and cooked, and the spinach wilted.

Remove the scallops, and place them on a plate.  If there is still water remaining in the pan, continue to cook the spinach over high heat, uncovered, for about 1 minute longer, until the moisture is gone.

Divide the spinach among four plates, and arrange the scallops on top.  Coat with the sauce, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving (without rice):  267.4 calories;  18.2g protein;  19.6g fat;  2.5g saturated fat;  7.6g carbohydrates;  28.1mg cholesterol;  491.2mg sodium.

Comments:  The beautiful simplicity of this recipe is reflected in its pure, straightforward taste.  The ingredients should be of the utmost freshness and quality.  Boiling the walnuts beforehand softens them and makes them more like fresh green walnuts, which are more delicate and fruity than the mature walnuts we commonly find in our markets.

                            Sticky Pecan Rolls

Recipe By     :Jerry Anne Di Vecchio
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  2% milk
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1            package  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water
  1              large  egg
  3 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour - (about)
  6        tablespoons  butter or margarine -- melted and cooled
     3/4           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  2        tablespoons  water
     3/4           cup  chopped pecans
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon

In a 1-quart pan, combine milk, 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar, oil, and salt.  Bring to a boil over medium heat; remove from heat and cool.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, dissolve yeast and remaining 1 teaspoon granulated sugar in the 1/4 cup warm water, stirring to mix; let sit until bubbly (about 5 minutes).  Add milk mixture, egg, and 2 cups of the flour to yeast mixture; stir until well combined.  Add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the remaining flour to make a sticky dough.

Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead until dough is firm, smooth, and no longer sticky (about 10 minutes), adding more flour as needed.  Let dough rest on board.

Butter a muffin pan that has twelve cups 2 1/2 inches in diameter.  In a small bowl, combine 4 tablespoons of the melted butter, 1/2 cup of the brown sugar, and the 2 tablespoons water.  Distribute mixture among coated muffin cups; top mixture evenly with pecans.  Press mixture into bottom of each cup.

Roll dough into a 12- by 15-inch rectangle.  Brush surface with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter.  In a small bowl, combine cinnamon with the remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar; sprinkle evenly over buttered dough.  Starling with one long side, roll rectangle into a cylinder, then cut into 12 equal slices (each about 1 1/4 inches).  Place, one cut side down, in muffin cups.  Let rise, uncovered, in a warm place until doubled (about 1 1/2 hours).

                          Stir-Fried Chili Pork

Recipe By     :Ken Hom
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  lean pork
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1              pinch  salt
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  8             ounces  fresh mild chilies
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  ground red chili powder
  1           teaspoon  Sichuan peppercorns -- roasted, crushed
  3        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sugar

Cut the pork into 3-inch thin slices and combine with the soy sauce, 1 tablespoon rice wine, salt, and sesame oil.

Cut the chilies in half lengthwise and seed them.

Heat a wok or large frying pan untiI hot.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of peanut oil and the pork and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Remove the pork with a slotted spoon.

Reheat the wok or frying pan.  Add the remaining oil.  When it is very hot, add the fresh chilies, garlic, chili powder, and peppercorns and stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Then add the water, 1 tablespoon rice wine or sherry, soy sauce, and sugar and cook for another 30 seconds.  Return the meat to the mixture and heat through.  Stir well, turn onto a platter, and serve.

To Roast Sichuan Peppercorns:  Heat a wok or heavy skillet to a medium heat.  Add the peppercorns (up to 1/4 cup at a time) and stir-fry them for about 5 minutes until they brown slightly and start to smoke.  Remove the pan from the heat and let them cool.  Grind the peppercorns in a pepper-mill, clean coffee grinder, or with a mortar and pestle.  Seal the mixture tightly in a screw-top jar to store.  Alternatively, keep the whole roasted peppercorns in a well-sealed container and grind them when required.

This recipe yields 4 servings as part of a chinese meal, or 2 servings as a single dish.

Comments:  Sichuan food is hot, spicy, and sensual, and the chile is one of the mainstays of that region's cuisine.  Unlike in the West, restaurants there do not offer chilies in oil or a paste at the table to augment tastes.  Instead they season a dish before it arrives.  Fragrant, roasted Sichuan peppercorns combined with freshly crushed dried chilies ensure that diners have a tasty dish, though not all chilies used are hot.  In this recipe mild chilies are combined with thinly sliced pork to create a pleasing, nutritious dish which is colorful, fragrant and flavorful.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour - (about)
     1/3           cup  sugar -- plus
  4        tablespoons  sugar - (about)
  3 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine -- cut into chunks
     2/3           cup  buttermilk
  2              large  egg yolks
  2             quarts  strawberries -- rinsed, hulled,
                        at room temperature
  1                cup  crËme fraiche or sour cream
     1/3           cup  chopped crystallized ginger
  112              cup  whipping cream

In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of the flour, 1/3 cup of the sugar, 2 teaspoons bf the lemon peel, the baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  With a pastry blender or your fingers, cut in or rub in butter until mixture looks mealy.

In a small bowl, combine buttermilk and egg yolks, then add to flour mixture and stir with a fork until dough holds together.

On a floured board, knead dough with floured hands just until smooth, 15 to 20 turns.  Reflour board and pat out dough 1 inch thick.  Cut into 6 rounds with a floured 2 1/2- to 3-inch round cutter, gathering and repatting scraps as needed.  Lift onto a 12- by 15-inch baking sheet and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar.

Bake shortcakes in a 400 degree oven until deep golden (12 to 14 minutes).  Transfer to a rack until cool (at least 30 minutes).

Set aside 6 whole berries.  Slice remaining berries into a medium-size bowl.  Add 2 tablespoons of the sugar and stir to coat; let stand for up to 1 hour.

Just before assembling, prepare lemon-ginger cream.  In a small bowl, combine crËme fraiche, crystallized ginger, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon peel.  In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the whipping cream until thick.  Fold in crËme-fraiche mixture.

Split shortcakes horizontally and place each bottom on a plate.  Cover bottom pieces with some lemon-ginger cream and sliced berries, then cover with the shortcake tops.  Garnish each with a whole berry.  Serve remaining lemon-ginger cream and sliced berries on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     hard-boiled eggs -- shelled
  4                     tinned sardines in oil
  1                     tinned anchovy - (to 2)
  1                     fresh red chili -- finely chopped,
                        (optional)
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped,
                        (optional)
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise - (about)
                        Plain yogurt, preferably Greek-style -- enough to create a
                        thick paste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Carefully cut the top third off each egg and scoop out the yolk.  Cut a sliver off the bottom of each egg to make it stable enough to stand on end.

Chop up the trimmed egg whites (tops and bottoms) and mix with the yolks.

Remove the sardine bones and mash the fish with about a teaspoon of their oil.  Finely chop the anchovy.

Mix sardines and anchovy together with all the remaining ingredients to achieve a thick paste.  Fill the empty egg white cases.  Serve with salad and crusty bread.

This recipe yields 8 eggs.

Comments:  This Anglo-Indian variation on plain old deviled eggs features tinned sardines, which were considered a luxury during the days of the Raj.  The optional additions of garlic and chili impart a sensational flavor.

                           Summer Tomato Salad

Recipe By     :Jean Galton
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     red bell peppers
  2                     yellow bell peppers
  6                     plum tomatoes -- halved
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  capers
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh marjoram
  3        tablespoons  crumbled ricotta salata or feta cheese
     1/2           cup  oil-cured black olives

Preheat the grill to high and brush with oil.

Grill the peppers, turning them several limes, for 15 minutes, or until blackened on all sides.  Transfer to a paper bag and let steam for 10 minutes.  When the peppers are cool enough to handle, peel, core, and seed them.  Cut the peppers into 1-inch-wide strips.  Set aside.

Grill the tomato halves for about 1 minute on each side, or until lightly charred.  Transfer to a serving platter.  Scatter the pepper strips around the tomatoes.  Sprinkle with the salt and pepper and drizzle with the oil.  Sprinkle with the capers, parsley, and marjoram, and top with the ricotta salata and olives.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is one of those great dishes that was born for entertaining.  It can be made completely ahead of time and is gorgeous to behold.  And, if you have any left over, which is doubtful, it makes a great sandwich on a baguette or roll.

                        Sweet Yogurt With Saffron

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  plain yogurt
     1/2           cup  superfine sugar
  1         tablespoon  skinned pistachio nuts -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  chironji nuts, hazelnuts, or almonds -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  cardamom powder
  1              pinch  saffron threads -- soaked in a little
                        hot milk

Put the yogurt into a large sieve or colander lined with wet cheesecloth and allow to drain for 6 to 8 hours, until it is relatively firm.

Sprinkle the drained yogurt with sugar, stirring to dissolve it, then push the mixture through a fine sieve to obtain a silken smooth texture.  Add half of the pistachios, the chironji nuts, cardamom, and saffron (or mango pulp, if preferred).  Mix and chill before serving garnished with the remaining pistachios.  Additional saffron can be used for garnishing if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  In India, this Gujarati favorite is always served with deep-fried bread (puri).  As it is so rich and substantial, you may prefer it simply on its own.  If desired, the saffron can be omitted and about 1/2 cup concentrated mango pulp added for a different flavor.

Preheat the broiler and coat the rack with olive oil.

Arrange the butterflied shrimp shell-side up on the rack.  Lightly brush with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.  Broil 4 minutes on one side and remove.

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat.  Cook the garlic until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the wine and simmer 2 minutes longer.  Add the shrimp to the pan along with the parsley.  Toss to coat evenly and cook 1 to 2 minutes.  Serve hot with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Comments:  Shrimp and garlic is a marriage of tastes very few people can resist.

                       Three Dips (For Artichokes)

Recipe By     :Ethel Brennan and Georgeanne Brennan
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             quarts  water - (to 6)
  8             medium  artichokes - (to 10)
                        === FOR THE THYME DIP ===
     1/2      teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh Anaheim chile
  2          teaspoons  freshly-squeezed Meyer lemon juice
                        = (or 1 teaspoon other lemon juice)
  4             ounces  soft-fresh goat cheese - (1/2 cup)
     1/3           cup  plain yogurt
                        === FOR THE ITALIAN PARSLEY DIP ===
  4             ounces  soft-fresh goat cheese - (1/2 cup)
     1/3           cup  plain yogurt
     1/2           cup  finely-minced fresh Italian parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR THE ROASTED PEPPER DIP ===
  1                cup  minced roasted red bell peppers
  8             ounces  soft-fresh goat cheese - (1 cup)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a large pot, bring the water to a rolling boil.  Meanwhile, pull off any damaged outer leaves from the artichokes and trim the stem ends.  Add the artichokes to the boiling water and cook until tender, 35 to 45 minutes.  The artichokes are done when a leaf can easily be plucked from the base.  Drain the artichokes into a colander and allow to cool.

While the artichokes are cooking, prepare the dips.  For the thyme dip, in a mortar or a spice grinder, combine the peppercorns, thyme, and chile and pound or grind until a thick paste begins to form.  Mix in the lemon Juice.  In a small bowl, combine the goat cheese, the yogurt, and the spice mixture and mix well with a fork.

For the Italian parsley dip, in a small bowl, combine the goat cheese, yogurt, parsley, salt, and pepper.  Mix with a fork until well blended.

For the roasted pepper dip, in a small bowl, combine the roasted pepper, goat cheese, salt, and pepper.  Mix with a fork until well blended.

To serve, arrange the artichokes in a large bowl.  Place the bowls holding the dips alongside, and set out bowls in which to discard the eaten leaves.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

                    Toasted Hazelnut Chocolate Custard

Recipe By     :Marie Simmons
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  hazelnuts
  3               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  milk
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
  5             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet (plain) chocolate -- chopped, plus
                        chocolate shaved into curls with a
                        vegetable peeler for garnish
  6                     egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast until fragrant and the skins have loosened, 5 to 7 minutes.  While still warm, transfer to a kitchen towel and rub vigorously to remove the skins.  Do not worry if small bits remain.  Reserve 8 whole hazelnuts for garnish.  Transfer the remaining nuts to a food processor and process until very finely ground; do not overprocess.

In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the cream and milk until bubbles appear along the pan edges.  Stir in the ground nuts, simmer for 3 minutes, cover, and set aside to steep for 1 hour.

Line a sieve with a double thickness of dampened cheesecloth (muslin) and place over a heatproof bowl.  Pour the cream mixture through the sieve, pressing on the solids with the back of a spoon to extract as much hazelnut flavor as possible, then squeeze the cheesecloth with your hands to extract any additional liquid.  Add the sugar to the bowl and stir well.  Set over (not touching) very hot water in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add the 5 ounces chocolate and heat, stirring, until the chocolate melts, about 5 minutes.

In another bowl, whisk the egg yolks until blended.  Add about 1/2 cup of the hot chocolate cream, whisking constantly.  Then whisk the yolks into the chocolate cream.  Place the bowl over the hot water in the saucepan and cook, stirring often, just until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher.  Then pour into eight 1/2-cup ramekins.  Let cool to room temperature, or refrigerate until chilled.

To make chocolate curls, it helps to slightly soften a block of chocolate by warming it between your hands.  Then draw a vegetable peeler along the surface.  Garnish each custard with chocolate shavings and a whole hazelnut.  Serve at room temperature or chilled.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Sewing:  545 calories;  7g protein;  48g total fat (26g saturated fat);  25g carbohydrates;  1g dietary fiber;  286mg cholesterol;  54mg sodium.

Comments:  For this decadent dessert, splurge on the best French or Belgian bittersweet or semisweet chocolate available, such as Valrhona or Callebaut.

                             Tomato 'sashimi'

Recipe By     :Bettina Vitell
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  ripe tomatoes
  4        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
  1              pinch  salt
  1         tablespoon  wasabi powder
  12            sprigs  watercress

Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil.  Plunge the tomatoes in for just a moment.  Rinse them under cold running water, and peel them.  Cut the tomatoes into quarters, and remove the seeds.  Slice each quarter into thin wedges.  Cover and chill for 30 minutes.

Mix the lime juice, soy sauce, and salt in a small bowl.

In another small bowl, combine the wasahi with just enough water to form a doughlike paste.  Mold the paste into 4 small pyramid shapes.

Divide the tomato wedges among 4 small plates.  Top each with 3 sprigs of watercress.  Place a wasabi pyramid on one of the sprigs.  Drizzle the lime sauce on the side of the dish so that it forms a pool.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Flavorful tomatoes are sliced with the  same care and attention as the raw fish for traditional sashimi.  Choose fruity, vine-ripened tomatoes at their peak.

  5                     tomatoes - (abt 2 lbs)
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  6             slices  ginger
  3        tablespoons  oyster-flavored sauce
  4                     scallions -- cut 2" sections

Halve the flank steak with the grain into 2 strips.  Cut each strip across the grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Place slices in a shallow bowl and sprinkle with the baking soda; stir to combine.  Add the soy sauce, cornstarch, rice wine, sesame oil, and 1/4 teaspoon sugar.  Stir to combine and set aside.

In a large pot, bring about 1 1/2 quarts of water to a boil over high heat.  Add the tomatoes and cook 1 to 3 minutes, or until the tomato skins just break.  Remove tomatoes with a slotted spoon and, when cool enough to handle, peel skins.  Core tomatoes and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges.

Meanwhile, stir 1 teaspoon vegetable oil into the beef mixture.  Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the remaining tablespoon vegetable oil and ginger, and stir-fry about 1 minute.  Carefully add the beef, spreading it in the wok.  Cook, undisturbed, 1 to 2 minutes, letting beef begin to brown.   Then, using a metal spatula, stir-fry 1 to 2 minutes, or until beef is browned but still slightly rare. Transfer the beef to a plate and set aside.

Add the tomatoes and remaining teaspoon of sugar to wok, and stir-fry 1 minute on high heat until tomatoes begin to soften.  Add the oyster sauce and 1/4 cup cold water, cover, and cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until the tomatoes are just limp.  Add the beef with any juices that have accumulated on the plate, and the scallions, and stir-fry 1 minute, or until just heated through.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings as part of a multicourse meal.

                               Vinaigrette

Categories    : Condiments                      Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  6        tablespoons  oil

In a bowl, mix together the vinegar with the salt, pepper, and mustard.  Gradually add the oil, beating it in with a balloon whisk, until the ingredients combine to form an emulsion.

This recipe yields 1/2 cup.

Comments:  The basic flavor of the vinaigrette depends on the vinegar and oil used.  For example, you can use light wine vinegar, spiced vinegar, or fruit-flavored vinegar, strong-tasting walnut or hazelnut oil, olive oil, or neutral-tasting sunflower seed or safflower oil.  The quality of the mustard will also make a difference to the flavor.  As a rule of thumb, use 1 teaspoon mustard to 6 to 8 tablespoons vinaigrette.  Generally speaking, the quantities are based on a ratio of 1 part vinegar to 4 parts oil.  If you prefer the fresh acidity of lemon to vinegar, use 1 part lemon juice to 5 parts oil.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cans  small white beans - (15 oz ea)*

  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

              Ziti With Roasted Garlic And Butfernut Squash

Recipe By     :Erica De Mane
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     garlic heads
                        Unsalted butter -- as needed
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  1              large  butternut squash - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into small cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     bay leaf
                        A few gratings of nutmeg
                        Zest of 1 large orange
  1                cup  homemade chicken broth or low-salt canned
  2        tablespoons  crËme fraiche - (heaping) -- more or less
  6                     fresh sage leaves -- cut thin strips
  6              large  flat-leaf parsley sprigs -- leaves coarsely
                        chopped
  1              pound  ziti
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Grana Padano cheese -- more or less

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Wrap the garlic heads together in a large sheet of aluminum foil and squeeze the top to seal it.  Roast until soft and fragrant, about 1/2 hour.

Meanwhile, heat about 2 tablespoons each of butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the squash, season with salt and pepper, and sautÈ a few minutes to lightly caramelize the surface of the cubes.  Add the bay leaf, nutmeg, orange zest, and chicken broth.

Cover the pan, and cook until the squash is just tender but still holding its shape, about 8 minutes.  At this point, most of the broth will have been absorbed, but you should have a few tablespoons left to form your sauce.  Add the crËme fraiche, sage, and parsley.  Mix well and taste for seasoning.

Start cooking the ziti.

Slice off the root ends and squeeze the garlic from the roasted heads into a bowl.  Mash it to form a paste, adding about a tablespoon of pasta cooking water to give it a creamy consistency.

When the ziti are al dente, drain them and transfer them to a large serving bowl.  Add the roasted garlic paste and the Grana Padano.  Toss.  Add the squash sauce, a bit of fresh black pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil and toss again.  Check for seasoning.

This recipe yields 6 first course or 4 main course servings.

Comments:  The butternut squash here cooks into a rough purÈe that adds body to the sweet sauce.  Fresh sage and wasted garlic add depth of flavor.  The result would work nicely as a first course before a Thanksgiving turkey.

You can purÈe this sauce in a food processor, adding the herbs at the end so they don't become too finely chopped.  A good pasta for this purÈe is fusilli, which will allow the thick, smooth sauce to cling to it.

Rosemary is an herb often paired with winter squash and can replace the sage (use very little, a few small sprigs only).

An altogether different flavoring for winter squash or pumpkin -- this one borrowed from Sicilian cooking -- is fresh mint, a splash of vinegar, and hot red pepper flakes.  If you would like to make this, sautÈ squash cubes in olive oil and garlic.  Add a splash of red wine vinegar and a few red pepper flakes.  Pour in enough chicken broth or water to allow the squash to simmer until tender and absorb most of the liquid.  Add chopped fresh mint leaves and toss with cooked penne or ziti.

Preheat the broiler.  In a blender or food processor, combine the whole eggs, egg whites, beans, green onions, salt, and hot pepper sauce and process until smooth.

In a medium broiler-proof skillet, heat the oil until hot but not smoking over medium heat.  Add the zucchini and cook until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the mint, basil, peas, and vinegar and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Reduce the heat to low, add the egg mixture to the skillet, cover, and cook until the frittata is set around the edges but still liquid in the center, 6 to 8 minutes.

Place the skillet under the broiler 3 inches from the heat and cook for 2 to 5 minutes, or until golden brown and set in the center.  Sprinkle the Parmesan over and broil for 1 minute, or until the cheese is golden.  Cut into wedges, divide among 4 plates, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
