--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BOYSENBERRY ICE CREAM ===
     2/3           cup  sugar
  12            ounces  frozen unsweetened boysenberries or
                        raspberries - (abt 2 1/2 cups) -- thawed

  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
                        = (or other orange liqueur)
                        === FOR DIPPING ===
  1 1/4         pounds  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
     1/4           cup  solid vegetable shortening, plus
  1         tablespoon  solid vegetable shortening
  6             ounces  imported white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt)
                        Milk chocolate shavings
  5                     walnut halves
                        Unsweetened cocoa powder

To make Boysenberry Ice Cream:  Sprinkle sugar over berries in small bowl.  Let stand 45 minutes at room temperature.  Puree berries in processor.  Strain through sieve into large bowl, pressing on solids with back of spoon.

Bring cream to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Whisk yolks in bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in hot cream.  Return mixture to saucepan and stir over medium-low heat until custard thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 2 minutes.  Strain into berry puree.  Refrigerate until cold.

Place 9- by 13-inch baking dish in freezer.  Transfer berry custard to ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's instructions.  Spread ice cream in bottom of chilled dish.  Freeze.

To make Grand Marnier Ice Cream:  Remove peel (orange part only) from oranges in long wide strips, using vegetable peeler.  Place in heavy medium saucepan.  Add 1 cup cream, half-and-half and sugar.  Bring to boil, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat.  Cover and let steep 30 minutes.

Remove peel from cream using slotted spoon and discard.  Bring cream mixture to simmer.  Whisk yolks in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in hot cream mixture.  Return mixture to saucepan and stir over medium-low heat until custard thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 2 minutes.  Strain into bowl.  Mix in 1 1/2 teaspoons grated orange peel, then remaining 1 cup cream.  Refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.  Mix in Grand Marnier.

Transfer custard to ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's instructions.  Spoon over boysenberry ice cream in dish; smooth top.  Cover with waxed paper.  Freeze until very firm, at least 6 hours or overnight.

Line 4 small cookie sheets with foil.  Place in freezer for 20 minutes.  Remove 1 sheet.  Dip 1 1/2-inch-diameter ice cream scoop into cup of hot water.  Working quickly, scoop up layered ice cream.  Round off edges with index finger.  Release ice cream ball onto frozen sheet.  Repeat, forming 15 ice cream balls.  Insert 1 toothpick into center of each ball.  Return sheet to freezer.

Remove second sheet from freezer.  Repeat process to form 15 more ice cream balls.  Return sheet to freezer.  Pack remaining ice cream into container and freeze.  Freeze ice cream balls until very firm, at least 6 hours or overnight.  Using metal icing spatula, loosen ice cream balls from foil; refreeze.

For Dipping:  Melt bittersweet chocolate with 1/4 cup shortening in heavy medium saucepan over very low heat, stirring until smooth.  Cool to lukewarm.  Remove 1 sheet of ice cream balls and 1 foil-lined frozen sheet from freezer.  Fill 1/4-cup measuring cup with melted chocolate.

Working quickly, hold 1 ice cream ball by toothpick over saucepan of chocolate; pour chocolate in cup over ball, turning to coat.  Allow excess chocolate to drip off.  Place bonbon on foil-lined sheet.  Repeat with remaining balls.  Twist and turn toothpicks to loosen; remove from bonbons.  Freeze.  Repeat dipping process with remaining ice cream balls and frozen cookie sheet.  Freeze for 30 minutes.

Melt white chocolate with remaining 1 tablespoon shortening in heavy small saucepan over very low heat, stirring constantly.  Cool to lukewarm.  Rewarm bittersweet chocolate to lukewarm over very low heat, stirring constantly, Remove 1 sheet of bonbons from freezer.  Dip 1 bonbon halfway into white chocolate, covering one side and hole left from toothpick.  Place on same frozen sheet.  Repeat with 4 more bonbons.

Dip spoon into melted bittersweet chocolate and quickly move from side to side over double-dipped bonbons, allowing chocolate to fall in zigzag lines.  Dip another spoon into melted white chocolate and wave from side to side over 5 solid chocolate bonbons, allowing chocolate to fall in zigzag lines.  Dip finger into melted bittersweet chocolate and dab over top of one of remaining bonbons on sheet, covering hole left from toothpick.  Sprinkle chocolate shavings over.  Repeat with remaining 4 bonbons on sheet.  Return bonbons to freezer.

Remove second sheet of bonbons from freezer.  Dip half of walnut into bittersweet chocolate.  Place atop 1 bonbon.  Repeat with 4 more walnuts and bonbons.  Roll remaining 10 bonbons in bowl of cocoa powder.  Brush off excess.  Place on same sheet.  Freeze at least 4 hours or overnight.  (Can be prepared 1 week ahead.  Store in single layer in airtight container.)

This recipe yields 30 bonbons.

Comments:  Pretty ice cream treats, decorated five different ways.  Turn the freezer to the coldest setting for best results.  Pack the left-over ice cream into a container and freeze it to enjoy after the bonbons are gone.  Begin this recipe at least a day ahead (and you can start up to a week ahead).  Once you've mastered the technique here, create bonbons of your own using other homemade ice creams or your favorite purchased ones.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Pretty ice cream treats, decorated five different ways.  Turn the freezer to the coldest setting for best results.  Pack the left-over ice cream into a container and freeze it to enjoy after the bonbons are gone.  Begin this recipe at least a day ahead (and you can start up to a week ahead).  Once you&apos;ve mastered the technique here, create bonbons of your own using other homemade ice creams or your favorite purchased ones.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
     3/4         pound  extra-lean ground beef
  2              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                can  Italian plum tomatoes - (28 oz)
  1                can  tomato puree - (16 oz)
  1           teaspoon  dried basil -- crumbled
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
     1/8      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4         pound  purchased cheese ravioli
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan or Romano cheese

Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and cook until tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Add ground beef and garlic and saute until meat is no longer pink, breaking up with fork, about 5 minutes.

Puree tomatoes with juices in processor.  Add to saucepan.  Add canned tomato puree, herbs and dried crushed red pepper.  Simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.  Drain well.  Place pasta in large bowl.  Add enough sauce to coat; stir.  Serve, passing cheese separately.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled or tripled.

Comments:  Our recipe makes plenty of sauce for two meals, so enjoy some with this menu and freeze the remainder for another time.  The sauce is also great over tortellini, penne or fusilli.  You can find the convenient prepared ravioli in the refrigerator section of most supermarkets.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg -- beaten to blend
     1/2           cup  dry breadcrumbs
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- melted
                        === MUSHROOM-WINE SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- sliced
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     2/3           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt broth)

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For Chicken:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Pound chicken between sheets of waxed paper to thickness of 1/4 inch using meat mallet.  Pat chicken dry.

Combine cheese, green onions and basil in small bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spread cheese mixture lengthwise over half of each chicken piece.  Tuck short ends in.  Roll chicken up, starting at one long side, into tight cylinders.  Tie ends with string to secure.  Dip chicken in egg, allowing excess to drip into bowl.  Roll in breadcrumbs, shaking off excess.  (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead.  Refrigerate.)

Place chicken in 8-inch square baking dish.  Pour 2 tablespoons melted butter over.  Bake until cooked through, about 20 minutes.

For Mushroom Wine Sauce:  Meanwhile, melt 1/4 cup butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add mushrooms and saute until tender, about 8 minutes.  Add wine and boil 3 minutes.  Add stock and boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 6 minutes.  Remove from heat and swirl in 4 tablespoons cold butter 1 piece at a time.  Season sauce with salt and freshly ground pepper.

Remove string from chicken.  Cut rolls crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rounds.  Fan on plates.  Serve immediately, passing sauce separately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Combine cheese, green onions and basil in small bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spread cheese mixture lengthwise over half of each chicken piece.  Tuck short ends in.  Roll chicken up, starting at one long side, into tight cylinders.  Tie ends with string to secure.  Dip chicken in egg, allowing excess to drip into bowl.  Roll in breadcrumbs, shaking off excess.

For Mushroom Wine Sauce:  Meanwhile, melt 1/4 cup butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add mushrooms and saute until tender, about 8 minutes.  Add wine and boil 3 minutes.  Add stock and boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 6 minutes.  Remove from heat and swirl in 4 tablespoons cold butter 1 piece at a time.  Season sauce with salt and freshly ground pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove string from chicken.  Cut rolls crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rounds.  Fan on plates.  Serve immediately, passing sauce separately.

  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  sugar
  2 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon peel
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" pieces
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  walnuts
  2             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate or 1/3 cup
                        mini chocolate chips)
                        Sugar
                        === ICE CREAM ===
  1               pint  ice cream of choice
  3             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped

For Cookies:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine first 6 ingredients in processor and blend.  Add butter and vanilla.  Process until mixture resembles fine meal and begins to stick together, using on/off turns.  Add walnuts and process until finely chopped.  Mix in chocolate.

Transfer mixture to sheet of waxed paper.  Press together.  Top with another sheet of waxed paper.  Roll out 1/4-inch thick.  Cut out cookies using 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter.  Transfer to ungreased cookie sheet.

Gather scraps, reroll and cut additional cookies.  Sprinkle cookies with sugar.  Bake until just beginning to color, about 22 minutes.  Cool on cookie sheet on rack 5 minutes.  Carefully transfer cookies to rack and cool.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Store in airtight container.)

For Ice Cream:  Soften ice cream slightly in refrigerator.  Turn 8 cookies over and gently spread 1/4 cup ice cream atop each.  Top with 8 cookies, sugared side up.  Freeze until firm.

Melt 3 ounces semisweet chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring until smooth.  Dip fork in chocolate and drizzle in free-form lines over top of sandwiches.  Freeze until chocolate design is firm.  (Can be prepared up to 3 days ahead.  Cover and freeze.)  Soften slightly in refrigerator before serving if frozen very solid.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Any favorite ice cream can be used in these treats. Both the walnut cookies and the "sandwiches" themselves can be prepared several days in advance.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COOKIES ===
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  peppermint extract
     1/2           cup  powder sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  powder sugar
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
                        === GANACHE ===
     1/4           cup  whipping cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  9             ounces  imported white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt)
     1/4      teaspoon  peppermint extract
                        === COATING ===
  9             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
  1         tablespoon  solid vegetable shortening

For Cookies:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 2 heavy large cookie sheets.

Using electric mixer, cream butter and extracts in medium bowl until light.  Beat in sugar.  Beat in half of flour.  Stir in remaining flour.  Spoon half of dough into pastry bag fitted with number 4 star tip.  Pipe 2 1/2-inch-long ovals with solid centers on prepared cookie sheet, spacing cookies 1/2-inch apart.  Repeat with remaining dough.

Bake until golden brown on edges, about 12 minutes.  Transfer to paper towels and cool.

For Ganache:  Bring cream and butter to simmer in heavy small saucepan over low heat.  Add chocolate and stir until smooth.  Mix in extract.  Refrigerate just until firm enough to spread, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Line 2 cookie sheets with foil.  Using small metal icing spatula, spread 1 teaspoon ganache over flat side 1 cookie.  Arrange ganache-side up on prepared cookie sheet.  Repeat with remaining cookies.  Refrigerate until ganache is firm, about 30 minutes.

For Coating:  Melt bittersweet chocolate and vegetable shortening in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth.  Remove from over water.

Dip 1 end of 1 cookie into bittersweet chocolate.  Grasp cookie on sides and dip ganache side into bittersweet chocolate; shake cookie to remove excess chocolate.  Place cookie on same sheet, chocolate-side down.  Repeat with remaining cookies.  Chill until chocolate sets, 30 minutes.

Remove cookies from foil.  (Can be prepared 2 weeks ahead.  Refrigerate in single layers in airtight containers.  Let stand 10 minutes at room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields about 42 cookies.

Comments:  Festive pipe cookies spread with minted white chocolate and coated with dark chocolate.  Great for after dinner.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SUGARED ORANGE PEEL ===
  3                     oranges
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  4        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
                        === COOKIES ===
     1/2           cup  whipping cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
     2/3           cup  lightly toasted sliced almonds
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped crystallized ginger
  6             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)

For Sugared Orange Peel:  Remove peel from oranges (orange part only) in strips using vegetable table peeler.  Finely chop enough peel to measure 2 teaspoons and set aside for cookie batter.  Blanch remaining peel in small saucepan of boiling water 2 minutes.  Drain.  Return blanched orange peel strips to saucepan.  Add 1/2 cup sugar and water and bring to boil, stirring frequently.  Boil 5 minutes.  Drain; reserve syrup for another use.

Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar on plate.  Arrange orange peel strips atop sugar.  Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.  Let stand 15 minutes.  Remove peel from sugar.  Finely chop enough peel to measure 2 tablespoons; reserve remainder for another use.

For Cookies:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line 2 heavy large cookie sheets with foil.  Lightly butter foil.

Combine first 4 ingredients in heavy small saucepan.  Cook over medium heat just until sugar dissolves, stirring constantly.  Add 2 teaspoons minced unsugared peel, 2 tablespoons chopped sugared orange peel, almonds, flour and ginger.  Bring mixture to boil, stirring frequently.

Drop 1 level tablespoon mixture (mixture will be runny) onto prepared cookie sheet.  Repeat 5 more times, spacing cookies about 3 inches apart.  Repeat procedure with second cookie sheet.  Bake cookies until edges are pale golden, brown, about 8 minutes (cookies will spread).

Remove cookie sheets from oven.  Using 3-inch round cookie cutter, push cookie sides in to reshape cookies into 3-inch rounds.  Slide foil off sheets.  Cool cookies on foil.  Turn foil over.  Carefully peel off cookies.  Line same cookie sheets with new foil.  Repeat with remaining batter.

Line 2 cookie sheets with foil.  Melt chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth.  Remove from over water.  Dip 1 cookie halfway into chocolate; shake off excess chocolate.  Place cookie on prepared sheet.  Repeat with remaining cookies.  Refrigerate until chocolate sets, about 30 minutes.

Remove cookies from foil.  (Can be prepared 2 weeks ahead.  Refrigerate in airtight container between sheets of waxed paper.  Let cookies stand 20 minutes at room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields 24 cookies.

Comments:  Chewy, candy-like caramel cookies enhanced with orange and crystallized ginger.  The leftover orange sugar syrup is a delicious sweetener for hot tea.

  1                cup  diced candied citron - (abt 5 oz)
  2        tablespoons  grated orange peel
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
     3/4           cup  unblanched all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
                        = (preferably Dutch-process)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  honey -- plus
  2        tablespoons  honey
  6             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- melted
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
                        Additional unsweetened cocoa powder

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Brush two 8-inch-diameter cake pans with melted butter.  Line bottoms with parchment paper.  Brush parchment generously with butter.  Reserving remaining butter.

Place hazelnuts on small cookie sheet; place almonds on another small cookie sheet.  Toast in oven until nuts are brown and fragrant, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes for almonds and 14 minutes for hazelnuts.  Cool.  Gather hazelnuts in dish towels.  Rub in towel to remove husks.  Transfer hazelnuts and almonds to large bowl.  Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees.

Add figs, apricots, citron, orange and lemon peels to nuts in large bowl.  Combine flour, 3/4 cup cocoa powder and spices in small bowl.  Add to nuts.

Combine sugar, honey and remaining melted butter in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until mixture is smooth and sugar is mostly dissolved, about 5 minutes.  Bring to boil.  Continue cooking until candy thermometer registers 248 degrees (firm-ball stage).  Immediately pour over mixture.  Stir to combine thoroughly.

Divide batter between prepared pans, using back of buttered spoon to spread evenly.  Bake until tops and edges just begin to brown and tops feel dry, about 1 1/4 hours.  Cool slightly on wire rack.  Run small sharp knife around edges of pans to loosen cakes.  Turn cakes out onto work surface; peel off parchment.  Cool cakes completely.

Arrange cakes top-sides up on 8-inch cardboard rounds.  Spread half of chocolate over each.  Refrigerate until chocolate is set, about 1 hour.

Brush tops of cakes with cocoa powder.  Wrap tightly in plastic wrap, then wrap decoratively with colored cellophane.  Tie ribbon with gift tag around cellophane to secure.  (Panforte can be prepared up to 1 month ahead.  Store at cool room temperature.)

This recipe yields 2 cakes.

Comments:  This Italian version of fruitcake is dense, chewy and candy-like.  Wrap it in brightly colored cellophane for giving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2             medium  oranges
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  orange marmalade
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4              large  eggs -- room temperature
  2 1/2           cups  cake flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4           cup  orange juice
                        === CHOCOLATE GANACHE ===
  2 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  9        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  30            ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
  7        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
                        = (or substitute orange juice)
  3        tablespoons  thawed frozen orange juice concentrate
  2        tablespoons  minced orange peel
                        === ORANGE GLAZE ===
  6        tablespoons  orange marmalade
  6        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
                        = (or substitute orange juice)
  3 1/2                 baskets raspberries - (1/2 pint ea)
                        = (or 5 1/4 cups frozen unsweetened
                        raspberries, thawed, drained)
                        Mint sprigs -- for garnish

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line pan bottoms with waxed paper.

Using vegetable peeler, remove peel from oranges in strips.  Coarsely chop peel in processor, stopping occasionally to scrap down sides of bowl.  Add 1/3 cup sugar and blend until peel is minced.  Add marmalade and puree.

Using electric mixer, cream butter with pureed mixture and vanilla in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Beat in remaining 1 cup sugar.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Sift dry ingredients into small bowl.  Mix dry ingredients into batter alternately with orange juice.

Divide batter between prepared pans.  Bake cakes until tops are golden brown and tester inserted in centers comes out clean, about 38 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Run sharp knife around pan sides to loosen cakes.  Turn cakes out onto racks; cool.  Peel off paper.

For the Chocolate Ganache:  Bring cream and butter to simmer in heavy large saucepan.  Reduce heat to low.  Add chopped chocolate and stir until melted.  Mix in remaining ingredients.  Pour ganache into large bowl.  Freeze until very thick but still spreadable, stirring frequently, about 1 hour 15 minutes.

For Glaze:  Melt marmalade in heavy small saucepan over low heat.  Remove from heat.  Mix in Grand Marnier.

Cut each cake into 2 layers.  Place 1 layer on plate.  Brush with 1/4 of glaze.  Spread 1 cup ganache over.  Top with second cake layer.  Brush with 1/4 of glaze.  Spread 3/4 cup ganache over.  Top with 1 1/2 baskets berries (about 2 1/2 cups).  Spread 1/2 cup ganache over third cake layer.  Invert, chocolate-side down, over berries.  Brush with 1/4 of glaze.  Spread 1 cup ganache over.  Top with fourth cake layer.  Brush with remaining glaze.

Spread 3/4 cup ganache over top of cake.  Spoon 1 cup ganache into pastry bag fitted with medium star top.  Spread remaining ganache over sides of cake, drawing icing spatula up to create vertical lines.  Pipe decorative border of ganache around top and bottom edges of cake.  Freeze cake 20 minutes.

Arrange remaining berries atop cake, covering completely.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover cake loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate.)

Garnish cake with mint sprigs.  Serve cake at room temperature.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COOKIES ===
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  1                cup  sugar
  1              large  egg
  1                     egg yolk
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves - (generous)
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  fresh cranberries
     1/4           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  raspberry preserves
                        Powdered sugar

For Cookies:  Using electric mixer, cream butter, vanilla and lemon in bowl until light.  Gradually add sugar and beat until blended.  Beat in egg and yolk.  Combine flour, cornstarch and cloves.  Beat half of dry ingredients into butter mixture.  Stir in remaining dry ingredients.  Gather dough into ball (dough will be soft).  Divide dough into 4 pieces; flatten each into disk.  Wrap each in plastic and chill 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter heavy large nonstick cookie sheets.  Roll 1 dough piece out (keep remainder refrigerated) on floured surface to thickness of 1/8-inch.  Cut out star-shaped cookies using floured 3-inch star cutter.  Transfer to prepared cookie sheets, spacing 1/2 inch apart.

Repeat rolling and cutting with second dough piece.  Gather scraps and reroll, chilling dough briefly if soft.  Cut out more 3-inch star cookies.  Transfer to prepared cookie sheets.  Chill cookies 10 minutes.  Bake until edges are golden, about 10 minutes.  Cool on rack.

Roll third dough piece out on lightly floured surface to thickness of 1/8-inch.  Cut out star-shaped cookies using floured 3-inch star cutter.  Cut smaller star out of center of each 3-inch star using 1 3/4- to 2-inch star cutter.  Transfer star outlines to prepared cookie sheets using floured metal spatula as aid.

Repeat rolling and cutting star outlines with fourth dough piece.  Gather scraps and star centers and reroll, chilling dough briefly if soft.  Cut out 3-inch stars.  Cut smaller stars out of each 3-inch star.  Transfer star outlines and centers to prepared cookie sheets.  Chill cookies 10 minutes.  Bake until edges are golden brown, about 9 minutes.  Transfer cookies to rack and cool.

For Filling:  Finely chop cranberries with sugar in processor.  Transfer mixture to heavy medium saucepan.  Mix in preserves.  Cook over medium-high heat until mixture is reduced to scant 1 cup, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Pour into bowl and cool.

Using metal icing spatula, spread 1 teaspoon jam filling in center of each 3-inch cookie, spreading slightly toward points of star.  Lightly sift powdered sugar over star outlines.  Place star outlines sugar-side up over jam-topped cookies.  (Can be prepared ahead.  Place in single layers in airtight containers.  Refrigerate up to 4 days or freeze up to 2 weeks.  Let stand 10 minutes at room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields about 36 sandwich cookies.

Comments:  Perfect for the holiday season.  Cranberries add tang to the filling of these colorful sandwich cookies.  You will have some small unsandwiched cookies, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  water
     1/2           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1            package  mixed dried fruit - (8 oz)
  4                     orange slices
  1                     cinnamon stick

                        Plain yogurt or sour cream -- for serving
                        Ground cinnamon -- for serving

Combine all ingredients except yogurt and ground cinnamon in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Reduce heat and simmer until fruit softens, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.

Transfer fruit only to glass bowl, using slotted spoon.  Boil liquid until reduced to 1 cup, returning liquid exuded from fruit to saucepan, about 10 minutes.  Pour liquid over fruit, discarding orange slices.

            Hearty Rutabaga, Carrot, Parsnip And Sausage Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  6             ounces  smoked turkey sausage -- cut 1/2" dice
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  3              small  parsnips -- peeled, diced
  1             medium  rutabaga -- peeled, diced
  1              large  carrot -- peeled, diced
  1                can  beef broth - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                can  chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz)
     1/4           cup  half-and-half
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme -- crumbled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add sausage and saute until brown on all sides, about 7 minutes.  Transfer to plate using slotted spoon.  Add onion to saucepan.  Reduce heat to medium and cook until tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.

Add parsnips, rutabaga and carrot and cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add broths.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes.

Puree soup in batches in processor.  Return to saucepan.  Mix in half-and-half and thyme.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add sausage.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)  Heat through.  Ladle into bowls and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled or tripled.

Comments:  This wintry soup can be enhanced with any sausage you like. We find it a great dish in which to use the lowfat turkey sausages now available. The blue cheese corn bread and a green salad make ideal accompaniments. Finish with ripe pears.

  8             ounces  lentils

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  Italian plum tomatoes - (28 oz) -- drained
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2                red onion -- chopped
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh marjoram
                        = (or 1 1/2 tspns dried marjoram, crumbled
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  1              pound  fresh clams
  8             ounces  linguine

Gently squeeze tomatoes to remove juices, then chop.  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and saute until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add garlic and saute until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add dried red pepper and stir 20 seconds.

Mix in tomatoes and simmer until sauce thickens, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Stir in half of marjoram and half of parsley.  Add clams to sauce.  Cover and cook sauce until clams open, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook linguine in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.  Drain well.  Transfer to large bowl.  Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and toss to coat.  Pour clams and sauce over, discarding any clams that do not open.  Sprinkle with remaining chopped fresh herbs.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled or tripled.

Comments:  This is as delicious with mussels as it is with clams.  Offer a simple green salad afterward, and pears and a wedge of Italian cheese for dessert.

  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed

Cook potato in medium saucepan of boiling water until tender, about 30 minutes.  Drain, reserving 3/4 cup cooking liquid.  Mash potato and transfer 1 cup to large bowl, reserving remainder for another use.  Mix 3/4 cup cooking liquid into potato.  Cool to lukewarm.

Sprinkle yeast and sugar over 1/2 cup warm water in small bowl; stir to dissolve.  Let yeast mixture stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.  Add yeast to mashed potato mixture.

Add milk, honey, 3 tablespoons oil and salt to potato mixture.  Stir in enough flour, 1 cup at a time, to form soft dough.  Knead dough on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if dough is sticky, about 5 minutes.  Let dough rest on floured work surface 20 minutes.  Gently punch dough down.

Grease large bowl.  Add dough, turning to coat entire surface.  Cover bowl.  Let dough rise in warm area until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.

Grease large cookie sheet.  Gently punch dough down.  Roll dough out on lightly floured surface to 20- by 15-inch rectangle.  Brush dough with egg whites.  Mix brown sugar, raisins and cinnamon in medium bowl.  Spread sugar mixture over dough, leaving 1-inch border on all sides.

Starting at 1 long side, roll dough up jelly roll fashion to form cylinder.  Pinch seam to seal.  Cut cylinder into 2-inch-wide pieces.  Arrange rolls on prepared sheet, placing cut side up and spacing 2 inches apart.  Brush rolls with vegetable oil.  Let cinnamon rolls rise until doubled in volume, about 35 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake rolls until golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Cool slightly in pan on rack.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 10 rolls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MACAROONS ===
     1/2           cup  hazelnuts - (abt 2 1/2 oz) -- lightly toasted
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1              large  egg white
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === MOCHA GANACHE ===
     1/4           cup  whipping cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  instant coffee granules
  9             ounces  imported milk chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === COATING ===
  9             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate, c
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
  1         tablespoon  solid vegetable shortening
  30             small  raspberries or hazelnuts -- more or less
  3             ounces  imported white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt)

For Macaroons:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line 1 large cookie sheet with parchment.  Brush lightly with vegetable oil.

Finely grind hazelnuts in processor.  Add sugar and flour; blend to powder.  With machine running, add egg white and vanilla; blend to paste. Spoon mixture into pastry bag fitted with number 4 (3/8-inch-diameter) round tip.  Pipe 3/4- to 1-inch-diameter mound onto parchment about 1/2-inch high and spacing 1 inch apart.  Dip finger into water and gently press top of cookie to flatten center slightly.

Bake until golden brown, about 12 minutes (cookies will spread to about 1 1/2 inches.)  Turn parchment (cookies will adhere) over onto work surface.  Brush parchment with just enough water to moisten.  Let stand until parchment can easily be pulled off cookies, about 2 minutes.  Peel off parchment.

For Ganache:  Bring cream and butter to simmer in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add instant coffee granules; stir to dissolve.  Reduce heat to low.  Add chocolate; stir until melted.  Mix in vanilla.  Pour into bowl.  Chill until firm enough to spread, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.

Line cookie sheet with foil.  Using icing spatula, spread 1 heaping teaspoon ganache onto flat side of each cookie, mounding to dome in center.  Place ganache-side up on prepared cookie sheet.  Repeat with remaining cookies.  Chill until ganache sets, 20 minutes.

For Coating:  Line cookie sheet with aluminum foil.  Melt bittersweet chocolate with vegetable shortening in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring until smooth.  Remove from over water.

Grasp 1 cookie between thumb and index finger.  Dip ganache portion into melted chocolate.  Shake off excess.  Turn chocolate-side up and place on foil-lined cookie sheet.  Top with raspberry or hazelnut.  Repeat with remaining cookies.  Refrigerate until chocolate sets, about 30 minutes.

Melt white chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring until smooth.  Dip spoon into chocolate.  Wave from side to side over cookies, forming decorative pattern.  Refrigerate until white chocolate sets, about 15 minutes.  Place cookies in single layer in airtight containers; chill overnight.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.)  Let stand 10 minutes at room temperature before serving.

This recipe yields about 30 cookies.

Comments:  If you're short on time, you can skip the white chocolate decoration.

     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  unsulfured molasses
  1                     egg
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger

Make Cookies:  Finely grind walnuts in processor.  Add 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup sugar and blend to powder.

Using electric mixer, cream butter with brown sugar and vanilla in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in molasses and egg.  Mix remaining 1 3/4 cups flour with nut mixture, spices and baking soda.  Stir into butter mixture (dough will be soft).  Divide dough into 2 pieces.  Flatten each into disk.  Wrap each disk tightly in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter heavy large cookie sheets.  On heavily floured surface, roll 1 dough piece out (keep remainder refrigerated) to thickness of 1/8- to 1/4-inch.  Cut out cookies using 3-inch leaf cookie cutter.  Transfer to prepared cookie sheets, spacing 1/2 inch apart.  Repeat rolling and cutting with second dough piece.  Gather scraps and chill 15 minutes.  Reroll scraps and cut out more cookies.  Bake until golden, about 10 minutes.  Cool on racks.

Make Icing:  Using electric mixer, beat sugar and egg whites until smooth.  Spoon icing into pastry bag fitted with 1/16-inch round tip.  Pipe icing atop cookies.  Decorate with dragees.  Let stand until icing sets.  (Can be prepared 2 weeks ahead.  Store refrigerated between layers of waxed paper in airtight container.  Let stand 5 minutes at room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields about 48 cookies.

Comments:  These Christmas cookies are topped with white icing and silver dragÈes for added elegance.  Look for the dragÈes in the cake decorating section of your supermarket.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  fennel seeds
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  1              large  onion -- minced
  3 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- more or less
  1            package  fast-rising dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/4           cups  hot water -- (125 to 130 degrees)
                        Coarse salt -- as needed

Heat heavy medium skillet over high heat.  Add fennel seeds and stir until just golden brown and aromatic, about 1 minute.  Transfer fennel seeds to large bowl.  Reduce heat to medium.  Add butter and minced onion to same skillet.  Saute until onion is golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Cool slightly.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Add 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar and salt to fennel seeds in large bowl.  Stir in hot water and onion mixture.  Mix in enough of remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, to form soft dough.  Knead dough on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if dough is sticky, about 8 minutes.

Form dough into ball.  Place on lightly floured surface.  Cover with towel.  Let dough stand 10 minutes.

Dust 4 cookie sheets with flour.  Divide dough in half.  Roll each half out on floured surface to 12-inch square.  Dust well with flour.  Fold each square in thirds and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide strips.  Unfold strips.  Let dough rest 5 minutes.  Stretch each strip to 14 inches.  Place strips 1/2 inch apart on prepared cookie sheets.  Let breadsticks rest 10 minutes.

Brush breadsticks lightly with water.  Sprinkle lightly with coarse salt.  Bake breadsticks until golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Cool 15 minutes.

Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees.  Return breadsticks to oven and bake until crisp, about 12 minutes.  Cool completely.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Store in airtight container.)

This recipe yields about 4 dozen.

  1                cup  raspberry jam - (abt 10 1/2 oz)
  2                     baskets fresh raspberries - (1/2 pint ea)
                        = (or two 12-oz bags frozen unsweetened
                        raspberries, thawed)
  2              large  bananas -- peeled, halved

                        Semisweet chocolate -- curled or grated

For Custard:  Scald half-and-half in heavy medium saucepan.  Whisk yolks, sugar and flour in top of double boiler until smooth.  Gradually whisk in hot half-and-half.  Set over boiling water and stir until custard is very thick and mounds when dropped from spoon, about 6 minutes.  Set top of double boiler over ice and chill custard, whisking occasionally.  Mix in vanilla.

Combine whipping cream and espresso powder in large bowl and stir until powder dissolves.  Beat to firm peaks.  Add Scotch and beat until firm.  Fold cream mixture into cold custard in 2 additions.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

For Trifle:  Place half of pound cake cubes in 3-quart trifle bowl or glass bowl.  Sprinkle with 3 tablespoons Scotch and toss.  Heat jam in heavy small saucepan until just pourable.  Spoon half of jam over cake and spread.  Top with half of custard.  Top with 1 basket or 1 package raspberries, making sure some berries show at sides of bowl.  Top with half of bananas.

Place remaining pound cake cubes in another bowl.  Sprinkle with 3 tablespoons Scotch and toss.  Layer fruit over.  Spoon remaining jam over and spread.  Top with remaining custard, then with 1 basket or package of raspberries and remaining banana.  Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)

Whip cream and sugar in large bowl to stiff peaks.  Add 3 tablespoons Scotch and beat to firm peaks.  Mound cream atop trifle.  Garnish with fresh raspberries and chocolate.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Inspired by a trip to Scotland, where some cooks make their Christmas pudding and hard sauce with their favorite Scotch.

For Trifle:  Place half of pound cake cubes in 3-quart trifle bowl or glass bowl.  Sprinkle with 3 tablespoons Scotch and toss.  Heat jam in heavy small saucepan until just pourable.  Spoon half of jam over cake and spread.  Top with half of custard.  Top with 1 basket or 1 package raspberries, making sure some berries show at sides of bowl.  Top with half of bananas.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place remaining pound cake cubes in another bowl.  Sprinkle with 3 tablespoons Scotch and toss.  Layer fruit over.  Spoon remaining jam over and spread.  Top with remaining custard, then with 1 basket or package of raspberries and remaining banana.  Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)

Recipe By     :Sue Ellison, Edgewater, CO
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whole wheat flour
  1           envelope  dry yeast
  1 1/2           cups  milk
     1/4           cup  honey
  1         tablespoon  sesame or vegetable oil
  1                     egg -- separated
     1/2           cup  cracked wheat -- see * Note
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- more or less
     1/2           cup  salted shelled sunflower seeds
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sesame seeds
  1         tablespoon  water
  2          teaspoons  chopped pecans
  2          teaspoons  rolled oats
  2          teaspoons  caraway seeds
  2          teaspoons  fennel seeds
  2          teaspoons  poppy seeds
  2          teaspoons  sesame seeds

* Note:  Also called bulgur, available at natural foods stores and supermarkets.

Combine 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and yeast in large bowl.  Heat milk, honey and sesame oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat to 115 degrees, stirring occasionally.  Remove saucepan from heat.  Add milk mixture to dry ingredients.  Stir in egg yolk, remaining 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, cracked wheat and salt.  Mix in enough all-purpose flour 1/2 cup at a time to form soft, slightly sticky dough.  Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, adding more all purpose flour if very sticky, about 10 minutes.

Lightly oil large bowl.  Add dough, turning to coat entire surface.  Cover bowl with kitchen towel.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 3/4 hours.

Grease cookie sheet.  Punch dough down.  Mix in sunflower seeds and 2 1/2 tablespoons sesame seeds.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth.  Divide dough in half.  Pat each half into 1 1/2-inch-thick round.  Place on prepared sheet.  Cover and let rise in warm draft-free area until almost doubled, about 1 1/4 hours.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Using sharp knife, cut 1/8-inch-deep, 1-inch-diameter circle in center of one round.  Starting at outside of circle, cut 1/8-inch-deep slit to edge of loaf.  Repeat 4 more times, spacing evenly apart and dividing bread into fifths.  Repeat with second loaf.

Beat egg white with 1 tablespoon water.  Brush over loaves.  Sprinkle pecans in center of each loaf.  Sprinkle oats, caraway seeds, fennel seeds, poppy seeds and 2 teaspoons sesame seeds into divided spaces.

Bake until loaves are brown and sound hollow when tapped on bottom, about 50 minutes.  Transfer to racks and cool slightly.  Serve bread warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 2 loaves.  This recipe can easily be doubled.

     1/2           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/2           cup  rolled oats
  2          teaspoons  cinnamon
     1/4           cup  chilled butter - (1/2 stick)
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
  3                     eggs

  1             medium  apple -- peeled, cored,

Bake until golden brown and toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean, about 55 minutes.  Cool on rack.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FUDGE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/3           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  4             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Baker's)
     1/2           cup  orange marmalade
  2        tablespoons  rum
                        === SUNDAES ===
  1                     basket strawberries - (1 pint) -- thickly sliced
  2                     bananas -- sliced
  2                     peaches -- peeled, sliced
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  rum
  2              pints  vanilla Swiss almond or
                        chocolate chip ice cream
                        = (such as Haagen-Dazs)
                        Toasted sliced almonds

For Fudge Sauce:  Stir first 4 ingredients in heavy small saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth.  Add rum.  Strain, pressing on solids to extract as much flavor as possible.  (Can be prepared 5 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm over low heat before using, stirring constantly and thinning with more cream if necessary.)

For Sundaes:  Combine first 5 ingredients in medium bowl.  Stir gently.  Let stand for 15 to 30 minutes.  Scoop ice cream into sundae or balloon glasses.  Top with warm sauce, then fruits and nuts and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  The addition of fresh fruit gives these irresistible sundaes seasonal appeal.  The rich creamy sauce is a do-ahead.

Cut goat cheese into twelve 1/2-inch-thick rounds.  Set rounds aside.

For Tomato And Garlic Goat Cheese:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place garlic in heavy small pan.  Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil.  Bake until garlic is tender when pierced with small sharp knife, about 20 minutes.  Cool slightly; peel garlic cloves.  Reserve oil in pan.

Place sun-dried tomatoes in small bowl.  Add enough boiling water to cover.  Let tomatoes stand until softened, about 15 minutes.  Drain; pat dry.

Put 1 tomato, 1 garlic clove and 1 sprig each rosemary and thyme in bottom of 8-ounce jar.  Drizzle with 1 1/2 teaspoons oil reserved from garlic.  Place 1 cheese round atop herbs.  Drizzle with more reserved olive oil.  Repeat layering, using remaining tomatoes, garlic, herbs, garlic oil and 3 more cheese rounds.  Pour in enough olive oil to fill jar completely.  Seal tightly.  (Can be prepared 1 week ahead; refrigerate.)

For Porcini Mushroom Goat Cheese:  Rinse mushrooms briefly with cold water; drain.  Place mushrooms in small bowl.  Add enough boiling water to cover and let stand until softened, about 30 minutes.  Drain mushrooms.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy small skillet.  Add garlic and saute until just golden, about 3 minutes.  Add mushrooms and cook until just heated through, stirring occasionally, about 1 minute.  Mix in parsley.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cool completely.

Layer mushrooms, olive oil and 4 goat cheese rounds in 8-ounce jar, beginning and ending with mushrooms.  Pour in enough oil to fill jar completely.  Seal tightly.  (Can be prepared up to 1 week ahead;  refrigerate.)

For Walnut Goat Cheese:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place walnuts on small cookie sheet.  Toast until golden brown and fragrant, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes.  Cool completely.

Finely chop walnuts.  Layer walnuts, walnut oil and remaining 4 goat cheese rounds in 8-ounce jar, seasoning each layer generously with pepper.  Pour in enough walnut oil to fill jar completely.  Seal tightly.  (Can be prepared up to 1 week ahead; refrigerate.)

This recipe yields three 8-ounce jars.

Comments:  Delicious served with bread or crackers, these cheeses are also a wonderful addition to pizzas, pastas and salads.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GINGER-LIME SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  6        tablespoons  water
     1/4           cup  strained fresh lime juice
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2             pieces  crystallized ginger
  3        tablespoons  minced crystallized ginger
                        === SUNDAES ===
                        Vanilla ice cream
  3               cups  diced peeled tropical fruit
                        = (such as papaya and/or mango, pineapple)
                        Toasted sweetened shredded coconut

For Ginger-Lime Sauce:  Combine first 6 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until sugars dissolve.  Boil gently until reduced to 1 cup, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes.  Cool to lukewarm.  Discard ginger pieces and add minced ginger.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and store at room temperature.  Reheat to lukewarm, whisking occasionally, before serving.)

For Sundaes:  Scoop ice cream into balloon glasses or sundae dishes.  Spoon lukewarm sauce over.  Top with fruit.  Sprinkle with coconut and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The twist to these sundaes is a simple ginger-flavored sauce sparked with lime.  It can be made ahead and rewarmed before you assemble the sundaes.
