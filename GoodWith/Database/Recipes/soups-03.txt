  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  mixed cooked meats (beef, lamb,
                        pork, chicken, game, etc.)
     1/2        gallon  chicken stock
     1/2        gallon  beef stock
  1              ounce  Worcestershire sauce
  1                cup  diced tomatoes
  1              large  onion -- diced
  1                     celery rib -- diced
  1              small  green bell pepper -- diced
  1              large  potato -- diced
  2              large  carrots -- diced
     1/4           cup  peas
     1/2           cup  okra
     1/4           cup  lima beans
     1/2           cup  yellow corn
  2           teaspoon  minced garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine all ingredients and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours -- skimming the top as needed. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Many regional versions of this soup are thick enough to stand your spoon in.  I developed this recipe to be a lighter first-course soup.  A favorite at Kentucky Derby time, its history dates back to before the Civil War.

  2        tablespoons  buffalo jerky scraps made with
                        salt and hand-ground chili powder
  2              small  hot chili peppers
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

  2              dozen  cornhusks -- soaked in water

Recipe By     :Betty Rosbottom
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2    tablespoons  chili powder
  2 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt -- more if needed
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2             pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut in 1/2" cubes
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped carrot
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  3                     garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
  1                can  plum tomatoes - (28 oz) -- drained, chopped
  5               cups  chicken broth
  1                can  black beans - (15 1/2 oz) -- drained, rinsed
  1                can  white navy beans - (15 1/2 oz) -- drained, rinsed
  1                cup  nonfat sour cream
  2          teaspoons  grated orange zest
  2        tablespoons  fresh orange juice
  4          teaspoons  chopped fresh cilantro

Combine chili powder, cumin, oregano, red pepper flakes and 1 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl and mix well.  Measure 2 tablespoons spice mixture and combine with flour.  Place in a bowl and toss with chicken cubes. 
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat When oil is hot, add enough chicken to fit comfortably in a single layer.  Saute, turning often, until chicken is golden, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat until all chicken is cooked, adding more oil if necessary.  Set aside. 
Add carrot, onion and celery to skillet and cook, stirring, until just softened, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add garlic and cook for 1 minute more.  Add remaining spice mixture and toss well.  Return chicken to skillet along with tomatoes and broth.  Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low and simmer until chicken is tender and soup thickens, 20 to 25 minutes.  Add beans and cook for 10 minutes more.  Remove from heat.  (Chili can be made a day ahead to this point, then covered and refrigerated.  It can also be frozen.  Defrost before continuing recipe.) 
To finish chili, mix together sour cream, orange zest, orange juice and cilantro in a small serving bowl.  (This garnish can be made up to 3 hours ahead, covered and refrigerated until ready to serve.)  Reheat chili over medium heat, stirring often. 
To serve, ladle into bowls and garnish with a dollop of the sour-cream mixture. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

                           Chicken Coconut Soup

Recipe By     :Martin Yan, "Everybody's Wokking"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  chicken broth
                        Bottom 6" of 1 lemongrass stalk -- cut into 1" pieces,
                        and crushed with the side of a cleaver
  3        thin slices  fresh ginger
  1                can  coconut milk - (14 oz)
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1              whole  chicken breast -- skinned, boned,
                        and thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  canned straw mushrooms
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1                     serrano or jalapeÃ’o chili -- seeded, slivered,
                        see * Note
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil

* Note:  Wear gloves when handling fresh, canned, dried or pickled chilis; the oils can cause a burning sensation on your skin. 
In a large pot, bring the broth, lemongrass and ginger to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium and add the coconut milk and fish sauce; cover and simmer for 8 minutes. 
Add the chicken, mushrooms, lime juice and chili, and cook until the chicken turns opaque, about 5 minutes. 
Add the basil leaves just before serving.  Ladle into individual soup bowls. 
Tip:  Although lemongrass stalks are fibrous and are used to flavor soup rather than as an ingredient to be eaten, it is customary in Thai cooking to leave them in the soup when serving.  You may prefer to discard them just as you would a bay leaf. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  My version of this Thai favorite is only moderately spiced.  If you want more flavor, double the amount of lemongrass and do not remove the seeds from the chili.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     fresh poblano chili peppers
  4                     jalapeÃ’o chili peppers - (to 6)
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, crushed
  2              large  onions -- peeled, chopped
  3        tablespoons  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2         pound  bacon -- finely chopped
  4             pounds  trimmed boneless pork loin -- cut in 1/2" dice
  40            ounces  canned chicken broth - (to 46 oz)
  1                can  cream of mushroom soup - (10 1/2 oz)
  2               cans  whole green chili peppers - (7 oz ea) -- drained, chopped
  1                jar  salsa verde - (16 oz)
     1/4           cup  minced fresh coriander (cilantro) leaves
  1              slice  Velveeta processed cheese block 2" thick
                        slice
  3               cans  beans - (15 oz ea) -- (optional) -- such as navy,
                        pinto, or cannellini
                        Sour cream -- (optional)
                        Fresh coriander leaves -- (optional)
                        Flour tortillas

Broil or grill the fresh poblano chili peppers, close to the heat source and turning frequently with tongs, until the pepper skins are mostly blackened and blistered.  (This may be done on the burner of a gas cooktop.)  Place the peppers in a brown paper lunch sack, fold over the top to seal and let stand 10 to 15 minutes. Wearing clean rubber gloves, peel and discard skin and stems.  If desired, cut open the peppers and remove their seeds to reduce the culinary heat of the peppers. 
While still wearing the rubber gloves, cut away and discard the stems of the jalapeÃ’o peppers.  Cut peppers lengthwise and remove all or most of the seeds to reduce the culinary heat.  Reserve one of the jalapeÃ’o chili peppers for later use. 
Place the remaining jalapeÃ’o peppers and prepared poblano peppers in jar of electric blender.  Add two cloves of garlic, half of the onion and all of the cumin and white pepper.  Add a generous dose of the chicken broth.  Process to a smooth puree, adding additional broth, if necessary, to achieve a smooth mixture.  Set aside. 
Warm the skillet over moderate heat.  Add chopped bacon and cook, stirring frequently.  Add the reserved jalapeÃ’o pepper halves and the remaining clove garlic when the bacon begins to release its fat.  Continue to cook until lean portions of bacon are browned and fragrant. 
In a colander set over a bowl, drain the bacon pieces, reserving the drippings.  Drain well.  Discard the crushed clove of garlic and jalapeÃ’o halves; they were in the skillet to flavor the drippings. 
Place the cooked bacon in the large saucepan.  Add the pureed poblano pepper mixture, scraping the blender container with a rubber spatula to remove all the flavorful mixture.  Add about three cups of the chicken broth.  Stir and set pan over low heat. 
Return the reserved bacon drippings to the skillet over moderate-high heat.  When the grease is hot again, add a portion of the cubed pork.  The heat should be high enough that the pork sizzles in the drippings.  The pork should not be crowded in the pan.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until all sides of the meat cubes are well browned.  As the meat browns, sprinkle lightly with salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste.  Drain the meat cubes well in the colander over the bowl, reserving the drippings.  Transfer the pork cubes to the large pan with the bacon and broth; add broth as necessary to keep the meat well covered.  Repeat as necessary until all pork is well browned and added to the large pan. 
Fry the chopped onion until golden in the remaining bacon fat; drain well and add to the growing pot of chili. 
Turn up the heat under the large pot and add the cream of mushroom soup, canned chili peppers, salsa verde and chopped coriander leaves.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes to blend flavors. 
Cut a 2-inch thick slice of the Velveeta cheese.  Add chunk of cheese and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until cheese melts.  If you wish to add beans, drain them in a colander, rinse well and drain; add to the chili mixture about 15 minutes before serving.  Taste and add salt if necessary. 
To serve, ladle chili into bowls.  If desired, top each with a tablespoon of sour cream and a sprig or leaf of fresh coriander (cilantro) and serve with warmed flour tortillas.  Refrigerate leftovers.  Chili will have a milder flavor on the second day. 
This recipe yields about 16 servings.

Broil or grill the fresh poblano chili peppers, close to the heat source and turning frequently with tongs, until the pepper skins are mostly blackened and blistered.  (This may be done on the burner of a gas cooktop.)  Place the peppers in a brown paper lunch sack, fold over the top to seal and let stand 10 to 15 minutes. Wearing clean rubber gloves, peel and discard skin and stems.  If desired, cut open the peppers and remove their seeds to reduce the culinary heat of the peppers. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
While still wearing the rubber gloves, cut away and discard the stems of the jalapeÃ’o peppers.  Cut peppers lengthwise and remove all or most of the seeds to reduce the culinary heat.  Reserve one of the jalapeÃ’o chili peppers for later use. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the remaining jalapeÃ’o peppers and prepared poblano peppers in jar of electric blender.  Add two cloves of garlic, half of the onion and all of the cumin and white pepper.  Add a generous dose of the chicken broth.  Process to a smooth puree, adding additional broth, if necessary, to achieve a smooth mixture.  Set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Warm the skillet over moderate heat.  Add chopped bacon and cook, stirring frequently.  Add the reserved jalapeÃ’o pepper halves and the remaining clove garlic when the bacon begins to release its fat.  Continue to cook until lean portions of bacon are browned and fragrant. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a colander set over a bowl, drain the bacon pieces, reserving the drippings.  Drain well.  Discard the crushed clove of garlic and jalapeÃ’o halves; they were in the skillet to flavor the drippings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the cooked bacon in the large saucepan.  Add the pureed poblano pepper mixture, scraping the blender container with a rubber spatula to remove all the flavorful mixture.  Add about three cups of the chicken broth.  Stir and set pan over low heat.

Return the reserved bacon drippings to the skillet over moderate-high heat.  When the grease is hot again, add a portion of the cubed pork.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     stewing hen - (6 lbs)
                        (or 2 broiler-fryers, 3 lbs ea)
  2              large  onions -- sliced
  2               cups  cut okra -- (optional)
  4               cups  fresh chopped tomatoes
                        (or 2 cans tomatoes, 16 oz ea)
  2               cups  lima beans
  3             medium  potatoes -- diced
  4               cups  corn cut from the cob
                        (or 2 cans corn, 16 oz ea)
  3          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  sugar

Cut the chicken in pieces and simmer it -- in 3 quarts of water for a thin stew or 2 quarts of water for a thick stew -- until the meat can easily be removed from the bones, for about 2 1/4 hours.  If canned vegetables are used, include their juices and reduce water to 2 quarts for a thin stew and 1 quart for a thick stew. 
Add the raw vegetables to the broth and simmer, uncovered, until the beans and potatoes are tender.  Stir occasionally to prevent scorching.  Add the chicken, boned and diced if desired, and the seasonings. 
This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings. 
Comments:  Tidewater home cooks make this stew a day ahead, as the flavor improves when it stands overnight and is reheated the next day.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12 1/2          cups  chicken broth -- divided
  1 1/4           cups  wild rice
  5        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  10            ounces  turkey kielbasa -- cut 1/4" dice
  2 1/2           cups  chopped onions
  1 1/4           cups  carrots in 1/4" dice
  2 1/2         pounds  frozen corn kernels -- defrosted
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt -- or to taste
  1 1/4      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  1 1/4           cups  half-and-half -- plus more if needed
                        Chopped fresh chives or flat-leaf parsley -- (optional)

Place 5 cups broth into a heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  When it just begins to simmer, add wild rice.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook until all liquid is absorbed, 20 to 30 minutes.  Remove from heat.  You should have 3 3/4 cups cooked rice. 
Heat oil in a large, deep-sided pot over medium-high heat.  When hot, add the sausage and saute, stirring until golden, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add onions and carrots and cook, stirring for 3 to 4 minutes more.  Add 6 cups broth and bring to a simmer over high heat.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. 
Meanwhile, prepare the corn broth.  Set aside 2 1/2 cups corn kernels.  Puree remaining corn and remaining 1 1/2 cups broth in a food processor fitted with a metal blade.  Process well to produce a thick, opaque broth. 
Add cooked wild rice, corn broth and reserved corn kernels to pot and stir well.  Cook for 10 to 15 minutes more.  Season with salt and pepper.  Stir in half-and-half.  If soup is too thick, add additional half-and-half.  Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed. 
Ladle into bowls and garnish with chives or parsley, if desired. 
This recipe yields 6 (2-cup) servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHRIMP ===
  36                    cooked shrimp - (abt 2 lbs) -- medium-to-large
     1/3           cup  olive oil
     1/3           cup  fresh lime juice
  8              large  garlic cloves -- roasted, minced
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro leaves
     1/3           cup  tequila
  3                     jalapeÃ’o peppers -- seeded, minced
                        === SOUP ===
  4        tablespoons  butter or margarine
  10                    garlic cloves -- roasted, minced
  4        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  chicken or vegetable stock -- preferably homemade
  1           teaspoon  ground oregano
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             ounces  softened cream cheese -- cut in 1/2" cubes
  2               cups  lowfat 2 percent milk
  1         tablespoon  grated fresh lime zest
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh cilantro leaves
                        Fresh whole cilantro leaves -- for garnish

Peel and devein cooked shrimp, leaving tails intact.  Combine shrimp, olive oil, lime juice, 8 garlic cloves, 2 tablespoons cilantro, tequila and jalapeÃ’os in a heavy-duty 1-gallon plastic food storage bag.  Seal the bag securely and turn over several times to coat the shrimp.  Marinate the shrimp at room temperature while the soup is simmering, but no longer than 30 minutes. 
To make the soup, melt butter in a 4- to 5-quart soup pot over medium heat.  Stir in 10 roasted garlic cloves.  Whisk in flour until well blended.  Cook for two minutes.  Slowly whisk in the chicken stock.  Season with oregano, cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper.  Simmer over low heat, uncovered, 15 minutes. 
Stir in cream cheese, milk, lime zest and 3/4 cup of cilantro.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until cream cheese has melted and mixture is heated through, about 5 minutes. 
Divide soup equally among 6 warm soup bowls.  Drain shrimp, discarding marinade.  Place six shrimp in each bowl.  Garnish with cilantro leaves, if desired. 
To roast garlic:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Slice off the tops of garlic heads to expose the cloves, and peel away the outer layers of papery skin.  Drizzle lightly with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Wrap tightly in foil and bake until garlic is tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, about 30 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, squeeze out the roasted cloves, discarding the skins.  (Any unused garlic cloves can be covered with olive oil and stored airtight in the refrigerator.). 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1              whole  chicken - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs) -- cut up
  3             quarts  cold water
  2             medium  onions -- peeled, quartered
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into thirds
  1                     celery rib -- cut into thirds
  3                     garlic cloves -- mashed
  3                     fresh parsley sprigs
  8              whole  peppercorns - (to 10)
  3                     whole cloves
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
  2             medium  carrots -- peeled, diced
  2             medium  celery ribs -- diced

Combine chicken and water in a large stockpot or Dutch oven; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer uncovered 1 hour, occasionally skimming foam and fat off surface. 
Add the chunks of onions, carrots and celery, garlic, parsley, peppercorns, cloves, bay leaf and thyme.  Simmer 2 hours more. 
Remove chicken with a slotted spoon.  When cool enough to handle, remove skin and bones and return them to stockpot.  Shred meat and set aside.  Simmer broth 1 hour; strain through a fine sieve; discard solids and skim off fat. 
Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat.  Add diced carrots and celery and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add to broth with shredded chicken. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Nothing can replace the aroma, flavor or nostalgia of this slow-simmering homemade soup.

  3             medium  carrots -- chopped
  2             medium  potatoes -- diced
  1         tablespoon  mixed herbs - (to 2 tbspns), such as
                        basil, thyme, marjoram, etc.
  1                can  beans of your choice -- drained, rinsed
  6               cups  greens, such as spinach and/or
                        kale, collards, mustard, dandelion,

In a large soup pot, add oil and cook onions, garlic and celery over medium heat until onions are soft.  Add stock and tomatoes, bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes.

Recipe By     :Jacques Pepin
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SOUP ===
  1 1/2         pounds  fish fillets -- all of one kind,
                        or a mixture
  1 1/2         pounds  littleneck or cherrystones clams
     1/2         pound  scallops
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onions
  5              large  scallions (white and green parts) -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2               cups  chopped cored tomatoes -- fresh or canned,
                        with skin, juice and seeds
  1                cup  white wine, like Chardonnay
  4               cups  fish stock
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  saffron threads -- or less if you wish
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon leaves
                        === ROUILLE ===
  1              slice  firm home-style white bread
  6              large  garlic cloves - (to 8) -- peeled
     1/3           cup  cooked potato
     1/4           cup  canned pimiento pieces
     1/4           cup  broth from the soup pot
  1                     egg yolk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne -- or to taste
     3/4           cup  olive oil - (to 1 cup)
                        === CROUTONS ===
  24            slices  baguette, 1/4" thick -- cut on the diagonal

Preliminaries:  Skin the fillets if you wish and cut them into even chunks, about an inch thick.  (If you want the skin on, make sure it has been scaled.)  Scrub the clams and rinse, if necessary.  Wash the scallops to remove any sand. 
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and toast the croutons on a baking sheet until they are crisp and starting to color on both sides, about 10 minutes.  Set aside until serving. 
Starting the soup base;  Heat the oil in the saucepan and stir in the onions, scallions and garlic.  Cook over medium heat until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, wine, and fish stock, and then stir in the thyme, salt, and pepper.  Bring quickly to the boil; meanwhile, taste and adjust seasonings.  Cook at a gentle boil for 10 to 15 minutes, partially covered, while you are making the rouille. 
Making the rouille:  Tear the bread slice into pieces and put them in the work bowl of the food processor with the garlic cloves.  Process until very finely chopped.  Add the cooked potato, the canned pimiento, and 1/4 cup of broth from the soup pot, and process until completely smooth.  Add the egg yolk, salt, black pepper and cayenne, and process until smooth.  With the machine running, pour in the olive oil in a slow, steady stream -- taking 1/2 minute or more -- as the emulsion is formed and the sauce becomes completely smooth.  Taste and adjust seasonings.  Scrape the rouille into a bowl. 
Finishing the stew/soup and serving:  With the soup base at the boil, add all the clams and the saffron and cook for about 2 minutes.  Add the fish and the scallops, return to a gentle boil, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, just until the fish pieces are cooked through and opaque and all of the clams have opened (discard any that remain closed after sitting in the hot broth for several minutes).  Stir in the chopped tarragon, taste and adjust the seasonings for the final time. 
Spoon some rouille on half of the croutons (or on 2 or 3 per serving).  Ladle portions of the seafood and broth into large soup bowls and place some rouille-topped croutons alongside each serving -- or set them in the broth, if you like.  Serve hot, with extra croutons and rouille on the side. 
This recipe yields about 3 quarts, or enough to serve 6 to 8.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  water
  1 1/2                 chicken bouillon cubes
  1                can  cream-style corn - (16 oz)
  2        tablespoons  katakuri-ko -- see * Note
                        (or substitute potato starch)
  2                     eggs

* Note:  Katakuri-ko is a starch ground from the dried root of the dogtooth violet.  It is expensive, so potato starch can be used as a substitute. 
In a large soup pot, bring water and bouillon cubes to a boil.  Dissolve the bouillon.  Add the creamed corn and bring to a boil again. 
Dissolve the starch in water (1 part starch to 2 parts water) and stir mixture into the pot. 
Beat the eggs.  Add about 1 cup of the hot soup to the eggs to warm them, then return mixture to the pot. 
Soup is ready when eggs are cooked and soup is thickened. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                          Lamb Stew With Lentils

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dried lentils
  2             pounds  boneless lamb shoulder
                        (or 3 to 4 lbs bone-in shoulder or neck)
  1 1/2           cups  sliced onions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  minced celery
     1/2           cup  peeled minced carrots
  1                cup  chopped cored tomatoes -- canned are fine
  3               cups  liquid -- see * Note
                        Minced fresh parsley leaves -- for garnish

* Note:  Use liquid such as water, red wine and/or chicken, beef or vegetable stock. 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  You can also cook this on the stove, if you prefer. 
Trim lamb shoulder of excess fat and cut into 2-inch cubes or, if using bone-in, cut into 2-inch chunks.  In a large pot or casserole with a cover, combine the lamb, lentils, onions, salt and pepper, and 3 cups liquid.  Cover the pot, bring it almost to a boil over high heat, then either turn the heat to low or place the stew in the oven.  Adjust the heat so the lamb bubbles gently. 
After the lamb has cooked for about 45 minutes, add the carrots, celery, garlic and tomatoes.  Add more liquid if the mixture seems dry or if you like your stew on the soupy side.  Cook until the lamb is tender and the second batch of vegetables is tender but not mushy, another 30 to 60 minutes. 
Garnish and serve.  If you prepare this stew the day before, the flavor will deepen; skim excess fat from the surface. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2              large  yellow boiling potatoes -- peeled, diced
                        (such as Yellow Finn or Yukon Gold)
  4               cups  defatted chicken or vegetable broth

                 Lentil And Vegetable Soup With Pancetta

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     carrots -- peeled
  8                     celery stalks
  3                     onions
  2 1/2           cups  lentils
  3 1/2         quarts  water
  2                     bay leaves
  2             sprigs  rosemary sprigs -- plus
  1         tablespoon  rosemary needles
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground pepper -- to taste
  4 1/2         ounces  pancetta - (abt 14 slices) --(optional)
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- or as needed
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  5               cups  chicken or vegetable stock
                        or low-sodium broth
     3/4           cup  tomato puree
     3/4           cup  diced jarred roasted red bell pepper

Cut 2 of the carrots, 4 of the celery stalks and 1 of the onions in half.  Place in a stock pot with the lentils, water, 1 bay leaf and the rosemary sprigs.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until the lentils are almost tender but still hard in the center, about 20 minutes.  Add 1 tablespoon salt and pepper to taste; simmer until the lentils are tender but not mushy, about 5 to 10 minutes longer.  Drain, reserving the liquid.  Let cool.  Discard the vegetable pieces and bay leaf. 
While the lentils cook, chop the remaining vegetables and optional pancetta into small dice; finely chop the rosemary needles. 
Fry the pancetta in a large heavy stock pot over medium-low heat until some fat is rendered.  There should be enough fat to sweat the vegetables, but if there is not enough or you aren't using pancetta, add olive oil.  Add the chopped vegetables, rosemary and red pepper flakes and sweat for about 15 minutes.  The vegetables should release their liquid but do not let them brown. 
Add the lentil-cooking liquid, the remaining bay leaf, the stock and tomato puree to the vegetables.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until the vegetables are tender but not mushy, 15 to 20 minutes. 
Add the diced peppers and the lentils to the soup and heat through.  Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary. 
This recipe yields 12 servings. 
Comments:  Pancetta is available in the deli section of supermarkets.  Leave it out if you wish a vegetarian soup.  Serve with toasted flat bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  lentils -- washed, and
                        picked over
  1                     bay leaf
                        Fresh thyme sprigs
                        (or 2 pinches dried thyme)
  1                     carrot -- peeled, and
                        cut in 1/2" dice
  1                     celery stalk -- cut in 1/2" dice
  6               cups  water or stock -- (preferably warmed
                        chicken, beef or vegetable stock)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the lentils, bay leaf, thyme, carrot and celery in a medium pot with 6 cups of the stock.  Bring to a boil, then turn the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally. 
Meanwhile, place the olive oil in a small skillet and turn the heat to medium-low.  Add the onion and cook, stirring until it softens.  Add the garlic and stir.  Cook for 1 minute more. 
When the lentils are tender -- they usually take about 30 minutes -- fish out the bay leaf and the thyme sprigs and pour the onion mixture into the soup.  (You may prepare the soup in advance up to this point.  Cover, refrigerate for up to 2 days and reheat before proceeding.) 
Add more stock if necessary; the mixture should be thick, but still quite soupy.  Season with salt and pepper and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

       Maya's Pumpkin Soup With Black Beans And Caramelized Apples

Recipe By     :Richard Sandoval
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CARAMELIZED APPLES ===
  2                     apples -- cored and peeled
     1/2         pound  butter
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        === THE SOUP ===
  4                     Sugar Pie pumpkins - (abt 5 lbs ea)
     1/2         pound  butter
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2    tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
     1/3           cup  chopped yellow onion
  2               cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  half-and- half
  1                cup  cooked black beans
  3        tablespoons  creme fraiche (not sour cream) -- for garnish

Making the Caramelized Apples:  Cut the apples into 1/2-inch slices.  Heat the butter in a saucepan over low heat until melted.  Add the sugar and cook until it melts and turns golden brown.  Add the apples and simmer for about 5 minutes, or until they are tender.  Do not overcook. 
Using a slotted spoon, transfer the apples to a sheet of waxed paper; let cool completely.  Chop the apples into 1/2-inch pieces; set aside. 
Making the Soup:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  The pumpkins can be used as soup bowls.  Slice off the top of each pumpkin 2 inches below the stem; reserve the caps.  Remove the seeds and stringy pulp from each pumpkin.  Using a spoon, scrape out the flesh of each pumpkin, being careful not to damage the shells.  Put the pumpkin flesh on a baking sheet; top with butter, cinnamon, salt and pepper.  Bake for about 1 hour and 20 minutes, until the pumpkin is tender.  Set aside. 
Heat the oil in a saute pan; add the onions and saute until translucent.  Add to the pumpkin.  Put the mixture in a blender and blend until smooth, using chicken stock to aid in blending.  Pass the puree through a fine-mesh sieve. 
Place the puree in a saucepan and heat over medium heat.  Stir in the remaining chicken stock, the heavy cream and half-and-half.  Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. 
Presentation:  Ladle the soup into the reserved pumpkin shells (or into warmed soup bowls).  Add 1/4 cup black beans and 1/2 cup caramelized apples to each.  Garnish with creme fraiche.  Note: Toasted pine nuts may be used as a garnish instead of black beans. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                   Mexican Three-Chili Pinto Bean Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  pinto beans -- sorted, washed
  2             medium  onions -- coarsely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  ground coriander
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  4             quarts  water
  4                     pasilla chiles -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and coarsely chopped
  3                     New Mexico chiles -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and coarsely chopped
  2                     canned chipotle chiles -- stemmed
  6               cups  chicken or vegetable broth - (to 7 cups) -- canned or homemade
     1/3           cup  coarsely-chopped cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     2/3           cup  crema -- for garnish
                        cilantro sprig -- for garnish

Soak beans in water to cover 24 hours, changing water at least 2 times.  Drain beans and place in 12-quart pot along with onions, garlic, cumin, coriander, oregano, cinnamon, water and chiles.  Bring to boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to moderate and simmer 1 hour until beans are tender.  Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. 
Add chicken stock and cilantro and mix well.  Using blender, puree soup in batches until smooth.  Return to pot and bring to boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to moderate and simmer 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soup is thick and aromatic. 
Season with salt and pepper.  Ladle into large bowls, drizzle each with a little crema and garnish with small sprig of cilantro.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  Serve with warm corn tortillas or Italian bread.  To easily chop the dried chiles into small pieces, use kitchen scissors instead of a knife.  Mexican crema is available at Latino markets; sour cream may be substituted.

Soak beans in water to cover 24 hours, changing water at least 2 times.  Drain beans and place in 12-quart pot along with onions, garlic, cumin, coriander, oregano, cinnamon, water and chiles.  Bring to boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to moderate and simmer 1 hour until beans are tender.  Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add chicken stock and cilantro and mix well.  Using blender, puree soup in batches until smooth.  Return to pot and bring to boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to moderate and simmer 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soup is thick and aromatic. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season with salt and pepper.  Ladle into large bowls, drizzle each with a little crema and garnish with small sprig of cilantro.  Serve immediately. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Serve with warm corn tortillas or Italian bread.  To easily chop the dried chiles into small pieces, use kitchen scissors instead of a knife.  Mexican crema is available at Latino markets; sour cream may be substituted.

                          Mexican Vegetable Stew

Recipe By     :Jeanne Lemlin, "Quick Vegetarian Pleasures"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2              large  onions -- diced
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  28            ounces  canned imported plum tomatoes -- roughly chopped,
                        with their juice
  8               cups  vegetable stock
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     carrots -- thinly sliced
  3             medium  zucchini -- cut lengthwise
                        into sixths, then into 1" chunks
  2               cups  freshly-cooked kidney beans
                        (or one 15 oz can kidney beans)
  2               cups  fresh or frozen corn kernels
                        Grated cheddar cheese -- (optional)
                        Corn chips -- (optional)

In a 6- to 8-quart pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Saute the garlic, onions and cumin 10 minutes, stirring often. 
Add the tomatoes with their juice, the vegetable stock, salt and pepper and bring to a boil.  Add the carrots and cook 15 minutes, then add the zucchini and cook 5 to 10 minutes, or until the zucchini is tender, not mushy. 
Add the kidney beans (drain and rinse if using canned beans) and corn and cook 2 minutes. 
Remove 2 cups of the stew, puree it in the blender or food processor, then return it to the pot.  This will nicely thicken the stew.  Taste to adjust the seasoning. 
If desired, sprinkle on grated cheese and break a few corn chips over each serving. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This fragrant stew, unlike most vegetable soups and stews, doesn't demand much chopping and so can be prepared quickly and easily.  Like most soups, it tastes even better when served the next day, so don't hesitate to make it in advance.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Water -- as needed
  2             pounds  lamb shoulder -- see * Note
  1 1/2         pounds  chicken pieces
  2               cups  finely-chopped cabbage
  1                cup  chopped onion
  2 1/2         pounds  potatoes -- peeled and diced
  2 1/2           cups  corn -- canned or frozen
  6        tablespoons  ketchup
  1 1/2           cups  tomato puree
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
  6        tablespoons  distilled vinegar
     1/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
  1 1/4    tablespoons  salt (or more to taste)
  1         tablespoon  ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne

* Note:  Our tester used lamb shoulder, which is more readily available than mutton.  Some cooks add dried or frozen lima beans, tomatoes and a little boiled shredded beef or wild game. 
In a large saucepan or kettle, cook lamb in water to cover until tender, about 2 hours.  Discard broth and bones.  Chop meat fine and set aside. 
Meanwhile, in large stockpot, cook chicken in 1 gallon of water until tender, about 30 minutes.  Remove chicken and set aside. 
Add cabbage, onion, potatoes, corn, ketchup and an additional 1/2 gallon of water to the chicken broth.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and cook until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. 
Meanwhile, chop chicken meat, discarding bones and skin.  When potatoes are tender, add chicken, lamb, tomato puree, lemon, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper and cayenne.  Return to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 2 hours or more, stirring occasionally from the bottom as it thickens. 
Burgoo is often served with bread, but crackers or corn bread are also good. 
This recipe yields about 1 1/2 gallons for 24 servings. 
Nutritional Analysis Per 1-cup Serving:  239 calories;  18 grams protein;  5 grams fat (percent calories from fat, 19);  31 grams carbohydrates;  48 milligrams cholesterol;  941 milligrams sodium. 
Comments:  Burgoo is to Kentucky what Brunswick stew is to Georgia -- the communal dish that used to grease the skids at political barbecues and now shows up at church picnics and the like.  The burgoo capital has to be Owensboro, an Ohio River city that specializes in mutton barbecue.  Owensboro's numerous Catholic parishes stage enormous fund-raising dinners; at St. Pius X's gathering in June 1999, they cooked 7,000 pounds of barbecue and 700 gallons of burgoo.  Most burgoo cooks in Owensboro use a recipe similar to this one from the Moonlite Bar-B-Q Inn, the city's best-known barbecue restaurant.

  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  12       tablespoons  butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
     3/4           cup  flour
  6               cups  whole milk
  2               cups  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  sherry

In a food processor, chop mushrooms very fine.  Place in a soup kettle with broth and onions.  Simmer, covered, 25 to 30 minutes. 
Meanwhile, melt butter in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat.  When bubbly, stir in flour with a whisk.  Cook and stir 3 minutes. 
While roux cooks, bring milk just to a boil.  When roux is done, add milk all at once, stirring or whisking vigorously until smooth.  Cook and stir white sauce over medium heat 5 minutes, until thickened and smooth. 
Stir in cream.  Add to broth mixture, stirring with a spoon until smooth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Add sherry and heat through. 
This recipe yields 4 quarts.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  tomatoes -- sliced
  2             medium  onions -- thinly sliced
  1              large  garlic clove - (to 3) -- minced
  2              large  zucchini -- sliced 1/4" thick
  1             medium  romaine lettuce head -- finely shredded
  10            ounces  frozen peas
  1                cup  finely-chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh basil
  10            ounces  frozen lima beans
                        (or 2 lbs fresh fava beans, shelled)
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil (to 1/2 cup) -- preferably Tuscan
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Spread tomatoes over the bottom of a 5- to 6-quart pot.  Top tomatoes with a layer of onions.  Sprinkle with garlic.  Add a layer of zucchini.  Top the zucchini with the lettuce.  Top the lettuce with the peas.  Sprinkle half the parsley and all the basil over the peas.  Add the beans.  Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup parsley over the vegetables.  Sprinkle the olive oil over everything.  Cook, covered, over low to medium heat for 20 minutes, or until vegetables start releasing their liquid.  Do not remove the cover for at least 10 minutes. 
At this point, add salt and pepper to taste, reduce heat to low, stir and mix vegetables well.  Cook, covered, over low heat for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring frequently, until vegetables are tender but not mushy; do not overcook.  Do not add water; the vegetables have enough water of their own. 
Serve hot, lukewarm or at room temperature, but do not chill.  Pass the grated cheese separately. 
This recipe yields about 3 quarts or 6 servings. 
Comments:  This soup tastes best freshly made, but it can be kept refrigerated for up to a week; reheat gently.  Do not freeze.

  2                     hens
                        Water -- as needed
  1                     rabbit
  6              large  onions -- chopped
  2 1/2         pounds  potatoes -- peeled, diced
  2             quarts  baby lima beans
  4             quarts  white corn -- see * Note 1
  4             quarts  canned tomatoes, including juice -- see * Note 2
  1              pound  butter
  1             bottle  chili sauce - (18 oz)
                        Worcestershire sauce -- to taste
                        Hot pepper sauce -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note 1:   Home frozen corn is best, but commercially frozen or canned white shoepeg corn can be used. 
* Note 2:  If using store-bought canned tomatoes, be sure to cut out and discard tough yellow cores. 
Place hens in a large stock pot.  Cover with cold water and bring to a slow boil.  Boil 1 hour.  Add rabbit (and more water if necessary), cover and boil slowly 1 hour longer.  Measure and reserve 2 quarts stock.  When hens and rabbit are cool enough to handle, skin, bone and cut meat into small pieces. 
Return meat to pot with reserved stock, onions, potatoes, beans, corn, tomatoes and butter.  Cover and cook over low heat, stirring from time to time, until thickened, about 6 hours.  Season with chili sauce, Worcestershire, hot pepper sauce, salt and pepper. 
This recipe yields 20 hearty servings.

Recipe By     :Gary Ibsen with Joan Nielsen, "The Great Tomato Book"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  ripe red tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1             medium  onion -- studded with
  10                    whole cloves
  1 1/4           cups  beef stock or water
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  2          teaspoons  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened
  1 1/2           cups  heavy whipping cream -- heated almost
                        to boiling
                        Fresh basil leaves -- julienned

In a large, deep saucepan over medium heat, cook tomatoes, onion, beef stock or water, basil, salt, pepper, nutmeg and coriander for 30 minutes.  Let cool a little, then remove and discard cloves from the onions. 
In batches, puree soup in a blender until smooth.  Return soup to the saucepan and stir in baking soda and sugar.  Blend the flour and butter together to form a smooth paste.  Stir into soup. 
Watching carefully, cook soup over a medium-low heat until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove saucepan from heat and slowly stir in warmed cream.  Return soup to heat and continue to warm it, just until it is piping hot and about to come to a boil.  (Don't let it boil, or it will curdle and truly disappoint you!)  Serve garnished with fresh basil leaves. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  3             pounds  onions -- peeled, halved
                        lengthwise, and thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6 1/2           cups  chicken stock -- homemade preferred
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine
  3        tablespoons  dry sherry
  2        tablespoons  Madeira -- (optional)
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme
  1              piece  rind from Parmesan cheese - (3")
  3               cups  stale country-style chewy bread chunks
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- for topping

In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat.  When hot, add onions, stir and cover.  Cook over medium-low heat for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft and starting to color.

Remove rind, whisk soup to incorporate bread, and serve with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                              Oven Beef Stew

Recipe By     :Allison Marx, "The Clueless Gourmet"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  boneless beef -- cubed for stew
  3        tablespoons  flour
  3             medium  onions -- sliced 1/4" thick
  6                     carrots -- sliced 1/4" thick
  4             medium  potatoes -- sliced 1/3" thick
  1 1/2           cups  red wine
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  cold water

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
Toss beef with flour.  Grease a large, deep pan or a Dutch oven.  Layer pan with 1/3 onions, 1/3 carrots, followed by 1/3 potatoes.  Layer half the meat on top of potatoes.  Repeat layering with 1/3 vegetables and the other half of the meat and then the rest of the vegetables. 
Combine wine and mustard in a small bowl.  Pour wine mixture over meat and vegetables.  Cover pan with a lid.  Bake 1 to 1 1/2 hours until tender.  Thicken gravy if necessary with cornstarch paste and boil on the stove for 1 minute until thickened. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Variations:  Use lamb instead of beef.  If you prefer lamb, use white wine and lemon juice instead of the mustard and add 2 teaspoons dried rosemary. 
Comments:  If all you find is stew meat on the bone, use at least 3 pounds.  Meat on the bone gives a terrific flavor to dishes.  It does have more flavor than meat cooked off the bone but is a bit less delicate to eat.  This is why some people prefer T-bone steaks to boneless sirloin.  The bone imparts flavor to the meat.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  stew meat (lamb or beef)
  2              small  pumpkins
                        (or 1 medium-small pumpkin)
     1/2           cup  dried prunes - (to 3/4 cup)
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste - (to 3 tbspns)
  1           teaspoon  turmeric
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2        medium  onion -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  saffron -- dissolved in
     1/4           cup  warm water -- (optional)
                        Hot cooked basmatic rice

Brown the meat and add about 1 1/2 cups water.  Add tomato paste, turmeric, cinnamon, saffron and salt and pepper and sauteed onion.  Cook covered at a simmer for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Meat should be tender and nearly falling apart.  You may need to add water during cooking but you shouldn't end up with more than the stated amount.  You don't want a watery stew. 
In the meantime, seed the pumpkin and slice into 2- by 2-inch pieces and peel.  Brown on both sides in corn oil.  The pumpkin should become brown in some places and somewhat flexible but not totally cooked.  Add to meat and cook covered an additional 20 to 30 minutes until tender but not falling apart.  A fork should go into the pumpkin easily but not break it up. 
Add the prunes the last 5 minutes of cooking.  They shouldn't really cook too much but should get warm.  Serve over hot basmatic rice. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  6             slices  bacon -- diced
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  5              large  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  4               cups  milk
  4               cups  chicken stock

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  boneless veal shoulder -- cut in 2" pieces
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus more
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     onions -- peeled, quartered
  6                     plum tomatoes -- halved
     1/2         pound  shiitake mushrooms
  1                     celery stalk -- finely chopped
  2                     leeks -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1              quart  chicken stock
  1             bottle  dry white wine
  1                     bay leaf
  1              bunch  fresh thyme -- divided
  1              bunch  carrots -- cut in 2" pieces,
                        and steamed until tender

Preheat the oven at 450 degrees.  Trim off any fat from the meat and toss it in a bowl with the oil until fully coated.  Sprinkle it with salt and pepper and spread the meat on a rimmed baking sheet.  Roast it for 10 minutes, turning once or twice, until the meat is golden brown at the edges.  Remove it from the oven. 
In a roasting pan combine the onions, tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms.  Drizzle them with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast them for 45 minutes, or until the onions are golden at the tips and the tomatoes have collapsed.  Remove them from the oven and let them sit until they are cool enough to handle. 
Turn the oven temperature down to 350 degrees.  Use tongs to pull the skins off the tomatoes; leave the tomatoes in halves.  Coarsely chop the mushrooms.  Leave the onions in quarters. 
Heat enough oil to film the bottom of a large burner-safe casserole dish.  Add the celery and leeks and cook over low heat, stirring often, for 8 minutes or until the leeks are softened.  Add the flour and stir thoroughly over low heat for 3 minutes or until the flour begins to brown at the edges.  Add the stock and wine gradually, stirring.  Cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until the liquids come to a boil and thicken slightly. 
Scrape the contents of the veal pan into the casserole dish.  Add all the vegetables and any liquid that accumulated in the pan, the bay leaf and half the thyme sprigs with stems.  Bring to a boil and transfer the pan to the oven.  Set the cover on askew.  Cook the stew for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until the meat is very tender, turning it in the liquid several times. 
Use tongs to remove the thyme and bay leaf from the liquid.  Use a slotted spoon to lift the meat and vegetables from the pan and transfer them to a bowl.  (If making in advance, use a plastic container for the meat and vegetables; cover and refrigerate overnight.)  Leave the liquid in the casserole.  (If making in advance, tip the liquid into a separate plastic container; cover and refrigerate.)  Bring the cooking liquid to a boil and let it simmer for 20 minutes or until it reduces and thickens slightly. 
Meanwhile, remove the thyme leaves from the remaining sprigs and chop the leaves.  Season the stew to taste with salt and pepper.  Return the meat to the liquid, add the carrots and thyme.  Let the liquid come to a boil and simmer 2 minutes.  Serve at once. 
This recipe yields 10 servings.

  6                     garlic cloves -- unpeeled, and
                        left whole
  2                     leeks including 1" of the green -- sliced lengthwise,
                        and rinsed well
  4              large  carrots -- unpeeled, halved
  1                     parsnip -- peeled, halved
  1              small  turnip -- peeled, quartered
  1                     fennel bulb -- trimmed, quartered
     1/2         pound  button mushrooms -- wiped, left whole
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  water or dry white wine -- plus
  2             quarts  water
  1            handful  parsley sprigs - (abt 1 oz)
     1/2         pound  cabbage -- coarsely chopped
                        (about half of a medium head)
  1                     bay leaf
  1 1/2      teaspoons  black peppercorns
     1/4      teaspoon  dried savory
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or more to taste

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
Place the onion, garlic, leeks, carrots, parsnips, turnip, fennel and mushrooms in a large roasting pan and drizzle with the olive oil.  Roast the vegetables, stirring two or three times, until browned, about 45 minutes.  Transfer them to a large stockpot.  Deglaze the roasting pan with 1 cup of water or wine, scraping up all the browned bits clinging to the pan.  Pour this liquid into the pot with the vegetables. 
Add the 2 quarts water, the parsley, cabbage, bay leaf, peppercorns and savory.  Bring to a boil, then simmer the stock for 1 1/2 hours. 
Strain the stock, pressing down the vegetables.  Season to taste with salt. 
This recipe yields 2 quarts. 
Comments:  You can vary the vegetables depending on what you have on hand.  If you want a pale stock for another recipe, peel the onion first; leaving the skin on produces a mahogany-colored broth.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil

  1                     leek, white part only -- sliced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  curry powder
  2               cans  reduced-sodium chicken broth -- (14 1/2 oz ea)
  1                can  pumpkin - (29 oz)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
                        salt -- to taste

In 3-quart saucepan, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onions, leek and curry powder.  Cook for 10 minutes, being careful not to brown.  Add chicken broth and pumpkin puree.  Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes.

Bring to boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is thoroughly absorbed and seeds begin to brown, being careful not to burn.  (Caution:  Toward end of cooking, hot seeds may pop out of pan.)  Transfer to foil in single layer; cool. 
To serve, ladle soup into bowls and garnish with a generous tablespoon of glazed pumpkin seeds, a dollop of whipped cream and chervil leaves.

                              Split-Pea Soup

Recipe By     :Christopher Kimball
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  thick-cut smoked bacon
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2             medium  onions -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  3                     bay leaves
  2 1/2         quarts  low-sodium chicken stock
                        (or 1 1/2 quarts regular canned
                        chicken stock plus 1 cup water
  1                     smoked ham hock - (abt 1 lb) -- see * Note
  1              pound  dried split peas
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Although this is an easy, straightforward recipe, be sure to use the ham hock or ham bone.  I have tested this soup without it and find that without the bone and the meat, it is not really worth making.  If you cannot find a smoked ham hock (usually found in the freezer section) and you do not have any cooked ham available, use bone-in smoked ham.  (If you want a really meaty soup, use 2 pounds instead of 1.) 
Cook the bacon in 6-quart stock pot or Dutch oven and drain on paper towels.  Remove all but 1 tablespoon of bacon fat and then add the olive oil and butter.  Over medium heat, cook until foam subsides and then add the onion and cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently for 15 to 20 minutes until onions are dark brown and have caramelized. 
Add the garlic, celery and carrots and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes or until carrots have softened.  Add the remaining ingredients except the salt and pepper and bring to a simmer over high heat.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer gently for about 1 1/2 hours, until peas fall apart and soup is thick. 
Remove and discard the bay leaf.  Remove the ham bones, trim off any meat, and return the meat to the pot, discarding the bones.  Whisk soup until smooth.  Taste and adjust seasonings.  (The ham is salty and therefore it is unlikely you will need to add salt.)  Crumble bacon and sprinkle on individual servings. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  3               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  buttermilk

* Note:  To make bouquet garni, combine in cheesecloth 2 thyme sprigs, 2 marjoram sprigs, 3 parsley sprigs, 1 bay leaf, 5 whole allspice, 10 whole white peppercorns, 10 whole black peppercorns and 12 fennel seeds. 
To make court bouillon:  In stockpot over moderate heat, sweat onions, carrots, celery, leeks and garlic in grapeseed oil until tender.  Add bouquet garni and white wine.  Fill pot with cold water until vegetables are just barely covered.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Crown top with a little cold water.  Reduce heat to a simmer.  Simmer for 2 hours.  Pour through fine strainer.  Discard vegetables.  (Makes 2 1/2 gallons) 
To make soup:  Roast pumpkin flesh-side down in 325 degree oven until tender.  Scoop out meat.  Discard shells. 
In large nonreactive stockpot, saute onions and garlic.  Add brown sugar.  Cook for 5 minutes.  Deglaze pot with cognac.  Add cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, bay leaf and pumpkin meat.  Cook for 5 minutes.  Add court bouillon and cream.  Simmer for 20 minutes.  Remove bay leaf.  Add salt and pepper.  Puree soup until smooth. 
To make creme fraiche:  In nonreactive container, combine cream and buttermilk.  Allow to stand at room temperature for 72 hours, or until thickened.  (Makes 2 pints) 
To make vanilla creme fraiche:  Split vanilla bean.  Scrape out seeds.  Add vanilla seeds to creme fraiche.  Mix well. 
To fry leeks:  Wash leeks, removing all grit.  Slice white and pale green parts very thinly.  Dry slices thoroughly.  Warm 2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil in saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add leek slices.  Saute, tossing, until crispy. 
To serve:  Garnish each 6-ounce serving of soup with 1 teaspoon vanilla creme fraiche, 1 teaspoon fried leeks and 1 teaspoon hazelnuts. 
This recipe yields 1 gallon, about 16 servings.

                          Super Bowl Sunday Stew

Recipe By     :Bernard Clayton Jr., "The Complete Book of Soups and Stews"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  beef stew meat -- cut 1" cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  butter
  30            ounces  tomato juice
  30            ounces  canned tomatoes -- chopped coarsely
  5                     celery stalks with leaves -- chopped small
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut in thin rounds or quarters
  2                     onions -- peeled, sliced thin
  3                     garlic cloves -- pressed or chopped
  1                     potato -- peeled, and
                        cut into small chunks
  10            ounces  frozen cut okra
  3        tablespoons  barley - (to 4 tbspns)
  3                     beef bouillon cubes
  16            ounces  canned corn
                        (or 10 oz frozen corn)
  3        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  2          teaspoons  salt -- (optional)
  6                     parsley stalks - (to 8) -- finely chopped
                        Water -- as needed
  1              pinch  cayenne -- (optional)
                        === SACHET D' EPICE ===
  12                    black peppercorns
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme

Season the meat well with salt and pepper.  In a 4 1/2-quart stew pot saute the meat pieces in butter over medium-high heat until they are browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.  (At this point you may switch to a 5- to 6-quart crockpot to finish cooking the dish.) 
The rest of the ingredients, plus the sachet, are added one by one.  The block of frozen okra can be added as is, for it will quickly thaw in the warming liquid.  As the stew cooks through the day, water may be added, depending on how thick you want your stew to be.  I usually add about 4 cups for a thick stew. 
Bring the stew to a boil, lower heat and simmer, partially covered, for at least 6 hours. 
Stir the stew frequently during the day.  Near the end of the cooking, taste for seasoning.  A partial teaspoon of cayenne will give it a hotter bite, but don't overload.  It is not meant to be a hot dish, just well seasoned. 
Serve from the stew pot into heated bowls.  A coarse French peasant bread, served in big chunks and with lots of butter, goes well with this. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Mollie Katzen, "Honest Pretzels"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3          teaspoons  finely-minced garlic
  6             slices  French or Italian or sourdough bread -- (to 8 slices)
  1                cup  finely-minced onion
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz) -- with liquid
  1                cup  milk
                        Fresh dill sprig -- (optional)
                        Fresh basil leaves -- (optional)

Tools needed:  Liquid measuring cup, small bowl, small knife, cutting board, measuring spoons and cups, oil brush, bread knife, baking tray, medium-size saucepan, wooden spoon, can opener, blender or food processor, ladle, bowls, spoons, scissors. 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 
Measure 1/3 cup olive oil, and pour it into a bowl.  Add 1 teaspoon of the garlic to the oil, and stir it in.  Paint both sides of each slice of bread with the garlic oil.  Put the bread on a cutting board.  Cut the bread into cubes, and put them on a baking tray.  Put the tray in the oven and bake for 5 to 10 minutes, until the cubes are crunchy.  Put aside. 
Put 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium-size saucepan, and then put the pan on the stove and heat to medium.  Wait for 30 seconds.  Put onion, 2 teaspoons garlic and salt in the pan.  Cook and stir the onions and garlic for 10 minutes. 
Open the can of tomatoes.  Put the tomatoes and all of their liquid into a blender or food processor.  Add the cooked onions and garlic, and puree until smooth.  Pour the pureed mixture back into the saucepan.  Put the saucepan on the stove again, and turn the heat to medium. 
When the soup is hot, slowly pour in milk.  Heat for just a few minutes.  Don't let it boil.  Ladle the soup into serving bowls.  If you like, snip tiny bits of fresh dill or basil with scissors right over the bowls of soup.  Pass the croutons around the table so people can take some and float them in their bowls of soup. 
This recipe yields 4 to 5 servings.

                          Winter Vegetable Stew

Recipe By     :Darra Goldstein, "The Winter Vegetarian: A Warm and Versatile Bounty"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  onion -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, minced
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4         pound  brussels sprouts -- trimmed, and
                        blanched for 1 minute in boiling water
     1/2         pound  cauliflower florets -- blanched for 1
                        minute in boiling water
  1                     sweet potato -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/2" thick, then cut 1/4" sticks
  1              large  red potato -- scrubbed, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  2              large  carrots -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/2" thick
     1/2         pound  celery root -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
     1/2                acorn squash -- peeled, seeded, and
                        sliced 1/4" thick, each slice halved
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger root
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
                        Generous pinch of dried savory
  1              quart  Roasted Vegetable Broth -- (see recipe),
                        or other vegetable stock
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

In a large stockpot saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil until soft, 10 to 12 minutes.  Add the remaining vegetables, the seasonings, and the vegetable broth, mixing well.  Bring the stew to a boil and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. 
Make beurre manie by mixing the butter and flour together with your fingers.  Stir bits of this mixture into the stew and cook for about 3 minutes more, until the broth has thickened slightly.  Serve hot. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 
Comments:  The rich flavor of this Winter Vegetable Stew suggests that it has cooked for hours -- but 20 minutes of simmering is all that is needed. 
Serve it piping hot in shallow soup bowls, suggests award-winning cookbook author Darra Goldstein, who has included the recipe in "The Winter Vegetarian: A Warm and Versatile Bounty" (Harper, $16 paperback).  The book was originally published in hardcover in 1996 as "The Vegetarian Hearth." 
Goldstein's text is full of background for her hearty recipes: tales of her travels in Russia, descriptions of winter folk festivals in northern cultures, essays on buckwheat and rutabaga.  Goldstein is professor of Russian at Williams College, Williamstown, MA. 
The recipes include appetizers, nourishing soups, egg and cheese dishes, breakfast favorites, sweet and savory breads and comforting desserts. 
In making the Winter Vegetable Stew, you can use any vegetable stock, but if you have time you can make your own Roasted Vegetable Broth with the recipe Goldstein also includes.

  1                     turkey carcass -- plus any scraps
                        of meat or leftover skin
  3              large  potatoes -- peeled, diced
