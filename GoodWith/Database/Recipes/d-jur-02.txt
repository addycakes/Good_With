  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
                        === FOR THE STIR-FRY ===
  1              pound  broccoli -- rinsed, stems removed,

  1             recipe  Vanilla Sables -- (see recipe)
  1             recipe  Chocolate Sables -- (see recipe)

Make Vanilla and Chocolate Sable doughs and chill at least 1 hour.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees. 
Roll out each dough to an even 1-inch thickness about twice as long as wide.  Using a ruler and a sharp knife, cut out a 3- by 6-inch rectangle from each piece of dough.  (Gather excess dough and set aside to make other cookies.) 
Cut rectangles lengthwise in thirds to make 3 bars.  Stack dough in 2 layers, alternating chocolate and vanilla doughs, to form a checkerboard pattern.  Press and pat gently to make dough stick together.  Slice cookies 1/4- to 1/3-inch thick and carefully transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet using a spatula.  (Note: make sure to keep edges of dough straight with a ruler and measure carefully.)  Repeat with remaining dough or shape excess into different shapes. 
Bake 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove to a rack to cool. 
This recipe yields about ?? dozen.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  low-fat 2% small curd cottage cheese
  8             ounces  "1/3 Less Fat than Cream Cheese"
                        Neufchatel Cheese
                        (Kraft in the box is good - don't buy the
                        kind in the tub)
  3                     eggs
  1                cup  sugarn -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2      teaspoons  strained lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  unsweetened Dutch Processed cocoa
     1/4      teaspoon  instant coffee or espresso powder -- see * Note
  3        tablespoons  graham cracker or Zwieback crumbs or
                        crushed chocolate cookies - (to 4 tbspns)

* Note:  Alice uses Medaglio D'Oro or Cafe Salvador Brand expresso. 
Position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Place a round of parchment paper in the bottom of the cake pan, and spray sides of pan with vegetable oil spray.  Put water kettle on to boil. 
Process the cottage cheese in a food processor for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes or until silk smooth, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl once or twice as necessary.  Set aside. 
In a small microwave safe bowl, soften the Neufchatel cheese in microwave on high for about 30 seconds.  Or, warm gently in the top of a double boiler.  Stir until smooth.  Scrape into the processor.  Add the eggs, 1 cup of the sugar, vanilla, lemon juice, and salt.  Pulse until incorporated and perfectly smooth.  Do not over process. 
In a small bowl, whisk cocoa, coffee powder, and the remaining tablespoon of sugar with 3 tablespoons water, until smooth.  Stir one cup of the cheesecake batter into chocolate mixture.  Set aside. 
Pour the plain batter into the prepared pan.  Pour the chocolate batter in a wide ring leaving a bull's eye of plain batter showing in the center and a border of plain batter around the edges.  Using a table knife or teaspoon, use circular strokes to marble the batters until nicely but not too completely mingled. 
Slide oven rack part way out.  Place cheesecake pan in baking dish or skillet and set on oven rack.  Carefully pour boiling water around the pan to a depth of about 1 inch.  Slide oven rack in gently to avoid sloshing.  Bake until cheesecake has puffed and risen slightly and is just beginning to shrink from the edges of the pan, about 40 to 45 minutes.  Remove cheesecake from water bath and cool on a rack.  When completely cool, cover and chill for at least 12 hours or up to 2 days before serving. 
To unmold and serve:  Cover the pan with tightly stretched plastic wrap.  Place a flat dish on top of plastic.  Invert pan and dish and rap pan gently until cheesecake is released from pan.  Remove pan and peel parchment liner from bottom of cake.  Place cake circle or serving plate on the cake and carefully invert so that cake is right-side up.  Remove plastic wrap.  Press crumbs around sides of cake.  Cut with a sharp thin knife.  Dip the knife in hot water and wipe it dry between cuts. 
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings. 
Tips: The suave texture of this cheesecake relies on ultra smooth cottage cheese.  This requires a food processor and at least 2 1/2 to 3 minutes of processing, no cheating. 
Once the Neufchatel Cheese has been added, pulse only enough to incorporate.  Overprocessing thins the batter. 
If you use nonfat cottage cheese instead of lowfat, the results will not be nearly as good and you would save only about .4 grams of fat per serving.  It's not worth it.

Recipe title translation:  Sausage of Chicken Liver and Other Parts with a Lemon-Cream Sauce with Potatoes and Artichokes. 
For the artichokes, cut the leaves and just keep the bottom.  Remove the beard from inside with a spoon and place in water and lemon juice.  Cut the bottom into thin slices.  In a skillet heat olive oil.  Add garlic and salt and pepper and saute for 5 minutes.  Set aside and keep warm. 
To prepare potatoes, in an oiled pan, place the sliced potatoes in a circle to form a galette in a non stick pan.  Brown on both sides until nice and golden.  Keep warm. 
To Prepare the sausage, blanch the duck testicles in salted boiling water for 2 minutes.  Remove them and place on a towel to dry.  Cut into slices, 1/8-inch thick. 
Meanwhile, cook the cocks comb in salted water until tender, about 2 hours.  Drain them and dry thoroughly.  Cut the cocks comb into thin strips and place in a bowl.  Add chicken kidneys, chicken livers, rosemary, sage and mix together.  Place mixture inside the duck neck skin to form a sausage.  With kitchen twine, sew the ends together so that the meat doesn't escape during cooking. 
In a skillet heat butter and onions.  Cook until the onions are translucent.  Add the sausage and cook very gently for 10 minutes.  During the cooking, add the chicken consume and hot pepper.  Remove sausage and set aside.  In a bowl mix together egg yolk and lemon juice and add to the skillet.  Mix in very quickly and make sure it doesn't boil again or the sauce will curdle. 
To Serve:  Divide the artichokes and place on the bottom of 6 serving dishes.  Cover with the potato and place a slice of sausage on top of it.  Sprinkle with sauce. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

    Crispy Sushi With Steamed Clams, Wasabi And Fermented Black Beans

Recipe By     :Norman Van Aken

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRISPY SUSHI ===
  1 1/2           cups  various vegetables --short julienne

                        Peanut or canola oil -- to fry lumpias
                        === CLAMS ===
  12                    clams -- scrubbed
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        === FERMENTED BLACK BEANS ===
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  mirin (rice wine)
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  peeled, finely-chopped ginger
  1         tablespoon  peeled, finely-minced garlic
  1                     jalapeÒo -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and finely minced
  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  fermented black beans -- soaked in cool water,
                        rinsed and drained
  2                     scallions, green and white parts -- cleaned, and
                        sliced into small rings
  2        tablespoons  cold butter -- cut small dice
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
                        Wasabi -- as desired
                        === GINGER-SOY VINAIGRETTE ===
  1                cup  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  dark roasted sesame oil
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped cilantro leaves
  3        tablespoons  peeled, minced ginger
  3        tablespoons  peeled, minced garlic
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
                        Cracked black pepper -- to taste

Ginger-Soy Vinaigrette to dress the Asian vegetables:  Combine all of the ingredients together and keep at room temperature if preparing the dish directly.  Otherwise refrigerate until almost ready to cook.  Any extra vinaigrette can be stored cold for a week or so. 
Crispy sushi:  Saute the vegetables in a very hot wok or saute pan.  When they are almost cooked add enough of the ginger-soy vinaigrette just to coat them.  Cool in a strainer so as to let all of the excess wetness not create a wetness problem for the wrapper. 
Now lay out one lumpia wrapper at a time.  Center the vegetables and a strip of the tuna on the lower third of each wrapper.  Roll them up until almost closed folding in the sides as you do.  Seal with the water by rubbing the lumpia's edges with your water moistened fingers. 
These can be prepared ahead by as much as a full day and kept refrigerated covered with plenty of plastic wrap to keep the wrappers from drying out. 
Clams:  Place the clams in a small saucepan with a lid.  Add the white wine and steam them open on medium-high heat until the clams open.  Remove from the heat and set aside, keeping them warm. 
Fermented black beans:  Combine the white wine, mirin, rice wine vinegar, ginger, garlic and jalapeÒo in a small saucepan on high heat and reduce by half, (about 3 minutes). 
Add the chicken stock and reduce the mixture to about 1/2 cup, (about 15 minutes).  Add the scallions and the fermented black beans and cook until just a little bit of liquid remains.  Whisk in the butter and keep warm.  (Yields about 3/4 cup) 
For the dish:  Heat four bowls until very warm. 
Place enough oil in a fryer or large pan to fry the stuffed lumpia.  Bring the oil to 350 degrees and fry them until crisp.  (You may do this in batches keeping them warm).  Drain on paper toweling. 
Cut a tiny amount of the end of each of the lumpia wrappers off.  (This is just excess dough and it will allow the lumpia to stand upright).  Cut them in half on a strong 45 degree bias angle.  Now stand them up and place them in the center of the bowls. 
Place 3 of the warm clams in each of the four bowls.  Now spoon the fermented black bean mixture into the bowls.  Place the wasabi on the rims of the dish as desired.  Serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments: The dish may be garnished with lime wedges, cilantro leaves and/or dots of salsa Sriracha, (a very red Oriental hot sauce).

Ginger-Soy Vinaigrette to dress the Asian vegetables:  Combine all of the ingredients together and keep at room temperature if preparing the dish directly.  Otherwise refrigerate until almost ready to cook.  Any extra vinaigrette can be stored cold for a week or so. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Crispy sushi:  Saute the vegetables in a very hot wok or saute pan.  When they are almost cooked add enough of the ginger-soy vinaigrette just to coat them.  Cool in a strainer so as to let all of the excess wetness not create a wetness problem for the wrapper. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Now lay out one lumpia wrapper at a time.  Center the vegetables and a strip of the tuna on the lower third of each wrapper.  Roll them up until almost closed folding in the sides as you do.  Seal with the water by rubbing the lumpia&apos;s edges with your water moistened fingers. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
These can be prepared ahead by as much as a full day and kept refrigerated covered with plenty of plastic wrap to keep the wrappers from drying out. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Clams:  Place the clams in a small saucepan with a lid.  Add the white wine and steam them open on medium-high heat until the clams open.  Remove from the heat and set aside, keeping them warm. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fermented black beans:  Combine the white wine, mirin, rice wine vinegar, ginger, garlic and jalapeÒo in a small saucepan on high heat and reduce by half, (about 3 minutes). 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the chicken stock and reduce the mixture to about 1/2 cup, (about 15 minutes).  Add the scallions and the fermented black beans and cook until just a little bit of liquid remains.  Whisk in the butter and keep warm.  (Yields about 3/4 cup) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the dish:  Heat four bowls until very warm. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place enough oil in a fryer or large pan to fry the stuffed lumpia.  Bring the oil to 350 degrees and fry them until crisp.  (You may do this in batches keeping them warm).  Drain on paper toweling. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut a tiny amount of the end of each of the lumpia wrappers off.  (This is just excess dough and it will allow the lumpia to stand upright).  Cut them in half on a strong 45 degree bias angle.  Now stand them up and place them in the center of the bowls. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 3 of the warm clams in each of the four bowls.  Now spoon the fermented black bean mixture into the bowls.  Place the wasabi on the rims of the dish as desired.  Serve. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments: The dish may be garnished with lime wedges, cilantro leaves and/or dots of salsa Sriracha, (a very red Oriental hot sauce).

  1                     eggplant -- peeled, and
                        cut in medium dice
  12            ounces  sweet Italian sausage
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced

  1           teaspoon  minced fresh peeled ginger
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
  1          teaspoons  chopped capers
  1                cup  chopped fresh or canned tomatoes
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1                cup  orange juice
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes - (to 1/2 tspn)
  1           teaspoon  honey
     1/4           cup  water - (to 1 cup)
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped scallions

Place a large non-stick pan over a medium heat and when it is hot, add the eggplant.  Cook until the eggplant is golden brown on all sides, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove the eggplant and set it aside. 
Reheat the pan, add the sausage and cook over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 7 minutes.  Discard the fat.  When the sausage is cool enough to handle, roughly chop it. 
Reheat the pan and add the oil.  Add the garlic and onion and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the reserved sausage, raisins, ginger root, capers, tomatoes, salt, orange juice, curry powder, pepper flakes, honey, reserved eggplant and 1/4 cup water, stirring well after each addition.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the eggplant is soft and the mixture is chunky and saucey, adding more water if necessary, or about 30 minutes. 
Remove the pan from the heat and add the vinegar, basil, cilantro, parsley, rosemary and scallions.  Serve at room temperature. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  oil - (to 1/2 cup) -- for cooking
  1              large  eggplant -- cut into 1/4" slices,
                        and salted
  1              large  egg - (to 2) -- beaten
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  My Marinara -- (see recipe)
     3/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2           cup  diced mozzarella cheese

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Using about 2 tablespoons of the oil, grease a baking dish.  Heat the remainder of the oil in a frying pan. 
Dip the eggplant slices in the beaten egg and then coat them on both sides with the flour.  Fry the slices until they are brown.  Place the cooked slices on paper towels to absorb any excess oil. 
In the baking dish, place a layer of eggplant slices, about 1/4 cup of My Marinara, half of the Parmesan, and 1/4 cup of the mozzarella.  Cover with another 1/4 cup of the sauce, another layer of eggplant, and top it off with the remaining cheese and sauce.  (I usually only make 2 layers.) 
Bake about 40 minutes.  It's great either hot or cold. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
    1/16      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1                     egg white
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/3           cup  heavy whipping cream
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/3           cup  light sour cream

Make Safe Meringue:  Bring 1-inch of water to a simmer in a large skillet.  Combine cream of tartar and 1 teaspoon of water in a 4 to 6 cup stainless bowl.  Whisk in the egg white and sugar.  Place thermometer near stove in a mug of very hot tap water.  Set bowl in skillet.  Stir mixture briskly and constantly with a rubber spatula, scraping the sides and bottom often to avoid scrambling the egg white. 
After 45 seconds, remove bowl from skillet.  Quickly insert thermometer, tilting bowl to cover stem by at least 2 inches.  If less than 160 degrees, rinse thermometer in skillet water and return it to mug.  Replace bowl in skillet.  Stir as before until temperature reaches 160 degrees when bowl is removed.  Beat on high speed until cool and stiff.  Set aside. 
Beat cream with vanilla until soft peaks form, not too stiff.  Fold meringue into whipped cream and light sour cream.  Cover and chill until needed.  May be refrigerated up to 8 hours. 
This recipe yields 2 cups.

                      Fallen Chocolate Souffle Cake

Recipe By     :Alice Medrich
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  blanched almonds
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped fine
     1/2           cup  unsweetened Dutch Process cocoa powder
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  boiling water
  2                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  brandy
  4                     egg whites -- room temperature
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar - (scant)
  2          teaspoons  powdered sugar - (to 3 tspns)

Position oven rack in the bottom third of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Place a round of parchment paper in the bottom of the pan (unless you plan to serve the cake directly from the bottom of the pan) and spray the sides with vegetable oil spray. 
In a food processor or blender, pulverize almonds with flour until very fine.  Set aside. 
In a large mixing bowl, combine chopped chocolate, cocoa, and 3/4 cup sugar.  Pour in boiling water and whisk until mixture is smooth and chocolate is completely melted.  Whisk in egg yolks and brandy.  Set aside. 
Combine egg whites with cream of tartar in a medium mixing bowl.  Beat on medium speed until soft peaks form.  Gradually sprinkle in remaining sugar and beat on high speed until stiff but not dry.  Whisk the flour and almonds into chocolate mixture.  Fold about one quarter of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it.  Fold in the remaining egg whites.  Scrape batter into prepared pan; level the top if necessary. 
Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until toothpick or wooden skewer plunged into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs clinging to it.  Cool in the pan, on a wire rack.  Torte will sink like a souffle; top will be uneven. 
Taking care not to break the edges of the torte, slide a small knife between the tort and the pan and run it around the pan to release the cake completely.  Invert cake and remove pan and paper liner.  Turn right-side up on cardboard circle or platter.  Or, simply serve on the bottom of the springform pan. 
Torte may be completed to this point and stored, wrapped airtight one day in advance of serving.  Or, freeze up to two months.  To serve, sieve powdered sugar over the top. 
This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PEARS ===
  4        tablespoons  sugar
                        Juice from 1 lemon
  2             quarts  cold water
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh ginger
     1/2           cup  white wine
  4              small  pears -- peeled
  3             sheets  phyllo pastry
  2        tablespoons  melted butter
  4                     vanilla beans -- soaked in cold
                        water to soften
                        === LINGONBERRY BROTH ===
  2               cups  lingonberries
  1                     cinnamon stick
  2                     cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
                        Zest from 1 orange
  2               cups  water

For the Pears:  Combine first 6 ingredients in a large saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Add pears and reduce heat to a simmer until pears are soft (approximately 10 to 15 minutes). 
Remove from heat, reserve pears and discard poaching liquid.  Pat pears dry with kitchen towel. 
Spread the phyllo sheets out on top of each other on a cutting board or other smooth surface and cut into 4 squares with a chef's knife. 
Dab sheets with melted butter and place pear on each section.  Draw phyllo up around fruit and tie 1-inch from top with a vanilla bean. 
Place pears on a baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.  Bake in a 400 degree oven until golden brown, approximately 10 to 12 minutes. 
Lingonberry Broth:  Combine all ingredients in a large saucepan over low heat.  Heat through without bringing to a boil. 
Arrange pears in a large bowl and pour lingonberry broth over the pears.  If desired, serve with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRAVLAX ===
     1/2           cup  salt
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cracked white peppercorns
  2                     fresh skin-on salmon fillets - (3 lbs ea)
  3            bunches  fresh dill
                        === MUSTARD SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  sweet mustard
  1           teaspoon  French mustard
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  salad oil
     1/2           cup  chopped dill

Gravlax:  Mix salt, sugar and white peppercorn.  Rub a handful of the salt mixture on both sides of the salmon fillets.  Place the salmon fillet in a shallow dish, and sprinkle with remaining salt mixture. 
Cover the salmon with dill, and let stand for six hours at room temperature.  Refrigerate for 24 to 30 hours. 
Mustard Sauce:  Combine the mustard, sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper in a large bowl.  Whisk vegetable oil into the mixture by drizzling oil in a very slow, steady stream, until thick consistency is formed.  (A food processor may also be used).  Refrigerate overnight. 
To serve:  Remove the skin from the salmon and reserve.  Slice the fillets lengthwise very thinly and arrange on a serving platter. 
Cut the reserved skin in 1/2-inch wide pieces and blacken in a very hot cast-iron skillet for approximately 20 seconds. 
Arrange fillets on platter and garnish with lemon, dill and salmon skin pieces before serving. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

         Grilled Bananas With Chocolate Sauce And Coconut Sorbet

Recipe By     :Nora Pouillon
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     bananas -- unpeeled
  6             ounces  good-quality semi-sweet chocolate
  6        tablespoons  milk or heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  Kahlua or other chocolate liqueur -- (optional)
                        Tropical fruit or exotic flavored sorbet
                        or frozen yogurt
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- for garnish

To make the chocolate sauce, put the chocolate, milk or cream, and Kahlua in the top of a double boiler and place over simmering water to melt the chocolate.  Stir to combine.  Sauce will thicken as it cools.  Put the unpeeled bananas under the broiler or on a grill.  Broil or grill until the skins turn jet black and become blistery.  Cut off the stem and the bottom and then peel off the skin.  You want to serve the banana warm off the grill. 
Put the warm bananas on each of four dinner plates.  You can serve the banana whole or cut it into slices.  Serve with a scoop of sorbet or frozen yogurt.  I like coconut sorbet or ginger ice cream.  Drizzle the chocolate sauce over the warm banana.  Garnish each plate with a mint sprig. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TWICE BAKED CHESTNUT POTATOES ===
  4              large  Idaho baking potatoes
  1              pound  chestnuts
  2             sprigs  thyme
  3               cups  milk
  1                     egg yolk
  1               dash  salt
  1               dash  pepper
  3        tablespoons  chopped parsley
                        === VENISON CHOPS ===
  4                     venison rib chops
  1                cup  canola oil
  2                     all-spice seeds
  1         tablespoon  aquavit or gin
                        Arctic Berry Chutney -- (see recipe)

Twice baked Chestnut Potatoes:  Scrub the potatoes and pat dry.  Prick the skins several times with a fork.  Bake the potatoes for 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven. 
Slice chestnuts with a very sharp knife approximately 1/4-inch and place on a roasting pan.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes (may be prepared up to one day in advance). 
Peel the chestnuts husks carefully away from the meat.  Combine meats with thyme sprigs and milk in a large saucepan.  Simmer for 8 minutes.  Remove thyme, strain chestnuts and reserve. 
Cut baked potatoes in half lengthwise.  Scrape out the inside of each potato, leaving approximately 1/4-inch thickness around skin and reserve. 
Mash hollowed potato and chestnuts gently with a masher until chunky smooth.  Fold in egg yolk and parsley and add salt and pepper to taste. 
Place filled shells on an ungreased cookie sheet and fill with potato mixture.  Bake uncovered in a 350 degree oven until golden brown (approximately 8 minutes). 
For the Venison Chops:  In a deep bowl, marinate venison chops for 24 hours in a marinade of canola oil, allspice and aquavit or gin. 
Remove chops from marinade.  Heat grilling pan or cast-iron or other heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat until very hot.  Place chops in pan and sear each side for approximately 5 minutes. 
To serve:  Spoon several tablespoons of the Arctic Berry Chutney on a plate and place grilled venison chop on top.  Serve with Twice Baked Chestnut Potatoes 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CHILE JELLY ===
  2                     ancho chilies -- stems, seeds discarded
  2                     chipotle chilies -- stems, seeds discarded
  6        tablespoons  red currant jelly
  6        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  Spanish sherry wine vinegar
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  4                     ripe bananas
  2 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  Chile Jelly
  3        tablespoons  Myers dark rum
  4             scoops  premium vanilla ice cream
                        (or other favorite ice cream)
                        Your favorite chocolate sauce -- as desired

For the chile jelly:  Toast the chilies in a dry skillet until they are very warm and fragrant.  Put them in a saucepan with 1 quart of water and simmer on medium heat until the water is almost completely evaporated.  Add the currant jelly, honey and vinegar.  Bring to a boil.  Now remove from the heat and process in a food processor thoroughly.  Remove to a clean bowl and cool. 
Comment:  This will make more Chile Jelly than needed for this one recipe but it can be made weeks in advance and held in the refrigerator.  Also, it is a good glaze for finishing a grilled chicken or baked ham. 
For the dish:  Peel the bananas and cut them into 1/4-inch thick slices.  Heat a skillet to moderately hot.  Place the bananas in the skillet with the butter and brown sugar.  When the butter is melted add the chile jelly.  Toss the bananas around to coat them.  Now add the rum to pan and carefully deglaze. 
Place a scoop of ice cream onto the center of 4 bowls.  Arrange the bananas around the ice cream.  Drizzle with the chocolate sauce.  Serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped fine
  1              whole  egg
  1                     egg -- separated
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                     egg white
     1/8      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/2           cup  unsweetened Dutch Process Cocoa -- plus
     1/2    tablespoon  unsweetened Dutch Process Cocoa
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  sugar -- plus
     1/4           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  low-fat milk
  1 1/4            cup  (or more) Raspberry Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Enlightened Creme Fraiche -- (see recipe)

Position the rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Line the bottom of 8-inch round cake pan with a round of parchment paper and grease pan sides with vegetable oil or butter.  Put a kettle of water on to boil. 
Place the chocolate in a large mixing bowl.  Combine 1 whole egg and 1 yolk in a small bowl with vanilla.  Place the 2 egg whites in a medium bowl with cream of tartar.  Set all 3 bowls aside. 
Combine the cocoa, flour and 2/3 cup sugar in a 1 to 1 1/2 quart heavy-bottomed saucepan.  Whisk in enough of the milk to form a smooth paste.  Mix in the remaining milk.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to prevent burning (especially around the bottom edges of the pot), until mixture begins to simmer.  Simmer very gently, stirring constantly, for 1 1/2 minutes.  Pour the hot mixture immediately over the chopped chocolate.  Stir until chocolate is completely melted and smooth.  Whisk in egg and vanilla mixture.  Set aside. 
Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar at medium speed until soft peaks form.  Gradually sprinkle in the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, beating at high speed until stiff but not dry.  Fold a quarter of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it.  Fold in remaining egg whites.  Scrape mixture into the cake pan and smooth the top.  Set cake pan in baking pan and place on oven rack.  Pour enough boiling water into the baking pan to come a third to halfway up the sides of the cake pan. 
Bake for exactly 30 minutes.  The surface of the cake will spring back when gently pressed but cake will still be quite gooey inside.  Remove cake pan and water pan from oven.  Remove cake pan from water and cool completely on a rack.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight before serving.  Refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze up to 2 months. 
To serve slide a thin knife around the sides of the pan to release cake.  Place a piece of waxed paper on top of cake.  Invert a plate on top of the waxed paper and invert cake onto plate.  Remove pan and peel away paper liner.  Turn cake right-side up again and remove waxed paper.  Cut with a sharp knife dipped in hot water and wiped dry before each slice.  Serve with Raspberry Sauce and Enlightened Creme Fraiche, if desired. 
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Position the rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Line the bottom of 8-inch round cake pan with a round of parchment paper and grease pan sides with vegetable oil or butter.  Put a kettle of water on to boil. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the chocolate in a large mixing bowl.  Combine 1 whole egg and 1 yolk in a small bowl with vanilla.  Place the 2 egg whites in a medium bowl with cream of tartar.  Set all 3 bowls aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the cocoa, flour and 2/3 cup sugar in a 1 to 1 1/2 quart heavy-bottomed saucepan.  Whisk in enough of the milk to form a smooth paste.  Mix in the remaining milk.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to prevent burning (especially around the bottom edges of the pot), until mixture begins to simmer.  Simmer very gently, stirring constantly, for 1 1/2 minutes.  Pour the hot mixture immediately over the chopped chocolate.  Stir until chocolate is completely melted and smooth.  Whisk in egg and vanilla mixture.  Set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar at medium speed until soft peaks form.  Gradually sprinkle in the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, beating at high speed until stiff but not dry.  Fold a quarter of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it.  Fold in remaining egg whites.  Scrape mixture into the cake pan and smooth the top.  Set cake pan in baking pan and place on oven rack.  Pour enough boiling water into the baking pan to come a third to halfway up the sides of the cake pan.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     jalapeÒos, stemmed, seeded,
                        and minced
     1/2                red onion -- diced medium
  1                     red bell pepper -- stemmed, seeded,

     1/2                fennel bulb -- cored, diced small
  1                     bay leaf -- broken
  6              large  shrimp -- still in shells
  18                    tiny clams -- scrubbed
  1                cup  white wine
  3        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1                cup  arborio rice
  1       medium pinch  saffron
  2 1/2           cups  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6              small  Poblano chilies -- fried , peeled,
                        seeds discarded, stem left on

Preheat an oven to 450 degrees. 
Heat a large sauce pot on medium heat and add the butter and olive oil.  When they are melted add the garlic, jalapeÒos, onion, red bell pepper and fennel.  Add a little cracked black pepper and the bay leaf.  Stir and allow to cook until very fragrant, about 5 minutes.  Now add the clams, shrimp and wine.  Cover the pot.  Turn the heat to high.  Let the clams steam open and remove them to a bowl as they do.  Remove the shrimp too.  Turn off the heat and allow the broth to cool a little. 
Remove the clams and shrimp from their respective shells.  Cut the shrimp into bite-sized pieces and reserve with the clams for later. 
Strain the vegetable and clam liquor and reserve combined with the chicken stock.  Warm them both together in a separate pot.  Clean out the sauce pot and return it to the stove.  Turn the heat on to medium and add the 3 tablespoons virgin olive oil.  When it is warm add the rice and stir well to coat all of the grains. 
Begin adding the reserved the liquor/stock mixture by adding 1 cup of it first, stirring constantly allowing it to become almost entirely assimilated by the rice.  Now add in the next 1/4 cup of stock/liquor and the saffron and stir again.  Repeat stirring and add all of the broth and stock until all of it is absorbed.  Season to taste.  Fold in the cooked shrimp and clams. 
Spoon this mixture into the poblanos and place them on a nonstick baking sheet pan and warm through.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 6 servings (with leftover paella that can be reheated for another use). 
Comments:  Additional vegetable garnishes could be folded into the paella rice if you like.  Cooked shelled sweet peas, roasted bell pepper(s) strips, cooked mushrooms and or corn kernels etc.

Recipe title translation:  Tomato Soup with a Bread Timballe and Fried Basil) 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  First, prepare the timballe.  Cut the bread into 1-inch cubes.  In a bowl mix together the milk and eggs.  Add the bread to the milk mixture and let soak until the bread is soft. 
Place garlic in a pot of water and poach them, but change the water the first three times the water boils.  (This will remove the bitter flavor from the garlic.)  Place garlic in a blender and puree.  Add garlic and Parmesan cheese to the bread mixture.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Place mixture into a blender and puree until coarse.  Pour mixture into 4 small buttered ramekins and place in a large baking dish.  Pour water into the baking dish, enough to come half way up the ramekins.  Place baking dish in the oven and bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. 
On to the soup.  In a large pot heat olive oil for 2 minutes.  Add tomatoes, tomato paste, leeks and hot pepper flakes.  Bring to a boil and add the basil leaves and the consume.  Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.  Cook for 20 minutes over low heat. 
For the basil:  heat oil in a fry pan until very hot.  Fry 4 or 5 basil leaves at a time.  Fry the basil leaves until they get a glossy green and drain on a dry towel and keep warm until ready to serve. 
To Serve:  Place one timballe in the middle of the dish.  Pour the soup around it and place fried basil leaves on top of the timballe. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE AND LAMB ===
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     lamb rib chops -- totally trimmed
  1         tablespoon  rosemary leaves
  4        tablespoons  pomegranate molasses
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2                     bay leaves -- broken
     1/3           cup  virgin olive oil
                        === POMEGRANATE AU JUS ===
  1         tablespoon  butter -- divided
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  4                     shallots -- peeled, chopped fine
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled, chopped fine
  1                cup  pomegranate juice
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  3               cups  rich lamb or chicken stock
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Fresh pomegranate seeds -- (optional)

Marinade and lamb:  Rub the lamb chops with the salt, pepper and rosemary leaves evenly.  Combine all of the remaining ingredients in non-reactive dish.  Add the chops and turn over in the mixture a few times.  Cover and refrigerate up to four hours ahead of time. 
Pomegranate Au jus:  Heat a medium-sized saucepan on medium heat.  Add 1/2 tablespoon of the butter and the olive oil.  When the butter melts add the shallots and garlic.  Allow to cook until lightly cooked, (about 3 minutes), stirring frequently so that the garlic doesn't burn.  Now add the pomegranate juice and vinegar.  Reduce by half.  Add the stock and reduce, skimming as necessary until the sauce will coat the back of a spoon, (about 15 minutes).  Remove from the heat and strain the sauce through a fine meshed strainer.  Reserve in a small saucepan while you cook the chops. 
Heat a grill or grill pan to fairly high heat.  Remove the lamb from the marinade and reason them with a touch of salt and pepper.  Grill about four minutes on each side. 
Reheat the pomegranate Au jus.  When is it just under a boil, whisk in the remaining butter.  Divide the sauce between the four plates and center the chops on the sauce.  Serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Marinade and lamb:  Rub the lamb chops with the salt, pepper and rosemary leaves evenly.  Combine all of the remaining ingredients in non-reactive dish.  Add the chops and turn over in the mixture a few times.  Cover and refrigerate up to four hours ahead of time. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pomegranate Au jus:  Heat a medium-sized saucepan on medium heat.  Add 1/2 tablespoon of the butter and the olive oil.  When the butter melts add the shallots and garlic.  Allow to cook until lightly cooked, (about 3 minutes), stirring frequently so that the garlic doesn&apos;t burn.  Now add the pomegranate juice and vinegar.  Reduce by half.  Add the stock and reduce, skimming as necessary until the sauce will coat the back of a spoon, (about 15 minutes).  Remove from the heat and strain the sauce through a fine meshed strainer.  Reserve in a small saucepan while you cook the chops. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a grill or grill pan to fairly high heat.  Remove the lamb from the marinade and reason them with a touch of salt and pepper.  Grill about four minutes on each side. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reheat the pomegranate Au jus.  When is it just under a boil, whisk in the remaining butter.  Divide the sauce between the four plates and center the chops on the sauce.  Serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  ancho chile powder
  2        tablespoons  ground toasted cumin
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  18             large  sea scallops -- rinsed, patted dry
  1                cup  peanut or vegetable oil
  3                     blue corn tortillas - (6" dia) -- cut very thin strips
  2               cups  bitter or bittery greens, such as
                        mizuna, arugula, mustard greens, or frisee
     1/2           cup  Spicy Orange Vinaigrette -- (see recipe)
  1              large  ripe papaya -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced

Combine the chile powder, cumin, salt and pepper in a bowl.  Set aside. 
In a saute pan over high heat, heat the olive oil until it begins to smoke.  Slightly dredge the scallops in the chile mixture on one side only.  Place the scallops in the heated pan, chile-side down, and cook for 20 seconds.  Reduce heat to low, turn the scallops, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more.  Remove from pan and reserve. 
In a saucepan over high heat, heat the peanut oil to about 375 degrees or until a tortilla strip sizzles when it is immersed.  Fry the tortilla strips for 10 to 20 seconds, or until crisp, and drain on paper towels. 
In a mixing bowl, dress the greens very lightly with the orange vinaigrette.  Combine the greens, papaya, and tortilla strips, being very careful not to break the strips.  Divide among 6 individual plates and surround each portion with 3 scallops. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Spice rub:  Toast and grind the cumin, black pepper, mustard seeds, coriander and cloves.  Now mix them with the chilies, ginger, cinnamon and brown sugar.  Store until needed.  (Yields 1/4 cup) 
Mofongo:  Heat a saute pan until quite hot.  Now add some peanut oil and fry the plantain pieces until they are quite dark on all sides.  Remove them to paper toweling to drain.  Now place the cooked plantains in a bowl and mash in the foie gras and the butter.  Season to taste. 
For the beans:  Heat the olive oil and butter in a large saucepan until the butter is foamy.  Add the garlic and jalapeÒos.  Stir.  Now add the remaining vegetables and allow to caramelize.  Now add the spices and stir.  Add the Spanish sherry wine vinegar and sherry and stir again.  Allow to reduce by half. 
Now add the beans and chicken stock.  Bring to a boil and skim as necessary.  Lower the heat so that its a high simmer until the beans are just cooked, (about 1 hour).  Strain and reserve the beans in a bowl.  Return the stock/bean broth mixture to the fire and cook down until almost syrupy.  Pour it over the beans and reserve.  Season to taste. 
For the chicken:  Preheat an oven to 400 degrees.  Cut a pocket in the underside of the chicken and spoon the mofongo into it.  Cover the pocket back up and season the breast with some of the spice rub. 
Combine the flour and cornmeal with the salt and pepper and dredge the four breasts in that.  Set aside. 
Heat the black bean sauce back up and keep warm. 
Heat a large heavy skillet and then add some peanut oil into it.  Begin cooking the breasts, skin-side down.  Allow to get crisp on each side.  Now place the skillet into the oven and cook approximately 10 minutes.  Remove and allow to rest for a moment. 
Return the black beans to high heat and season with a touch of the rub, to taste.  Now place about 3 to 4 ounces of the bean sauce onto 4 warm plates.  Center the chicken on top of the sauce.  Serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  A warm fruit chutney is a nice addition to this dish.

Scrambled Eggs Chiliquiles With Blue Corn Tortillas, White Cheddar Cheese And Sour Cream

Recipe By     :Bobby Flay
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOMATILLO SAUCE ===
  20                    tomatillos -- peeled, washed
  1             medium  red onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  8              large  garlic cloves -- roasted
     1/2           cup  spinach - (packed)
     1/2           cup  cilantro - (packed)
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2   tablespoons  pureed chipotle peppers
                        Honey -- to taste
                        === CHILIQUILES AND TORTILLAS ===
  12                    blue corn tortillas -- deep fried whole
     1/2         pound  white cheddar cheese -- grated
  2        tablespoons  butter
  12             whole  eggs -- cracked, scrambled
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  2               cups  Tomatillo Sauce

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Mix the tomatillos, onions and oil and season with salt and pepper.  Transfer onto a baking dish and roast for 15 to 20 minutes, until tomatillos become slightly soft and onions begin to turn translucent.  Add the roasted garlic cloves and roast for an additional 3 minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly. 
Wash and pick the cilantro and spinach well.  In a blender place the roasted vegetables.  Add the spinach, cilantro, vinegar and blend until smooth.  Season to taste with salt, pepper and chipotle puree.  Add honey to adjust acidity.  Place pureed mixture in a medium-size saucepan and heat for Chiliquiles. 
Melt butter in a hot pan, add slightly beaten eggs and scramble. 
To assemble the dish, lay one blue corn tortilla on each plate.  Place some grated cheese, a dollop of sour cream and an ounce of tomatillo sauce.  Layer with another tortilla and repeat.  Top each with another tortilla and place the scrambled eggs on top with a little more sauce and the remaining cheese. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  sea scallops - (to 1 1/2 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  black sesame seeds
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
                        === ORANGE-GINGER SAUCE ===
  3                     shallots
  3        tablespoons  canola oil
  1 1/2           cups  orange juice
  1              pinch  saffron or turmeric
  1              piece  ginger - (2") -- peeled, and
                        sliced across the fiber
  1           teaspoon  rice wine vinegar or 1 tspn lemon juice
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SQUASH OR POTATO PUREE AND BROCCOLI
                        ===
  1                     butternut squash or 2 sweet potatoes
                        or 2 jewel yams - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
  1              pinch  mace or allspice
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  broccoli florets

For the scallops:  Remove the tough muscle attachment from the sides of the scallops.  Rinse them briefly, drain, and dry on paper towels.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour the sesame seeds onto a small salad plate and dip one side of each scallop in the seeds. 
Heat one tablespoon of canola oil in a medium saute pan until hot.  Put the scallops into the pan, sesame seeds down, and saute them for 3 minutes or until the crust is slightly crisp.  Turn the scallops and brown the other side for 3 minutes or until the scallops are nearly cooked through and opaque.  Remove scallops from the saute pan, drain them on a paper towel-lined dish, and cover with foil to keep them warm. 
For the Orange-Ginger Sauce:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Put shallots in a small baking dish with 1 teaspoon oil, cover with foil, and roast for 30 to 40 minutes until soft.  Pour the orange juice into a saucepan and boil until reduced by half.  Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. 
Put the orange juice, saffron or turmeric, shallots and vinegar or lemon juice into a blender.  Puree until smooth.  Add the remaining oil in a thin stream as the motor runs.  Blend until the sauce is smooth and shiny.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
For the Squash or Sweet Potato Puree and Broccoli:  Steam squash or sweet potato cubes for 20 minutes or until tender with a collapsible steamer in a saucepan.  Puree the squash in a food processor.  Season with mace or allspice, salt and pepper.  If puree is too thick, add some water. 
Steam broccoli in small saucepan with a steamer or blanch in boiling water until tender, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Season broccoli with some olive oil, salt and pepper. 
To assemble:  Pour some Orange-Ginger Sauce on each of four warm dinner plates.  Tilt the plates to spread the sauce evenly over the entire base.  Put a spoonful of the squash or sweet potato puree in the middle of the plate.  Arrange the scallops and broccoli in a circle around the puree. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  oranges
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped red onion
  1         tablespoon  minced jalapeÒo
  2        tablespoons  finely-diced ginger
  2               cups  fresh orange juice
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  honey
  8             medium  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        halved, and thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped cilantro

Mix in the cilantro, red bell pepper, and salt and pepper to taste.  Pour into jars and refrigerate, covered, up to three days.  Bring to room temperature 1 hour before serving.

                        === FOR EGGPLANT SHELLS ===
  2                     eggplants -- sliced in half
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced

                        === FOR STUFFING ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- more if needed
                        Eggplant pulp
  2                     yellow onions -- diced
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  mushrooms -- washed, sliced thin
     1/4           cup  sun-dried tomatoes -- chopped
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  pine nuts -- toasted
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh parsley

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Scoop the pulp from the eggplant halves and set it aside. 
In a small bowl, mix the olive oil with the garlic and salt and pepper and baste the inside of the eggplant shells with this mixture.  Bake the shells for about 15 minutes.  Then remove the shells from the oven and lower the heat to 350 degrees. 
Place the 2 tablespoons olive oil in a saute pan and saute the eggplant pulp and onions for about 4 minutes.  Add the minced garlic along with the mushrooms and cook another 4 to 5 minutes.  Add more oil if needed.  Add the tomatoes, wine and pine nuts and cook until the vegetables are tender. 
Stuff the eggplant shells with the pulp mixture and top with the Parmesan cheese and parsley.  Bake, covered with tinfoil, for 20 to 30 minutes.  Remove the tin foil for the last 5 minutes of baking in order for the eggplant to brown. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE TEA AND FISH ===
     1/3           cup  Lapsang Souchong tea
     1/3           cup  balsamic vinegar
  3        tablespoons  butter
  10                    shallots, peeled, sliced thin
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  1          big pinch  pepper
  8                     wooden skewers -- presoaked in warm
                        water for at least 2 hours
  24            ounces  skinless, boneless salmon -- cut into long
                        ribbon shapes
                        === FOR THE LEMON BUTTER ===
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  Champagne vinegar
  2                     shallots -- peeled, sliced
  1                     bay leaf -- broken
  1           teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
  3        tablespoons  heavy cream
     1/2         pound  butter -- cut small pieces,
                        and kept very cold
                        === VINAIGRETTE FOR THE GARDEN ===
  1                cup  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  soy
     1/2           cup  dark roasted sesame oil
     1/2           cup  chopped cilantro leaves
     1/2           cup  hot chile oil
  3        tablespoons  chopped peeled ginger
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
                        === FOR THE GARDEN ===
  8               cups  mixed vegetables with an Asian aesthetic,
                        such as cucumbers, purple cabbage, red and
                        yellow
                        bell peppers, blanched snow peas, blanched
                        asparagus
                        spears, bean sprouts and shiitake
                        mushrooms
                        Peanut or canola oil -- for sauteing

For the tea and fish:  Soak the dried tea in the balsamic for a minimum of 30 minutes before proceeding with the next step. 
Heat a medium-sized shallow saucepan.  Add the butter and allow to foam briefly.  Now scatter the shallots across the bottom of the pan and stir occasionally to coat them. 
When the shallots are caramelized, add the sugar and stir again.  Now add the tea and balsamic and stir.  Allow the vinegar to reduce almost completely.  Season with salt and pepper.  Remove to a bowl and allow to cool.  (The tea mixture without the fish can be made up to a week in advance and stored in the refrigerator.) 
Lay the ribbon cuts out on a cutting board.  Take the prepared salmon and keep the best looking side down.  Sprinkle or rub the tea mixture sparingly down the length of each ribbon. 
Roll the ribbons up into a tight circle and secure them with a skewer from the 12 o'clock to 6 o' clock position and the 3 to 9 o'clock position.  Refrigerate until ready to grill them. 
For the lemon:  Put the lemon juice, vinegar, shallots, bay leaf and cracked black pepper in a small, heavy, non-reactive saucepan and bring it to a simmer over a medium heat.  Allow the liquid to reduce until only about 3 ounces remain.  Now add the cream.  Once it boils, whisk in the butter, a bit at a time until it is incorporated.  Strain the sauce through a fine meshed strainer and keep in a warm place. 
Vinaigrette for the garden:  Mix all of the vinaigrette ingredients together and set aside. 
For the garden:  Heat a large wok or skillet until very hot.  Add the oil for stir-frying the vegetables.  Add the vegetables and cook briefly together.  Add enough of the vinaigrette to lightly dress them.  (Reserve any extra in the refrigerator for another time.)  Season to taste. 
For the dish:  When you are almost ready to eat, fire up a hot grill.  Grill the spirals until just done, about 4 to 5 minutes. 
Place the cooked fish in the center of four plates.  Remove the skewers.  Spoon some of the prepared lemon butter around the fish.  Mound the vegetables over the fish.  Serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the tea and fish:  Soak the dried tea in the balsamic for a minimum of 30 minutes before proceeding with the next step. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a medium-sized shallow saucepan.  Add the butter and allow to foam briefly.  Now scatter the shallots across the bottom of the pan and stir occasionally to coat them. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the shallots are caramelized, add the sugar and stir again.  Now add the tea and balsamic and stir.  Allow the vinegar to reduce almost completely.  Season with salt and pepper.  Remove to a bowl and allow to cool.  (The tea mixture without the fish can be made up to a week in advance and stored in the refrigerator.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lay the ribbon cuts out on a cutting board.  Take the prepared salmon and keep the best looking side down.  Sprinkle or rub the tea mixture sparingly down the length of each ribbon. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll the ribbons up into a tight circle and secure them with a skewer from the 12 o&apos;clock to 6 o&apos; clock position and the 3 to 9 o&apos;clock position.  Refrigerate until ready to grill them. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the lemon:  Put the lemon juice, vinegar, shallots, bay leaf and cracked black pepper in a small, heavy, non-reactive saucepan and bring it to a simmer over a medium heat.  Allow the liquid to reduce until only about 3 ounces remain.  Now add the cream.  Once it boils, whisk in the butter, a bit at a time until it is incorporated.  Strain the sauce through a fine meshed strainer and keep in a warm place. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Vinaigrette for the garden:  Mix all of the vinaigrette ingredients together and set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the garden:  Heat a large wok or skillet until very hot.  Add the oil for stir-frying the vegetables.  Add the vegetables and cook briefly together.  Add enough of the vinaigrette to lightly dress them.  (Reserve any extra in the refrigerator for another time.)  Season to taste. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the dish:  When you are almost ready to eat, fire up a hot grill.  Grill the spirals until just done, about 4 to 5 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the cooked fish in the center of four plates.  Remove the skewers.  Spoon some of the prepared lemon butter around the fish.  Mound the vegetables over the fish.  Serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  1                     egg yolk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2               cups  all-purpose flour

With an electric mixer beat together butter, sugar and salt until very light, about 5 minutes on medium speed.  Beat in yolk and vanilla.  Remove from mixer, sift in flour and stir to blend. 
Divide dough in half and shape into two 8-inch long cylinders, forming them in sheets of parchment paper.  Chill until firm. 
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Slice cylinders of dough 1/4-inch thick and arrange on parchment paper-lined baking sheets.  Bake 15 to 20 minutes. 
This recipe yields 64 cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     dry-aged sirloin steaks - (16 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary -- roughly chopped
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme -- roughly chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SAUCE ===
  3               cups  red wine
     1/4           cup  peeled chopped shallots
  2        tablespoons  veal stock (demi-glace)
                        Splash of sherry vinegar
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Sugar -- to taste
                        === FRENCH FRIES ===
  8                     Idaho potatoes -- peeled
     1/2        gallon  peanut oil, neutral flavor -- for frying
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === COMPOUND BUTTER ===
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/4         pound  butter -- softened
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              sprig  rosemary -- finely chopped
  2             sprigs  thyme -- finely chopped
                        Wood chips -- for grilling

Have the butcher cut 4 prime sirloin steaks to your desired size.  Prepare the marinade by combining the 4 marinade ingredients and rubbing the steaks in this mixture.  Allow to marinade overnight in the refrigerator. 
Combine red wine and shallots in a medium saucepan.  Cook over high heat and reduce until about 3 tablespoons remain, then add veal stock, sherry vinegar and butter, bring back to a low boil, and add sugar, if needed, and set aside in a warm place. 
Cut the French fries with mandoline or French fry cutter 1/4-inch strips.  Heat a saucepan or stock pot (at least 2 gallon capacity) with the oil about 250 degrees (use a thermometer to gauge).  Add the French fries and cook, stirring to avoid clumping together, about 3 minutes, until soft but not mushy.  Remove with a mesh strainer and drain onto paper towels. 
Turn heat to high and heat oil to 350 degrees.  At the last minute before serving plunge the fries into the oil and cook until golden brown.  Remove from oil, drain onto towels and season with salt to taste. 
Heat the stove top smoker with wood chips.  Put the steaks on the smoker for 3 minutes.  Cover with the lid for a few minutes to infuse the meat with the wood smoke flavor.  Then place steaks on grill pan and cook to desired doneness.  Season with salt and pepper.  To serve, laddle sauce over steak and top with compound butter. 
For compound butter, mix all ingredients in a bowl and whisk until smooth.  Roll into a log, shape in plastic wrap, then freeze until solid.  Slice into 1/4-inch slices and place on top of each steak. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                     hard-boiled egg -- yolk sieved, and
                        the white chopped small
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === MOJO ===
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled, minced
  1                     Scotch bonnet -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  whole cumin seeds -- freshly toasted
  1                cup  pure olive oil
     1/3           cup  sour orange juice -- see * Note
  2          teaspoons  Spanish sherry wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR SERVING ===
                        Mesclun of lettuces
                        Simple vinaigrette

* Note:  If sour orange is unavailable use 1/2 orange juice to 1/2 lime juice as a substitute. 
For the shrimp and yuca:  Combine the mashed yuca with the bonnet, garlic, salt and pepper.  Push the filling into the deep incision of the butterflied cut shrimp. 
To coat the shrimp:  Dust the shrimp first in the flour, then the egg wash and then the panko.  Set aside. 
Tartar Salsa:  Put the egg yolks in an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks until pale.  Add the olive and canola oils very slowly until it is all incorporated.  Whisk in the vinegar and pickling juice.  Gently stir in the remaining ingredients.  Reserve, covered and refrigerated until ready to use.  (Yields 1 1/2 cups) 
Mojo:  Mash the raw garlic, chilies, salt and cumin together in a mortar with the pestle until fairly smooth.  Scrape this into a bowl and set aside a moment. 
Heat the olive oil until fairly hot and pour it over the garlic chilies mix and allow to stand 10 minutes.  Now whisk in the sour orange juice and the vinegar.  Season as desired and set aside until ready to use.  Keep warm, (or rewarm at the last moment).  (Yields 1 1/4 cups) 
To serve:  Have a simple mesclun of lettuces and a simple vinaigrette set aside to mix at the last moment. 
Heat a large skillet with peanut oil until very hot.  When the oil is hot (350 degrees), lay the shrimp in it and cook until golden and cooked through on each side.  Remove them to a plate with absorbent toweling and keep warm. 
Spoon some of the tartar salsa onto the plate in four equidistant places.  Place a shrimp over the dots of salsa.  Whisk the mojo and spoon some of it over each of the shrimp.  Serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.
