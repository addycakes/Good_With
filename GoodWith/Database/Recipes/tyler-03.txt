  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  chicken - (abt 3 lbs) -- cut 10 pieces
  4        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4          teaspoons  ground cumin
  1 1/2    tablespoons  dried oregano
  2          teaspoons  sweet paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2                     dried chorizo sausages - (abt 1 1/4 lbs) -- cut 1" chunks
  1                     Spanish onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
  2                     bay leaves
  2               cups  long-grain white rice
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (15 oz) -- with liquid
  3               cups  low-sodium chicken broth -- warm
  1                cup  pimento stuffed green olives
                        === SALSA VERDE ===
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, minced
     1/4           cup  fresh cilantro leaves
     1/4           cup  blanched almonds -- toasted
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1                     lime -- juiced

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Rinse the chicken pieces and pat dry.  In a small bowl, blend 2 tablespoons oil, salt, pepper, cumin, oregano, paprika and cayenne.  Rub each piece of chicken with the spice paste and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes for the flavor to develop.

In a heavy, ovenproof casserole with lid, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil.  Fry the chorizo over medium heat until it is crispy and renders its fat.  Remove the chorizo with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Place the chicken in the pan, skin-side down, and brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Remove from pan and set aside.

Make a sofrito by sauteing the onion, garlic, bell pepper and bay leaves; cooking until the vegetables are very soft and almost dissolved.  Stir in the rice so the grains are well coated with the sofrito.

Add the tomatoes and broth, season with salt and pepper.  Return the chorizo and chicken to the pan.  Bring the mixture to a boil and let simmer for 5 minutes.  Cover and transfer pot to oven.  Bake for 20 minutes or until the chicken is done and the rice is tender and has absorbed the liquid.  Scatter the olives on top of the chicken and rice before serving.

To prepare the Salsa Verde:  In a mortar and pestle or food processor, mash together all ingredients to form a loose paste.  Garnish Arroz Con Pollo with Salsa Verde before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                    Artichokes With Sausage And Tomato

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     handful fresh flat-leaf parsley -- plus
                        some chopped parsley for garnish
  4                     garlic cloves
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
                        = (such as Pinot Grigio)
  2                     lemons -- halved
  2             quarts  water
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8              whole  artichokes
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2         pound  chicken sausages
  3                     vine-ripened tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter

First thing to do is steam the artichokes in a flavorful broth.  Put the parsley, garlic, bay leaves, wine, and 1 of the halved lemons in a wide pot, add 2 quarts of water, and bring to a simmer.  Season the broth with salt and pepper.  In the meantime prepare the artichokes.

Wash the artichokes under cold water.  Using a paring knife, trim the bottom end of the stem and shave the stem down to expose the tender, inner part of the artichoke.  Snap or cut off the outer petals until you reach the pale green, soft leaves in the center.  Cut 1-inch off the top of the artichoke.  Repeat with the remaining artichokes.

Place the artichokes in the steaming liquid.  Cover and simmer on medium-low for about 20 minutes, or until there is no resistance when a knife is inserted into the base.  Remove the artichokes from the poaching liquid with tongs.  Using a spoon, carefully scoop out the hairy choke from the center and discard.  Try and keep the artichoke intact as best you can, it looks great for presentation.

Place a large deep skillet over medium heat and coat with 2 tablespoons of the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the sausage and cook for 5 minutes to render out the fat and brown the sausage slightly; they should not be fully cooked through.  Take the sausage out of the pan and slice it up.

Cut the tomatoes in half and then squeeze them into a bowl to hand crush; drizzle with a couple of tablespoons of oil and a pinch of salt.  Toss the sausage slices back into the pan and pour in the tomatoes, along with any juice that has accumulated in the bowl.  Cook for 3 minutes until the tomatoes start to break down and soften.

Now it's time for the artichokes to go in there.  Nestle these little beauties into the sausage and tomato mixture; season with salt and pepper.  Add the butter and let it melt, give a squeeze of lemon juice to brighten the flavor, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Now it&apos;s time for the artichokes to go in there.  Nestle these little beauties into the sausage and tomato mixture; season with salt and pepper.  Add the butter and let it melt, give a squeeze of lemon juice to brighten the flavor, and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DUMPLINGS ===
     1/2         pound  fresh curd cheese
                        = (such as topfen/ quark/ or pot cheese)
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  1 1/2           cups  sifted all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  melted butter
  12             whole  fresh apricots
  12                    sugar cubes
                        === COATING ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  fresh bread crumbs -- dried out
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  sour cream
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        Confectioners' sugar for dusting -- if desired

Place the cheese in some cheesecloth or several layers of paper towels and let it drain for 5 to 10 minutes, pressing gently, to remove excess moisture.

With a mixer, beat the cheese until smooth.  Add the egg and continue to beat until incorporated.  Sprinkle in the sugar and salt, and then gradually add the flour; continue to mix until a dough begins to form.  Add the melted butter and mix just until the dough holds together when patted with your hands, it will look pretty wet.  Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for several hours or up to overnight, the dough will stiffen as it chills.

Using a knife, make a slit down the seam of the apricot and carefully pull out the pit, keeping the fruit in tact.  Stick a sugar cube inside the apricot where the pit was and squeeze the apricot back together to close it up tightly.  The sugar cube melts inside the apricot when you cook it.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Lightly flour a rolling pin and work surface.  Roll the dough out into a thin circle and cut out 12 circles with a 4-inch ring cutter.  Place an apricot in the center of the dough and carefully bring the edges together to completely enclose the fruit and form a dumpling; make sure there are not any tears or holes in the dough.  Working in batches, gently lower the dumplings into the simmering water; they should not be touching or crowded.  Cook for about 10 to 15 minutes; the dumplings will sink to the bottom of the pot and then rise to the surface.  Carefully remove the dumplings from the water with a strainer.

In a large nonstick skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the bread crumbs, sugar, and cinnamon, cook and stir for a couple of minutes until the bread crumbs are toasty and golden.  Lay the bread crumbs out on a sheet pan or plate and roll the apricot dumplings in the browned crumbs to coat evenly.

In a small bowl, mix the sour cream, brown sugar, and lemon juice together.  Serve the apricot dumplings with the sweet-sour cream sauce on the side and a dusting of confectioners' sugar if desired.

This recipe yields 12 dumplings.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
  2          teaspoons  salt
  3 1/2           cups  bread flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
                        Cornmeal -- for dusting
                        Milk -- for brushing

In the bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water; stir to blend.  Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.

Stir in the salt.  Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until most of the flour has been incorporated and the dough forms a ball.  Continue to mix at the lowest speed until the dough has become a sticky ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl; about 4 to 5 minutes.

Dust the counter lightly with flour.  Knead the dough by hand for a minute and form into a ball.  Transfer the dough to a bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let it sit in a warm spot for 2 hours to rise.

To form the baguettes:  Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces.  Press each piece of dough into a rectangle and fold the long sides up into the middle.  Roll each into a log, taking care to close the seam.  Taper the ends by gently rolling it back and forth.  Lay the baguettes on a sheet pan that is dusted with cornmeal and cover with a towel.  Let the baguettes rise for another 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

With sharp knife, make 4 or 5 diagonal slashes across the top of each loaf.  Brush the tops of the loaves with milk.  Bake for 40 minutes, until the bread is golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack.

This recipe yields 4 baguettes.

                         Banana Bread With Pecans

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4                     overripe bananas
  1                cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- melted, cooled
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  pecans -- finely chopped
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; set aside.

Mash 2 of the bananas with a fork in a small bowl so they still have a bit of texture.  With an electric mixer fitted with a wire whisk, whip the remaining bananas and sugar together for a good 3 minutes; you want a light and fluffy banana cream.  Add the melted butter, eggs, and vanilla; beat well and scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Mix in the dry ingredients just until incorporated; no need to overly blend.  Fold in the nuts and the mashed bananas with a rubber spatula.  Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan.  Give the pan a good rap on the counter to get any air bubbles out.

Bake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.  Don't get nervous if the banana bread develops a crack down the center of the loaf; that's no mistake, it's typical.  Rotate the pan periodically to ensure even browning.

Cool the bread in the pan for 10 minutes or so, and then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.  Toast the slices of banana bread, dust with confectioners' sugar, and serve.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  6                     ripe bananas -- peeled, sliced
                        lengthwise and halved
     1/4           cup  banana liqueur
     1/2           cup  dark rum
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1               pint  vanilla ice cream

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat.  Add the brown sugar and stir until the sugar completely dissolves, about 2 minutes.  Lay the bananas in the pan and cook on both sides until they become slightly soft and begin to brown, about 3 minutes.

Remove the pan from the heat and add the banana liqueur and then the rum and cinnamon.  Tip the pan slightly and carefully ignite the alcohol with a long kitchen match or kitchen lighter to flambe.  Put the pan back on the heat and shake it back and forth basting the bananas, until the flame dies out.

Divide the ice cream among dessert bowls.  Gently lift the bananas from the pan and place 2 pieces on the ice cream.  Spoon the sauce over the ice cream and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                               Beef Brisket

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  garlic cloves -- smashed
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt -- plus
                        more for seasoning
  4             sprigs  fresh rosemary -- needles striped
                        from the stem and chopped
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4              pound  first-cut beef brisket
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              large  carrots -- cut 3" chunks
  3                     celery stalks -- cut 3" chunks
  4              large  red onions -- halved
  2               cups  dry red wine
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (16 oz) -- hand-crushed
  1                     handful fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
  3                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour -- (optional)
                        Potato Pancakes -- (see recipe)

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

On a cutting board, mash the garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt together with the flat-side of a knife into a paste.  Add the rosemary and continue to mash until incorporated.  Put the garlic-rosemary paste in a small bowl and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil; stir to combine.

Season both sides of the brisket with a fair amount of kosher salt and ground black pepper.  Place a large roasting pan or Dutch oven over medium-high flame and coat with the remaining olive oil.  Put the brisket in the roasting pan and sear to form a nice brown crust on both sides.

Lay the vegetables all around the brisket and pour the rosemary paste over the whole thing.  Add the wine and tomatoes; toss in the parsley and bay leaves.  Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and transfer to the oven.  Bake for about 3 to 4 hours, basting every 30 minutes with the pan juices, until the beef is fork tender.

Remove the brisket to a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes.  Scoop the vegetables out of the roasting pan and onto a platter, cover to keep warm.

Pour out some of the excess fat, and put the roasting pan with the pan juices on the stove over medium-high heat.  Boil and stir for 5 minutes until the sauce is reduced by 1/2.  (If you want a thicker sauce, mix 1 tablespoon of flour with 2 tablespoons of wine or water and blend into the gravy).

Slice the brisket across the grain (the muscle lines) at a slight diagonal.  Serve with Potato Pancakes.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  bacon -- chopped
  3             pounds  boneless beef shank -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" cubes
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     roasted red bell peppers -- peeled, sliced
  3        tablespoons  Hungarian sweet paprika
  2          teaspoons  caraway seeds -- toasted, ground
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (15 oz) -- hand crushed
  6               cups  low-sodium beef broth
  4                     russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        thickly sliced
     1/2           cup  sour cream
                        Chopped flat-leaf parsley -- for garnish

Place a large heavy pot over medium heat and add the bacon.  Fry for about 5 minutes until crisp and remove to a paper towel and reserve.  Add the beef to the hot bacon fat and brown it evenly on all sides, turning with tongs; season generously with salt and pepper.  While the beef is searing, sprinkle the flour evenly in the pot and continue to stir to dissolve any clumps.  Add a little oil if necessary to keep the meat from sticking to the bottom of the pot.

Toss in the onions, garlic, roasted peppers, paprika, and caraway; cook and stir for 2 minutes until fragrant.  Stir in the vinegar, tomatoes, and broth.  Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer and cook for 1 hour, covered, stirring occasionally.

Add the potatoes.  Crumble the reserved bacon into the stew and continue to simmer for 30 minutes, partially covered, until the potatoes are tender.  Season with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat and stir the sour cream into the goulash just before serving.  Garnish with the chopped parsley.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

             Black Bass In Miso Soup With Udon And Shiitakes

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             quarts  cold water
  3                     six-inch pieces dried kelp (kombu) -- wiped of dirt
  1 1/2           cups  dried bonito flakes
  2        tablespoons  light miso
  8             ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        and halved
  2                     center-cut skin-on black sea bass fillets  -- (6 oz ea)
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 2")
  1                     handful fresh cilantro -- plus
                        more for garnish
  2              heads  baby bok choy -- halved lengthwise
  1              pound  fresh udon noodles
  2                     green onions, white and green part -- chopped
                        Several shakes chili-sesame salt

To make the dashi (Japanese soup stock):  Combine the water, kelp, and bonito flakes in a 4-quart saucepan and place over medium-low heat.  Allow the water to slowly come to a simmer; this should take about 10 minutes.  Turn off the heat immediately just as the stock reaches a boil.

Let the stock sit for 1 to 2 minutes and then strain out the solids.  Reserve 2 quarts of the dashi to use in the future as a base for soups and stews (it will keep for 1 week in the refrigerator or frozen for several months), and the remaining quart to prepare the miso soup.

Pour the dashi into a wok and place over medium heat.  Whisk the miso into the dashi, stirring until smooth.  Toss in the mushrooms.

Lightly coat the bottom of a 12-inch bamboo steamer with non-stick cooking spray.  Season both sides of the fish fillets with salt and pepper; lay them side by side in the steamer, skin-side up.  Cut the ginger lengthwise in strips and put it on top of the fish so the flavor can permeate; put the cilantro on top.  Nestle the bok choy in the steamer, side by side, and cover with the bamboo lid.

Set the steamer inside the wok, and steam for 15 to 20 minutes until the fish is cooked.  Carefully remove the bamboo steamer and add the udon noodles and green onions into the soup.  Cook for 1 minute or until the noodles are tender.

To serve:  Ladle the miso soup into 2 wide shallow bowls, scoop the noodles into the soup and lay the bok choy and fish on top of that.  Garnish with more cilantro and sprinkle lightly with the chili-sesame salt and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine
                        = (such as Sancerre or Sauvignon Blanc)
     1/4           cup  orange blossom honey
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2                baguette -- cut 1" slices
  8             ounces  bleu cheese
  1              bunch  peppery lettuce
                        = (such as arugula or watercress)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  toasted chopped walnuts

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Put a sheet pan or pizza stone in the oven to get it heated up too.

Combine the Sancerre, honey, and lemon juice in a saucepan and place over medium-low heat.  Simmer gently, swirling the pot around, until the wine is syrupy and coats the back of a spoon, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Butter both sides of each slice of bread.  Put a nice hunk of bleu cheese on top of the baguette slices and arrange them on the hot sheet pan or stone.  Bake for 5 minutes until the cheese melts and the bread toasted.

Put the lettuce in a mixing bowl and toss with the olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Pile the greens on a serving platter with the bleu cheese crostini around it.  Drizzle the wine syrup over the crostini and greens and sprinkle with the walnuts.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                             Boiled Spaghetti

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Cornmeal -- for dusting

To make pasta dough:  Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface; shape into a mound and make a well in the center.  Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork.  Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall of the well in a circular motion.  Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall.  Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball.

Knead and fold the dough until elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes.  Brush the surface with remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let it rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.

Cut the ball of dough in 1/2, cover and reserve the dough you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out.  Dust the counter and dough with a little flour.  Form the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at widest setting.  Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers.  Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times. Continue tightening and rolling until the sheet is about 1/4-inch thick; (keep in mind, overly thick pasta tastes gummy.)

Now, using the spaghetti cutting attachment, run the sheets through the cutting slot.  Dust the noodles and a baking sheet with cornmeal.  Coil the spaghetti strands into a nest and allow the pasta to dry for about 10 minutes before boiling.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add spaghetti.  Cook for a few minutes until al dente.

This recipe yields about 1 pound spaghetti.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIE PASTRY ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
     1/4           cup  finely-ground pecans
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cold, and
                        cut into small chunks
  2        tablespoons  ice water -- plus more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  dark corn syrup or sugar cane syrup
                        = (such as Steen's)
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  3        tablespoons  bourbon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  pecan halves

To make the Pastry:  Combine the flour, ground pecans, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl.  Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Pour in the ice water and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky.  Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle.  Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin (this may take a little practice) and lay it inside a 9-inch pie pan.  Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly and trim the excess around the rim.  Place the pie pan on a sturdy cookie sheet so it will be easy to move in and out of the oven.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

To make the Filling:  Melt the butter and chocolate in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, remove from heat and let cool.  Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl until frothy and then blend in the sugar.  Stir in the syrup, vanilla, bourbon, salt, and the melted butter mixture until well blended.

Arrange the pecans on the bottom of the pie crust and carefully pour the egg mixture over them.  Bake until the filling is set and slightly puffed, about 45 minutes.  Test for doneness by sticking a thin knife in the center of the pie, if it comes out pretty clean, you're good to go.  Transfer the pie to rack and cool completely before cutting.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  escarole - (abt 1 lb)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  4                     garlic cloves -- sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2                lemon -- cut thin slices
  2               cups  water
                        = (or chicken broth)
  1              pinch  sugar
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Break off the leaves of the escarole and wash them individually, taking care to remove any soil at the base of the stems.  Shake the leaves dry, stack them up, and slice the escarole crosswise into ribbons about 1 1/2-inches wide.

Place a large deep skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil and butter.  Toss in the garlic, red pepper flakes, bay leaves, and lemon slices; cook and stir for a couple of minutes, tossing to combine.

Nestle the escarole into the pan and saute until it begins to wilt and shrink down, about 2 minutes.  Sprinkle the escarole with a pinch of sugar and season with salt and pepper.  Pour in the water and cover the pan.  Simmer for 20 minutes until the escarole is tender.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     lamb shanks - (abt 8 oz ea)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8             sprigs  fresh thyme -- divided
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  1                     lemon -- zested in big strips
  2                     garlic cloves -- halved
     1/2      teaspoon  whole cloves
  4                     cinnamon sticks -- divided
  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1             bottle  full-bodied red wine
                        = (such as Cabernet Sauvignon)
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cups  lamb or chicken stock
  1                cup  pearl onions -- peeled
  3                     carrots -- coarsely chopped
  12             large  green Spanish olives
  12                    dried apricots

First off, you want to marinate the lamb shanks for a few hours to really penetrate the deep flavor; the wine also tenderizes the meat.

Put the shanks in a large glass bowl and season with salt and pepper.  Break up the rosemary and six sprigs of the thyme with your hands to release the oils and toss them on top of the lamb.  Add the lemon peel, garlic, cloves, 2 of the cinnamon sticks, peppercorns, bay leaves, and sugar.  Pour in the bottle of wine, cover and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours.

Line a few layers of paper towels on the counter.  Pull the lamb shanks out of the wine marinade (reserving it for later), and lay them out on the paper towels, cover with more paper towels and pat the meat dry really well.

Put the flour in a large shallow platter and season it with a fair amount of salt and pepper.  Dredge the lamb shanks in the seasoned flour; tapping off the excess.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place a large Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat and add the oil.  Sear the lamb shanks, turning carefully with tongs, so all sides are a brown caramel color.  Drizzle with a little more oil if needed.  Do this in batches if the shanks are big and look crowded in the pot.

Strain marinade reserving the wine.  Add the wine, remaining 2 sticks of cinnamon, remaining 2 sprigs of thyme and the stuff from the marinade.  Cook until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes.  Pour in the stock and add the onions, carrots, olives, and apricots; bring to a boil.  Cover the pot.  Place in the oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.

Transfer the lamb shanks to a large platter.  Spoon the onions, olives, and apricots over them.  Strain the braising juices and season with salt and pepper.  Pour the sauce over the platter and serve with some crusty bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  pearl onions
  1                cup  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  3          teaspoons  chopped fresh dill

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  whole squid -- cleaned
  1                cup  milk
  1              large  egg
  6                     fresh basil leaves -- chopped
                        Canola oil -- for frying
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  paprika
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving
                        === DIPPING SAUCES ===
                        Smoked JalapeÒo Aioli -- (see recipe)
                        Tomato-Basil Sauce -- (see recipe)

Rinse the squid under cool water and pat dry with paper towels.  Cut the body of the squid into 1/2-inch rings and trim the tentacles as necessary.

Combine the milk, egg, and basil leaves in a bowl; mix with a fork until lightly beaten.  Put the prepared calamari in the milk mixture and stick it in the refrigerator while getting everything else set up; it fries better if marinated and chilled for about 15 minutes.

Pour about 2 inches of oil in a fryer or large, heavy pot and heat to 375 degrees.  Mix the flour and paprika in a pie dish or plate; season with a fair amount of salt and pepper.  Toss the calamari in the seasoned flour to coat.  Fry for 1 to 3 minutes or until golden brown.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried calamari to paper towels to drain.  Serve immediately with lemon wedges and dipping sauces.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Combine the milk, egg, and basil leaves in a bowl; mix with a fork until lightly beaten.  Put the prepared calamari in the milk mixture and stick it in the refrigerator while getting everything else set up; it fries better if marinated and chilled for about 15 minutes.

Pour about 2 inches of oil in a fryer or large, heavy pot and heat to 375 degrees.  Mix the flour and paprika in a pie dish or plate; season with a fair amount of salt and pepper.  Toss the calamari in the seasoned flour to coat.  Fry for 1 to 3 minutes or until golden brown.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried calamari to paper towels to drain.  Serve immediately with lemon wedges and dipping sauces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts - -- (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
                        All-purpose flour -- for dredging
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  water
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2                lemon, with rind -- cut thin rounds
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
                        = (such as Pinot Grigio)
  1                cup  chicken broth
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley

Put the chicken breasts side by side on a cutting board and lay a piece of plastic wrap over them.  Pound the chicken breasts with a flat meat mallet, until they are about 1/4-inch thick.  Put some flour in a shallow platter and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper; mix with a fork to distribute evenly.  In a wide bowl, beat the eggs with 3 tablespoons of water to make an egg wash.  Heat the oil over medium-high flame in a large skillet.

Dredge both sides of the chicken cutlets in the seasoned flour, and then dip them in the egg wash to coat completely, letting the excess drip off.  When the oil is nice and hot, add the cutlets and fry for 2 minutes on each side until golden, turning once.  Remove the chicken cutlets to a large platter in a single layer to keep warm.

Toss the lemon slices into the pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until fragrant.  Add the wine, broth, and lemon juice, simmer for 5 minutes to reduce the sauce slightly.  Roll the butter in some flour and add it to the skillet, this will thicken the sauce.  Stir to incorporate and dissolve the flour.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and return the chicken to the pan; place the lemon slices on top of the cutlets.  Simmer gently for 2 minutes to heat the chicken through.  Season with salt and pepper and garnish with chopped parsley before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                cup  plain yogurt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic

  1 1/2         pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut into strips
                        === ASSEMBLY AND SERVING ===
  20                    wooden skewers -- soaked in water
                        for 30 minutes
                        Vegetable oil -- for grilling

                        Fresh cilantro leaves
                        === PEANUT SAUCE ===
  1                cup  smooth peanut butter
     1/4           cup  low-sodium soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  red chili paste
                        = (such as sambal)

Place a grill pan over medium heat and brush it with oil to prevent the meat from sticking.  Grill the chicken satays for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until nicely seared and cooked through.  Serve the satays on a platter lined with lettuce leaves and cilantro; accompanied by a small bowl of peanut sauce on the side.

Peanut Sauce:  Combine the peanut butter, soy sauce, red chili paste, brown sugar, and lime juice in a food processor or blender.  Puree to combine.  While the motor is running, drizzle in the hot water to thin out the sauce, you may not need all of it.  Pour the sauce into a nice serving bowl and garnish with the chopped peanuts.  Serve with chicken satay.  (Makes 3 cups)

This recipe yields 20 skewers.

                    Chinatown Steamed And Roasted Duck

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  duck - (4 to 5 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  Chinese five-spice powder
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
  5                     big slices fresh ginger
  4                     garlic cloves
     1/2         bunch  green onions
  1                     tangerine -- peel cut big strips
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/2           cup  soy sauce

Duck is notoriously a fatty bird, to diminish the fat and produce a crispy skin, begin by trimming the excess fat from the neck and body.  Rinse the duck, inside and out, and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels.

Combine the Chinese five-spice, sugar, and salt in a small bowl.  Rub the spice mixture all over the duck, inside and out.  Salt and five-spice powder makes a fragrant dry marinade, which draws some of the moisture from the duck so that the spices penetrate.

Stuff the duck cavity with the aromatics: the ginger, garlic, green onions, and tangerine peel.  Fold the wing tips back under the duck and tie the legs together with kitchen string.  Poke the duck breast a few times, piercing the skin.

Place a roasting pan on the stovetop over 2 burners and fill with 2-inches of water, turn the heat to medium.  Set a V-rack insert inside the pan and lay the duck on the rack, breast-side up.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil.  Steam the duck for 45 minutes, checking the water level periodically.  Steaming the duck first melts away some of the fat and shrinks the skin.

In a small saucepan combine the vinegar, honey, and soy sauce over low heat.  Cook and stir for 5 minutes until thick.  The duck will be lacquered with the sweet glaze, which caramelizes during roasting, making the skin crisp and brown.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Take the foil off the duck, remove the rack with the duck, and pour out the water and all the fat that has rendered out (this is great to use in other dishes like fried rice.)  Put the rack with the duck back inside the roasting pan.  Baste the duck with the vinegar mixture, until all the skin is completely coated in the glaze.

Stick the whole thing in the oven.  Roast the duck for 1 hour, basting periodically with any remaining glaze to set in a deep mahogany color.  Tent the breast with some foil if it gets too dark.  The legs will wiggle easily when it's done.  Carve and serve.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Put the chicken in a large stockpot and place over medium heat.  Toss in the green onions, garlic, ginger, onion, and peppercorns.  Pour about 3 quarts of cold water into the pot to cover the chicken by 1-inch.  Simmer gently for 1 hour, uncovered, skimming off the foam on the surface periodically.

Carefully remove the chicken from the pot and pass the stock through a strainer lined with cheesecloth to remove the solids and excess fat.  Cool the chicken stock to room temperature before storing in the refrigerator, or chill it down over ice first.

This recipe yields about 2 quarts.

                 Chinese Spareribs #5 With Teriyaki Glaze

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     racks pork spareribs - (4 lbs ea) -- excess fat trimmed
     1/2           cup  Chinese five-spice powder
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds -- for garnish
                        Chopped fresh cilantro leaves -- for garnish
                        Chopped green onion -- for garnish
                        === TERIYAKI GLAZE ===
  1                cup  low-sodium soy sauce
  1                cup  grapefruit juice
     1/4           cup  hoisin sauce
     1/4           cup  ketchup
  3        tablespoons  rice vinegar
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
  1                     fresh red chile
  2                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 2") -- whacked open with
                        the flat side of a knife

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Rub the ribs all over with the five-spice powder; season generously with salt and pepper.  Arrange the ribs in a single layer in a roasting pan and slow-roast for 2 1/2 hours.

To prepare The Teriyaki Glaze:  In a pot, combine the soy sauce, grapefruit juice, hoisin sauce, ketchup, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, chile, garlic, and ginger over medium heat.  Bring to a slow simmer and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 20 minutes.  (Makes 1 1/2 cups)

In the last 30 minutes of cooking, baste the ribs with the Teriyaki Sauce.  When they are done, the pork will pull away from the bone and you will see about 1/2-inch of bone showing.  Just before you're ready to eat, baste the ribs with the teriyaki sauce again and stick them under the broiler for 5 to 8 minutes to make the spareribs a nice crusty brown.  (Keep a close eye on these guys -- ribs go from perfectly crisp to perfectly burnt in seconds.)

Separate the ribs with a cleaver or sharp knife, pile them on a platter, and pour on the remaining sauce.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds, chopped cilantro, and green onion before serving.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  ripe bananas
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  4             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- broken in chunks
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting
                        === EMPANADA DOUGH ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  masa harina
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted, cooled
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for egg wash
                        Butter -- for greasing pans

Mash the bananas, sugar, and cinnamon together in a mixing bowl until creamy, but not completely smooth -- you should still have pieces of banana chunks.  Spoon a generous tablespoon of the banana filling on the empanada pastry circles and stick a piece of chocolate on top.  Form and bake the empanadas as directed in the recipe.  Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve hot.

Empanada Dough:  In a large bowl, sift together the flour, masa harina, baking powder, and salt.  Stir in the melted butter.  Gradually add 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of water, working it in with your hands to incorporate; the dough should be easy to handle and not sticky.  Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic, and chill for 30 minutes.

Lightly flour your rolling pin and counter.  Divide the dough in half so it will be easier to work with and roll it out to 1/8-inch thickness.  Using a 4-inch cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out 10 circles of dough; repeat with the other half.

Spoon a generous tablespoon of filling into the center of each pastry circle, leaving a 1/2-inch border.  Brush the edges with the egg wash and then fold the dough over in 1/2 to enclose the filling and form a semi-circle.  Tightly seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork.  Chill at least 30 minutes before baking.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place the empanadas on a buttered baking sheet and brush the tops with additional egg wash.  Using a fork, prick a few holes in the top of the empanadas for steam to escape.  Bake for 30 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown.

This recipe yields 20 empanadas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1                cup  warm water
     1/2           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  margarine or butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- melted, cooled,
                        plus more for brushing
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  ground cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts
     1/4           cup  melted margarine or butter -- cooled
                        === Glaze ===
     1/4           cup  water
  2               cups  confectioners' sugar -- sifted
  1                     orange -- zest finely grated
  1              large  egg white

To prepare the Dough:  In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of the warm water.  Sprinkle in 1/4 teaspoon of the sugar and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.

Turn the mixer on low speed and add the remaining water, sugar, melted margarine, eggs, and salt.  Add 2 cups of the flour and turn the speed up to medium; continue to mix until incorporated.  Gradually add the remaining flour, and continue to mix until the dough holds together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl; the dough will be very soft.

Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface, until smooth and elastic.  Rub the inside of a mixing bowl with the oil and put the dough in it, turning to coat.  Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for about 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in size.

To prepare the Filling:  Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon in a mixing bowl.  Add the orange zest, raisins, walnuts, and melted margarine.  Fold the ingredients together to combine.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and brush with melted margarine.

Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface into a large rectangle, about 10 by 18-inches.  Brush the surface of the dough with melted margarine and spread the filling evenly across.  Roll the dough up, jelly roll-style, into a long cylinder, and twist it a few times like your wringing out a towel.  Put the dough on the sheet pan and coil it around like a pinwheel, tuck the loose end of the dough under so it doesn't unravel.  Brush the top of the dough with more melted margarine.

Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour until your kitchen smells like cinnamon, and the babka is golden brown.  Cool in the pan for 5 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack.

To prepare the Orange Glaze:  Mix the all the ingredients together in a bowl, until the sugar dissolves.  Whisk the glaze to smooth out any lumps; drizzle it over the top of the babka while it is still warm.

This recipe yields 1 babka.

Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Peanut or vegetable oil -- for frying
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
  3              large  egg whites
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  flaked coconut
  1 1/2         pounds  jumbo shrimp -- peeled with tails on
                        === RED CURRY SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  Thai red curry paste
  1                cup  unsweetened coconut milk
  1                     lime -- juiced
                        === GARNISH ===
  1                     green onion, white and green part -- chopped
  1                     handful fresh mint -- hand-torn

Heat 3 inches of oil in a large deep skillet or heavy pot to 325 degrees.

In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch, egg whites, salt, and pepper until foamy.  Spread the coconut out in a pie dish.  Dredge the shrimp with the cornstarch/egg white mixture and shake off any excess.  Press the shrimp into the coconut flakes; turn shrimp over and press into coconut again to coat both sides.

Deep-fry the shrimp in batches until the coconut is golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Using tongs or a slotted spoon, remove the shrimp to paper towels to drain.  Arrange the shrimp on a platter, serve immediately with red curry sauce and garnish with green onion and mint.

Red Curry Sauce:  Place a small pot over medium heat and coat with the oil.  Stir the red curry paste into the pan and fry that up until aromatic.  Slowly pour in the coconut milk and continue to stir to incorporate.  Add the lime juice (and 1 of the squeezed out halves for added flavor) and cook for 5 to 10 minutes to thicken.  Pour the sauce into a nice serving bowl and serve with the coconut shrimp.  (Makes 1 cup)

This recipe yields about 20 shrimp.

     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan

In a large pot, bring the chicken broth and salt to a boil over medium heat.  Gradually whisk in the cornmeal in a slow steady stream.  The liquid will be absorbed and the cornmeal will lock up; don't freak, just whisk through it.  Lower the heat and continue to whisk until the polenta is thick and smooth, about 20 minutes.

Add the cream and 2 tablespoons of the butter; continue to stir until incorporated and creamy, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper.  Remove the polenta from the heat and pour it into a small baking dish.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Place a small skillet over medium heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.  Swirl the pan over the heat and cook the butter until golden and nutty, about 1 minute.  Add the raisins and pine nuts, tossing to coat in the brown butter.  Pour the raisins and pine nuts over the top of the polenta and sprinkle with the Parmesan.  Bake for 25 minutes and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                           Creole Crawfish Boil

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lemons -- halved, plus
                        more for serving
  3                     bay leaves
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/4           cup  Old bay seasoning
                        = (or Zatarains shrimp boil)
  4             medium  onions -- quartered
  1               head  garlic -- halved
  3             pounds  red new potatoes -- (medium to large)
  4               ears  sweet corn -- halved
  2             pounds  smoked sausage
                        = (such as andouille or kielbasa)
  2             pounds  live crawfish - (to 3)
                        Hot pepper sauce -- for serving

Fill a huge stock pot, preferably fitted with a basket insert, with about 4 quarts of water.  Keep in mind that when you add the solid ingredients the water level will rise, so don't fill the pot up more than 1/2 way.  Squeeze the lemon juice into the water, tossing in the halves too.  Add the bay leaves, salt, seasoning, onions, and garlic; bring the broth to a boil over medium-high heat and simmer for 10 minutes.  You want a very aromatic broth with plenty of salt and spices; taste it, don't be afraid to make it strong so some of that flavor can penetrate and get absorbed by the potatoes and stuff.

Add the potatoes to the pot to give them a head start and simmer for 10 minutes.  Now add the corn and sausage; cook another 10 minutes, making sure everything stays covered with the liquid.  Toss in the crawfish and shut off the heat.  Cover the pot and let the crawfish steep in the flavor for 15 minutes.  Drain and spread the crawfish, sausage, corn, potatoes, and onions out on a table that's covered with newspaper.  Serve with lemons, hot sauce, and plenty of napkins.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  russet potatoes -- peeled
  2             medium  onions
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     egg whites -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped chives
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        === SERVING SUGGESTION ===
                        Applesauce

Using a box grater or food processor, coarsely grate the potatoes and onions.  Put the grated potatoes and onions together in cheesecloth or a tea towel and twist it to squeeze out the excess liquid.  Put the dry potatoes and onions in a bowl and season with salt and pepper.  Fold in the egg whites and chives to bind the mixture together.

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat and coat with 1/4-inch of oil.  For each pancake, take about 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture and drop into the hot oil; gently flatten with a spatula so they fry up thin and crispy.  Fry for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until golden.  Remove to paper towels to drain; season with salt while the potato pancakes are still hot.  Continue frying, adding more oil as needed, until all of the mixture is used up.  Serve immediately with apple sauce, if desired.

This recipe yields about 20 (4-inch) pancakes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  Ghee -- (see recipe)
  1                     yellow onion -- finely chopped

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  coriander seeds
  1         tablespoon  cumin seeds
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  whole cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  mustard seeds
  1         tablespoon  cardamom seeds
  1         tablespoon  whole black peppercorns
  2                     dried red chiles -- broken in pieces,
                        and seeds discarded
  1         tablespoon  turmeric

Toast the whole spices (coriander, cumin, fennel, cloves, mustard, cardamom and peppercorns) and the chiles in a small dry skillet over medium-low heat, shaking the pan often to prevent them from burning.  Toast for a couple of minutes until the spices smell fragrant.

In a clean coffee grinder, grind the toasted spices together to a fine powder.  Add the turmeric and give it another quick buzz to combine.  Use the spice blend immediately, or store in a sealed jar for as long as 1 month.

This recipe yields about 1/2 cup.

Toast the whole spices (coriander, cumin, fennel, cloves, mustard, cardamom and peppercorns) and the chiles in a small dry skillet over medium-low heat, shaking the pan often to prevent them from burning.  Toast for a couple of minutes until the spices smell fragrant.

In a clean coffee grinder, grind the toasted spices together to a fine powder.  Add the turmeric and give it another quick buzz to combine.  Use the spice blend immediately, or store in a sealed jar for as long as 1 month.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  peanut oil
  2                     shallots -- thinly sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 2") -- peeled, grated
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
  1              small  Napa cabbage head -- cored, chopped
  1                can  straw mushrooms - (8 oz) -- drained, rinsed
     1/2           cup  frozen peas -- run under cool
                        water for 2 minutes to thaw
  1              pinch  kosher salt - (generous)
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  1               pint  cooked long-grain white rice
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1                cup  cooked duck meat -- cut in pieces
                        Fresh cilantro leaves -- for garnish

Heat 3 tablespoons of the peanut oil in a wok or large non-stick skillet over medium-high flame.  Give the oil a minute to heat up, then add the shallots, garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes; stir-fry for 1 minute until fragrant.  Add the cabbage, mushrooms, and peas, stir-fry until the cabbage is wilted and soft, about 8 minutes; season with a nice pinch of salt.  Remove the vegetables to a side platter and wipe out the wok.

Put the pan back on the heat and coat with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil.  When the oil is hot, pour the eggs into the center of the pan.  Scramble the egg lightly, then let it set without stirring so it stays in big pieces.

Fold in the rice and toss with the egg to combined well, breaking up the rice clumps with the back of a spatula.  Return the sauteed vegetables to the pan and moisten with the soy sauce.  Toss everything together to heat through and season again with salt.

Spoon the fried rice out onto a serving platter, lay the pieces of duck on top and garnish with cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying
  4              large  russet potatoes
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt -- plus
                        more for seasoning
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- plus
                        more for seasoning
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  1                can  soda water - (12 oz)
     1/2           cup  rice flour -- for dredging
  2                     cod or haddock fillets - (8 oz ea) -- cut in half on an
                        angle
                        Malt vinegar -- for serving
                        Tartar Sauce -- (see recipe)

Heat 3 inches of the oil in a deep fryer to 325 degrees.  Alternately, heat 3 inches of oil in a deep pot.

Peel the potatoes and cut them into chips, about the size of your index finger.  Put the potatoes in the oil.  Fry the chips for 2 to 3 minutes; they should not be crisp or fully cooked at this point.  Remove the chips with a spider strainer or slotted spoon, to a paper towel-lined platter to drain.

Crank the oil temperature up to 375 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and egg.  Pour in the soda water and whisk to a smooth batter.  Spread the rice flour on a plate.  Dredge the fish pieces in the rice flour and then dip them into the batter, letting the excess drip off.

Put the chips in the bottom of the fryer basket and carefully submerge in the hot oil.  Carefully wave the battered fish into the bubbling oil before dropping them in on top of the chips.  Fry the fish and chips for 4 to 5 minutes until crispy and brown.  Remove the basket and drain the fish and chips on paper towels; season lightly with salt.  Serve wrapped in a newspaper cone with malt vinegar and/or tartar sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        sprigs, 1 bay leaf ñ all tied together
                        with kitchen string)
                        === POT PIE ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     carrots -- cut 1/2" circles
  1                cup  pearl onions -- peeled
  1                cup  fresh sweet peas
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
                        Leaves from 8 fresh thyme sprigs
                        Needles from 1 fresh rosemary sprig -- chopped
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
  1                     egg -- mixed with
  3        tablespoons  water -- for egg wash
                        Coarse salt -- as needed

To make the Pastry:  Combine the flour and salt in a very large mixing bowl.  Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Pour in the ice water and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky.  Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Wrap the large ball of dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate while preparing the rest of the recipe (feel free to make the dough the night before if you prefer.)

To make the Chicken Broth:  Put the chicken in a large stockpot and cover with 3 quarts of cool water.  Add the vegetables and herbs and bring it up to a boil over medium-high heat.  Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour; skimming frequently as the oil rises to the surface.  What we're doing here is not only cooking the chicken but also creating the base sauce for the pot pie.  It's the old trick of killing two birds with one stone -- or one pot as the case may be.

Remove the chicken to a platter to cool.  When it's cool enough to handle shred the chicken meat, discarding the skin and bones, and set aside.  Using a colander, strain the chicken broth into another pot and discard the solids; you should have about 2 quarts when you're done.

To make the Pot Pie Filling:  Wipe out the stockpot and put it back on the stovetop over medium-low heat.  Melt the butter and just as the foam subsides, add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps.  This is a roux, which will act as a thickener.  Cook and stir the roux until it's the color of a California blonde.

Now, gradually pour in the reserved chicken broth, whisking the entire time to prevent lumps.  Whisk and simmer for 10 minutes to cook out the starchy taste of the flour and thicken the broth; it should look like cream of chicken soup.

Fold in the carrots, pearl onions, peas, garlic, rosemary, thyme, and lemon juice; stir to combine.  Simmer for 10 minutes to soften the vegetables a bit; season the mixture with salt and pepper.

Stir in the shredded chicken until incorporated, remove from the heat and cool to room temperature; it will get quite thick as it cools down.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Take the dough out of the refrigerator and set it out on the counter for 5 minutes to warm up a bit, making it easier to roll out.

Sprinkle the counter and a rolling pin lightly with flour.  Roll the dough out into a big 14- by 20-inch rectangle.  Carefully transfer the dough to a large rectangular pizza stone or standard sheet pan, leaving about 1 foot of the pastry hanging off 1 end.  Spoon the cooled chicken filling on the pastry that is on the pizza stone, leaving a border around the sides.

Lightly beat the egg with 3 tablespoons of water to make an egg wash and brush it on the dough border.  Fold the "free" dough over the filling like a blanket and crimp the ends with a fork to form a tight seal; it should look like a big pillow.  Brush the top of the giant chicken pie with the remaining egg wash, sprinkle with the coarse salt, and cut tiny slashes in the top so steam can escape.

Place the chicken pie in the oven and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour until puffed and golden.  Let the chicken pie rest for 10 minutes before moving it.  Run a spatula underneath the pot pie to loosen it from the pizza stone.  Scoop out the chicken pie with a large serving spoon.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  2                     filet mignon steaks - (8 oz ea)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

  2                     bacon strips
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  assorted mushrooms -- stemmed, halved
                        = (such as shiitake, crimini, and
                        chanterelle)
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped garlic
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  2               cups  Pinot Noir
  2        tablespoons  prepared demi-glace
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Season both sides of the filet mignon generously with salt and pepper.  Wrap a piece of bacon around the sides of each steak and secure with butcher's twine.

In a large heavy, ovenproof skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until almost smoking.  Place the steaks in the hot pan and cook until well seared on 1 side, about 3 minutes.  Turn the steaks over, there should be a nice crust on top.

Add the mushrooms, garlic, and rosemary; give everything a good stir.  Transfer the pan to the oven.  Roast for 10 to 12 minutes or until the steaks are cooked medium-rare.

Remove the steaks, mushrooms, and rosemary to a platter; cover to keep warm.  Return the pan to the stove over medium-high heat.  Deglaze with the wine, scraping up all the yummy bits in the bottom of the pan.  Mix in the demi-glace, stirring to combine.  Put the steaks and mushrooms back in the pan and coat in the pan sauce.  Finish with a couple of tablespoons of butter to make it rich.

Put the steak and mushrooms on 2 serving plates and cut off the butcher's twine from the filets.  Pour the wine sauce on top and garnish each plate with a roasted rosemary sprig.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  1                cup  stone-ground cornmeal
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1              pinch  cayenne
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

                        === SOUP ===
  3             slices  day old French bread -- crusts removed
  2             pounds  vine-ripe medium tomatoes -- seeded, and
                        coarsely chopped
  2              small  kirby cucumbers -- coarsely chopped
  1                     red or yellow bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and coarsely chopped
  1             medium  onion -- coarsely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2               cups  tomato juice or water
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  Spanish paprika
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  sherry wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     handful fresh flat-leaf parsley -- coarsely chopped
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        === GARNISHES ===
                        Chopped tomato
                        Chopped cucumber
                        Chopped bell pepper
                        Chopped onion
                        Chopped hard-cooked egg
                        Lemon wedges

Soak the bread in 1 cup of water for 5 minutes, and then squeeze out the excess water.  Place the bread in a blender or food processor; add the tomatoes, cucumbers, bell pepper, onion, and garlic.  Puree the ingredients until almost smooth, leaving a little texture.

Pour the vegetable mixture into a large bowl; stir in the tomato juice, sugar, paprika, salt, pepper, vinegar, oil, parsley, and lemon juice until well combined.  Refrigerate the soup for at least 2 hours until very well chilled; the flavors will develop as it sits.

Season the gazpacho again with salt and pepper before serving.  Serve in chilled bowls or tureen and top with desired garnishes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1              pound  unsalted butter

Put the butter in a heavy saucepan over moderate heat, swirl the pot around to ensure that it melts slowly and does not sizzle or brown.  Increase the heat and bring the butter to a boil.

When the surface is covered with foam, stir gently and reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting.  Gently simmer, uncovered, and undisturbed for 45 minutes, until the milk solids in the bottom of the pan have turned golden brown and the butter on top is transparent.

Strain the ghee through a sieve lined with several layers of cheesecloth.  The ghee should be perfectly clear and smell nutty; pour into a glass jar and seal tightly.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             medium  tomatillos - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- husked, rinsed
  1                     jalapeÒo - (to 2) -- stemmed
  1                     Spanish onion -- quartered
  3                     garlic cloves
  1                     handful fresh cilantro leaves -- coarsely chopped
  1                     lime -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
  2               cups  finely-shredded cooked chicken
                        = (preferably dark meat)
  1                cup  crumbled queso fresco
                        === EMPANADA DOUGH ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  masa harina
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted, cooled
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for egg wash
                        Butter -- for greasing pans

Bring a pot of water to a boil; add the tomatillos, jalapeno, onion, and garlic.  Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes until the tomatillos are soft.  Drain and cool slightly.  Combine the tomatillos, jalapeÒo, onion, garlic, cilantro, and lime juice in a blender.  Add 1/4 cup of water and process to a coarse puree; season with a generous pinch of salt.  You should have about 3 cups of this salsa verde.

Combine the shredded chicken and queso fresco in a large mixing bowl.  Pour in 1 1/2 cups of the salsa verde and fold the ingredients together to moisten.  Use as a filling for empanadas.  Serve the remaining salsa verde on the side.

Empanada Dough:  In a large bowl, sift together the flour, masa harina, baking powder, and salt.  Stir in the melted butter.  Gradually add 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of water, working it in with your hands to incorporate; the dough should be easy to handle and not sticky.  Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic, and chill for 30 minutes.

Lightly flour your rolling pin and counter.  Divide the dough in half so it will be easier to work with and roll it out to 1/8-inch thickness.  Using a 4-inch cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out 10 circles of dough; repeat with the other half.

Spoon 2 generous tablespoons of filling into the center of each pastry circle, leaving a 1/2-inch border.  Brush the edges with the egg wash and then fold the dough over in 1/2 to enclose the filling and form a semi-circle.  Tightly seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork.  Chill at least 30 minutes before baking.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place the empanadas on a buttered baking sheet and brush the tops with additional egg wash.  Using a fork, prick a few holes in the top of the empanadas for steam to escape.  Bake for 30 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown.

This recipe yields 20 empanadas.

Bring a pot of water to a boil; add the tomatillos, jalapeno, onion, and garlic.  Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes until the tomatillos are soft.  Drain and cool slightly.  Combine the tomatillos, jalapeÒo, onion, garlic, cilantro, and lime juice in a blender.  Add 1/4 cup of water and process to a coarse puree; season with a generous pinch of salt.  You should have about 3 cups of this salsa verde.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the shredded chicken and queso fresco in a large mixing bowl.  Pour in 1 1/2 cups of the salsa verde and fold the ingredients together to moisten.  Use as a filling for empanadas.  Serve the remaining salsa verde on the side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Empanada Dough:  In a large bowl, sift together the flour, masa harina, baking powder, and salt.  Stir in the melted butter.  Gradually add 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of water, working it in with your hands to incorporate; the dough should be easy to handle and not sticky.  Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic, and chill for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly flour your rolling pin and counter.  Divide the dough in half so it will be easier to work with and roll it out to 1/8-inch thickness.  Using a 4-inch cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out 10 circles of dough; repeat with the other half.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon 2 generous tablespoons of filling into the center of each pastry circle, leaving a 1/2-inch border.  Brush the edges with the egg wash and then fold the dough over in 1/2 to enclose the filling and form a semi-circle.  Tightly seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork.  Chill at least 30 minutes before baking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place the empanadas on a buttered baking sheet and brush the tops with additional egg wash.  Using a fork, prick a few holes in the top of the empanadas for steam to escape.  Bake for 30 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 20 empanadas.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALMON CAKES ===
     1/4           cup  peanut oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     shallot -- minced
  1         tablespoon  grated fresh ginger
  1                     red or green chile - (to 2) -- minced
  1 1/2         pounds  skinless boneless salmon fillets -- cut small cubes
  1                cup  fresh bread crumbs
                        = (4 slices white bread with crusts
                        removed pulsed in the food processor)
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh cilantro leaves
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1              large  egg white
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  peanut oils
                        === BOK CHOY ===
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 2")
  2              heads  baby bok choy -- halved lengthwise
     1/4           cup  water
  3        tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce
     1/4           cup  oyster sauce
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar

Toasted sesame seeds, chopped cilantro leaves, and sliced green onion, for garnish

To make the Salmon Cakes:  Heat 2 tablespoons of the peanut oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Add the garlic, shallot, ginger, and chiles; saute for a few minutes to release the flavor.  Remove from heat to cool slightly.

In a mixing bowl, combine the salmon, bread crumbs, cilantro, mayonnaise, lemon juice and egg white.  Scrape the garlic/ginger oil into the salmon mixture; season with salt and pepper.  Fold the ingredients together gently but thoroughly, taking care not to mash the salmon too much.  Using your hands, form the mixture into 4 salmon cakes, they should be moist and just hold together.

Coat a non-stick skillet with the 2 tablespoons of peanut oil and bring it to a slight smoke over medium heat.  Fry the salmon cakes until brown, about 4 minutes on each side, turning carefully with a spatula.  Keep warm on a plate lined with paper towels.

To make the Bok Choy:  Return the skillet to the heat and coat with the 2 tablespoons of peanut oil and heat until almost smoking.  Split the piece of ginger open with a knife then whack it with the flat side of the knife.  Lay the ginger pieces in the oil, cut-side down to let it start to perfume.  Pan-fry the bok choy, cut-side down, for a couple of minutes to give it some color.  Add the water and cook another minute to steam the bok choy; carefully remove it to a plate.  Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, lemon juice, and brown sugar.  Cook and stir for 3 minutes until the sauce is the consistency of syrup.

Serve the salmon cakes with the bok choy, and drizzle the brown sauce over the whole thing.  Garnish the dish with the toasted sesame seeds, cilantro, and green onion.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

  3        tablespoons  cornstarch -- mixed with
     1/4           cup  water
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
                        Chopped green onions -- for garnish
                        Chopped cilantro leaves -- for garnish

Put the wood ears in a small bowl and cover with boiling water.  Let stand for 30 minutes to reconstitute.  Drain and rinse the wood ears; discard any hard clusters in the centers.

Heat the oil in a wok or large pot over medium-high flame.  Add the ginger, chili paste, wood ears, bamboo shoots, and pork; cook and stir for 1 minute to infuse the flavor.  Combine the soy sauce, vinegar, salt, pepper, and sugar in a small bowl, pour it into the wok and toss everything together -- it should smell really fragrant.  Pour in the Chinese Chicken Stock, bring the soup to a boil, and simmer for 10 minutes.  Add the tofu and cook for 3 minutes.

Dissolve the cornstarch in the water and stir until smooth.  Mix the slurry into the soup and continue to simmer until the soup thickens.  Remove the soup from the heat and stir in 1 direction to get a current going, then stop stirring.  Slowly pour in the beaten eggs in a steady stream and watch it spin around and feather in the broth (it should be cooked almost immediately.)  Garnish the hot and sour soup with chopped green onions and cilantro before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  chicken broth
  2             stalks  fresh lemongrass -- sliced on a bias
                        into 2" pieces
  4                     kaffir lime leaves
  1              piece  fresh galangal or ginger - (abt 1") -- sliced
  2                     red chiles -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce (nam pla)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  1                can  straw mushrooms - (8 oz) -- rinsed and halved
  1              pound  large shrimp -- peeled, tails on
  2                     limes -- juiced
  2                     green onions -- sliced
  1                     handful fresh cilantro -- chopped

Bring the stock to the boil over medium heat in a saucepan.  Add the lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, and chiles.  Lower the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes to let the spices infuse the broth.

Uncover and add the fish sauce, sugar, and mushrooms.  Simmer for 5 minutes.  Toss in the shrimp and cook for about 8 minutes until they turn pink.  Remove from the heat and add the lime juice, green onions, and cilantro.  Taste for salt and spices; you should have an equal balance of spicy, salty, and sour.  It's a good idea to tell your guest's that the lemongrass and lime leaves are for flavor only and should be avoided when eating the soup.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HOT POT ===
  2                     Dungeness crabs - (1 1/2 lbs ea)
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
  1              piece  ginger - (abt 2") -- peeled, and
                        whacked open with flat side of knife
  2                     shallots -- halved
  1                     fresh red chili -- split
  2        tablespoons  light miso
  10            ounces  shiitake mushrooms
  1                     handful fresh cilantro -- hand-torn
  1                     lime -- juiced
                        === CRAB WONTONS ===
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
  1              piece  fresh ginger -- (2 inch) grated
  2                     shallots -- finely chopped
     1/2                carrot -- finely chopped
  1              pound  Dungeness crabmeat -- picked through for
                        shells and cartilage
  1                     green onion -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  1            package  square wonton wrappers - (12 oz)
  1                     egg white -- for brushing
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Cornstarch -- for dusting

To make the soup:  Remove the claws from the crabs and quarter the bodies.  In a large stockpot, add the oil, ginger, shallots, and chile for 2 minutes until fragrant.  Then add the crabs and miso.  Cover with 1 gallon of cold water and place over medium heat; simmer for 30 minutes.  In the meantime, you can focus on assembling the wontons.

Heat a skillet over medium flame and coat with the peanut oil; add the ginger, shallot, and carrot, saute for 2 minutes to soften.  Put the lump crabmeat in a mixing bowl and scrape in the ginger mixture.  Fold in the green onion, cilantro, mayonnaise, and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.  Be careful not to mash the crabmeat, you want that texture when you bite into the wonton.

Lay a wonton wrapper on a flat surface and brush with the beaten egg white.  Drop 1 tablespoon of the crab filling onto the center of the wrapper.  Fold the wonton in half, corner to corner, to form a triangle.  Press around the filling to knock out any air bubbles, then press the seam together to seal so the filling doesn't seep out.  Brush the 2 side points with beaten egg white.  Lay your index finger in the center so you have something to press up against, then fold the 2 sides into the center, slightly overlapping, and press the dough against your finger with your thumb to form a tight seal.  Lightly dust the filled wontons with cornstarch to keep them from sticking together and place them on a cookie sheet.  When these are folded they look like Pope hats.

When the wontons are all filled and folded, strain the soup broth to remove the solids and pour it into the hot pot.  Bring the soup to a simmer.  Toss in the shiitake mushrooms and the wontons; simmer for 15 minutes until the wontons are cooked.  Add the lime juice and cilantro; ladle into soup bowls and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

  2          teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
     3/4           cup  milk
  1                cup  grape jelly

                        Butterfinger, Nutterbutter, Heath Bar)
                        === PEANUT BUTTER FROSTING ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  1                cup  smooth peanut butter
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- room temperature
  4               cups  confectioners' sugar
  1         tablespoon  milk

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Line a cupcake pan with paper liners, gently spray the liners with nonstick spray and set aside.

Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt over a large piece of paper.  In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar with a hand mixer on medium speed, until light and fluffy.  Beat in the eggs, the egg yolk, and the vanilla.  Reduce the speed to low and scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Pour in the milk and continue to mix until smooth.  Pick up the paper with the dry ingredients and gradually pour it into the wet ingredients, continue to mix just until blended.

Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared cupcake tins, about 3/4 full.  Bake until the tops of the cupcakes spring back to the touch and are not too golden; about 20 minutes.  Cool in the pan for 15 minutes, and then allow to cool completely on a wire rack before filling, frosting or decorating.

Fill a squirt bottle with the grape jelly and screw on the cap.  Carefully insert the tip of the squirt bottle as far as it will go into the top of the cupcakes.  Gently squeeze about 1 tablespoon worth of jelly inside of each.  Ice the tops of the cupcakes with Peanut Butter Frosting to cover.  Decorate with your favorite candy.

Peanut Butter Frosting:  Beat the butter, peanut butter, and cream cheese with a hand or standing mixer on medium speed, until light and fluffy.  Slowly add the confectioner's sugar and continue to mix until the frosting is smooth, mix in the milk and continue to mix until it reaches a good spreading consisting.  (Makes 2 cups)

This recipe yields 12 cupcakes.

            Lemon And Herb Roasted Chicken With Baby Potatoes

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     free-range chicken - (4 to 5 lbs)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     lemon -- halved
  1                     garlic head -- halved
     1/4         bunch  fresh rosemary
     1/4         bunch  fresh thyme
     1/4         bunch  fresh parsley
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  red new potatoes

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Rinse the chicken with cool water, inside and out, then pat it dry with paper towels.  Season the cavity with salt and pepper, and then stuff the lemon, garlic, and herbs inside.

Place the chicken, breast-side up, in a roasting pan.  Tie the legs of the chicken together with kitchen twine to help hold its shape.  Toss the potatoes around the chicken.  Season the whole thing with a fair amount of salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil.

Roast the chicken and potatoes for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Don't forget to baste the chicken with the drippings and rotate the pan every 20 minutes or so to insure a golden crispy skin.  The chicken is done when an instant-read thermometer says 165 degrees when inserted into the thickest part of the thigh (the legs of the chicken should wiggle easily from the sockets too.)

Remove the chicken to a platter and let stand for 10 minutes, so the juices settle back into the meat before carving.  Serve with the roasted potatoes on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                   Lemon Curd Trifle With Fresh Berries

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  egg yolks
  1                cup  sugar
  4                     lemons -- zested and juiced
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut in chunks
  1               pint  fresh strawberries -- stemmed, and
                        halved lengthwise
  1               pint  fresh blueberries
  1               pint  fresh blackberries
  2               cups  sweetened whipped cream
  1                     prepared lemon pound cake -- sliced
     1/4           cup  Lemoncello liqueur -- (optional)
                        = (or Grand Marnier)
                        Fresh mint leaves -- for garnish

To make the lemon curd:  Bring a pot of water to a simmer over medium-low heat.  Combine the egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice, and zest in a metal or glass heat-resistant bowl and whisk until smooth.  Set the bowl over the simmering water, without letting the bottom touch, and continue to whisk.  Keep working-out that arm and whisk it vigorously for a good 10 minutes, until the curd has doubled in volume and is very thick and yellow.  Don't let it boil.  Remove the bowl from heat and whisk in the butter, a couple of chunks at a time, until melted.  Refrigerate until the custard is cold and firm.

To build the trifle:  Put the berries in a mixing bowl and toss them together so they are evenly distributed.  Fold the whipped cream into the chilled lemon curd to lighten it up into a mousse.

Line a glass trifle bowl with pieces of pound cake to fit.  Drizzle or brush the cake with the Lemoncello, spoon a layer of the lemon curd over the cake, and then a layer of mixed berries.  Repeat the layers until the ingredients are used up, the last layer looks best if it's the berries.  Chill before serving.  Garnish with fresh mint.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried small red beans -- picked over,
                        and rinsed
  2              large  smoked ham hocks
  1              large  yellow onion -- chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
  1              large  green bell pepper -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  cayenne
     1/4         bunch  fresh flat-leaf parsley -- chopped
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  3                     bay leaves
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2                     green onions, green part only -- chopped, plus
                        more for garnish
                        Red pepper sauce -- to taste
  2                     andouille sausages -- cut 3" chunks
  4               cups  cooked white rice

Place the dried beans in a large bowl and cover with cold water.  Soak the beans overnight in the refrigerator.

Drain the beans and put them in a large heavy pot with the ham hocks, adding just enough cold water to cover (about 2 quarts).  Add the onion, celery, green pepper, cayenne, parsley, thyme, bay leaves, garlic, green onions, and several shakes of red pepper sauce; give everything a good stir to combine.  Simmer, uncovered, until the beans are tender and starting to thicken, about 2 1/2 hours.  You want the beans to be almost overcooked, like they are getting ready to burst.  Stir the beans occasionally to prevent scorching on the bottom of the pot.  Add about 1 cup of water toward the end of cooking if the mixture appears too thick or dry.

Mash about 1 cup of the cooked beans against the side of the pot with a wooden spoon, this makes the broth thick and creamy.  Toss in the sausages and cook for another 30 minutes to heat them through.  Adjust the seasoning, if needed.  Serve the red beans in a wide bowl over some steamed white rice and garnished with chopped green onion.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                      Muscat Jelly With Blackberries

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              pints  fresh blackberries -- halved
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2                     fresh rosemary sprigs -- plus
                        more for garnish
     1/2        bottle  Muscat - (a 750ml bottle)
                        = (or other sweet dessert wine)
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  2                     large strips orange zest
  2                     gelatin sheets
                        = (or half of 1/4-oz envelope powdered
                        gelatin)
                        Sweetened whipped cream -- for serving
                        Fresh mint leaves -- for garnish

Put the blackberries in a bowl, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the sugar, and twist the rosemary with your hands to release the essential oils and throw it on top.  Gently toss the berries to combine and let them sit absorbing the flavor while you make the Muscat jelly.

Combine the Muscat, lemon juice, orange peel, and remaining sugar and in a heavy pot and place over medium-low heat.  Simmer and stir, until little bubbles appear around the pot and the alcohol starts to vaporize; about 15 minutes.

Soak the gelatin sheets in cool water for 2 minutes to soften*, then remove them and squeeze out the excess water.  Remove from the heat and fish out the strips of orange.  Add the gelatin sheets into the hot wine and continue to simmer for 1 more minute, stirring to dissolve completely.  Let the jelly cool slightly for 5 minutes.

* if using powdered gelatin, soak in 2 tablespoons cool water for 3 minutes, then add to hot wine mixture.

Fill 4 martini or wine glasses a quarter of the way with blackberries; carefully pour the Muscat jelly over the berries to fill the glasses to the top.  Chill until thoroughly gelled and set, at least 4 hours or up to overnight.  Garnish the Muscat jelly with whipped cream and mint; serve it with the remaining Muscat.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  white sugar
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2              large  eggs
  1              block  dark chocolate - (8 oz) -- coarsely chopped

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper.  Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt into a medium bowl and set aside.

Place the butter, sugar, and brown sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer; cream together on medium speed until light and fluffy.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.  Beat in the vanilla and eggs.  Gradually add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture and continue to mix until a smooth batter forms.  Turn off the mixer and fold in the chocolate chunks using the spatula.

To form the cookies, scoop about 1/4 cup of cookie dough into your hands and roll it around into a ball; place them about 3-inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets; you should get about 4 cookies on each pan.  Press down the tops of the dough slightly and bake until the cookies are light brown, 12 minutes for chewy cookies, or about 15 minutes for crispy cookies.

Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.  Repeat with remaining dough/cookie sheets.

This recipe yields about 1 dozen 5-inch cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRY RUB ===
  3        tablespoons  paprika
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  dry mustard
  3        tablespoons  coarse salt
                        ===
  1                     pork roast - (5 to 7 lbs)
                        = (preferably shoulder or Boston butt)
                        === CIDER VINEGAR BARBECUE SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  cider vinegar
  1                cup  yellow or brown mustard
     1/2           cup  ketchup
     1/3           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  2                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        ===
  12                    hamburger buns
  1             recipe  Spicy Slaw -- (see recipe)
                        Pickle spears

Mix the paprika, garlic power, brown sugar, dry mustard, and salt together in a small bowl.  Rub the spice blend all over the pork and marinate for as long as you have time for, as little as 1 hour or up to overnight, covered, in the refrigerator.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Put the pork in a roasting pan and bake for about 6 hours.  Basically, roast the pork until it's falling apart and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 170 degrees.

To make the barbecue sauce, combine the vinegar, mustard, ketchup, brown sugar, garlic, salt, cayenne, and black pepper in a saucepan over medium heat.  Simmer gently, stirring, for 10 minutes until the sugar dissolves.

Remove the pork roast from the oven and transfer to a large platter.  Allow the meat to rest for about 10 minutes.  While still warm, take 2 forks and "pull" the meat to form shreds.  Using 2 forks, shred the pork by steadying the meat with 1 fork and pulling it away with the other.  Put the shredded pork in a bowl.  Pour 1/2 of the sauce on the shredded pork and mix well to coat.

To serve, spoon the pulled pork mixture onto the bottom 1/2 of the hamburger bun, and top with the Spicy Slaw.  Serve with pickle spears and the remaining sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Mix the paprika, garlic power, brown sugar, dry mustard, and salt together in a small bowl.  Rub the spice blend all over the pork and marinate for as long as you have time for, as little as 1 hour or up to overnight, covered, in the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the pork in a roasting pan and bake for about 6 hours.  Basically, roast the pork until it&apos;s falling apart and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 170 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the barbecue sauce, combine the vinegar, mustard, ketchup, brown sugar, garlic, salt, cayenne, and black pepper in a saucepan over medium heat.  Simmer gently, stirring, for 10 minutes until the sugar dissolves.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the pork roast from the oven and transfer to a large platter.  Allow the meat to rest for about 10 minutes.  While still warm, take 2 forks and &quot;pull&quot; the meat to form shreds.  Using 2 forks, shred the pork by steadying the meat with 1 fork and pulling it away with the other.  Put the shredded pork in a bowl.  Pour 1/2 of the sauce on the shredded pork and mix well to coat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, spoon the pulled pork mixture onto the bottom 1/2 of the hamburger bun, and top with the Spicy Slaw.  Serve with pickle spears and the remaining sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

                Paella With Seafood, Chicken, And Chorizo

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     chicken thighs
  2                     chicken legs
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  2        tablespoons  sweet paprika
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     Spanish chorizo sausage
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1                     Spanish onion -- diced
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (16 oz) -- drained, and
                        hand crushed
  1                cup  Spanish rice, short to medium grain
  1           teaspoon  saffron threads
  3               cups  water -- warm
  4                     jumbo shrimp -- peeled, with
  1              heads  and tails on
  2                     lobster tails -- split
  6                     littleneck clams -- scrubbed
     1/2           cup  sweet peas -- frozen and thawed
                        Fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves -- for garnish
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

Rinse the chicken pieces and pat them dry.  Mix the oregano and paprika with some salt and pepper in a small bowl.  Rub the spice mixture all over the pieces of chicken; marinate for 30 minutes so the flavor can sink in a bit.

Heat the olive oil in a paella pan or wide shallow skillet over medium-high heat.  Place the chicken in the pan, skin-side down and brown on all sides, turning with tongs.  Add the chorizo and continue to cook until the oil is a vibrant red color.  Remove the chicken and sausage to a platter lined with paper towels.

Return the pan to the stove and lower the heat to medium.  Make a sofrito by sauteing the garlic, onion, and tomatoes; cook until the mixture caramelizes a bit and the flavors meld; season with salt and pepper.

Fold in the rice, stirring to coat the grains.  Stir the saffron into the rice.  Pour in the water and simmer for 10 minutes, gently moving the pan around so the rice cooks evenly and absorbs the liquid.  Do not cover or constantly stir like risotto.

Add the shrimp, lobster, clams, the reserved chicken, and the chorizo.  Give the paella a couple of good stirs to tuck in all the pieces and just let it simmer, without stirring, until the rice is al dente, about 15 minutes.

Scatter the peas on top and continue to cook for 5 minutes, until the paella looks fluffy and moist.  The ideal paella has a toasted rice bottom called socarrat.  Allow to rest, off the heat for 5 minutes, and garnish with parsley.  Serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

  3              whole  salted herrings - (to 4)
  2               cups  milk

Arrange the herring fillets, onion, carrots, dill, bay leaves, and horseradish in a glass dish or funky Mason jar.  Pour the cooled pickling mixture into the jar so that all the ingredients are completely covered with the liquid.  Cover and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days before serving.

                  Pigeon Pea Rice - {Arroz De Gandules}

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried pigeon peas -- picked through,
                        and rinsed
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4           cup  Achiote Oil -- (see recipe)
  1             medium  white onion -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     green bell pepper -- cored, diced
  1                     cubanella or Italian green pepper -- cored, diced
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  2               cups  long-grain rice
     1/2                lime -- juiced
  1         tablespoon  salt

Put the pigeon peas and bay leaves in a large pot, cover with 3 quarts of cold water, and place over medium heat.  Cover and cook the beans until tender, about 1 1/2 hours.  Check the water periodically; add more, if necessary, to keep the peas covered.  Drain the pigeon peas and reserve 4 cups of the cooking liquid.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Coat a large Dutch oven or other ovenproof pot with the achiote oil and place over medium heat.  When the oil begins to smoke, add the onion, garlic, and peppers.  Cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, until the vegetables have softened, without letting them brown.

Pour in the chicken broth and continue to cook until the liquid is evaporated.  Stir in the cumin, coriander, and cayenne.  Mix in the rice and reserved pigeon peas.

Pour in the reserved 4 cups of pigeon pea cooking liquid, lime juice, and salt; stir everything together.  Cover and bake for 20 to 30 minutes, until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  waxy red or white potatoes -- peeled, sliced
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              pound  chorizo sausage -- casing removed
  1                     Spanish onion -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
  12             large  pimiento-stuffed green olives -- chopped
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
                        === EMPANADA DOUGH ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  masa harina
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted, cooled
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for egg wash
                        Butter -- for greasing pans

Put the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water; add the salt and bring to a boil, uncovered.  Simmer until fork tender, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, place a large skillet over medium flame.  Add the chorizo, and cook, stirring for 5 minutes, until the sausage renders its fat and gets crispy.  Add the onion and garlic; season with the cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper.  Cook and stir for 5 minutes, until the mixture is soft and has a beautiful red color.  Pour in the broth and simmer for 3 minutes.

Drain the potatoes and fold them into the pan, using a wooden spoon, break up the potatoes into nickel-size pieces.  Add the olives and raisins and toss everything together; season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Allow the filling to cool before filling the empanadas.  Serve with cilantro cream.

Empanada Dough:  In a large bowl, sift together the flour, masa harina, baking powder, and salt.  Stir in the melted butter.  Gradually add 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of water, working it in with your hands to incorporate; the dough should be easy to handle and not sticky.  Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic, and chill for 30 minutes.

Lightly flour your rolling pin and counter.  Divide the dough in half so it will be easier to work with and roll it out to 1/8-inch thickness.  Using a 4-inch cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out 10 circles of dough; repeat with the other half.

Spoon 2 generous tablespoons of filling into the center of each pastry circle, leaving a 1/2-inch border.  Brush the edges with the egg wash and then fold the dough over in 1/2 to enclose the filling and form a semi-circle.  Tightly seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork.  Chill at least 30 minutes before baking.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place the empanadas on a buttered baking sheet and brush the tops with additional egg wash.  Using a fork, prick a few holes in the top of the empanadas for steam to escape.  Bake for 30 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown.

This recipe yields 20 empanadas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIEROGI DOUGH ===
  4              large  eggs -- plus
  1                     egg -- for egg wash
     1/2           cup  melted unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cooled
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1           teaspoon  salt
  5               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  potatoes -- peeled, cubed
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
                        more for sautÈing
  1              large  leek
  10            ounces  mushrooms -- finely chopped
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley -- for garnish
                        === ROASTED APPLES ===
  3                     Gala apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and coarsely chopped
  3                     Golden Delicious -- peeled, cored,
                        and coarsely chopped
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  2                     cinnamon sticks
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

To make The Pierogi Dough:  Mix the 4 eggs, butter, sour cream, and salt together in a bowl with a whisk.  Sift the flour onto a flat work surface and make a well in the center, pour the wet ingredients into the crater.  Stir the mixture together with a fork, gradually incorporating the flour into the well until a soft dough forms.  Squeeze the dough with your hands, if it's too sticky, add a bit of flour; if it's not pliable, add a couple of drops of water.  Knead the dough, adding only as much additional flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking, until it is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Gather the dough into a ball and cover it with an inverted bowl or plastic wrap for 10 minutes or so to rest.

To make The Filling:  Cook the potato cubes in boiling salted water until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain and then mash them with a ricer or regular old potato masher while they are still hot; set them aside to cool while preparing the rest of the filling.

Trim the root off the end of the leek and cut off all but 1-inch of the green part.  Halve the leek lengthwise and rinse really well under cool water, checking for dirt everywhere; it gets trapped in all the layers of outer leaves.  Slice the leek finely.

Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat.  Add the leek, mushrooms, and thyme, saute for a few minutes to soften the vegetables; season with salt and pepper.  Continue to cook until the vegetables are broken down and almost dry, then pour in the cream, stir to incorporate.

Remove the pan from the heat, take out the sprigs of thyme, and scrape the mushroom mixture into the potatoes, mix well to incorporate the ingredients.  Make sure the filling is not too hot, or it will start to cook the dough, causing it to sog.

Lightly flour your rolling pin and counter.  Take 1/2 of the dough (leaving the rest covered so it doesn't dry out while you work) and roll it out into a thin circle, about 1/8-inch thick.  Using a 3-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut circles out of the dough.  Spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling into the center of each pastry circle, leaving a 1/2-inch border.

Beat the remaining egg with 2 tablespoons of water to make an egg wash and brush it on the edges of the circle.  Fold the dough over in 1/2 to enclose the filling and form a semi-circle and seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork.  Lightly tap the bottoms of the dumplings on the counter to make it flat.

Repeat with the remaining half of dough and filling.  You should make about 35 pierogies; put 1/2 of them in the freezer to keep on hand (they are better than the ones you find in the frozen section of the grocery store.)

Coat a large saute pan (that has a tight fitting lid) with vegetable oil and place over medium heat.  Lay the pierogies in the pan (you may have to do this in batches) and fry them for a couple of minutes until they start to crisp and brown on both sides.  Pour in 1 cup of water and cover the pan to let the pierogies steam; when the water evaporates the turnovers should be cooked and crisp.  Arrange the pierogies on a platter, garnish with parsley, and serve with roasted apples and/or sour cream.

Roasted Apples:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Spread the apples out in a casserole pan and add the lemon juice, cinnamon, sugar, salt, and butter.  Bake until the apples are roasted and soft, about 30 minutes.  Serve the chunky apple sauce with pierogies, either hot or chilled.  (Makes 2 cups)

This recipe yields about 3 dozen.

<DirT>
To make The Pierogi Dough:  Mix the 4 eggs, butter, sour cream, and salt together in a bowl with a whisk.  Sift the flour onto a flat work surface and make a well in the center, pour the wet ingredients into the crater.  Stir the mixture together with a fork, gradually incorporating the flour into the well until a soft dough forms.  Squeeze the dough with your hands, if it&apos;s too sticky, add a bit of flour; if it&apos;s not pliable, add a couple of drops of water.  Knead the dough, adding only as much additional flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking, until it is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Gather the dough into a ball and cover it with an inverted bowl or plastic wrap for 10 minutes or so to rest.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make The Filling:  Cook the potato cubes in boiling salted water until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain and then mash them with a ricer or regular old potato masher while they are still hot; set them aside to cool while preparing the rest of the filling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Trim the root off the end of the leek and cut off all but 1-inch of the green part.  Halve the leek lengthwise and rinse really well under cool water, checking for dirt everywhere; it gets trapped in all the layers of outer leaves.  Slice the leek finely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat.  Add the leek, mushrooms, and thyme, saute for a few minutes to soften the vegetables; season with salt and pepper.  Continue to cook until the vegetables are broken down and almost dry, then pour in the cream, stir to incorporate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the pan from the heat, take out the sprigs of thyme, and scrape the mushroom mixture into the potatoes, mix well to incorporate the ingredients.  Make sure the filling is not too hot, or it will start to cook the dough, causing it to sog.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly flour your rolling pin and counter.  Take 1/2 of the dough (leaving the rest covered so it doesn&apos;t dry out while you work) and roll it out into a thin circle, about 1/8-inch thick.  Using a 3-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut circles out of the dough.  Spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling into the center of each pastry circle, leaving a 1/2-inch border.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat the remaining egg with 2 tablespoons of water to make an egg wash and brush it on the edges of the circle.  Fold the dough over in 1/2 to enclose the filling and form a semi-circle and seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork.  Lightly tap the bottoms of the dumplings on the counter to make it flat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Repeat with the remaining half of dough and filling.  You should make about 35 pierogies; put 1/2 of them in the freezer to keep on hand (they are better than the ones you find in the frozen section of the grocery store.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Coat a large saute pan (that has a tight fitting lid) with vegetable oil and place over medium heat.  Lay the pierogies in the pan (you may have to do this in batches) and fry them for a couple of minutes until they start to crisp and brown on both sides.  Pour in 1 cup of water and cover the pan to let the pierogies steam; when the water evaporates the turnovers should be cooked and crisp.  Arrange the pierogies on a platter, garnish with parsley, and serve with roasted apples and/or sour cream.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roasted Apples:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the apples out in a casserole pan and add the lemon juice, cinnamon, sugar, salt, and butter.  Bake until the apples are roasted and soft, about 30 minutes.  Serve the chunky apple sauce with pierogies, either hot or chilled.  (Makes 2 cups)
</DirT>

This recipe yields about 3 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     duck - (abt 5 lbs)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     yellow onion -- chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  celery seed
  1                cup  pitted prunes -- halved
  3                     Golden Delicious apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut in wedges
  8                     fresh sage leaves
  1               pint  dried rye bread cubes -- crusts off
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  fruity red wine
                        = (such as Pinot Noir)
  2               cups  chicken stock

Duck is a notoriously fatty bird.  To diminish the fat and produce a crispy skin, begin by trimming the excess fat from the body.  Rinse the duck thoroughly, inside and out, and pat dry with paper towels.  Season the bird inside and out with a generous amount of salt and pepper.

To prepare the stuffing:  Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion, celery, celery seed, prunes, apples, and 4 sage leaves; season with salt and pepper; saute for 10 minutes until soft.  Add the bread cubes and toss the mixture together to combine.

Put the stuffing in a large mixing bowl and moisten it with a squeeze of lemon and the heavy cream; give it another toss and season with salt and pepper.  Spoon the stuffing into the duck cavity.

Rip off a foot long piece of aluminum foil and lay it on an insert rack fitted in a roasting pan, let a bit of the foil hang off the end.  Lay the duck, breast-side up, on the foil; tuck the wing tips back under the duck, and fold the excess foil over the end of the duck with the stuffing.  The foil will protect the stuffing from burning and falling into the delicious duck fat.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Roast the duck for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, rotating the pan every 20 minutes or so.  It may seem like a bother, but it's the best way to ensure an even crispy skin.  The legs will wiggle easily when the bird is done and an instant-read thermometer will register about 180 degrees when inserted into the thigh.

Take the insert rack out of the pan and set the duck on a cutting board to let it rest before carving.  Now you have a whole lot of duck fat in the bottom of the roasting pan.  Pour out all but a couple of tablespoons of the duck fat into a container and reserve.

For the gravy:  Place the roasting pan, with the couple of tablespoons of duck fat, on the stove over 2 burners set on medium heat.  Sprinkle in the flour and stir to make a paste.  Crank the heat up to high and add the wine, cook and stir, scraping the bottom of the pan, until the liquid is reduced slightly.  Add the chicken stock and remaining 4 sage leaves, season with salt and pepper.  Cook and stir for 1 to 2 minutes until the gravy has thickened slightly.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1               head  garlic -- cloves peeled

  2            bunches  fresh oregano -- leaves finely

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     butterflied leg of lamb - (abt 4 lbs)
  10             large  Pita bread
  1               head  butter lettuce
  5                     vine-ripe tomatoes -- chopped
                        === TZATZIKI ===
  3               cups  plain yogurt
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  2             medium  cucumbers -- peeled, halved,
                        seeded and diced
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh mint leaves
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Finely chop up 1/2 of the garlic on a cutting board and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt.  Mash the garlic and salt together with the flat-side of a knife into a paste.  Add the oregano and continue to mash until incorporated.  Put the garlic-oregano paste in a small bowl, add the lemon juice and 1 cup of olive oil; season with salt and pepper.  Slice the remaining garlic into thin slivers.

Put the lamb on a large platter, and trim any excess fat.  Cut the lamb in 1/2 lengthwise so you have 2 large pieces.  Make slits all over the meat with a sharp knife, and push the garlic slivers inside.  Rub 1/2 of the garlic-oregano paste all over the lamb and season the meat with salt and pepper.  Roll up each piece of lamb lengthwise and tie with butcher's twine to hold the roasts together.  Put the lamb on a large platter and slather with the remaining garlic-oregano paste.  Marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Wipe off the excess paste from the lamb so it won't burn in the oven.  Place a large roasting pan over 2 burners on medium-high flame and coat with a fair amount of olive oil.  Put the lamb roasts in the roasting pan and sear to form a nice brown crust on all sides.  Transfer the pan (and lamb) to the oven and roast for 1 to 1 1/2 hours; it should be pink in the center and the internal temperature reads 130 degrees.  Allow the lamb to stand 10 minutes to let the juices settle before and slicing.

Cut off the butcher's twine and thinly slice the lamb.  Place the meat in the center of the pita breads.  Top with lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and tzatziki.

Tzatziki (Yogurt And Cucumber Sauce):  Put all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and combine with a fork.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to marry.  (Makes 4 cups)

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Finely chop up 1/2 of the garlic on a cutting board and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt.  Mash the garlic and salt together with the flat-side of a knife into a paste.  Add the oregano and continue to mash until incorporated.  Put the garlic-oregano paste in a small bowl, add the lemon juice and 1 cup of olive oil; season with salt and pepper.  Slice the remaining garlic into thin slivers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the lamb on a large platter, and trim any excess fat.  Cut the lamb in 1/2 lengthwise so you have 2 large pieces.  Make slits all over the meat with a sharp knife, and push the garlic slivers inside.  Rub 1/2 of the garlic-oregano paste all over the lamb and season the meat with salt and pepper.  Roll up each piece of lamb lengthwise and tie with butcher&apos;s twine to hold the roasts together.  Put the lamb on a large platter and slather with the remaining garlic-oregano paste.  Marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wipe off the excess paste from the lamb so it won&apos;t burn in the oven.  Place a large roasting pan over 2 burners on medium-high flame and coat with a fair amount of olive oil.  Put the lamb roasts in the roasting pan and sear to form a nice brown crust on all sides.  Transfer the pan (and lamb) to the oven and roast for 1 to 1 1/2 hours; it should be pink in the center and the internal temperature reads 130 degrees.  Allow the lamb to stand 10 minutes to let the juices settle before and slicing.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut off the butcher&apos;s twine and thinly slice the lamb.  Place the meat in the center of the pita breads.  Top with lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and tzatziki.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tzatziki (Yogurt And Cucumber Sauce):  Put all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and combine with a fork.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to marry.  (Makes 4 cups)

                Roasted Pork Shoulder - {Pernil Al Horno}

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     boneless pork shoulder - (abt 4 lbs) -- skin on
  4                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1                     handful fresh oregano
  4        tablespoons  Kosher salt
                        = (1 tbspn for every lb of meat)
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar

Place the pork, fat-side up, in a roasting pan fitted with a rack insert, and using a sharp knife, score the surface of the meat with small slits.

Mash the garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper into a paste on a cutting board with the flat side of a knife; place the adobo in a bowl and stir in the oil and vinegar.  Rub the garlic paste all over the pork, being sure to get into the incisions so the salt can penetrate the meat and pull out the moisture -- this will help form a crust on the outside when cooked.

Cover the pork with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or up to overnight.

Allow the meat to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Roast the pork for 3 hours, uncovered, until the skin is crispy-brown.  Let the meat rest on a cutting board for 10 minutes before slicing.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh baby spinach -- washed, and
                        stems trimmed
     1/4           cup  Ghee -- (see recipe)
     1/2         pound  cubed paneer cheese
  2                     yellow onions -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated ginger
  1           teaspoon  Curry Powder -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
     1/4           cup  plain yogurt
                        Salt -- to taste

Bring a large pot of water to a boil, toss in the spinach and blanch for 1 minute until very tender.  Dump the spinach into a colander and press firmly with the back of a spoon to extract as much water as possible, set aside.

Heat the ghee in a deep skillet over medium-high flame.  Add the cubed paneer and fry for a couple of minutes until light brown on all sides, gently turning to avoid breaking up the cubes.  Remove the cheese from the skillet and set aside.

Return the skillet to the heat and sautÈ the onions, garlic, and ginger; cook and stir for about 5 minutes until soft.  Sprinkle the mixture with the curry powder; continue to stir to marry the flavors, about 1 minute.  Fold in the chopped spinach and give everything a good toss.

Shut off the heat and stir the buttermilk and yogurt into the spinach to incorporate.  The mixture should be creamy and somewhat thick.  Gently fold in the fried paneer cubes, season with salt, to taste, and serve with steamed basmati rice and/or flat bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Lay the fish out on a large sheet pan or glass baking dish.  Pack the salt mixture on top of and around the salmon.  Cover with another sheet pan and place a brick or heavy can weight on top to press out the moisture from the salmon.  Refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours to cure the fish.

Scrape the salt mixture off the salmon and lightly rinse the fish under cool water; pat dry with paper towels.  The cured salmon will be firm but pliable.

To set up the presentation, lay the salmon on a large wooden cutting board.  (The whole fish looks great as a center piece on the table, so only slice a quarter of the gravlax at a time.)  With a very sharp knife slice the salmon New York Deli-style; paper-thin on a slight angle.  Serve the cured salmon with the Blini, the Dill Creme Fraiche, and Radish-Lime Salsa on the side.  This is an interactive hors d'oeuvre: let your friends attack it, then slice more as needed.

To prepare the blini, in a large bowl, proof the yeast in the warm milk for 10 minutes, stirring to dissolve.  In another large bowl, sift the all-purpose flour, buckwheat flour, salt, and sugar together.  Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture, melted butter, and egg yolks (reserve the whites) and whisk until smooth.  Cover with a towel and let it rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours.

Just before you are ready to cook the blini, beat the egg whites until stiff, then fold them into the batter.  Place a griddle or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and brush it with a little melted butter.  Pour 1 tablespoon of the batter into the pan, to make pancakes about 3 inches in diameter.  Cook for about 30 seconds, then flip them over with a spatula and cook another 30 seconds.  Stack the blini on a platter and wrap them in a cloth napkin to keep them warm.

Dill Creme Fraiche:  Mix all ingredients together in a bowl until combined.  (Makes 3/4 cup)

Radish-Lime Salsa:  Put all the salsa ingredients in a food processor and pulse 5 times to combine.  Put it in a bowl and serve.  (Makes 2 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields about 40 blini.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     thinly-sliced 5-oz veal cutlets -- (scallopini)
  4             slices  thinly-sliced prosciutto
  8                     fresh sage leaves -- plus
                        more for garnish
                        All-purpose flour -- for dredging
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

Put the veal cutlets side by side on a sheet of plastic wrap.  Lay a piece of prosciutto on top of each piece of veal and cover with another piece of plastic.  Gently flatten the cutlets with a rolling pin or meat mallet, until the pieces are about 1/4-inch thick and the prosciutto has adhered to the veal.

Remove the plastic wrap and lay a couple of sage leaves in the center of each cutlet.  Weave a toothpick in and out of the veal to secure the prosciutto and sage.

Put some flour in a shallow platter and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper; mix with a fork to combine.  Dredge the veal in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess.

Heat the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter and in a large skillet over medium flame.  Put the veal in the pan, prosciutto-side down first.  Cook for 3 minutes to crisp it up and then flip the veal over and saute the other side for 2 minutes, until golden.  Transfer the saltimbocca to a serving platter, remove the toothpicks, and keep warm.

Add the wine to the pan, stirring to bring up all the delicious flavor in the bottom; let the wine cook down for a minute to burn off some of the alcohol.  Add the chicken broth and remaining tablespoon of butter, swirl the pan around.  Season with salt and pepper.  Pour the sauce over the saltimbocca, garnish with sage leaves and lemon wedges; serve immediately.

     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  jumbo shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped

                        Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley -- for garnish

Put the flour on a plate and season with a healthy amount of salt and pepper; mix with a fork to combine evenly.  Dredge the shrimp in the seasoned flour to coat all sides.

Heat the butter and oil in a heavy bottomed pan over medium heat until butter stops foaming and just starts to turn a light brown.  Add the shrimp, and give it a toss, saute for 5 minutes until the shrimp is firm and there is a crispy coating on the outside.  Remove the shrimp to a side plate and cover to keep warm.

Put the pan back on the heat and add the garlic and shallots.  Cook and stir for 1 minute until soft.  Add the lemon juice and chicken broth, give it a stir and let it cook down for 1 minute to thicken slightly.  Put the shrimp back in the pan and coat in the lemon sauce.  Season with salt and pepper and garnish with chopped parsley before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  cold unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut small chunks
  2        tablespoons  ice water -- plus more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  unsulphured molasses
                        = (or Pennsylvania Dutch Table Syrup)
     3/4           cup  hot water
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
                        === CRUMB TOPPING ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        ===
                        Whipped cream -- for serving

To make the Pastry:  Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl.  Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Pour in the ice water and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky.  Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Sprinkle the counter and a rolling pin lightly with flour.  Roll the dough out into a 10-inch circle; to check the size, put the 9-inch pie pan upside down over the dough.  Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin (this may take a little practice) and lay it inside the pie pan.  Press the dough firmly into the bottom and sides so it fits tightly.  Trim the excess dough around the rim.  Place the pie pan on a sturdy cookie sheet so it can prevent spills from burning in the bottom of the oven.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

To make the Filling:  In medium-size mixing bowl, combine the molasses and water; stir in baking soda, eggs, and spices.

To make the Crumb Topping:  With a pastry blender, mix together the flour, brown sugar, and butter, until it is the texture of coarse crumbs.  Take 1/2 cup of the crumb mixture and put it in the bottom of the pie shell, pour in the molasses filling, and scatter the remaining crumbs on top.

Bake for 30 minutes, until the filling jiggles slightly and the top is firm.  Let cool to room temperature before cutting.  Serve with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) pie.

To make the Pastry:  Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl.  Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Pour in the ice water and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky.  Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sprinkle the counter and a rolling pin lightly with flour.  Roll the dough out into a 10-inch circle; to check the size, put the 9-inch pie pan upside down over the dough.  Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin (this may take a little practice) and lay it inside the pie pan.  Press the dough firmly into the bottom and sides so it fits tightly.  Trim the excess dough around the rim.  Place the pie pan on a sturdy cookie sheet so it can prevent spills from burning in the bottom of the oven.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRITS ===
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  stone-ground white cornmeal
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SHRIMP ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  white onion -- minced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1              pound  spicy sausage -- cut in chunks
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1                     bay leaf
  2             pounds  large shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        and tails on
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1                     green onion, white and green part -- chopped

To make the grits, place a 3-quart pot over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Slowly whisk in the cornmeal.  When the grits begin to bubble, turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon.  Allow to cook for 10 to 15 minutes, until the mixture is smooth and thick.  Remove from heat and stir in the cream and butter, season with salt and pepper.

To make the shrimp, place a deep skillet over medium heat and coat with the olive oil.  Add the onion and garlic; saute for 2 minutes to soften.  Add the sausage and cook, stirring, until there is a fair amount of fat in the pan and the sausage is brown.

Sprinkle in the flour and stir with a wooden spoon to create a roux.  Slowly pour in the chicken stock and continue to stir to avoid lumps.  Toss in the bay leaf.  When the liquid comes to a simmer, add the shrimp.

Poach the shrimp in the stock for 2 to 3 minutes, until they are firm and pink and the gravy is smooth and thick.  Season with salt and pepper; stir in the parsley and green onion.

Spoon the grits into a serving bowl.  Add the shrimp mixture and mix well.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

  1                can  chopped tomatoes - (15 oz) -- drained
  3                     bay leaves
  3                     fresh thyme sprigs -- leaves striped from
                        the stem
  2             quarts  Shrimp Stock
  1 1/2         pounds  reserved peeled shrimp
  1               pint  raw shucked oysters
                        = (abt 20 lbs unshucked)
  3               cups  cooked long-grain white rice
                        Chopped flat-leaf parsley -- for garnish
                        Chopped green onions -- for garnish
                        Crusty French bread -- for serving
                        Fire Water -- (see recipe)

To make the shrimp stock:  Peel the shrimp, and toss the heads and shells into a large stock pot; refrigerate the peeled shrimp until ready to cook in the gumbo.  Add the crab, onion, bay leaves, thyme, cayenne, Old Bay, and lemons to the pot.  Cover with 2 1/2 quarts of cold water.  Allow the liquid to slowly come to a boil, and then lower the heat.  Gently simmer for 45 minutes, uncovered, skimming any foam that rises to the top.  Strain the stock into a heatproof container or another pot to remove the chunky solids; at this point you should have about 2 quarts of flavorful broth to use in the gumbo.  Cool until needed.

To make the gumbo, you must start with a roux base:  Melt the butter over medium-low heat in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot.  Just as the foam subsides, add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps -- it may lock-up like cake frosting but just keep stirring through it.  Cook the roux until it's the color of a walnut and smells equally as nutty, this should take about 15 minutes.

Add the onions, celery, bell pepper, garlic, and okra (if it ain't got okra, it ain't gumbo!); season with salt, cayenne, and Old Bay.  Mix in the tomatoes, bay leaves, and thyme.  Cook for 10 minutes, stirring now and then, until the vegetables are soft.  Pour in the cooled shrimp stock and stir to combine.  Bring the mixture to a boil, and then reduce the heat.  Simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the gumbo is dark and thick.  Toss in the shrimp and oysters, cook about another 15 minutes; adjust seasoning.

To serve:  Ladle the gumbo into shallow bowls and pile some rice in the center.  Sprinkle the parsley and green onions over the top.  Pass the French bread and hot sauce at the table.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  onion powder
  2        tablespoons  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  cayenne
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     bone-in pork chops, 3/4" thick
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1                cup  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
                        Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley -- for garnish

Put the flour in a shallow platter and add the onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper; mix with a fork to distribute evenly.  Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels to remove any moisture and then dredge them in the seasoned flour; shaking off the excess.

Heat a large saute pan or cast-iron skillet over medium heat and coat with the oil.  When the oil is nice and hot, lay the pork chops in the pan in a single layer and fry for 3 minutes on each side until golden brown.  Remove the pork chops from the pan and add a little sprinkle of seasoned flour to the pan drippings.

Mix the flour into the fat to dissolve and then pour in the chicken broth in.  Let the liquid cook down for 5 minutes to reduce and thicken slightly.  Stir in the buttermilk to make a creamy gravy and return the pork chops to the pan, covering them with the sauce.  Simmer for 5 minutes until the pork is cooked through.  Season with salt and pepper and garnish with chopped parsley before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                     Soft Scrambled Eggs With Avocado

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    eggs
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     avocados -- peeled, pitted,
                        and sliced
                        Chopped fresh chives -- for garnish

Crack the eggs into a bowl.  Add the cream and whisk until the eggs look foamy and light.

Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat.  Melt the butter until it foams, then turn the heat down to low and slowly pour in the eggs.  Using a heat resistant rubber spatula, slowly stir the eggs from the outside of the pan to the center.  Once the eggs begin to set, stirring slowly will create large, cloud-like curds.  This sounds easy but perfect scrambled eggs that are soft and custard-like with no brown color are a sign of a really good cook.  This process takes about 10 minutes.

Season the eggs with a few cranks of black pepper and good salt, like fleur de sel.  Serve with a few slices of avocado and a little chopped fresh chive.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  milk
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh chives

In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.  In another mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and milk together.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the egg-milk mixture.  Gradually draw in the flour from the sides and combine well; the dough should be smooth and thick.  Let the dough rest for 10 to 15 minutes.

Bring 3 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot, then reduce to a simmer.  To form the spaetzle, hold a large holed colander or slotted spoon over the simmering water and push the dough through the holes with a spatula or spoon.  Do this in batches so you don't overcrowd the pot.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until the spaetzle floats to the surface, stirring gently to prevent sticking.  Dump the spaetzle into a colander and give it a quick rinse with cool water.

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and add the spaetzle; tossing to coat.  Cook the spaetzle for 1 to 2 minutes to give the noodles some color, and then sprinkle with the chopped chives and season with salt and pepper before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  fish or shrimp stock
  2 1/2    tablespoons  squid ink
  5        tablespoons  Spanish olive oil
  1             medium  yellow onion -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2             medium  tomatoes -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  Spanish paprika
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  Spanish short-grain rice
  2                     pimentos -- chopped
  6                     pitted green olives -- smashed
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        Pan Roasted Prawns -- (see recipe)

Combine the stock and squid ink in a saucepan and place over medium-low heat, stir to combine.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a wide shallow skillet or paella pan over medium heat.  Make a sofrito by sauteing the onion, garlic, and tomatoes; cook until the mixture caramelizes a bit and the flavors meld, about 10 minutes.  Sprinkle with the paprika, salt and pepper.

Fold in the rice, stirring to coat the grains.  Pour in the hot, black stock and give it a stir.  Reduce the heat to low and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper.  Do not cover or constantly stir like risotto.

Mix the pimentos, olives, parsley, lemon juice, and remaining 2 tablespoons of oil together in a small bowl.  Arrange the pan-roasted prawns on the black rice, and sprinkle the olive mixture all over the top; serve directly from the pan at the table.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Fold in the rice, stirring to coat the grains.  Pour in the hot, black stock and give it a stir.  Reduce the heat to low and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper.  Do not cover or constantly stir like risotto.

Mix the pimentos, olives, parsley, lemon juice, and remaining 2 tablespoons of oil together in a small bowl.  Arrange the pan-roasted prawns on the black rice, and sprinkle the olive mixture all over the top; serve directly from the pan at the table.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/2                lemon -- zested, juiced
     1/4      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  3        tablespoons  cake flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

        Stir-Fried Dungeness Crab With Sweet Chili Sauce, Bok Choy

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     live Dungeness crabs - (1 1/2 lbs ea)
     1/4           cup  peanut oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 1") -- grated
  2                     fresh red chiles -- sliced
  4              heads  baby bok choy -- halved
  1                cup  water
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar
     1/4           cup  low-sodium soy sauce
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
     1/4           cup  sake
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  2        tablespoons  water
                        Butter lettuce
  2                     green onions, white and green part -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped unsalted peanuts
                        White rice -- for serving

First thing to do is "dismantle" the crabs before you wok-fry them.  Toss the live crabs into salted boiling water for 2 minutes.  Next, place the crabs top-side up, and stick your thumb under the edge of the top shell, pull forward and lift the shell up and off, and reserve.  Scrape out the gills that are found on top of the body.  Now, turn the crabs over and on the underbelly you will find the "apron," a slightly-lifted triangular flap, pull this off too.  Finally, rinse the crabs of all the grey or green spongy stuff (the soft yellow matter is fat or crab butter and considered desirable by many, keep it if you wish.)  Divide the crabs into quarters with a big knife, leaving the legs attached to the 4 sections.

Heat the peanut oil in a wok over high heat until almost smoking.  Add the garlic, ginger, chiles, and bok choy.  Stir-fry for 1 minute, then remove to a side platter.  Toss in the crab pieces, including the top shells.  Take the top shells out after 1 minute, continue to stir-fry the crab for 3 minutes.  With a big spoon or spatula, remove the crab pieces to the side platter.

Now on to the sauce, pour 1 cup of water into the wok, along with the brown sugar, soy sauce, lemon juice, and sake.  Stir for 2 minutes to dissolve the sugar.  Stir in the cornstarch slurry and cook another minute until the sauce thickens.  Return the crabs and bok choy to the pan, toss everything together to coat.  Cover, and cook for 3 minutes.

To serve, line a large platter with butter lettuce leaves, and arrange the crabs with the top shell back on top so it looks roughly like a whole crab again -- cool right?!  Put the bok choy around the crab and pour the sauce all over the top.  Garnish with the green onions and peanuts.  You'll need crab crackers, mini forks, a side bowl for the shells, a stack of napkins, and bowls of warm lemon water to clean your hands.  Serve with steamed white rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  dried wide rice noodles
     1/4           cup  fish sauce (nam pla)
  3        tablespoons  tamarind juice
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1 1/2         pounds  large shrimp -- peeled, tails on
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2                     shallots -- sliced
  1                     fresh red chile -- sliced
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  1                cup  fresh bean sprouts
     1/2           cup  chopped unsalted roasted peanuts
  1                     lime -- cut small wedges
     1/4           cup  fresh cilantro leaves

Soak the dried rice noodles in cool or lukewarm water for 30 minutes, or until they're limp but still firm to the touch; later cooking in the wok will soften them more.  Drain the noodles thoroughly in a colander and set aside while preparing the other ingredients.

In a small bowl, mix the fish sauce, tamarind juice, and sugar; stir well to melt the sugar.  Taste and adjust flavors to the desired combination of salty, sour, and sweet.

Heat a wok over medium-high heat until it is smoking hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and quickly stir-fry the shrimp until they turn pink and are almost cooked through; 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove the shrimp to a plate and cover to keep warm.

Add the remaining oil to the wok and toss in the garlic, shallots, and chile; stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Push the garlic and shallots to 1 side of the wok and pour the egg into the center.  Scramble the egg lightly until set, breaking it up into pieces with a spatula.  Add the drained noodles to the wok, stirring and tossing quickly with 2 spatulas to separate the strands.  Pour in the fish sauce mixture, tossing well to coat the noodles and keep them from sticking (if the noodles are still too firm, drizzle with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to help them cook.)

When the noodles are in good shape, toss in 1/2 of the bean sprouts and peanuts; save the remaining for garnish.  Continue to stir-fry, to combine.  Return the shrimp to the wok and toss the pad thai together to warm everything through.  Serve the pad thai on a platter, pile the remaining bean sprouts and peanuts on 1 side of the dish and garnish with the lime wedges and cilantro.  Squeeze lime juice over each portion before eating.

Soak the dried rice noodles in cool or lukewarm water for 30 minutes, or until they&apos;re limp but still firm to the touch; later cooking in the wok will soften them more.  Drain the noodles thoroughly in a colander and set aside while preparing the other ingredients.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, mix the fish sauce, tamarind juice, and sugar; stir well to melt the sugar.  Taste and adjust flavors to the desired combination of salty, sour, and sweet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a wok over medium-high heat until it is smoking hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and quickly stir-fry the shrimp until they turn pink and are almost cooked through; 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove the shrimp to a plate and cover to keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the remaining oil to the wok and toss in the garlic, shallots, and chile; stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Push the garlic and shallots to 1 side of the wok and pour the egg into the center.  Scramble the egg lightly until set, breaking it up into pieces with a spatula.  Add the drained noodles to the wok, stirring and tossing quickly with 2 spatulas to separate the strands.  Pour in the fish sauce mixture, tossing well to coat the noodles and keep them from sticking (if the noodles are still too firm, drizzle with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to help them cook.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the noodles are in good shape, toss in 1/2 of the bean sprouts and peanuts; save the remaining for garnish.  Continue to stir-fry, to combine.  Return the shrimp to the wok and toss the pad thai together to warm everything through.  Serve the pad thai on a platter, pile the remaining bean sprouts and peanuts on 1 side of the dish and garnish with the lime wedges and cilantro.  Squeeze lime juice over each portion before eating.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SWEET AND SOUR TOMATO SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1 1/2         quarts  crushed tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CABBAGE ROLLS ===
  1 1/4            cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     yellow onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1                     splash dry red wine
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1              pound  ground beef
  1              pound  ground pork
  1              large  egg
  1 1/2           cups  steamed white rice
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              large  green cabbage heads - (abt 3 lbs ea)

To make the sauce:  Coat a 3-quart saucepan with the oil and place over medium heat.  Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Add the vinegar and sugar; simmer, until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat.

Place a skillet over medium heat and coat with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  SautÈ the onion and garlic for about 5 minutes, until soft.  Stir in the tomato paste, a splash of wine, parsley, and 1/2 cup of the prepared sweet and sour tomato sauce, mix to incorporate and then take it off the heat.  Combine the ground meat in a large mixing bowl.  Add the egg, the cooked rice, and the sauteed onion mixture.  Toss the filling together with your hands to combine, season with a generous amount of salt and pepper.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Remove the large, damaged outer leaves from the cabbages and set aside.  Cut out the cores of the cabbages with a sharp knife and carefully pull off all the rest of the leaves, keeping them whole and as undamaged as possible, (get rid of all the small leaves and use them for coleslaw or whatever.)

Blanch the cabbage leaves in the pot of boiling water for 5 minutes, or until pliable.  Run the leaves under cool water then lay them out so you can assess just how many blankets you have to wrap up the filling.  Next, carefully cut out the center vein from the leaves so they will be easier to roll up.

Take the reserved big outer leaves and lay them on the bottom of a casserole pan, let part of the leaves hang out the sides of the pan.  This insulation will prevent the cabbage rolls from burning on the bottom when baked.  Use all the good looking leaves to make the cabbage rolls.

Put about 1/2 cup of the meat filling in the center of the cabbage and starting at what was the stem-end, fold the sides in and roll up the cabbage to enclose the filling.  Place the cabbage rolls side by side in rows, seam-side down, in a casserole pan.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Pour the remaining sweet and sour tomato sauce over the cabbage rolls.  Fold the hanging leaves over the top to enclose and keep the moisture in.  Drizzle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Bake for 1 hour until the meat is cooked.

This recipe yields about 1 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  yellow onion -- finely chopped
  1              small  fennel bulb -- halved, cored,
                        and diced
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/2           cup  pine nuts
  1                cup  long-grain rice
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped dill leaves
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                jar  grape leaves - (8 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  2                     lemons -- juiced

To make the filling, coat a large saute pan with 1/4 cup of the oil and place over medium heat.  Add the onion, fennel and lemon zest and stir until soft, about 10 minutes.  Add the pine nuts and rice, saute for 2 minutes, stirring to coat.  Pour in just 1/2 cup of the chicken stock and lower the heat.  Simmer until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente, about 10 minutes.  Scrape the parboiled rice mixture into a bowl and add the dill and parsley; season with salt and pepper.  Allow to cool.  Now on to the grape leaves.

Bring a big pot of water to a simmer.  Blanch the grape leaves in the hot water for 5 minutes until pliable.  Drain then trim the stems and any hard veins from the leaves.  Pat dry with paper towels.

To assemble the dolmades, lay a grape leaf on a work surface, shiny-side down.  Put 2 tablespoons of the rice filling near the stem end of the leaf.  Fold the stem end over the filling, then fold both sides toward the middle, and roll up into a cigar -- it should be snug but not overly tight because the rice will swell once it is fully cooked.  Squeeze lightly in the palm of your hand to secure the roll.  Repeat with remaining grape leaves and filling.

Place the dolmades in a large Dutch oven or wide deep skillet, seam-side down in a single layer.  Pour the remaining cup of broth, remaining olive oil, and the lemon juice over the dolmades, the liquid should reach halfway up the rolls, add some water if necessary.  Cover the pan and simmer over low heat for 30 to 40 minutes, until the dolmades are tender when pierced with a fork.  Serve warm, at room temperature or cool.

This recipe yields about 30 dolmades.

               Summer Rolls With Sweet Chili Dipping Sauce

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Spring/Summer Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  Vietnamese cellophane noodles -- cooked according
                        to package directions
  2               cups  bean sprouts
  2                     carrots -- julienned
  1              large  beet -- julienned
  1                     fresh red chile -- cut in circles
  2                     handfuls fresh cilantro -- hand-torn
     3/4           cup  chopped unsalted peanuts
  2          teaspoons  dark sesame oil
  1                     lime -- juiced
                        Sea salt -- to taste
  20                    round rice paper wrappers - (8" dia)
  40                    mint leaves
                        === SWEET CHILI DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
     1/4           cup  hot water
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                     lime -- juiced
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  red chili paste
                        = (such as sambal)

Put the cellophane noodles, vegetables, cilantro and peanuts in a large bowl; toss with sesame oil and lime juice to give the filling some flavor; season with salt and pepper.

Pour 3 cups of hot, not boiling water in a large shallow bowl.  One at a time, immerse the rice paper wrappers in the hot water for 10 seconds to soften, then place on a slightly damp towel.  The rice paper is very delicate, don't soak them any longer or they will break apart.  Keep them covered while you work to prevent them from drying out and curling.

To form the rolls, lay a rice paper wrapper on a flat surface.  Grab a small amount of the cellophane and vegetable mixture and lay it across the bottom third.  Use less filling than you think you should, if you overstuff the wrapper it will tear.  Carefully fold the bottom of the wrapper up to cover the filling.  Fold in the left and right sides, then tuck and roll it over once.  Lay 2 mint leaves on top, then tuck and roll it over to close the whole thing up like a tight cigar.  The mint leaves should show through the transparent rice paper.  Arrange the finished rolls on a platter and cover with a damp towel.

Sweet Chili Dipping Sauce:  In a blender, puree the rice wine vinegar, fish sauce, hot water, sugar, lime juice, garlic, and chili paste until combined.  Pour into a small bowl and serve with the summer rolls.  (Makes 1 cup)

This recipe yields 20 rolls.

Put the cellophane noodles, vegetables, cilantro and peanuts in a large bowl; toss with sesame oil and lime juice to give the filling some flavor; season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour 3 cups of hot, not boiling water in a large shallow bowl.  One at a time, immerse the rice paper wrappers in the hot water for 10 seconds to soften, then place on a slightly damp towel.  The rice paper is very delicate, don&apos;t soak them any longer or they will break apart.  Keep them covered while you work to prevent them from drying out and curling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To form the rolls, lay a rice paper wrapper on a flat surface.  Grab a small amount of the cellophane and vegetable mixture and lay it across the bottom third.  Use less filling than you think you should, if you overstuff the wrapper it will tear.  Carefully fold the bottom of the wrapper up to cover the filling.  Fold in the left and right sides, then tuck and roll it over once.  Lay 2 mint leaves on top, then tuck and roll it over to close the whole thing up like a tight cigar.  The mint leaves should show through the transparent rice paper.  Arrange the finished rolls on a platter and cover with a damp towel.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sweet Chili Dipping Sauce:  In a blender, puree the rice wine vinegar, fish sauce, hot water, sugar, lime juice, garlic, and chili paste until combined.  Pour into a small bowl and serve with the summer rolls.  (Makes 1 cup)

                 Swedish Meatballs With Lingonberry Sauce

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatballs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fresh bread crumbs -- dried out
     3/4           cup  milk
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4                     shallots -- minced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  caraway seeds -- toasted and ground
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  ground beef
  1              pound  ground pork
  1              large  egg
  1                     handful fresh flat-leaf parsley -- chopped, plus
                        more for garnish
  1                     handful fresh dill -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth
     3/4           cup  sour cream
     1/4           cup  lingonberry or red currant jam -- plus
                        more for serving

In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs and the milk; stir with a fork and let stand for 5 minutes.

Put 3 tablespoons of the butter in a small skillet and let it melt over medium heat.  Add the shallots, garlic, and caraway; season with salt and pepper.  Saute until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes.

Put the ground beef and pork in a large bowl.  Add the sweated shallot mixture, egg, parsley, and dill; season with salt and pepper.  Squeeze the milk out of the soaked bread crumbs, add the bread to the meat mixture, and mix well using your hands.

Pinch off about 1/2 cup worth of the meat mixture and roll it around in your moistened hands to shape it into a cue ball-sized meatball.  Continue forming the meatballs and putting them on a platter; there should be about 20 meatballs.

Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over moderate heat.  When the foam starts to subside, add the meatballs in batches so you don't overcrowd the pan.  Saute the meatballs until well-browned on all sides, about 7 minutes total.  Remove the meatballs to a platter lined with paper towels as they are done.

Discard most of the fat from the skillet and return it to the heat.  Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and swirl it around to coat the pan.  Sprinkle in the flour, and stir with a wooden spoon to dissolve into the fat.  Pour in the chicken broth, and stir with a wooden spoon to loosen the bits from the bottom of the pan.  Simmer and stir until the liquid is reduced and a sauce starts to form; season with salt and pepper.

Lower the heat and stir in the sour cream.  Return the meatballs to the sauce and stir in 1/4 cup of the lingonberry jam until combined.  Simmer until the sauce thickens slightly and the meatballs are heated through, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Shower with chopped parsley and transfer to a serving bowl.  Serve the Swedish meatballs with additional lingonberry jam on the side.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dry mustard
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper

     1/4           cup  boiling water
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  heavy cream

Place all the ingredients in the container of a blender, blend for 1 minute.  Scrape down the sides of the blender with a rubber spatula and process for 30 seconds longer.  The mustard should be a little thicker than heavy cream.

Store in glass jar, well-sealed, in the refrigerator and let the flavors marry for at least a day before using.  The longer it sits, the better it tastes; it also will get thicker and more yellow.

This recipe yields 12 ounces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             pounds  bone-in skin-on smoked ham - (to 10)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              bunch  fresh sage leaves
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- cut in chunks
  2                     tangerines -- sliced thin,
                        and seeds removed
  2               cups  tangerine juice
  2               cups  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  water
     1/4      teaspoon  whole cloves
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  1 1/2         pounds  carrots -- peeled

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Put the ham in a large roasting pan, fat-side up.  Using a sharp knife, score the ham with cuts across the skin, about 2-inches apart and 1/2-inch deep.  Cut diagonally down the slashes to form a diamond pattern; season the meat generously with salt and pepper.  Chop about 8 of the sage leaves and put it in a bowl; mix with the oil to make a paste.  Rub the sage-oil all over the ham, being sure to get the flavor into all the slits.  Bake the ham for 2 hours.  Now there is plenty of time to bang-out the tangerine glaze.

For the glaze:  Place a saucepan over medium heat.  Add the chunks of butter, tangerines, tangerine juice, brown sugar, water, and spices.  Slowly cook the liquid down to a syrupy glaze; this should take about 30 to 40 minutes.

After the ham has being going for a couple of hours, pour the tangerine glaze all over it, with the pieces of fruit and all.  Scatter the remaining sage leaves on top and stick the ham back in the oven and continue to cook for 1 1/2 hours, basting with the juices every 30 minutes.

Scatter the carrots around the ham and coat in the tangerine glaze.  Stick the ham once again back in the oven and cook for a final 30 minutes, until the carrots are tender, the ham is dark and crispy, and the whole thing is glistening with a sugary glaze.

Set the ham on a cutting board to rest before carving.  Serve the carrots and tangerine glaze on the side.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  large dried white beans
                        = (such as corona beans)
  3                     bay leaves
  3                     garlic cloves
                        All-purpose flour -- for dredging
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced pancetta
  6                     fresh sage leaves

Put the dried beans in a large bowl and cover with cold water.  Soak the beans overnight in the refrigerator.

Drain the soaked beans, place them in a large pot and cover with fresh cold water.  Put the beans over medium-high heat and bring to a boil.  Toss in the bay leaves and garlic.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 1 1/2 hours until tender.  Drain the cooked beans and spread them out on a sheet pan to cool slightly.

Put about 1/2 cup of flour in a shallow platter and season it with salt and pepper; mix with a fork to distribute evenly.  Toss the beans in the seasoned flour to coat completely.

Place a large skillet over medium-high heat and coat with the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the pancetta, fry for a couple of minutes to crisp it up.  Toss in the sage leaves and fry for about 1 minute.  Remove the pancetta and sage to some paper towels; now you have a flavor base.

Shake off excess flour from the beans and put them in the pan in a single layer.  Fry the beans for a good 10 minutes to form a golden crust on the outside of the beans, tossing to cook both sides.   Return the pancetta and fried sage to the pan, stir everything together, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  arctic char - (2 to 3 lbs) -- gutted, scaled,
                        gills and fins removed, head and tail
                        intact
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     handfuls mixed fresh herbs
                        = (basil, thyme, tarragon)
  1                     small bulb fennel -- sliced, and
                        fronds reserved
  4                     bay leaves
  1                     lemon -- cut into 4 slices
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        === PISTOU ===
  2                     anchovy fillets
  2                     garlic cloves
  1                cup  fresh basil leaves - (packed)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  1                     vine-ripe tomato -- seeded, chopped
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Rinse the fish well inside and out and pat dry with paper towels.  Lay the big-boy out on a large rimmed sheet pan; cut 4 gashes crosswise on both sides of the fish, slicing all the way down to the bone.

Season the arctic char with a generous amount of salt and pepper, inside the cavity and all over the skin.  Stuff the mixed herbs and fennel inside the body of the fish.  Tuck a lemon slice and bay leaf inside each of the slits.  Rub a decent amount of olive oil on all parts of the fish.

Roast for 30 to 40 minutes, until the skin is crispy and the fish itself is flaky.

Transfer to a serving platter and garnish with fennel fronds.  Serve with Pistou sauce.

Pistou:  Combine all ingredients in a food processor and process until the garlic is finely chopped. Serve at room temperature with grilled or roasted fish.  (Makes 1 cup)
