Recipe By     :Cheryl Alters Jamison and Bill Jamison
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chili                           Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     bacon slices -- chopped
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  4                     plump garlic cloves -- minced
  4             pounds  chuck roast -- trimmed of surface
                        fat, and cut into 1/2" cubes
     1/2           cup  good-quality chili powder
  1         tablespoon  cumin seeds -- toasted and ground
                        (or 1 tbspn of ground cumin)
  1         tablespoon  mole paste -- available in
                        specialty food stores (optional)
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano (preferably Mexican) -- crumbled
  2          teaspoons  salt -- or more to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper -- or more to taste
  2          teaspoons  cider vinegar
  2               cups  beef stock (preferably homemade)
  1         tablespoon  masa harina - (to 2 tbspns) -- (optional)
                        === GARNISHES ===
                        Chopped onions
                        Minced fresh or pickled jalapeÒos
                        Saltine crackers

Fry the bacon in a Dutch oven or other large heavy pot over medium heat until brown and crisp.  Remove the bacon from the drippings with a slotted spoon and reserve. 

Add the onion to the drippings and saute briefly until softened.  Add the garlic and saute until the onion is translucent.  Stir in the beef and saute until it loses its raw color.  Add the reserved bacon, chili powder, cumin, mole paste, oregano, salt, pepper and vinegar.  Add just enough stock to cover.  Reduce the heat to very low and cook uncovered for about 3 hours, stirring about every 30 minutes.  Add stock as needed to keep the mixture from getting dry and sticking. 

In the last 30 minutes of cooking, stir in the masa harina, a couple teaspoons at a time, to thicken or "tighten" the chili.  Serve the chili immediately or let it cool, cover and refrigerate overnight, and reheat.  Serve the chili steaming hot in bowls, with garnishes as you wish. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  fresh spinach leaves - (abt 7 cups)
                        (or 10 oz frozen chopped spinach, thawed)
  2 1/4           cups  evaporated skim milk -- chilled
  1              small  onion -- cut up
  2          teaspoons  snipped fresh dill
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried dillweed)
  1           teaspoon  lemon-pepper seasoning
  8             ounces  plain fat-free yogurt
     1/4           cup  slivered almonds -- toasted
                        Fresh dill -- (optional)
                        Rose petals -- (optional)

In a blender container or food processor bowl combine about one-third of the fresh spinach or half of the undrained thawed spinach, 1 1/2 cups of the evaporated milk, the onion, dill, and lemon-pepper seasoning.  Cover and blend or process until nearly smooth.  Add another third of the fresh spinach (if you're using fresh); cover and blend or process till smooth.  Pour the mixture into a large storage container. 

In the blender container or food processor bowl combine remaining fresh or thawed spinach, remaining evaporated milk, and the yogurt; cover and blend or process until nearly smooth.  Stir into the mixture in the storage container.  Cover and chill until serving time. 

To serve, ladle soup into bowls, top with almonds.  If desired garnish with fresh dill and rose petals.

Comments:  Almonds, yogurt, and evaporated milk make this a hearty, rich-tasting meal. 

To use rose petals as a garnish, make sure they are not poisonous and that they are free from pesticides.  Gently wash them and pat dry with paper towels. 

Make-Ahead Tip:  Up to 24 hours ahead, prepare soup mixture; cover and chill.  Stir before serving.

Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cups  sliced onions
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  pearled or hulled barley
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh sage
                        (or 1 tspn dried sage)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or more to taste
  10              cups  water or vegetable stock -- more as needed
  1              large  russet potato -- peeled, and
                        chopped into 1" cubes
  2               cups  carrot rounds 1/2" thick
  1        small bunch  kale -- leaves cut from the
                        stem and stalk - (abt 6 cups)
  1 1/4           cups  cooked and rinsed kidney beans
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice - (1/2 lemon)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  4           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil

In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat and add the onions.  Cook the onions 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, then add the garlic, barley, sage, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 7 cups of the water or stock.  Cover the pan, bring the stew to a boil and turn the heat to low.  Let the stew simmer for 25 minutes, then add the potato, carrots and 2 cups more water or stock.  Cover the pan again and let the stew simmer for 10 minutes more. 

Add kale to the soup with 1 cup more water.  Simmer 10 minutes more and add more water if the stew seems too dry. 

Add the cooked beans, stirring well, then add lemon juice.  The stew should be thick, like a pilaf.  Taste and add salt and pepper, keeping in mind you will be adding Parmesan cheese in the bowl. 

To serve, ladle into bowls, sprinkle with Parmesan and drizzle with olive oil. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Doesn't this sound good for a cold winter day?  Be careful not to oversalt.  If you cook the beans ahead, this dish will go together in about 45 minutes.  Collards work well in this dish, too.

Categories    : Beef                            Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  beef stew meat cubes
  6        tablespoons  flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2               cups  chopped onion
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  red wine
  3               cups  beef broth
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1                cup  crushed tomatoes
  3              large  red or white potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  4                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 2" lengths
  3               ribs  celery -- peeled, and
                        cut into 2" lengths
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley

Trim excess gristle and fat from meat.  Don't worry about getting every bit.  Season flour with salt and pepper.  Dust meat with flour to dry surface.  Heat oil in large Dutch oven or deep skillet on medium-high heat.  Brown meat in batches; do not crowd pan.  Remove to bowl; reserve. 

Saute onion in residue oil to brown lightly, about four minutes at medium-high.  Stir in garlic and any remaining seasoned flour for a few seconds.  Add red wine; bring to a boil to cook off alcohol. 

Return meat and any liquid to pot.  Add beef broth, Worcestershire, tomatoes.  Bring to boil.  Reduce to simmer, covered, for one hour.  Add potatoes, carrots, celery and parsley; simmer one hour more or until tender. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                     Bean Soup With Bacon And Oregano

Recipe By     :Diane Morgan, Dan Taggart and Kathleen Taggart
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  Spicy White Bean Stew With Roasted Red
                        Peppers - (to 6 cups) -- (see recipe)
  2               cups  milk
  4             slices  bacon -- cut 1/4"-wide pieces
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
     1/2           cup  fresh parsley leaves - (lightly packed) -- coarsely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a blender or food processor, puree the bean stew and milk, in batches if necessary. 

In a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat, saute the bacon until almost crisp.  Add the garlic and saute until the bacon is crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon and garlic to a plate. 

Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat.  Pour the bean puree into the pan and add the bacon mixture and oregano.  Bring the soup to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to prevent the soup from sticking and burning.  Reduce heat so that the soup just simmers, cover and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the parsley, salt and pepper.  Serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This soup makes great use of the spicy white bean stew.  For a vegetarian option, eliminate the bacon.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  onion -- coarsely chopped
  1              piece  ginger root - (2" long) -- peeled
  2             pounds  beef bones -- rinsed
  6                     star anise
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1            package  dry flat rice noodles (pho) - (16 oz)
  1              pound  boneless lean tender beef (preferably
                        sirloin or filet mignon) -- sliced as thinly
                        as possible
  3                     scallions -- thinly sliced
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  20            sprigs  cilantro
  1                cup  bean sprouts
  10            sprigs  basil
                        Fresh red or green chili pepper -- thinly sliced
  1                     lime or lemon -- quartered
                        Fish sauce -- to taste
                        Hoisin sauce
                        Hot chili sauce

Preheat the broiler. 

Broil the onion and ginger, turning so all sides are charred.  Remove from the heat.  Using the back of a cleaver or the side of a chef's knife, smash the ginger; set aside. 

Meanwhile, place the bones in a large stock pot and add enough water to cover.  Bring the mixture to a boil; immediately pour off and discard the water.  Add 12 cups fresh water and bring to a boil, skimming any foam that forms.  Stir in the broiled onion and ginger along with the star anise, salt and sugar.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes. 

In a medium bowl, soak the noodles in cold water to cover; set aside for 10 minutes.  Drain and set aside. 

Meanwhile, in large stock pot bring 2 quarts water to a boil.  Add the drained noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are tender, about 7 minutes.  Drain the noodles and rinse under cold running water; set aside. 

Strain the beef broth, discarding the bones, vegetables and seasonings.  Return the broth to the pot and bring to a boil. 

To serve, divide the noodles evenly among large individual serving bowls.  Arrange the thinly sliced raw beef, scallions, onion and the minced leaves from 10 cilantro sprigs on top of the noodles.  Pour enough boiling hot broth over the noodles to cover.  Set aside for a few minutes until the broth has cooked the thinly sliced beef. 

Sprinkle the soup with the bean sprouts, basil leaves, remaining cilantro sprigs and chili pepper.  Serve immediately with lime and lemon quarters, fish sauce, hoisin sauce and hot chili sauce on the side. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  To thinly slice the beef, partially freeze the uncut beef for about 35 minutes. 

This is a beef noodle soup very similar to the traditional pho.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a medium bowl, soak the noodles in cold water to cover; set aside for 10 minutes.  Drain and set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Meanwhile, in large stock pot bring 2 quarts water to a boil.  Add the drained noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are tender, about 7 minutes.  Drain the noodles and rinse under cold running water; set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Strain the beef broth, discarding the bones, vegetables and seasonings.  Return the broth to the pot and bring to a boil. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To serve, divide the noodles evenly among large individual serving bowls.  Arrange the thinly sliced raw beef, scallions, onion and the minced leaves from 10 cilantro sprigs on top of the noodles.  Pour enough boiling hot broth over the noodles to cover.  Set aside for a few minutes until the broth has cooked the thinly sliced beef. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Sprinkle the soup with the bean sprouts, basil leaves, remaining cilantro sprigs and chili pepper.  Serve immediately with lime and lemon quarters, fish sauce, hoisin sauce and hot chili sauce on the side. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  To thinly slice the beef, partially freeze the uncut beef for about 35 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This is a beef noodle soup very similar to the traditional pho.

                     Best Of Both Worlds Chicken Soup

Recipe By     :Evelyn Rose and Judi Rose
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         large  stewing chicken -- all visible fat
                        removed
  2                     roast chicken carcasses
  3             quarts  water
  2          teaspoons  sea salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  2              large  onions -- peeled, halved
  3              large  carrots -- peeled, and
                        halved lengthwise
  3                     celery stalks -- leaves and
                        top 2" of ribs only
  1              sprig  curly parsley
  1                     ripe tomato
  2              large  carrots -- peeled, diced
  1                     fat leek, 3" of white part -- finely shredded
                        Grandma Rose's Matzo Balls -- (see recipe)
                        Egg noodles, medium -- cooked according to
                        instructions and drained

Put the stewing chicken and broken-up carcasses in a large, heavy soup pot with 3 quarts of water, and the sea salt and pepper.  Cover and bring to the boil.  Remove any froth with a large, wet metal spoon.  Add the onions, carrots, celery, parsley and tomato.  Return to a boil, then reduce the heat so the liquid is barely bubbling.  Cover and simmer for 3 hours. 

Remove the stewing chicken and reserve for another use.  Discard the roast chicken carcasses.  Strain the soup into a large bowl or freezer container and discard the vegetables.  Cook, cover and freeze overnight. 

When ready to serve, remove congealed fat and return soup to a pot.  Add the diced carrots and shredded leek.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes or until the vegetables are bite-tender.  Garnish with matzo balls and noodles. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  Grandma Rose's Matzo Balls are in "Mother and Daughter Jewish Cooking"  (William Morrow, $25) by Evelyn Rose and Judi Rose.  While the dumplings may be traditional Jewish fare, the Roses' Best of Both Worlds Chicken Soup is less so.  Unlike earlier versions in which the soup was crowned with golden beads of fat, this soup is nearly fat-free.

                Black Bean Chili With Pork And Tomatillos

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chili                           Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried black beans
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2             pounds  fresh tomatillos -- husked
  3                     red onions
  2               cans  green chiles - (7 oz ea)
  5                     garlic cloves
  3                     serrano chiles
  2 1/2         pounds  boneless pork butt
                        Salt - to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              quart  chicken broth
  3               cups  water -- (to 4 cups)
  2          teaspoons  salt - (to 3 tspns)
  3               ears  yellow corn
                        Sour cream -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 

Soak the beans overnight in a large pot of water, or do a quick soak: Place beans in a large pot and cover with twice as much water.  Bring to a boil, then immediately cover and take off the heat.  Let sit for 1 hour. 

Meanwhile, place the tomatillos in a lightly oiled roasting pan.  Roast until soft, 20 to 25 minutes. 

Chop the onions and green chiles into large dice.  Mince the garlic and serranos.  If you don't want too much heat, seed the chiles. 

Cut the pork into 1-inch cubes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 

Place a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, then add enough of the remaining oil to cover the bottom of the pan.  When the oil is hot, add the meat (work in batches) and brown well on all sides.  Remove meat from the pan with a slotted spoon. 

Drain all but 1 tablespoon oil from the pan.  Add the onions and cook, scraping up the brown bits on the bottom of the pan.  Saute for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. 

Add the garlic and serranos; saute for a few minutes.  Add the canned chiles and the tomatillos, crushing the tomatillos into chunks with a spoon. 

Add the meat and beans to the pot, then add the broth and 3 cups water.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a steady simmer and cook for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the extra cup of water as needed to allow beans enough liquid to simmer freely. 

Cut off corn kernels with a sharp knife.  Set aside. 

After 45 minutes, check the beans -- they should still be somewhat firm.  Add 2 teaspoons salt, then simmer until the beans are tender, 15 to 25 minutes. 

When the beans are tender, add the corn kernels.  Taste for seasoning.  Serve garnished with sour cream. 

This recipe yields 12 servings.

                     Black Bean Soup Saint Louis Club

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  black beans
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  1                     carrot -- finely chopped
  6               cups  chicken stock
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chicken-flavored soup base -- see * Note
  1                     smoked ham hock
     3/4           cup  diced ham
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Chicken-flavored soup base is a concentrated flavoring.  Different brands vary in flavor and in salt content.  Saint Louis Club uses Minor's brand, with no monosodium glutamate (MSG). 

The recipe was tested with good results with chicken-flavored Better Than Bouillon, a brand of soup base found at a Dierbergs store in the soup aisle near the bouillons. 

Soak beans in cold water overnight, filling pot with water to about 3 inches above beans. 

Drain beans; set aside. 

To sweat vegetables:  Melt butter in a heavy stockpot.  Add onion and carrots.  Place a sheet of aluminum foil or parchment paper over vegetables, then cover pot with lid.  Cook over medium heat until vegetables are soft, about 5 to 8 minutes.  Do not brown.  Discard foil or parchment. 

Stir in chicken stock and chicken base.  Add ham hock.  Cook until ham hock is tender, about 30 minutes. 

Add beans; cook until tender, about 30 to 45 minutes more. 

Remove ham hock.  When cool enough to handle, remove meat from bone, dice and add to beans.  Stir in diced ham and ground cumin. 

If soup is too thin, crush some beans in the pot or remove some beans and puree, adding them back to the soup.  If soup is too thick, add more chicken stock.  Season with salt and pepper to taste. 

This recipe yields 6 generous servings. 

Comments:  This soup has been a longtime menu item at the Saint Louis Club, a private dining club at 7701 Forsyth Boulevard.  Pierre Chambrin, executive chef, says it was already a favorite when he arrived at the club in 1994 after serving as White House chef under President George Bush.  The club serves the soup with a garnish of red onions soaked in red wine vinegar served on the side.

                      Carrot, Ginger And Orange Soup

Recipe By     :n/aMarcy Goldman
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1                cup  finely-diced onion
  2             medium  garlic clove -- minced
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger root
  1             medium  potato -- peeled and shredded
  2             pounds  baby carrots -- (may substitute
                        peeled sliced carrots)
  4               cups  water
  2        tablespoons  frozen orange juice concentrate
     1/2      teaspoon  salt - (to 1 tspn) -- or to taste
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame seed oil -- plus additional
                        to taste
                        === GARNISHES ===
  1              pinch  dried chili pepper flakes
                        Minced orange zest
                        Toasted sesame seeds -- see * Note
                        Cilantro leaves

* Note:  To toast sesame seeds, heat them in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, shaking the pan occasionally, until golden and fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes.  Watch the seeds carefully because they burn easily. 

In a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat, heat the oil.  Add the onion and garlic and cook just until they soften but do not brown.  Add the ginger, potato, carrots and water.  Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until the carrots are tender, about 20 minutes. 

Carefully transfer the vegetables and the cooking liquid to a blender or food processor.  (You will need to process the mixture in batches.)  Process until pureed. 

Return the mixture to the saucepan.  Add the orange juice concentrate, salt and pepper to taste and the sesame oil and heat over low heat, stirring occasionally, until warm.  Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary. 

Divide the soup evenly among 6 soup bowls.  Garnish each bowl with chili pepper flakes, orange zest, sesame seeds and cilantro leaves. 

Comments:  When it comes to soups, I prefer hot to chilled.  But as the days grow warmer, hearty stews and chowders no longer hold the same allure.  So I created this light, refreshing soup, which sure fits the bill.

                        Chickpea Soup With Sausage

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  chickpeas -- soaked overnight in
                        water to cover if time allows
  5                     garlic cloves -- peeled and sliced
  3             sprigs  rosemary or thyme
  1             medium  to large carrot -- peeled, and
                        diced small
  1                     celery rib -- peeled, and
                        diced small
  1             medium  onion -- peeled, and
                        diced small
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2         pound  sausage -- grilled or broiled,
                        and thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- or to taste

Combine chickpeas, sliced garlic and rosemary in a large saucepan with fresh water to cover by at least 2 inches.  Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer, partly covered, for at least 1 hour, or until chickpeas are fairly tender.  Add additional water if necessary, and skim any foam that rises to the surface. 

Scoop out and discard herbs.  Add carrot, celery, onion, and salt and pepper to taste to pan.  Continue to cook until chickpeas and vegetables are soft, at least 20 minutes longer.  Remove about half the chickpeas and vegetables; carefully puree in a blender, adding cooking liquid as needed. 

Return puree to pan; stir.  Add minced garlic and sausage.  Reheat, adding more water if the mixture is too thick.  Taste, adjust seasoning and serve, drizzled with olive oil. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Variation:  To use canned chickpeas, drain and rinse 4 cups and combine with 6 cups chicken or vegetable stock and the vegetables.  Cook until vegetables are tender, then proceed as above. 

Comments:  Chickpeas can almost make a soup on their own.  Not all soups need to start with stock to taste rich and full.  Chickpeas, more than any other legume, exude so much flavor into plain water as they cook that they can almost make a soup on their own.  Garlic, herbs and a few aromatic vegetables add another dimension, but the trick to a superb soup is even simpler: puree some of the cooked chickpeas, stir them back in, and the soup becomes sublimely if deceptively creamy. 

This is a wonderful vegetarian soup, but it can be easily turned into a meatier meal by adding leftover chicken, beef, pork or lamb or something cooked especially for the soup, such as pan-grilled sausage, shrimp or more vegetables. 

Probably the most obvious question about this recipe is whether it will work with canned chickpeas.  The answer is yes -- within limits.  The liquid in which most canned chickpeas are packed is not the light, flavorful broth that results from simmering the legumes at home, but instead is a heavy substance whose flavor is mysterious at best.  Canned chickpeas should be rinsed before using; they can then be combined with water or, better still, chicken or vegetable stock before simmering with the other seasonings. 

Chickpeas can be cooked without being soaked, but they will cook more quickly if they are soaked 6 to 12 hours.  Either way, the cooking time is unpredictable, depending largely on how much moisture the chickpeas have lost in storage (older beans, being drier, require longer cooking).  Soaked chickpeas will take about an hour and a half to turn tender; dry ones, 30 minutes longer.

Categories    : Fruit                           Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1                cup  fruity white wine such as Chenin Blanc,
                        Semillon or Gerwurztraminer
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1                     ripe melon such as cantaloupe or honeydew -- halved, seeded,
                        peeled, cubed and chilled - (abt 2 lbs)
  1                     ice cube
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro (may substitute
                        mint or basil)

In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the water, wine, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of the lemon zest.  Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until the liquid is reduced by about 1/3, about 10 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat; set aside to cool to slightly.  Transfer the pan to the freezer for 15 minutes. 

In a blender or food processor, combine 1/2 of the wine mixture, 1/2 of the melon cubes and the ice cube and puree until smooth.  Pour the soup into a tureen or bowl and set aside.  Repeat with the remaining wine mixture and melon cubes and add to the first batch.  Stir in the remaining 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest and 1 1/2 tablespoons of the cilantro. 

Ladle the soup into individual bowls and sprinkle with the remaining cilantro.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  The color of your soup, of course, will depend upon the color of the flesh of the melon that you choose.  The soft salmon of a cantaloupe, the palest lime of a honeydew will both show off the bright green specks of cilantro, added at the finish.  For a slightly different finish, you might choose fresh mint or basil.  From the Small Dishes, Soups and Salads chapter.

Categories    : Chowder                         Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     red bell peppers - (abt 3/4 lb)
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper
  1                can  whole clams - (10 oz) -- undrained
  1                     bacon slice
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onion
  1 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  cubed (1/2") peeled baking potato -- (abt 2 lbs)
  2               cups  fresh corn kernels - (abt 4 ears)
  1                cup  chardonnay or other dry white wine
  2            bottles  clam juice - (8 0z)
     3/4           cup  half-and-half
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat broiler.  Cut bell peppers in half lengthwise; discard seeds and membranes.  Place pepper halves, skin-sides up, and jalapeÒo pepper on a foil-lined baking sheet; flatten bell peppers with hand.  Broil 10 minutes or until blackened.  Place peppers in a zip-top plastic bag; seal.  Let stand 5 minutes. 

Discard seeds and membranes from jalapeÒo pepper.  Peel and chop bell peppers and jalapeÒo pepper; set aside.  Drain clams in a colander over a bowl, reserving liquid. 

Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp.  Remove bacon from pan, reserving drippings in pan.  Crumble bacon; set aside.  Add chopped onion to pan; saute 10 minutes.  Add flour; cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Stir in reserved clam liquid, potato, corn, wine and clam juice; bring to a boil.  Partially cover, reduce heat, and simmer 25 minutes or until potato is tender. 

Stir in roasted peppers, clams, half-and-half, green onions, basil and black pepper.  Cook 5 minutes or until thoroughly heated.  Sprinkle with crumbled bacon. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Traditional Northeast chowders are nothing more than cream, fish and butter with a few crackers thrown in.  Every ingredient imaginable has crept in and out of chowders through the years, but one constant remains: cream.

  1 1/2           cups  flour
  2        tablespoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  sugar

  2               cups  fresh cape gooseberries (ground cherries)

  1        large piece  peeled fresh ginger
     1/2                cinnamon stick
     1/4      teaspoon  allspice powder
  3                     black peppercorns - (to 4)
     1/2           cup  honey
  1                cup  cornstarch -- mixed with

Categories    : Chowder                         Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  chicken broth
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh or frozen corn kernels
     1/4         pound  thick-sliced bacon -- cut 1/2" dice
  1             medium  onion - (abt 1/2 lb) -- cut 1/2" dice
  1              large  red bell pepper - (abt 8 oz) -- cut 1/2" dice
  2              large  celery stalks -- cut 1/2" dice
  2             pounds  russet potatoes -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2               cups  milk
  2               cups  heavy (whipping) cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Hot pepper sauce such as Tabasco -- to taste
  4             ounces  butter - (1 stick)
  2 1/2         pounds  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
     1/4           cup  chopped chives

In a medium pot, combine the chicken broth and 1 pound of the corn.  Bring the broth to a boil; immediately remove the pan from the heat.  Working in batches, transfer the corn mixture to a blender or food processor and process until the corn is almost pureed but slightly chunky.  Set aside. 

In a 6- to 8-quart pot over medium heat, saute the bacon pieces until the fat has been rendered and the bacon pieces are golden brown.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon pieces to a platter lined with paper towels to drain.  Set aside. 

Heat the skillet with the bacon drippings over medium heat and add the onion, bell pepper and celery.  Cook, stirring, until the vegetables have softened, 10 to 12 minutes.  Add the pureed corn mixture along with the remaining 1/2 pound corn kernels, the potatoes, milk, heavy cream and salt and pepper to taste.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat so the chowder is just barely at a simmer.  Simmer the chowder until the potatoes are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. 

Add hot pepper sauce and additional salt to taste, if needed. 

Just before serving, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter.  Add some of the shrimp, being careful not to crowd the pan.  Saute until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer the shrimp to a plate.  Repeat with the remaining butter and shrimp. 

Stir the chives and bacon into the hot soup.  Ladle the soup into serving bowls and add 5 or 6 shrimp to each bowl.  Serve immediately.  If serving as a buffet, place the dish of sauteed shrimp next to the soup and let guests serve themselves. 

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings. 

Comments:  Shrimp can be difficult to serve in any kind of soup or stew.  It takes only a few minutes of overcooking to turn the shrimp tough.  To get around this, this chowder is prepared and then, just before serving, the shrimp are sauteed in very hot butter.  The shrimp are added to the chowder as it is served.  This all sounds like more work than it is, especially since the shrimp cook in just 3 or 4 minutes. 

Do-ahead tip:  The soup is best the first day, but can be prepared a day in advance if necessary.  Freeze for longer storage.  The shrimp can be peeled and deveined hours in advance.  Refrigerate until ready to cook.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     bacon slices
  2               cups  chopped leek
  1                cup  chopped onion
  3               cups  water
  2               cups  chopped peeled baking potato -- (abt 12 oz)
  1                cup  dried lentils
     3/4           cup  chopped carrot
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                can  fat-free less-sodium chicken broth -- (16 oz)
     1/2           cup  half-and-half
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry

Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp.  Remove bacon from pan, reserving drippings in pan.  Crumble bacon; set aside.  Add leek and onion to pan; saute 4 minutes.  Add water, potato, lentils, carrot, salt and broth; bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 1 hour or until vegetables are tender.  Place vegetable mixture in a blender or food processor; process until smooth.  Return pureed mixture to pan; stir in half-and-half and sherry.  Cook until thoroughly heated.  Sprinkle with bacon. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  This is no ordinary lentil soup -- half-and-half creates a satiny finish and creamy body, making typically watery lentils truly sublime.  This is a great main-dish soup served with a green salad and rustic bread.  It won't have the same smoky taste, but you can go vegetarian by substituting 2 tablespoons vegetable oil for the bacon drippings and vegetable broth for the chicken broth.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp.  Remove bacon from pan, reserving drippings in pan.  Crumble bacon; set aside.  Add leek and onion to pan; saute 4 minutes.  Add water, potato, lentils, carrot, salt and broth; bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 1 hour or until vegetables are tender.  Place vegetable mixture in a blender or food processor; process until smooth.  Return pureed mixture to pan; stir in half-and-half and sherry.  Cook until thoroughly heated.  Sprinkle with bacon.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 6 servings.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  This is no ordinary lentil soup -- half-and-half creates a satiny finish and creamy body, making typically watery lentils truly sublime.  This is a great main-dish soup served with a green salad and rustic bread.  It won&apos;t have the same smoky taste, but you can go vegetarian by substituting 2 tablespoons vegetable oil for the bacon drippings and vegetable broth for the chicken broth.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick)
  1                cup  water
  1           teaspoon  salt -- plus more
                        to salt cooking water
  1                cup  flour
  3                     eggs

In a saucepan, bring the butter, water and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil.  Add the flour all at once, stirring vigorously.  When the dough forms a smooth, shiny ball that comes away from the sides of the pan, remove from the heat.  Cool 10 minutes. 

Mix in the eggs, one at a time, beating well. 

Bring 2 inches of water to a simmer in a wide, shallow skillet and add 1 teaspoon salt per quart of water.  Shape the dough into 40 (3/4-inch or smaller) balls.  Use 2 teaspoons or a small scoop. 

As you finish shaping a dumpling, drop it into the simmering water and repeat as the others are being completed.  As you're working, bring the water to a boil; as soon as it boils, add a small amount of cold water.  Return to a boil and repeat three times, adding water and bringing the water to a boil again.  The dumplings will then be done all at one time.  Lift dumplings out of the water and drain in a sieve.  Dumplings can be made a day ahead of time and then warmed in the soup. 

This recipe yields 40 dumplings.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  water
  1                cup  dried red lentils
  2               cups  chopped onions
  2               cups  chopped potatoes
  8              large  garlic cloves -- peeled, left whole
  1         tablespoon  canola or other vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  turmeric
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine water, lentils, onions, potatoes and garlic in soup pot.  Cover and bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until everything is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from heat. 

In small saucepan on low heat, warm oil until it is hot but not smoking.  Add cumin, turmeric and salt; cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes, until cumin is fragrant.  Take care not to scorch spices.  Set aside for about a minute, or the oil may splatter when added to the soup.  Stir slightly cooled spices into soup and add cilantro. 

Working in small batches, puree soup in blender until smooth.  Add lemon juice.  Return soup to pot and reheat gently.  Add salt and pepper to taste. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  1 1/2    tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     pepper bacon slices -- diced
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1                     yellow onion -- diced
  1              large  fennel bulb -- diced
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  flour
  4               cups  chicken stock
  4              large  potatoes -- diced
                        Kernels cut from 5 ears corn -- (abt 2 cups)
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  cayenne sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a very large stockpot, cook diced bacon until crisp.  Add vegetable oil and heat.  Add onion, fennel, and garlic and saute until tender, about 2 minutes.  Add flour and stir while cooking for about 1 minute.  Slowly add the chicken stock, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.  Add diced potatoes and cook until barely tender. 

Add corn and cream and bring to a boil.  Season with cayenne sauce, salt, and pepper.  Serve hot.  Use less cayenne sauce if you want a less spicy soup. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  This soup is a meal -- lunch or dinner.  Serve it with corn muffins or sourdough bread and everyone will be happy.  I usually make this soup when corn is in season, you can use frozen corn, but don't allow it to cook too long or it will get tough.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     vanilla bean -- halved lengthwise
  1              slice  fresh ginger 1/4"-thick
  1                     star anise -- crushed
  1             2 inch  cinnamon stick - (2" long)
                        (or 1/2 tspn ground cinnamon)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  4               cups  water
                        Juice of 1 orange - (abt 1/2 cup)
  1                     mango or papaya - (1 lb) -- pitted, peeled,
                        and cut into 1/4" dice
  2                     kiwi fruits - (8 oz) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" dice
  1                cup  red berries (such as raspberries, red
                        currants, wild strawberries or small
                        strawberries) -- halved
     1/2        medium  pineapple -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2" dice
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Fresh mint -- (optional)

Combine vanilla bean, ginger, star anise, cinnamon stick (or cinnamon, if using), sugar, water and orange juice in a 4-quart pot with a tight-fitting lid.  Bring mixture to a slow simmer over medium-low heat.  Cover pot and simmer mixture 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and let stand 1 hour. 

Remove and reserve vanilla bean.  Strain syrup through a fine sieve into a large bowl; discard ginger, star anise and cinnamon stick.  Scrape the seeds from each half of the vanilla bean and stir into the strained syrup.  (Do not discard vanilla bean.  Place dry bean in sugar to make vanilla sugar.) 

Stir mango, kiwis, berries, and pineapple into syrup and refrigerate 2 hours.  (Can be made ahead.  Cover and refrigerate up to 4 hours.) 

Divide soup among six chilled serving bowls.  Garnish with mint, if desired. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  This soup is delicate and intriguing because the fruits are served in a light syrup scented with exotic spices.  You make this soup with unusual tropical fruits to keep the conversation going with people guessing what's what, but use whatever fruits you have available.

Recipe By     :Bharti Kirchner
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  finely-chopped onion
  4               cups  chopped seeded tomato - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground turmeric
     1/8      teaspoon  ground red pepper
  2               cans  chickpeas (garbanzo beans) - (15 1/2 oz) -- drained
     1/2      teaspoon  garam masala
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
                        Peanut Rice

Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and saute 5 minutes or until tender.  Stir in tomato and next 5 ingredients (tomato through pepper).  Cook 8 minutes or until thick, stirring occasionally. 

Stir in chickpeas and garam masala; cook for 5 minutes or until thoroughly heated.  Sprinkle each serving with 1 tablespoon cilantro.  Serve over Peanut Rice. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This vegetarian entree is a great introduction to Indian food --- subtly spiced with garam masala, curry and turmeric, the latter two of which can be found in the spice section of your supermarket.  Garam masala, a mixture of ground spices such as cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, coriander, cumin, nutmeg and black peppercorns, is often found in gourmet grocery stores or in the Middle Eastern sections of supermarkets.

                      Garlic Soup With Poached Eggs

Recipe By     :Barbara Kafka
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GARLIC BROTH ===
  3       small  heads  garlic cloves
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  9               cups  water
                        === GARLIC SOUP WITH POACHED EGG ===
  4          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8             slices  French bread 1/4"-thick -- dried
  4                     eggs
                        Grated Parmesan cheese

For the Garlic Broth:  Smash, peel and cut the garlic cloves in half lengthwise and, if necessary, remove the green germ growing through the center. 

In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over low heat.  Stir in the garlic cloves and cook, stirring often, until the outside of the garlic is translucent and cloves are soft, about 20 minutes.  Don't let the garlic brown. 

Pour in the water and bring to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer, uncovered, for 40 minutes.  The garlic will be very tender. 

To eat the broth on its own, season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.  To use as a stock, omit the salt and pepper.  (This makes 8 cups of broth) 

For Garlic Soup With Poached Egg:  In a large, deep frying pan, combine the garlic broth, salt and pepper over medium heat.  Arrange the bread slices around the edge of the pan, slightly overlapping them and leaving a circle about 6 inches in diameter in the center. 

Bring to a boil.  Lower heat so the liquid is at a lively simmer.  Crack the eggs into the pan.  Or, if preferred, crack the eggs one at a time onto a saucer and slide them into the broth. 

Cook just until the whites and the surface of the yolks are set, 3 to 4 minutes.  Spoon broth over the tops of the yolks if they aren't submerged. 

To serve, ladle broth and bread into warm soup bowls and top with eggs.  Pass Parmesan at the table. 

This recipe yields 4 first course servings, or 2 main dish servings.

                        Grandma Rose's Matzo Balls

Recipe By     :Evelyn Rose and Judi Rose
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  rendered chicken-flavored vegetable fat,
                        or soft margarine
     1/2           cup  warm chicken soup or water
  3          teaspoons  sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger -- (optional)
     1/4           cup  ground almonds
  1                cup  matzo meal

Whisk the eggs until fluffy, then stir in the soft fat, the warm soup or water, 1 teaspoon of the salt, pepper, ginger, ground almonds and matzo meal.  Mix thoroughly.  The mixture should look moist and thick but not quite firm enough to form into balls.  If too soft, add a little more meal; if too firm, add water 1 teaspoon at a time until you have the right consistency.  Chill for at least 1 hour, but overnight will do no harm.  The mixture will then firm up. 

Half-fill a 3-quart cooking pot with water and bring to a boil, then add 2 teaspoons of sea salt.  Remove matzo mixture from the refrigerator.  With wet hands, take pieces the size of large walnuts and roll between the palms into balls.  Drop these balls into the boiling water and reduce the heat until the water is simmering.  Cover and simmer for 30 minutes without removing the lid.  Strain the matzo balls from the water with a slotted spoon and lower into the simmering soup.  You can cook the matzo balls in chicken soup rather than in water.  They will absorb some of the soup but with it also its delicious flavors. 

Place two matzo balls into each soup bowl and ladle chicken soup over them. 

Thie recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 

Comments:   You can cook matzo balls in chicken soup rather than in water.  They will absorb some of the soup, and with it some of the flavors.  Matzo balls may be made in advance and frozen for up to 1 month.  Freeze the cooked and drained balls on baking sheets until solid -- about 2 hours -- and store them in plastic bags.  To use, defrost for 1 hour at room temperature, then reheat in the simmering soup.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz) -- undrained
  1             medium  bell pepper -- finely chopped,
                        and divided
  1                cup  finely-chopped cucumber -- divided
     1/2           cup  chopped onion -- divided
  1                cup  croutons -- divided
  2        tablespoons  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  olive or vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  white vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In the bowl of a food processor or blender, place tomatoes, 1/2 cup bell peppers, 1/2 cup cucumber, 1/4 cup onion, 1/2 cup croutons, the broth, oil, cumin, vinegar, salt and pepper.  Cover and blend on medium speed until smooth. 

Pour into medium bowl and refrigerate at least 1 hour.  Serve remaining vegetables and croutons as accompaniments.  Other good additions are yogurt or sour cream and chopped hard-cooked egg. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  What could be easier than uncooked, cold soup based on canned tomatoes?  It's a good chance to hone your chopping skills with a new chef's knife, too.

                   Hot 'N' Fiery Celebration Thai Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  chicken broth
                        (or 4 cups chicken bouillon
                        plus 2 cups water)
     1/4           cup  fish sauce
  6                     garlic cloves -- crushed or minced
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (2" long)
  8                     green onions
  5                     lemon grass stalks
  2               cups  dried whole mushrooms (sold in
                        Oriental stores)
  2                     red peppers
  1              bunch  fresh coriander
  1              bunch  or 1/2 (10 oz) bag fresh spinach
  1              pound  medium-size shrimp -- fresh or frozen
  1           teaspoon  hot Oriental sauce or Sambal Oelek
                        Juice of 1 large lime

To make stock, pour broth and fish sauce into a large saucepan.  Add garlic and red pepper flakes.  Thinly slice unpeeled ginger and add to saucepan.  Cut white part of green onions (saving green parts for later) and lemon grass into 1/4-inch slices and add to saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat. 

Meanwhile, rinse mushrooms well with warm running water to remove any sand.  Place in a bowl and pour 2 cups boiling water overtop.  Let stand at room temperature until mushrooms are softened, about 20 to 30 minutes. 

Once stock comes to a boil, reduce heat to medium and boil gently, uncovered, for 20 minutes.  Stock will have a strong taste.  Strain through a sieve and save broth.  Discard vegetables.  Add mushroom-soaking liquid to broth.  Slice mushrooms, discarding stems, and add to broth.  If making ahead, broth can now be refrigerated for several days or frozen for several months. 

Before reheating broth, slice green parts of onions into 1-inch pieces.  Seed peppers, thinly slice and cut into bite-size pieces.  Wash coriander and coarsely chop.  Remove stems and shred spinach.  If shrimp are frozen, rinse with cold running water until ice crystals melt. 

Just before serving, bring broth to a full rolling boil over high heat.  Add peppers and green portions of onions.  Stir in Oriental sauce and lime juice.  Add shrimp and continue boiling gently just until shrimp are bright pink and hot, about 2 minutes.  Stir in coriander and spinach and remove from heat.  Taste and add more hot sauce or lime juice if you wish.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 8 one-cup servings. 

Comments:  This is the most addictive soup we know.  We love it to start a dinner party -- it wakes up the taste buds for the rest of the meal.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;To make stock, pour broth and fish sauce into a large saucepan.  Add garlic and red pepper flakes.  Thinly slice unpeeled ginger and add to saucepan.  Cut white part of green onions (saving green parts for later) and lemon grass into 1/4-inch slices and add to saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Meanwhile, rinse mushrooms well with warm running water to remove any sand.  Place in a bowl and pour 2 cups boiling water overtop.  Let stand at room temperature until mushrooms are softened, about 20 to 30 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Once stock comes to a boil, reduce heat to medium and boil gently, uncovered, for 20 minutes.  Stock will have a strong taste.  Strain through a sieve and save broth.  Discard vegetables.  Add mushroom-soaking liquid to broth.  Slice mushrooms, discarding stems, and add to broth.  If making ahead, broth can now be refrigerated for several days or frozen for several months. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Before reheating broth, slice green parts of onions into 1-inch pieces.  Seed peppers, thinly slice and cut into bite-size pieces.  Wash coriander and coarsely chop.  Remove stems and shred spinach.  If shrimp are frozen, rinse with cold running water until ice crystals melt. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Just before serving, bring broth to a full rolling boil over high heat.  Add peppers and green portions of onions.  Stir in Oriental sauce and lime juice.  Add shrimp and continue boiling gently just until shrimp are bright pink and hot, about 2 minutes.  Stir in coriander and spinach and remove from heat.  Taste and add more hot sauce or lime juice if you wish.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  water
  3             pounds  ripe tomatoes -- cored, and
                        cut into chunks
  2              large  red bell peppers -- roasted, seeded,
                        and cut into pieces
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped onions
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2              large  bay leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  saffron threads -- (optional, but
                        highly recommended)

Bring the water and tomatoes to a boil in the pot of the pressure cooker.  Add the roasted peppers, onions, garlic, bay leaves and saffron.  Lock the lid in place, then set the cooker to high heat (be sure to check the specific instructions for your pressure cooker); bring it to high pressure, then lower the heat just enough to maintain that high pressure for three short minutes. 

Allow the pressure to come down naturally (or quick-release the pressure by placing the cooker under cold running water for a few minutes), then remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape. 

Fish out and toss the bay leaves, then puree small batches of the soup in a food mill (the preferred method, as it will separate out the tomato skins and seeds), food processor or blender, then reheat if you plan to serve it immediately.  Otherwise, allow it to cool, then freeze it up in plastic containers. 

Serve this tasty soup as is or stir in a tablespoon of good olive oil or some evaporated milk or yogurt for creaminess.  Or stir in a little grated cheddar cheese if you dare.  Or add some cooked rice or small-sized pasta for a "stick to your ribs" meal.  Or add some fresh corn and chopped spinach and cook unpressured for a few more minutes.  Or add some chopped cucumber, scallion and a splash of vinegar and serve cold as gazpacho. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  cleaned medium-size shrimp
  5 1/2      teaspoons  cayenne pepper
  5 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  5 1/2      teaspoons  vegetable oil
  9                     andouille sausages - (abt 4 lbs) -- halved lengthwise,
                        then sliced diagonally bite-size pieces
  3              large  onions -- diced
  3                     red bell peppers -- diced
  3                     green bell peppers -- diced
  8                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     bay leaf
  1                can  chopped tomatoes - (28 oz)
  9               cups  chicken stock
  3               cups  white rice

Toss the shrimp with the cayenne, salt and black pepper; set aside in the refrigerator. 

Heat the oil in a large stockpot.  Add the sausage and brown over medium-high heat, turning as necessary.  Remove the sausage with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. 

Reduce heat to medium-low.  Add the onions and saute for 5 minutes.  Add the bell peppers, garlic and bay leaf and saute for 5 minutes longer. 

Add the tomatoes and browned sausage; bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. 

Add 3 cups of the stock and bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pot.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes.  Repeat with another 3 cups of stock and simmer another 15 minutes.  After adding the last 3 cups of stock, simmer uncovered for 15 minutes. 

Add the rice and bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until the rice is just tender, about 20 minutes.  Add the shrimp and remove from the heat.  Cover and let sit for 10 minutes.  Stir thoroughly.  If the shrimp are not completely cooked, put the pot back on the heat and simmer a minute or two, stirring constantly, until the shrimp just turn pink. 

This recipe yields 12 servings. 

Note:  Jambalaya freezes well.  After thawing and reheating, garnish with minced parsley.

                  Larry's Chile-Roasted Tomato Gazpacho

Recipe By     :Carol Ann Sayle
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     Anaheim chile peppers
  4             medium  tomatoes -- stemmed but skin
                        intact
  1             medium  onion -- peeled and quartered
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled, halved
  1         tablespoon  fresh basil, sage or oregano -- or more if needed
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar -- or more to taste
                        Salt -- to taste

To roast Anaheim or New Mexican-style chiles, roll them around in an iron skillet or comal -- no oil -- until they are blackened.  If you have a gas stove, you can place the chiles directly over the grate and turn them with tongs until they are blackened.  Place the chiles in a plastic or paper bag and let them sweat for about 30 minutes.  Roast the tomatoes by rolling them around in an iron skillet -- no oil -- until they are blackened.  Let the tomatoes cool on a plate. 

Once the chiles have cooled, use the edge of a knife and scrape the charred skin off.  With the charred material will come the brittle cellophane-like outer skin of the chile.  Cut the stem end off, cut through the side of the chile, open it up flat on the cutting board and clean out the seeds with the knife.  Leave the tomatoes as they are, charred skin and all (for extra flavor). 

Blend the chiles, tomatoes, onion, garlic and herbs in a blender.  Add the vinegar and salt, a little at a time, testing, until the gazpacho has the flavor and consistency (chunky or smooth) that you like. 

Chill the gazpacho if you can wait that long, or if you can't, just put it in a bowl, call it a dipping sauce and get out the chips. 

This recipe yields 2 to 3 servings. 

Comments:  What do you get when you take a couple of long, tall Texans, an organic farm and a gifted writer who just can't stop?  It's called "Eating in Season: Recipes From Boggy Creek Farm," a charming and informative cookbook by Carol Ann Sayle (Boggy Creek Farm, $12.95). 

To tantalize customers, farmer Larry grills chiles right at his farmstand, on a cactus pear burner.  In fact, he will even burn Anaheims "to order."  "Friends of the Farm (FoFo's) love it," Sayle says.  "It's got fire; it makes noise; it's a little dangerous.  But the aroma makes it all safe."  The charring gives this dish its characteristic flavor, and it is one of Larry's favorite dishes.  You can just as easily char the chiles over your kitchen stove.  It makes three servings for normal people, one or maybe two for Larry, Sayle says.

                        Lettuce And Tarragon Soup

Recipe By     :Jerry Traunfeld
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  leeks - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - ( 1/2 stick)
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped
  4               cups  chicken or vegetable stock
  1           teaspoon  salt -- (omit if using
                        canned stock)
  1        medium head  romaine lettuce or other head lettuce
     1/4           cup  fresh tarragon
                        (or 1 1/2 tbspns dried tarragon)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Creme fraiche or sour cream -- for optional garnish
                        Heavy cream -- for optional garnish

Cut off and discard tops of the leeks at the point where they turn from light to dark green.  Split the remaining portion lengthwise in half, keeping the roots attached so that the layers will not fall apart.  Wash thoroughly, getting between the layers.  Thinly slice them into half circles; discard roots. 

Melt butter in a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat.  Add leeks and garlic; cook, stirring often, until softened and just beginning to turn golden, about 10 minutes.  Add stock and salt; bring to a simmer.  Turn heat to low, cover and cook at a bubbling simmer for 15 minutes to soften leeks.  (The soup may be made to this point up to two days ahead and refrigerated.  Return to heat before continuing.) 

Slice head of lettuce crosswise into 1-inch-wide strips; discard the base.  Wash lettuce in a deep basin of cold water; drain in a colander.  Stir lettuce into hot soup, increase heat to medium.  Cook, uncovered, until lettuce is wilted and softened, about 5 minutes.  Stir in tarragon. 

Put half of soup in the container of an electric blender.  Hold the lid down with a dry towel.  Turn the blender on low speed so that the soup doesn't splash out, then gradually increase speed and blend until very smooth.  Repeat with remaining soup. 

Return pureed soup to pot; gently reheat.  Taste; season with pepper and additional salt if needed.  Serve in warmed bowls. 

To garnish, stir together creme fraiche or sour cream with heavy cream; drizzle over soup. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Although this recipe calls for romaine, other lettuces (except iceberg) can be substituted.  We made it with bibb lettuce, and it worked beautifully. 

Use the best stock you can find. If you're using canned and you have time, simmer the canned stock with some chicken wings and backs to enrich the flavor.

                        Meatball And Dumpling Soup

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Dumplings For Meatball And Dumpling Soup -- (see recipe)
                        === MEATBALLS ===
     1/2         pound  ground meat (pork, veal, beef or turkey,
                        or meatloaf mix)
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  ground allspice
  3         tablespoon  flour
  3         tablespoon  milk
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten
                        === BROTH ===
  2             quarts  well-flavored beef consomme (homemade
                        or canned)
  1                cup  diced cooked carrots
  1                cup  frozen sugar snap peas

To make meatballs:  Put ground meat and onion in a food processor with the steel blade in place; process until very fine.  (Or, put through a food grinder three times until very fine.) 

Add the salt, pepper, allspice, flour, milk and egg white; process until smooth.  Turn out into a bowl and let stand 30 minutes (mixture will thicken).  Shape the meat into 40 (3/4-inch or smaller) balls. 

At this point you will need to cook the meatballs using either the Danish method (see following), which produces a very lightweight meatball with little color.  Or the American method can be used, where the meatballs are baked in the oven and become brown.  Either way, the meatballs can be made a day ahead of time, then warmed in the soup. 

Danish method of cooking meatballs:  Bring 2 inches of water in a skillet to a boil.  Add 1 teaspoon salt for each quart of water.  Drop meatballs into boiling water and boil 4 to 5 minutes until cooked through.  Lift out of the water with a perforated spoon.  Place in a sieve, rinse with cold water and let meatballs drip until dry.  Warm in soup. 

American method of cooking meatballs:  Preheat oven at 350 degrees.  Place meatballs in a baking pan and place in oven until nicely browned and cooked through, stirring occasionally so that all sides are browned (time will depend on size of meatballs).  Do not overcook the meatballs. 

Make dumplings (see recipe). 

To serve:  Heat the consomme to boiling.  Add the carrots, snap peas, meatballs and dumplings.  Ladle into bowls. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  This soup looks long and involved, but only because it is composed of three elements, two of which can be made earlier and reheated in a rich vegetable-garnished beef broth (which is the third element).  Both the dumplings and meatballs are very light and tender.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  stewing or roasting chicken - (abt 6 lbs) -- remove giblets
                        and reserve for another use
  3             quarts  water
     1/2           cup  baby carrots -- left whole, and
     1/2           cup  baby carrots -- cut into 1/2" pieces
  3                     celery ribs including tops -- sliced
  2              large  onions -- peeled, halved
  2                     bay leaves
     3/4           cup  uncooked long grain rice
                        (or 1 1/2 cups cooked rice)
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1                can  whole artichokes - (14 1/2 oz) -- see * Note
     1/2       package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed, drained
  3              large  garlic cloves -- peeled, minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  About 5 to 7 total (cut off the tops and use the bottoms only), diced, or use 4 artichoke bottoms (from one 14 1/2 oz can), drained and diced; reserve any remaining for another use. 

Place the chicken in a large pot or stock pot and cover with water.  Bring to an immediate boil, then drain and discard the water.  Return the chicken to the pot and add the water.  Add the 1/2 cup of whole baby carrots, the celery slices and tops, the onions and the bay leaves.  Partially cover the pot and simmer for 2 hours or until the chicken is tender but not falling apart. 

Remove the chicken to a large platter and, when cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones.  Shred the white meat, measure out 1 cup and set aside.  Reserve the remainder of the meat for a chicken salad or other recipe. 

Strain the stock into a large bowl and discard the contents of the strainer. 

Cool the soup stock in the refrigerator overnight.  The next day, remove all of the fat that has hardened on the surface.  In a large pot or stock pot, place the defatted stock, rice, lemon juice, 1/2 cup of carrot pieces, artichoke bottoms and spinach. 

Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer the soup 1 hour.  Add more water to equal 2 1/2 to 3 quarts if necessary.  About 5 minutes before serving, add the minced garlic and the reserved 1 cup of shredded chicken meat.  Season with salt and pepper to taste. 

This recipe yields about 3 quarts soup.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     yellow onion -- diced
  1                     green bell pepper -- diced
     1/2           cup  dried-tomato halves -- minced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated lemon peel
  1           teaspoon  crushed red-pepper flakes
     1/2         pound  Italian plum tomatoes -- seeded, diced
                        (or use canned tomatoes)
  1                cup  bottled clam juice
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1              pound  firm white fish fillets -- cut into 1" pieces
  1              pound  large shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        tails left intact
  8             medium  or large scallops
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  additional minced garlic -- (optional)
                        Crusty bread, couscous or rice

In a Dutch oven, heat oil over high heat.  Add onion, bell pepper and dried-tomato bits (reconstitute tomatoes in hot water, wine or broth before mincing, if that's easier).  Reduce heat to low and saute 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add 2 garlic cloves, minced, during last 2 minutes. 

Add lemon zest, hot-pepper flakes and plum tomatoes; saute 2 minutes.  Add clam juice and wine.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer 10 minutes.  Add fish pieces, shrimp, scallops and parsley; stir well.  Cover and simmer 5 minutes or until seafood is cooked through. 

In small bowl, combine mayonnaise and additional garlic; blend well. 

To serve, ladle stew into serving bowls; top each with a dollop of mayonnaise.  Serve with bread, couscous or rice. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                       Mediterranean Mushroom Stew

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  3             medium  onions -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  butter
  24            ounces  mushrooms -- thickly sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  basil
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano
  2               cans  peeled and chopped tomatoes - (14 oz ea)
  3             medium  onions -- cut thick chunks
  1 1/2           cups  V-8 juice
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1 1/4           cups  green pimento-stuffed olives
  1                cup  red wine

In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and chopped onions and cook until onions are soft and translucent.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until light brown. 

Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat melt the butter.  Add the mushrooms, basil and oregano and cook until mushrooms are soft and render their liquid, about 7 minutes. 

Stir into the soup pot the tomatoes, chunked onions, V-8 juice and water.  Stir well, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.  Stir in the mushrooms with their liquid.  Lower heat and simmer 45 minutes. 

Stir in the olives and wine.  Cook 1 hour longer. 

This recipe yields 4 servings as a main dish; 6 as a first course. 

Comments:  This rich and hardy dish is a cross between a stew and soup.  It could easily be served as a main course with the addition of good crusty bread.  Perfect for vegetarians as is, the addition of chicken or shrimp (or a combination of both) would boost the protein.

                   Mexican Chicken Soup With Condiments

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  salad oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  1                     garlic clove -- pressed or minced
  3              small  dried hot red chilies
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
  2 1/2         quarts  regular-strength chicken broth
     1/2      teaspoon  dry oregano leaves
  1                     broiler-fryer chicken - (3 to 3 1/2 lbs) -- cut up
  2              large  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4"-thick slices
     1/3           cup  long-grain rice
  2             medium  chayotes or zucchini
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === CONDIMENT SUGGESTIONS ===
  1                     lime - (to 2) -- cut in wedges
  2              small  tomatoes -- cored and diced
     1/3           cup  homemade or bottled salsa
     1/3           cup  fresh cilantro (coriander) sprigs

Pour oil into a 5- to 6-quart pan and place over medium heat.  Add onion, garlic, chilies, and cumin.  Stir until onion is limp.  Add broth, oregano, and all chicken except breast pieces.  Cover and simmer 20 minutes.  Add carrots, rice, and chicken breasts.  Cover and continue simmering until breast is no longer pink when cut in thickest part, about 15 minutes longer. 

Remove from heat.  Lift out chicken pieces and, when cool enough to handle, remove skin and bones; discard.  Tear meat into bite-size pieces.  (If made ahead, cool, cover soup and chicken, and chill.  Lift off and discard solid fat on soup.) 

Scrub chayotes and cut, including the edible seed, to make 1/2-inch cubes (or cut zucchini into 1/2-inch cubes).  Bring soup to simmering; add chayote and chicken.  Simmer, covered, until chayote is tender when pierced, 5 to 10 minutes.  Skim off and discard fat.  Add salt to taste.  Ladle into bowls and offer condiments to add to each serving. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                         Mild-Mannered Beef Chili

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chili                           Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2                     green bell peppers -- cut 1/2" dice
  2                     red bell peppers -- cut 1/2" dice
  2             medium  onions - (abt 1 lb) -- cut 1/2" dice
  3 1/2         pounds  coarse-ground beef, preferably chuck -- (to 4 lbs)
  2 1/2      teaspoons  chili powder -- or more to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin -- or more to taste
     3/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes -- or more to taste
  1                can  beef broth - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                can  tomato puree - (29 oz)
  2               cups  water
                        Salt -- to taste

In a 6- to 8-quart pot over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Add the bell peppers and the onions and cook, stirring, until the vegetables soften, about 10 minutes. 

While the vegetables are cooking, add about 3 tablespoons oil to a large skillet, enough to coat the bottom of the pan generously, and heat over medium-high heat.  Add some of the ground beef, taking care not to crowd the meat in the pan.  Cook the beef, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until it is no longer pink in the middle.  Transfer the meat to a platter lined with paper towels to drain.  Continue cooking the remaining beef in batches, adding additional oil as needed. 

Add the chili powder, cumin and red pepper flakes to the onions and peppers and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the beef broth, tomato puree, cooked beef and enough water to cover the meat and vegetables.  Stir to combine.  Add salt to taste.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat so the liquid just simmers.  Simmer the chili until the flavors have blended, about 25 minutes. 

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings. 

Comments:  This ground beef chili is relatively tame in terms of spice level.  Add more spices where indicated if you like more kick.  Coarse ground beef is available at most supermarkets.  If there's none in the meat case, ask the butcher.  It makes a much heartier chili.  Serve with sour cream, shredded cheddar and corn bread. 

Do-ahead tip:  Everything.  The chili is best made a day ahead.  Freeze for longer storage.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  uncooked Minnesota wild rice,
                        other wild rice -- see * Note
  6               cups  beef stock
     1/4           cup  diced carrots
     1/4           cup  diced celery
     1/2           cup  diced onion
  1                     bay leaf
  2               cups  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  diced ham
  1                cup  diced smoked turkey -- see * Note
  1           teaspoon  ground thyme
  1              quart  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  We located Minnesota wild rice at Global Foods Market, 421 North Kirkwood Road in Kirkwood.  For the smoked turkey in this recipe, we bought a smoked turkey tenderloin in the meat case at Schnucks and diced up as much as we needed.  The country club often uses smoked turkey breast. 

In a large stockpot, combine wild rice and beef stock.  Bring to a boil; lower heat and cook until rice is almost tender and most of the grains have split slightly.  The time will vary with the rice; check package directions. 

In a small saucepan, combine carrots, celery, onion, bay leaf and chicken stock.  Bring to a boil; lower heat and let simmer for 5 minutes. 

Meanwhile, in a saute pan, heat olive oil until hot.  Add ham and turkey; saute for 3 minutes.  Add thyme; cook 1 minute more. 

Add vegetable and meat mixtures to rice in stockpot.  Stir in cream.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 

Simmer 10 to 15 minutes or until flavors blend and soup thickens slightly.  Remove bay leaf; discard.  Serve soup hot. 

Tester's note:  Leftover soup will thicken in the refrigerator.  To serve leftovers, reheat slowly and thin soup as needed with a splash of chicken or beef broth or cream or whole milk. 

This recipe yields 12 to 15 servings. 

Comments:  This soup, on the daily menu, has become a tradition at Glen Echo Country Club, says executive chef Rob Marbs.  The soup, he notes, is often prepared by assistant chef Mark Williams.  Glen Echo itself is steeped in tradition.  Its golf course, at Lucas and Hunt and Natural Bridge roads, is known as "the oldest 18 holes west of the Mississippi" and was used during the 1904 Olympics.  The club will celebrate its 100th anniversary next year.

            Mom's Beef Stew Topped With Sage Parmesan Biscuits

Recipe By     :Diane Phillips
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BEEF STEW ===
  2             pounds  beef stew meat -- cut into 1" chunks
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     garlic cloves -- mashed
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3               cups  beef broth
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh sage
                        (or 1 tspn dried sage)
  3                     carrots -- cut into 1" chunks
  2               cups  potato in 1" cubes
  1                cup  fresh or frozen corn kernels -- defrosted if frozen
  1                cup  fresh or frozen petite peas -- defrosted if frozen
                        === SAGE-PARMESAN BISCUITS ===
  2               cups  Bisquick
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     2/3           cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  dried sage

For the stew:  Sprinkle beef with salt, pepper and garlic.  In a 3-quart ovenproof casserole or Dutch oven, heat the oil.  Add meat, browning it on all sides for 6 to 8 minutes.  When the meat is browned, add broth, stirring to scrape up any bits that have stuck to the bottom of the pan.  Add sage, carrots and potato cubes.  Cover and simmer 35 minutes. 

Add corn and peas and continue to cook for another 10 to 15 minutes.  The sauce will appear thin, but it will thicken when the biscuits bake.  (The stew can be refrigerated at this point for 2 to 3 days, or frozen for up to 2 months.  Allow to come to room temperature before baking.) 

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 

For the biscuits:  In a large mixing bowl, combine Bisquick and Parmesan cheese.  Add milk and sage, stirring with a fork to combine.  Turn the dough out onto a floured board and knead 5 times.  Roll the dough out to 1/2-inch thickness, cut out individual biscuits with a 2-inch cutter and place on top of stew.  Or transfer the entire crust to the top of the stew, cutting it to fit. 

Bake the stew in the preheated oven for 17 to 20 minutes, or until the biscuits are browned and the stew is bubbling. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Rich and satisfying, this recipe drew raves from tasters.  It also makes a pretty presentation.  It's easy to prepare, and the stew can be refrigerated overnight."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  portobello mushroom stems
  1                     carrot -- unpeeled, sliced
  1              small  leek -- cut lengthwise
  1              small  white onion -- unpeeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1                     celery rib -- sliced
  1                     garlic clove -- unpeeled
  1              sprig  parsley
     1/2                bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
  6               cups  water

In a small stockpot or Dutch oven, combine the mushroom stems, carrot, leek, onion, celery, garlic, parsley, bay leaf, peppercorns and thyme.  Add the water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat low enough to maintain a simmer and cook, uncovered, for about 1 hour, or until reduced by 1/3 to yield 4 cups. 

Set aside 2 cups for the Portobello Mushroom Stew and reserve the rest for another use. 

This recipe yields about 1 quart.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  canola or olive oil
  4             pounds  lean beef chunks
     1/2           cup  flour
  2             pounds  large onions -- thickly sliced
  6                     garlic cloves -- put through a press
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  thyme leaves
  2          teaspoons  salt - (to 3 tspns) -- or to taste
                        Lots of freshly-ground black pepper
  2 1/2           cups  beef broth or bouillon
  2               cans  or bottles of beer - (12 oz ea)
  4              large  carrots -- cut 1" chunks

Cut the beef into three-quarter-inch chunks. 

OK, heat the oil in a large skillet.  Coat the beef with flour, then brown in small batches.  When each batch is done, transfer with a slotted spoon to an oven casserole. 

When all the meat is done, toss the onions into the skillet and let 'em sizzle for about two minutes.  Add the garlic and cook another minute, then add this mess to the casserole, along with the sugar, vinegar, thyme, salt and pepper. 

Pour the beef broth into the empty skillet.  Stir with a wooden spoon to incorporate any brown bits in the pan, then pour this sludge into the casserole.  Add the beer, and I prefer a dark brew. 

Cover the casserole and shove into a 325 degree oven for two hours.  After the first hour, stir in the carrots then return to the oven. 

When done, move the casserole to the burner on your range.  Stir in three tablespoons of Wondra flour that have been mixed with a third of a cup of water.  Keep stirring and when the sauce has thickened, serve the stew with "Civilian Cornbread" (see recipe). 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3             medium  leeks, white and light green parts only -- split lengthwise,
                        thinly sliced, and washed
  6               cups  low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth
  3             medium  Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        diced into 1/4" cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  3             ounces  sorrel leaves -- stemmed and washed
     1/3           cup  heavy cream -- whipped to firm
                        peaks

In a stock pot over low heat, melt butter.  Add leeks, and cook, stirring until tender but not colored, 8 to 10 minutes.  Pour in stock, increase heat, and bring just to a boil.  Add potatoes, season with salt and pepper, lower heat, and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, or until potatoes are cooked through.  Adjust seasoning as needed.  Keep warm. 

In a blender, process sorrel to a smooth puree.  If it seems stiff, add a tablespoon of whipped cream.  Carefully fold puree into whipped cream, and season with salt and pepper. 

Ladle soup into bowls, and top each bowl with a spoonful of sorrel cream.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                   Potato Soup With Leeks And Bok Choy

Recipe By     :Regina Campbell
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     medium-large potatoes -- cubed
  2                     vegetable bouillon cubes
  2               cups  chopped leeks
  1 1/3           cups  chopped bok choy
     3/4           cup  shredded carrots
     1/8      teaspoon  ground coriander
                        Paprika -- to taste
                        Cayenne -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
  2               cups  low fat milk

Boil potato cubes in 2 quarts of water with bouillon cubes until tender but not mushy, about 15 minutes.  Reserve 1 to 2 cups of liquid. 

Meanwhile, saute the leeks in a little water until lightly browned.  Add bok choy and carrots and saute for 3 to 4 minutes.  Begin sprinkling seasonings a little at a time into the pan with leeks, bok choy and carrots. 

Reserving 1 1/2 cups potato cubes for texture, puree potatoes with half the milk in a blender or with a hand mixer.  Blend or mix only long enough to create a smooth texture without it becoming gluey. 

Return potato puree to the soup pot and add sauteed vegetables and remaining potato cubes.  Add remainder of milk until soup reaches the desired thickness.  Add more milk as needed. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  West and East meet in this dish, and it turns out to be a good match.  Substitute soy or rice milk for dairy milk if you wish.

                   Pulled Chicken And Green Chili Chili

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Chili
                Poultry                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PULLED CHICKEN AND BROTH ===
  5             pounds  bone-in chicken thighs and/or breasts
  1              large  tomato -- coarsely chopped
  1              large  onion -- coarsely chopped
  2              large  or 3 medium carrots -- coarsely chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- coarsely chopped
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  salt
                        === FOR THE CHILI ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  butter
  2             medium  onions - (abt 1 lb total) -- chopped
  2               cans  chopped green chilies - (4 1/2 oz ea)
  1           teaspoon  cumin
     1/4           cup  flour
                        Salt -- to taste

For the pulled chicken and broth:  In a large stock pot, combine the chicken, tomato, onion, carrots, celery, bay leaves and salt.  Add enough water to cover the chicken and vegetables.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low so the liquid just barely simmers.  Simmer until the chicken is tender and falling off the bones, about 1 hour.  Transfer the chicken pieces to a plate and set aside until cool enough to handle. 

Strain the broth; discard the vegetables.  Set the broth aside. 

Using a fork or your fingers, pull the chicken from the bones.  Break any large pieces into small, bite-size chunks or strips.  Discard the chicken bones and skin. 

While the chicken is cooling, start preparing the chili.  In a 6- to 8-quart pot, heat the oil and butter over medium heat.  Add the onions and cook until softened, about 10 minutes.  Add the green chilies and cumin and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour is dissolved.  Stir in 3 cups of the reserved chicken broth.  Add the pulled chicken and bring the mixture to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to medium-low so the liquid just barely simmers.  Taste and add salt as needed.  Simmer the chili for 15 minutes.  If the chili seems too thick, add additional chicken broth as needed.  Save the remaining broth for another use. 

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings. 

Comments:  If chili can be described as having Tex-Mex parentage, this version is on the Mexican side of the family.  Serve with rice, chopped tomato, sour cream, shredded cheese and warm flour tortillas. 

Do-ahead tip:  This can be prepared a day ahead.  Freeze for longer storage.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cans  reduced-sodium chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz 
     3/4           cup  finely-diced onion
     3/4           cup  finely-diced carrot
  1                can  diced green chilies - (4 oz)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced fresh basil leaves
                        (or 1 1/2 tspns dried basil)
  1            package  fresh or frozen cheese ravioli - (9 oz)
  1                cup  thin strips of cooked chicken
     1/4           cup  freshly-shredded parmesan cheese

In a 4- to 5-quart pan over high heat, bring broth, onion, carrot, green chilies, garlic, and basil to a simmer.  Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 15 minutes. 

Turn heat to high and bring broth to a boil.  Add ravioli and cook until just barely tender to bite, 4 to 6 minutes.  Add chicken and cook until hot, about 2 minutes more. 

Ladle soup into bowls, and sprinkle with parmesan cheese. 

This recipe yields about 7 cups, 4 servings. 

Comments:  Every summer Tammy Moore-Worthington buys three bushels of roasted mild New Mexico green chilies and freezes them to use throughout the year.  She adds a couple of the chilies to this speedy soup (you can substitute canned green chilies).  Leftover grilled chicken adds a smoky note.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a 4- to 5-quart pan over high heat, bring broth, onion, carrot, green chilies, garlic, and basil to a simmer.  Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 15 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Turn heat to high and bring broth to a boil.  Add ravioli and cook until just barely tender to bite, 4 to 6 minutes.  Add chicken and cook until hot, about 2 minutes more. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Ladle soup into bowls, and sprinkle with parmesan cheese. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields about 7 cups, 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Every summer Tammy Moore-Worthington buys three bushels of roasted mild New Mexico green chilies and freezes them to use throughout the year.  She adds a couple of the chilies to this speedy soup (you can substitute canned green chilies).  Leftover grilled chicken adds a smoky note.

Recipe By     :Rhonda Brown
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chili                           Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cans  chopped green chilies - (4 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin -- plus
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano leaves -- crumbled
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  4               cups  chicken stock or broth - (to 6 cups)
  4               cups  diced cooked chicken
  3               cans  large white beans such as cannellini -- (16 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Grated Monterey jack or cheddar cheese -- (or both)
                        Salsa
                        Sour cream

Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and garlic and cook for about 5 minutes or until the vegetables are softened slightly.  Add the chilies, cumin, oregano, cloves, and cayenne and cook for about 1 minute longer.  Add 4 cups of the chicken stock, the beans and the chicken and cook over low heat for about 1 hour, adding stock if necessary.  If using canned beans and pre-cooked chicken, add the beans and chicken after about 40 minutes and cook 20 minutes to blend flavors.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve with grated cheese, salsa and sour cream, if desired. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  In spite of my chili research, my mind returns to the chili my good friend, Rhonda Brown, makes.  She is co-owner of the Brown Grotta Gallery in Wilton, Conn., and often entertains groups of artists and clients.  When she throws a chili party, she usually makes two kinds of chili, ground beef and chicken.  The chicken version is based on a recipe clipped from a newspaper years ago. 

The original recipe called for dried beans, but Brown uses canned beans.  And, she says, when she's in a hurry she buys cooked cubes of white meat from the grocer's meat case.

               Roasted Fennel Soup With Walnuts And Stilton

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  fennel bulb -- cut into quarters
  2        tablespoons  canola oil -- divided
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     leek, white part only, --sliced
  1                cup  cubed peeled russet potatoes
  2               cups  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry
     1/2           cup  half-and-half
     1/2           cup  toasted walnuts -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  crumbled Stilton cheese
                        Finely-chopped zest of 1 lemon
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh chives

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Toss fennel with 1 tablespoon oil.  Sprinkle with kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper.  Roast fennel on baking pan until tender and golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. 

While fennel is roasting, heat remaining oil in a heavy, medium-sized pot over a medium-low flame.  Add leek, stirring to coat with oil.  Cover pot and cook the leek for 5 minutes, until translucent.  Add potatoes and stock.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until the potatoes are fully cooked, about 20 minutes.  Puree mixture with a hand-held blender or in a food processor until smooth. 

Allow fennel to cool.  When easy to handle, slice fennel in 1/4-inch strips.  Add to potato mixture, along with dry sherry and the half-and-half.  Return to a simmer and stir in walnuts.  Season with salt and pepper. 

Toss Stilton cheese with the lemon zest.  To serve, ladle soup into warm bowls, top each with a tablespoon of the Stilton mixture.  Sprinkle with minced chives and extra walnuts if desired. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

       Roasted Onion And Leek Soup With Gruyere And Parmesan Croute

Recipe By     :Georgia Chan Downard and Evie Righter
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE SOUP ===
  3             pounds  onions -- sliced 1/2" thick
  2             pounds  leeks, white and light green parts -- washed, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper-- to taste
  1                cup  dry white wine
  6               cups  homemade or canned beef stock - (to 8 cups -- divided
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
                        (or 1 tspn dried thyme, crumbled)
  1                     bay leaf
                        === GRUYERE AND PARMESAN CROUTES ===
  12            slices  Italian or French bread -- cut 1/2" thick
                        on the diagonal
  2              large  garlic cloves -- halved
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  grated Gruyere cheese
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan

Preheat oven to 425 degrees. 

In a large roasting pan, toss the onions and leeks with the oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Roast, stirring often, for 30 minutes or until the onions are golden but not crispy.  Transfer to a large soup pot.  Pour the wine into the roasting pan.  Bring to a boil over high heat on the stovetop, scraping up the browned bits.  Boil for 1 minute, then add to the onions and leeks. 

Add 6 cups of the stock, the thyme, bay leaf and salt and pepper to taste.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes to concentrate the flavors, adding some or all of the remaining 2 cups stock as needed if the soup becomes too thick.  Remove and discard the thyme sprig, if used, and the bay leaf. 

For the croutes:  Reduce oven heat to 400 degrees.  Rub both sides of each slice of bread with the garlic and brush with oil.  Arrange slices on a baking sheet and bake, turning once, for 7 minutes total, or until lightly toasted.  Spoon some of both cheeses over each slice and bake for 3 to 4 minutes more or until the cheeses are melted.  Serve at once. 

To serve:  Ladle soup into heated bowls and top each with a hot cheese croute. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  A soup for all seasons, this one's savory onion flavor is touched by sweetness of the leeks.  The onions should roast only until golden; you do not want them to singe around the edges, which would add a burned flavor to the stock.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Preheat oven to 425 degrees. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a large roasting pan, toss the onions and leeks with the oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Roast, stirring often, for 30 minutes or until the onions are golden but not crispy.  Transfer to a large soup pot.  Pour the wine into the roasting pan.  Bring to a boil over high heat on the stovetop, scraping up the browned bits.  Boil for 1 minute, then add to the onions and leeks. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Add 6 cups of the stock, the thyme, bay leaf and salt and pepper to taste.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes to concentrate the flavors, adding some or all of the remaining 2 cups stock as needed if the soup becomes too thick.  Remove and discard the thyme sprig, if used, and the bay leaf. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;For the croutes:  Reduce oven heat to 400 degrees.  Rub both sides of each slice of bread with the garlic and brush with oil.  Arrange slices on a baking sheet and bake, turning once, for 7 minutes total, or until lightly toasted.  Spoon some of both cheeses over each slice and bake for 3 to 4 minutes more or until the cheeses are melted.  Serve at once. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To serve:  Ladle soup into heated bowls and top each with a hot cheese croute. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 6 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  A soup for all seasons, this one&apos;s savory onion flavor is touched by sweetness of the leeks.  The onions should roast only until golden; you do not want them to singe around the edges, which would add a burned flavor to the stock.

                         Roasted Sweet Corn Soup

Recipe By     :Mary Evely
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10              ears  fresh corn in the husks - (to 12)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  4       large cloves  garlic
  4               cups  chicken stock or broth
  2               cups  water
  1              large  baking potato -- peeled, and
                        cut into eighths
  4          teaspoons  cornmeal
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Basil oil and basil leaves -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. 

Peel the husk down from the corn and remove the silk, leaving the base intact.  Place some of the butter on each ear and replace the husk (you might need to tie the husk and cob together).  Place in a baking pan with the garlic cloves.  Roast 20 minutes. 

Cool to room temperature.  Peel the garlic and shuck the corn.  Scrape the kernels from the cob, reserving 2 cups of the kernels and 6 cobs. 

In a medium saucepan, combine the chicken stock and water.  Add the corn cobs, garlic and potato.  Simmer until the potato is tender.  Discard the cobs. 

In a food processor, process the stock mixture, remaining corn kernels and cornmeal in several batches until pureed.  Combine with the cream in the saucepan.  Bring just to a boil.  Stir in the reserved 2 cups of corn kernels, salt and pepper.  Ladle into soup bowls, garnish with basil oil and leaves, and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  The creaminess and roasted corn flavor of this delectable soup make a perfect match for the buttery, toasty flavors of a good chardonnay, according to winery chef Mary Evely.  But you could also try a contrast pairing, opposing the soup's richness with the bright, refreshing acidity of sauvignon blanc.

                            Seafood Chowder II

Recipe By     :Marie Simmons
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chowder                         Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  bacon
     1/2           cup  onion in 1/4" dice
     1/2           cup  carrot in 1/4" dice
     1/2           cup  celery in 1/4" dice
  1              pound  small potatoes -- peeled, and
                        diced into 1/2" cubes
  1                cup  water
                        Salt -- to taste
  2               cans  evaporated milk - (12 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  frozen baby lima beans or green peas -- thawed
  1                cup  whole milk -- or more to taste
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1                     skinless salmon fillet - (abt 8 oz) -- cut into chunks
  8             ounces  frozen shelled tiny shrimp -- thawed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cook bacon until crisp in large, wide saucepan.  Remove to paper towel to drain.  Cut into small pieces; set aside.  Reserve 1 tablespoon bacon fat in pan; discard remaining fat. 

Add onion, carrot and celery to saucepan; cook, stirring, until golden, about 5 minutes.  Add potatoes, water and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Bring to a boil.  Cover; cook over low heat until potatoes are almost tender, about 10 minutes. 

Whisk evaporated milk and flour until blended.  Add to vegetables; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 10 minutes.  Add lima beans, milk and tomato paste.  Heat to a simmer, stirring to dissolve tomato paste. 

Add salmon and cook, covered, over low heat 5 minutes.  Do not boil.  (Be careful; thickened milk may scorch on bottom on pan.)  Stir in shrimp and cook, stirring gently, until heated through, about 3 minutes.  Add generous grinding of black pepper and salt to taste.  Thin with additional milk, if desired. 

Ladle into large, deep soup bowls.  Top each with bacon, distributing evenly.  Serve at once. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  In New England, chowder typically is made with clams, but in the following recipe I use chunks of fresh salmon fillet and frozen tiny shrimp.  Hearty with potatoes and assorted vegetables and creamy with evaporated milk, this makes a satisfying meal on a cold winter's night, yet it is fancy enough for company.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  frozen cream-style corn - (10 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil
  1                cup  frozen chopped onions
  1           teaspoon  bottled minced garlic
  1                can  fat-free chicken broth - (14-1/2 oz)
  1                can  reduced-fat cream of chicken soup -- (10 3/4 oz)
  1                can  chopped green chilies - (4-1/2 oz)
  1                can  premium chicken breast meat - (5 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder -- or more to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1                cup  low-fat milk
                        Shredded Mexican-blend cheese -- optional garnish

Pierce the plastic corn container (frozen corn only) to vent according to package directions and place it on a microwave-safe plate.  Microwave uncovered at high for 4 minutes to defrost. 

Meanwhile, place the olive oil in a 4 1/2-quart Dutch oven or soup pot over medium-high heat.  Stir in the onions and cook for 30 seconds.  Stir in the garlic.  Add the chicken broth and raise the heat to high.  Add the cream of chicken soup and stir to mix well. 

Allow the soup to come to a boil while draining the chilies and chicken and adding them to the pot.  When the soup boils, reduce the heat to low.  Add the creamed corn, chili powder and cumin.  Stir to mix well. 

Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the milk.  Serve at once, garnished with cheese if desired. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Cook's note:  If frozen cream-style corn is not available, substitute a 15-ounce can of cream-style corn.  We tested this recipe with Campbell's Healthy Request cream of chicken soup.  If you're serving very small children, feel free to omit the canned chilies, chili powder and cumin.  Instead, stir in 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese for extra flavor.

                Spicy Chipotle, Pork And White Bean Chili

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chili                           Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  chipotle chili peppers in adobo sauce -- (7 oz)
  5        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2         pound  carrots -- cut 1/4 to 1/2" dice
  2             medium  onions (abt 1 lb) -- cut 1/4 to 1/2" dice
  3 1/2         pounds  boneless pork shoulder or country-style
                        pork ribs - (to 4 lbs) -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
     1/2         pound  dried small white beans (such as navy
                        beans) -- presoaked according
                        to package directions and drained
  3               cups  chicken broth -- or more as needed
  2               cups  canned tomato puree
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt -- or to taste
     1/4           cup  sugar

In a blender or mini-food processor, puree the chipotle peppers and sauce until smooth.  Set aside. 

In a 6- to 8-quart pot, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat.  Add the carrots and onions and cook until the vegetables have softened and the onion just begins to turn golden brown, about 10 minutes. 

While the vegetables are cooking, add about 3 tablespoons oil to a large skillet, enough to coat the bottom of the pan generously, and heat over medium-high heat.  Add some of the diced pork, taking care not to crowd the meat in the pan.  Saute the meat until it is no longer pink in the middle.  Transfer the meat to a large platter lined with paper towels to drain.  Continue cooking the remaining pork in batches, adding additional oil as needed. 

Transfer the cooked pork to the pot with the carrots and onions along with the chipotle puree, beans, chicken broth, tomato puree, salt and sugar.  Stir to combine, adding more chicken broth if needed to fully cover the meat and vegetables.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low so the liquid just barely simmers.  Simmer the chili until the meat is tender and the beans are fully cooked, about 1 1/2 hours. 

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings. 

Comments:  Chipotles -- canned, dried, smoked jalapeÒos in adobo sauce -- add heat here.  They also bring a rich, deep flavor to the chili.  Cans of chipotle used to be hard to find, but most supermarkets now carry them in the international section.  Those feeling more timid, in terms of spice, can cool down this dish by using only half of the pureed chipotle mixture.  Serve with sour cream and diced scallions. 

Do-ahead tip:  Everything.  This chili is best made 1 or 2 days ahead.  The chili may thicken with time; add additional chicken broth as needed when reheating.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a blender or mini-food processor, puree the chipotle peppers and sauce until smooth.  Set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a 6- to 8-quart pot, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat.  Add the carrots and onions and cook until the vegetables have softened and the onion just begins to turn golden brown, about 10 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;While the vegetables are cooking, add about 3 tablespoons oil to a large skillet, enough to coat the bottom of the pan generously, and heat over medium-high heat.  Add some of the diced pork, taking care not to crowd the meat in the pan.  Saute the meat until it is no longer pink in the middle.  Transfer the meat to a large platter lined with paper towels to drain.  Continue cooking the remaining pork in batches, adding additional oil as needed. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Transfer the cooked pork to the pot with the carrots and onions along with the chipotle puree, beans, chicken broth, tomato puree, salt and sugar.  Stir to combine, adding more chicken broth if needed to fully cover the meat and vegetables.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low so the liquid just barely simmers.  Simmer the chili until the meat is tender and the beans are fully cooked, about 1 1/2 hours. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Chipotles -- canned, dried, smoked jalapeÒos in adobo sauce -- add heat here.  They also bring a rich, deep flavor to the chili.  Cans of chipotle used to be hard to find, but most supermarkets now carry them in the international section.  Those feeling more timid, in terms of spice, can cool down this dish by using only half of the pureed chipotle mixture.  Serve with sour cream and diced scallions. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Do-ahead tip:  Everything.  This chili is best made 1 or 2 days ahead.  The chili may thicken with time; add additional chicken broth as needed when reheating.

              Spicy White Bean Stew With Roasted Red Peppers

Recipe By     :Diane Morgan, Dan Taggart and Kathleen Taggart
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  small dried white beans such as
                        Great Northern or navy
  2              large  onions
  3             medium  carrots
  1                     celery rib
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves
  2                     serrano chiles or 1 jalapeÒo chile -- seeded, and
                        thinly sliced
  3 1/2           cups  chicken stock or 2 cans low-salt chicken
                        broth - (14 1/2 to 16 oz ea)
  1                can  crushed tomatoes in juice - (14 1/2 oz)
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh rosemary leaves
                        (or 2 tspns dried rosemary)
  1                     red bell pepper - (6 to 8 oz) -- roasted, seeded,
                        and cut into medium dice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  minced fresh parsley

Pick over the beans, discarding any rocks or shriveled beans, and rinse in a colander.  Chop half of 1 onion, half of 1 carrot and all the celery.  In a 4-quart or larger saucepan over medium heat, heat the olive oil and saute the chopped vegetables until soft but not browned, about 5 minutes.  Add the beans, garlic, chiles, stock or broth, tomatoes and juice and rosemary.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to a gentle simmer and cover.  Cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes. 

Cut the remaining onions into 1-inch wedges.  Cut the remaining carrots into 1/2-inch rounds.  Add the onions and carrots to the pot.  Cook until the beans are tender but not mushy, about 30 additional minutes. 

Add the bell pepper to the beans.  Add salt and pepper.  Ladle 1 to 1 1/2 cups stew into each of 4 wide soup plates or bowls and top each portion with a little parsley.  Cover and refrigerate the remaining stew for "Bean Soup With Bacon and Oregano" (see recipe). 

This recipe yields 12 cups. 

Comments:  This stew is a great vegetarian option for a chilly winter evening -- or put thick slices of turkey breast on top.

                            Spring Garden Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     radishes - (to 6) -- washed, and
                        sliced paper thin
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1              pound  baby turnip bulbs -- peeled (if desired),
                        and diced
  4                     green onions - (to 6) -- sliced
  4               cups  vegetable broth
                        Turnip or rapini greens -- (optional)
  1                cup  shelled peas
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh herbs

Blanch radishes in boiling water 30 seconds; drain, rinse with cold water, drain again and set aside. 

Melt butter in a 6-quart saucepan, add turnips and cook slowly, turning often to wilt them slightly without browning.  Add green onions and cook 2 to 3 minutes.  Add broth, bring to simmer and cook until turnips are barely tender, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add peas and cook 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir in blanched radishes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Stir in fresh herbs if desired. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  In spring these vegetables are tender and sweet.  You don't have to peel the turnips if you don't want to; that will speed preparation and add a stronger turnip flavor.  This tastes like a spring tonic like one you might pay a lot of money for at a spa restaurant.  Stretch it the second day with potatoes or rice.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1              large  fennel bulb -- chopped
     1/2         pound  dandelion greens -- cleaned and chopped
     1/2         pound  mustard greens -- cleaned and chopped
     1/2         pound  baby spinach leaves -- cleaned
  4                     garlic cloves
  6               cups  reduced-sodium canned chicken broth
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  half-and-half
                        Sprouts -- (optional)

In a 4-quart saucepan, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onion and fennel; saute until vegetables soften and are lightly browned -- about 10 minutes.

Increase heat to high and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes.  Let cool 15 minutes. 

Working in small batches with a blender, puree soup, transferring pureed soup to a 3-quart saucepan.  Stir in half-and-half and reheat over low heat.  When ready to serve, divide soup among bowls and garnish with sprouts, if desired. 

Comments:  Any combination of fresh greens can be used in this soup; just be sure the total weight amounts to 1 1/2 pounds.

Recipe By     :Cynthia Hizer
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2                onion -- thinly sliced
  5                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4          head  green cabbage -- thinly sliced as
                        for coleslaw
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2           packages  ramen noodles
                        Sushi ginger -- for garnish,
                        (optional)

Heat the olive oil in a skillet.  Add the onion and garlic and cook 1 minute.  Add the cabbage and soy sauce and toss.  Add enough water so there is a thin layer of water on the bottom, about 2 tablespoons.  If the water evaporates, add enough more so that a constant stream of steam is coming off the vegetables.  Cook for 5 minutes. 

While the cabbage is cooking, bring 4 cups of water to a boil, add the packages of ramen noodles.  Boil for 1 minute, turn off the heat and let sit.  Add the seasoning packets.  As the noodles soften, if the broth seems too thick, add more water to make it soupy. 

To serve, spoon the cabbage mixture into bowls and top with the ramen broth.  Pass the ginger at the table. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  It doesn't matter what kind of ramen noodles you buy, or where.  They are all made from wheat pasta and taste pretty much the same, regardless of price.  I do like the mushroom ones, as they add a flavor without my having the extra chore of chopping mushrooms.

                       Traditional Black Bean Soup

Recipe By     :Jennifer Brewster
Serving Size  : 15    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried black beans
  2 1/2         quarts  canned chicken broth -- plus more as needed
  1                     smoked ham shank - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) --cut i
                        by your butcher
  1 1/2           cups  diced onion
  1         tablespoon  cumin seed
  2        tablespoons  chili powder
  1                cup  diced canned tomatoes -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Sort beans, discarding any debris.  Rinse thoroughly; drain. 

Transfer beans to a heavy-bottomed 5-quart stockpot.  Add broth and ham shank.  Bring to a boil, then cook for 5 minutes skimming foam off the top of the broth.  Reduce heat to medium; simmer for about 1 hour, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. 

Add onion, cumin, chili powder and tomatoes.  Simmer an additional 45 minutes to 1 hour or until beans are tender.  Add water or broth as necessary to maintain desired thickness.  Soup will thicken as it cools. 

Remove shank; shred ham off bone; return meat to soup.  Season with salt and pepper to taste. 

Reheat gently.  Thin if needed when soup reaches desired serving temperature.  Adjust seasoning if necessary. 

This recipe yields 15 servings. 

Comments:  "Enclosed is a recipe similar to our black bean soup," wrote Jennifer Brewster, a representative of Panera Inc., which owns St. Louis Bread Co.'s bakery-cafes.

Recipe By     :John Owen
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  flour
  2          teaspoons  paprika
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt -- divided
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     chickens -- cut serving pieces
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  4              large  onions -- sliced
  4               cups  chicken broth
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  dried sage
  6                     celery stalks
  10            medium  carrots
  1              pound  large fresh mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2                     egg yolks
  1                cup  half-and-half

On a piece of waxed paper, mix together the flour, paprika, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and the pepper. 

Wash and dry the chicken then roll to cover in the flour mixture.  Save the remainder of the flour mixture. 

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet and brown the chicken pieces on both sides, in two batches.  Remove to a large pot or Dutch oven. 

Add more olive oil to the pan if needed, and lightly brown the onions, in two batches.  Dump the cooked onions into the pot with the chicken.  Moosh around with a wooden spoon, then add the broth, basil, sage and the final teaspoon of salt.  Bring everything to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes. 

Cut each carrot into three or four hunks and add to the stew.  Simmer another 20 minutes. 

Clean and quarter the mushrooms.  Slice the celery into 1/4-inch pieces.  Add both to the stew along with the lemon juice.  Cover and simmer a final 20 minutes. 

Remove chicken pieces and vegetables to a platter in a warm oven. 

In a medium bowl, beat together the egg yolks and half-and-half.  Stir in the leftover flour mixture and keep stirring until you have a smooth paste. 

Bring the liquids left in the pot to a boil.  Add a cup of these pot liquids to the egg mixture, stir until smooth then pour the whole mess into the pot, stirring until the sauce begins to thicken. 

Pour some of the sauce over the chicken and veggies and pass the remainder around in a large bowl. 

This recipe serves eight, over split baking-powder biscuits.
