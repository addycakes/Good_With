  2               cups  sparkling apple-cranberry juice
     1/4           cup  frozen concentrated cranberry
                        juice cocktail -- thawed

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Remove stems from apples.  Using melon baller, scoop out core of each apple, making 1-inch-wide hollow center but leaving bottom of apple intact.  Make 1/8-inch-deep cut in skin around center of each apple.  Arrange apples, hollowed-side up, in 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass baking dish.

Mix raisins, cranberries, sugar, apricots, and 1/2 teaspoon allspice in small bowl.  Pack fruit mixture into hollows of apples.  Sprinkle any remaining fruit mixture around apples in dish.  Drizzle butter into filling and around apples in dish.  Pour sparkling juice and cranberry concentrate into dish.  Sprinkle remaining 1/4 teaspoon allspice into dish.  Bake apples uncovered until tender, occasionally basting with cranberry juice mixture, about 1 hour 10 minutes.

Transfer apples to 4 bowls.  Pour juices from dish into medium saucepan and boil until thick enough to coat spoon, about 4 minutes.  Spoon sauce over apples.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  whipping cream
  8             ounces  bacon -- chopped
                        = (preferably applewood-smoked)
  4               cups  thinly-sliced leeks
                        = (white and pale green parts only)
  1                cup  finely-chopped celery
  1                     bay leaf
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  grated Pecorino Romano cheese
  20            medium  oysters -- shucked
                        = (or four 8-oz jars shucked oysters)
  1                cup  fresh breadcrumbs
                        = (made from crustless French bread)

Melt butter in small skillet over medium heat.  Add flour; whisk 2 minutes.  Add cream slowly and whisk until mixture thickens slightly.  Remove from heat.

SautÈ bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 6 minutes.  Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.  Discard all but 2 tablespoons drippings from skillet.  Add leeks, celery, bay leaf, and cayenne to skillet and sautÈ over medium heat until vegetables are soft, about 12 minutes.  Add wine and cook until absorbed, about 15 seconds.  Add cream mixture and bring to simmer.  Stir until leek mixture thickens slightly, about 3 minutes.  Stir in bacon and cheese.  Season generously with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Place 1 oyster on each of 20 oyster shells or place 2 oysters in each of 10 small ramekins.  Top oyster in each shell with 2 tablespoons leek mixture, or top oysters in ramekins with 1/4 cup leek mixture.  Place on rimmed baking sheet.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Divide breadcrumbs among shells or ramekins.  Bake until leek mixture bubbles and crumbs are golden, about 8 minutes.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  Use fresh oysters if you can; note that the recipe also tested well using oysters packed in jars.  If the oysters are very large, cut them in half.

Serving Size  : 25    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  dried porcini mushrooms
  4               cups  hot water
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  4              large  onions -- finely chopped
  5             pounds  hot Italian sausages -- casings removed
  4             pounds  button mushrooms -- sliced
  4          teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  2               cups  dry white wine
  4                     bay leaves
  2               cans  beef broth - (14 oz ea)
  4               cups  half-and-half
  4             pounds  rigatoni
  6               cups  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- plus
                        additional grated Parmesan cheese
                        Fresh rosemary sprigs -- for garnish

Rinse porcini mushrooms.  Place in medium bowl.  Add 4 cups hot water, cover, and let stand until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain, reserving soaking liquid.  Chop porcini.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in each of 2 heavy large pots over medium heat.  Divide onions between pots; sautÈ until tender, about 10 minutes.  Divide sausage between pots.  Increase heat to high and cook until no longer pink, breaking up into small pieces with back of fork, about 12 minutes.  Divide button mushrooms and chopped rosemary between pots and stir until mushrooms begin to soften, about 8 minutes.  Divide porcini, wine, and bay leaves between pots and boil until almost all liquid evaporates, stirring frequently, about 6 minutes.  Divide porcini soaking liquid between pots, leaving sediment behind.  Divide beef broth between pots.  Boil until sauce is syrupy, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.  Divide half-and-half between pots; boil until thickened slightly, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  (Sauce can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly, then cover and chill.  Rewarm before continuing.)

Brush four 3 1/2-quart glass or porcelain baking dishes with oil.  Cook pasta in 2 large pots of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain.  Divide pasta between sauce in pots; stir to coat.  Mix 3 cups cheese into each pot.  Season pasta with salt and pepper.  Divide among prepared baking dishes.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before continuing.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Cover dishes with foil.  Bake pasta just until hot but not bubbling, about 25 minutes.  Sprinkle with additional cheese.  Garnish with rosemary sprigs and serve with additional cheese.

This recipe yields 25 servings.

Comments:  The pasta is divided among four 3 1/2-quart baking dishes so they can be baked individually for open-house-style serving.  But you can use any size bake-and-serve dishes ó even a roasting pan or a paella pan.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     firm medium-size banana -- diced
     3/4           cup  chopped onion
  1                can  black beans - (15 oz) -- drained
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2                     sheets frozen puff pastry - (17.3-oz pkg) -- thawed
  1                cup  coarsely-grated Monterey Jack cheese - -- (packed)
  1                     egg - (for glaze) -- beaten to blend

Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over high heat.  Add banana and sautÈ until golden, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer banana to paper towels to drain.  Add onion to skillet; sautÈ 3 minutes.  Add beans, cilantro, cumin, and cayenne; cook until mixture is hot, about 3 minutes.  Using back of fork, mash bean filling to coarse paste; season with salt and cool.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Roll out each puff pastry sheet on floured surfaceto 14-inch square.  Cut each into 9 squares.  Place 1 heaping tablespoon filling in center of 12 squares (reserve remaining squares for another use).  Sprinkle each mound of filling with cheese, then top with bananas, dividing equally.  Brush edges of squares with glaze.  Fold 1 corner over filling to opposite corner, forming triangle.  Using fork, seal crust edges.  Arrange on rimmed baking sheet; brush with glaze.  Bake empanadas until golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 12 empanadas.

Comments:  Diane writes; "I'm a part-time restaurant manager and food writer, and occasionally I teach cooking classes.  One piece of advice I always share with my students is to keep the ingredients list short ó you don't need to empty out your refrigerator to make a great meal.  You just need a few quality ingredients with bold flavors."

These Latin American turnovers work as appetizers or as a vegetarian main course when served several to a person.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Roll out each puff pastry sheet on floured surfaceto 14-inch square.  Cut each into 9 squares.  Place 1 heaping tablespoon filling in center of 12 squares (reserve remaining squares for another use).  Sprinkle each mound of filling with cheese, then top with bananas, dividing equally.  Brush edges of squares with glaze.  Fold 1 corner over filling to opposite corner, forming triangle.  Using fork, seal crust edges.  Arrange on rimmed baking sheet; brush with glaze.  Bake empanadas until golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Serve hot.

Comments:  Diane writes; &quot;I&apos;m a part-time restaurant manager and food writer, and occasionally I teach cooking classes.  One piece of advice I always share with my students is to keep the ingredients list short ó you don&apos;t need to empty out your refrigerator to make a great meal.  You just need a few quality ingredients with bold flavors.&quot;
</DirT>

These Latin American turnovers work as appetizers or as a vegetarian main course when served several to a person.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted
     1/4           cup  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
                        === FILLING ===
  8             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into 5 pieces
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-grated blood orange peel - -- (lightly packed)
                        = (or orange peel)
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-grated pink grapefruit peel - -- (lightly packed)
  1              large  egg yolk -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  boiling water
                        Jasmine Whipped Cream -- (see recipe)
                        Candied Citrus Peel -- (see recipe)

For Crust:  Combine first 4 ingredients in bowl.  Add flour and stir just until blended; let stand 5 minutes.  Press dough onto bottom and up sides of 9- to 9 1/2-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Chill 30 minutes.

Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Bake crust until deep golden, pressing down with back of spoon if bubbles form, about 25 minutes.  Cool crust in pan on rack.

For Filling:  Combine chocolate, butter, and both peels in medium metal bowl.  Place bowl in skillet of barely simmering water set over low heat.  Stir just until chocolate and butter are melted and smooth.  Remove bowl from water.  Place fine strainer over bowl with melted chocolate.  Keep skillet with water set over low heat.

Whisk egg yolk in small metal bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in 1/4 cup boiling water.  Place bowl in skillet of hot water; stir constantly with heatproof rubber spatula, scraping bottom of bowl to prevent egg from cooking, until instant-read thermometer inserted into egg mixture registers 160 degrees, about 3 minutes.  Immediately pour egg mixture into strainer set over bowl of chocolate.  Stir just until egg is incorporated into chocolate and mixture is smooth.

Pour chocolate filling into crust; tilt slightly to spread evenly (crust will not be completely filled).  Cover and chill overnight or up to 2 days.  Before serving, let tart soften slightly at room temperature.

Remove pan sides. Place tart on platter.  Using pastry bag fitted with star tip, pipe whipped cream rosettes around edge of tart.  Garnish with candied peel.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  The subtle citrus notes in this dark chocolate tart come from pink grapefruit and blood orange zests.  It has a sublime buttery shortbread crust.

Do-aheads: filled tart, 2 days; candied citrus peel, 1 week.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  Boston brown bread - (1 lb) -- cut into 1/2" cubes
     1/2         pound  soft Italian bread -- crusts trimmed,
                        cut into 1/2" cubes - (abt 4 cups)
  4             ounces  bacon -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/2" strips
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
     3/4           cup  chopped onion
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh chives
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  low-salt chicken broth

Preheat oven to 250 degrees.  Divide all bread cubes between 2 rimmed baking sheets.  Bake until bread is dry, about 1 1/2 hours.  Transfer bread to large bowl.

SautÈ bacon in large skillet until crisp.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels.  Discard all but 1 tablespoon drippings from skillet.  Add butter to drippings and melt over medium heat.  Add onion; sautÈ until soft, about 7 minutes.  Add onion, chives, tarragon, salt, pepper, and reserved bacon to bowl with bread; toss to combine.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Butter 9- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish.  Add chicken broth to bread mixture and toss to moisten.  Transfer stuffing to prepared dish.

Cover stuffing with foil and bake 40 minutes (50 minutes if refrigerated).  Uncover and bake until lightly browned on top, about 20 minutes longer.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Boston brown bread is in the canned-vegetable aisle of most supermarkets.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  crumbled queso fresco or feta cheese - -- (abt 6 oz)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  3 1/4           cups  water
  1                cup  polenta (coarse yellow cornmeal)
                        = (or regular cornmeal)
  1                     bag frozen yellow corn kernels - (16 oz) -- thawed
  1              pound  fresh link chorizo sausage -- casings removed
  1              pound  cherry tomatoes - (abt 3 1/2 cups)

Meanwhile, sautÈ chorizo in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until browned, breaking into small pieces with side of wooden spoon, about 6 minutes.  Add cherry tomatoes to skillet.  Cover, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until tomatoes soften, about 6 minutes.  Uncover; crush some tomatoes with fork.  Simmer until tomatoes release juices and sauce thickens slightly, about 10 minutes.  Spoon polenta onto plates.  Top with chorizo mixture, then cheese mixture.

Comments:  This dish would be great served with fried eggs for brunch.

Market Tip:  Polenta is the Italian name for coarse yellow cornmeal.  It is available at some supermarkets, natural foods stores, and Italian markets.  If you can't find it, regular cornmeal can be substituted in this recipe.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             pounds  butternut squash with long necks
  1                cup  fresh tangerine juice -- divided
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
  2        tablespoons  grated tangerine peel
                        Fresh sage leaves - (abt 30)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Cut neck off each squash.  Peel necks and cut crosswise into generous 1/3-inch-thick slices.  Overlap slices in 2 large baking dishes.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Spoon 6 tablespoons tangerine juice over squash.  Spoon cream over squash; dot with butter.  Bake squash until beginning to brown, about 30 minutes.

Mix tangerine peel into remaining 10 tablespoons juice; drizzle over squash.  Place 1 sage leaf atop each squash round.

                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" cubes
  3        tablespoons  chilled lard -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  half-and-half
     2/3           cup  whipping cream
  2              large  eggs
  1              large  egg yolk
  1                cup  canned pure pumpkin
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     3/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Mincemeat Ice Cream -- (see recipe)

For Crust:  Mix flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Add butter and lard; using on/off turns, process until coarse meal forms.  Add 2 tablespoons ice water and process until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if mixture is dry.  Form dough into disk.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour.

Roll out dough on floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter pie dish.  Fold overhang under; crimp edges decoratively.  Chill 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake crust until edges begin to brown, pressing crust with back of fork if bubbles form, about 15 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Meanwhile, For Filling:  Stir sugar and 2 tablespoons water in medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; boil without stirring until sugar turns dark amber, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down pan sides with wet pastry brush, about 7 minutes (time will vary depending on size of pan).  Remove pan from heat.  Whisk in butter 1 tablespoon at a time (mixture will bubble).  Stir in half and half and cream, stirring until all caramel bits dissolve.

Whisk 2 whole eggs and 1 yolk in large bowl to blend.  Whisk in pumpkin, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt.  Gradually whisk caramel mixture into pumpkin mixture.

Transfer filling to crust.  Bake until puffed and set in center, about 50 minutes.  Cool pie on rack.  Chill until cold.  (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.)  Serve with Mincemeat Ice Cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Divide carrots between 2 large rimmed baking sheets.  Roast until carrots are tender and liquids are reduced to glaze, stirring twice and mixing in water by tablespoonfuls if needed to prevent burning, about 55 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.  Rewarm in 375 degrees oven 10 minutes before serving.)

Transfer carrots to platter.  Sprinkle pomegranate seeds, pine nuts, basil, and mint over carrots and serve.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Market Tip:  Look for maroon, white, yellow, and red carrots at farmers' markets and include as many colors as you like.  Or use regular carrots and thin parsnips.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  celery roots (celeriac) with leafy tops
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2           cups  chopped leek -- white and
                        pale green parts only
     3/4           cup  arborio or medium-grain white rice
  3               cups  low-salt chicken broth -- more or less
  1                cup  grated Parmesan cheese -- divided

Place 1 1/2 cups (packed) celery root leaves and oil in mini-processor.  Blend until leaves are minced.  Season pesto to taste with salt and pepper.

Peel celery roots.  Cut into 1/3-inch-thick slices.  Cut slices into enough 1/3-inch cubes to measure 2 cups.  Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat.  Stir in celery root cubes and leek.  Cover; cook until celery root is tender but not brown, stirring often, about 10 minutes.

Mix in rice; stir 1 minute.  Add broth; increase heat and bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until rice is tender and risotto is creamy, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.  Mix in 3/4 cup cheese.  Season risotto to taste with salt and pepper.

Divide risotto between bowls; swirl some pesto on top.  Serve with remaining cheese and pesto.

This recipe yields 2 main-course servings.

Comments:  A mini-processor comes in handy for making the pesto.

Categories    : First Course

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  low-salt chicken broth
     1/4           cup  cream Sherry
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  1              small  white onion -- finely chopped
     1/2         small  butternut squash -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into 1/4" pieces
  1 1/2           cups  arborio rice - (10 oz)
  2               cups  peeled roasted chestnuts -- chopped
                        = (or jarred chestnuts)
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh marjoram
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley

Bring chicken broth and Sherry to boil in medium saucepan over high heat.  Reduce heat to low; cover and keep warm.

Meanwhile, heat oil and 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and squash; cook until onion is translucent, stirring often, about 10 minutes.  Add rice; stir until rice is translucent at edges but still opaque in center, about 3 minutes.

Add 1 cup warm broth; simmer until almost absorbed, stirring often, about 4 minutes.  Add more broth, 1 cup at a time, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding next until rice is just tender, stirring frequently, about 25 minutes total.

Stir in chestnuts, thyme, and marjoram.  Remove from heat; stir in remaining 1 tablespoon butter, cheese, and parsley.  Season risotto with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 6 first-course servings.

Comments:  A touch of cream Sherry amplifies the sweetness of the nuts and the squash.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  canned sweetened chestnut spread*
  1 1/4           cups  whole milk -- divided
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  water
  1 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  Armagnac
  1                cup  peeled roasted chestnuts -- chopped
                        = (or jarred chestnuts)

* Known as crËme de marrons; available at some supermarkets and specialty foods stores.

Whisk chestnut spread, 1/4 cup milk, and salt in small bowl to combine.  Set aside.

Combine sugar and 1/3 cup water in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides and swirling pan, about 12 minutes.  Slowly and carefully add cream (mixture will bubble vigorously), then remaining 1 cup milk.  Stir over low heat until any hard caramel bits dissolve and mixture is smooth.  Stir in chestnut spread mixture and Armagnac.  Transfer cream mixture to bowl; cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours or overnight.

Process cream mixture in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer ice cream to bowl; cover tightly and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Keep frozen.)

Scoop into bowls.  Sprinkle each with 2 tablespoons chopped chestnuts.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     chickens - (3 1/2 to 3 3/4 lbs ea) -- each cut quarters,
                        and backbones removed

  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  Hungarian sweet paprika
  1           teaspoon  turmeric
     2/3           cup  olive oil
  1 1/4         pounds  white onions -- thinly sliced
  1 1/4         pounds  red onions -- thinly sliced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  honey
  1             bottle  dry white wine - (750 ml) -- divided
  9              large  fresh sage leaves
  8              large  shallots -- peeled
  8              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
  3                     Turkish bay leaves
  3               cups  assorted brine-cured Mediterranean olives
                        = (such as Kalamata and picholine)

Rinse chicken; pat dry.  Arrange on foil.  Mix cumin, salt, paprika, and turmeric in bowl.  Sprinkle over both sides of chicken.  Let stand while preparing onions.

Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add all onions.  SautÈ until pale golden, about 30 minutes.  Mix in honey.  SautÈ until onions are deep brown, about 15 minutes.  Turn off heat.  Tilt skillet, pushing onions toward top and allowing oil to pool at bottom.  Set aside 1/3 cup onions for pilaf.  Using slotted spoon, spread remaining onions evenly in large roasting pan.  Reserve skillet with oil.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Heat oil reserved in skillet over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, brown chicken, about 5 minutes per side.  Arrange chicken, skin-side up, in single layer atop onions in roasting pan.  Remove skillet from heat.

Add 1/2 cup wine to hot skillet.  Let stand until bubbling stops.  Add remaining wine.  Place skillet over medium-high heat; boil until reduced to 2 cups, scraping up bits, about 9 minutes.  Tuck sage, shallots, garlic, and bay leaves among chicken quarters.  Sprinkle with pepper.  Spoon wine mixture over.

Cover pan tightly with foil and bake chicken 30 minutes.  Uncover; sprinkle olives over chicken.  Baste with juices.  Return to oven, uncovered, and continue baking until chicken is tender, basting 2 more times, about 35 minutes.

Transfer chicken, vegetables, and olives to platter.  Serve with pan juices.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  ground ginger
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
  6        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- room temperature
  3        tablespoons  mild-flavored (light) molasses
  1              large  egg
  6             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
                        Cinnamon decorating candies or
                        chopped crystallized ginger

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Whisk first 7 ingredients in large bowl to blend.  Stir brown sugar, butter, and molasses in medium saucepan over low heat until melted.  Increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.  Let cool 10 minutes.  Whisk egg in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk molasses mixture into egg.  Using electric mixer, gradually beat molasses mixture into flour mixture until just blended.

Roll dough out on lightly floured surface to 12- by 10-inch rectangle.  Cut out gingerbread with cookie cutters.  Transfer to baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart.  Gather scraps and roll out on lightly floured surface; cut out additional cookies.  Repeat until all dough is used.

Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until puffed and tops are firm, about 10 minutes.  Cool on sheets 5 minutes.  Transfer to rack; cool completely.

Place rack over rimmed baking sheet.  Stir chocolate and oil in top of double boiler set over barely simmering water until melted.  Holding bottom of 1 cookie, dip top into chocolate, allowing excess to drip off.  Transfer cookies, chocolate-side up, to prepared rack.  Repeat with remaining cookies and chocolate.  Decorate cookies with candies or ginger.  Chill cookies until chocolate is set, about 30 minutes.  (Cookies can be made 3 days ahead.  Store in single layer in airtight container in refrigerator.)  Let cookies stand at room temperature 15 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields about 48 two-inch cookies or about 10 five-inch cookies.

Comments:  These soft ginger cookies are dipped in dark chocolate for sophisticated fun.

Mix yogurt and ginger in bowl.  (Fruit and yogurt can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover separately; chill.)

Spoon yogurt atop fruit.  Sprinkle with brown sugar and dried cranberries.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Market Tip:  Greek yogurt, which is actually drained yogurt, has a luxurious texture similar to that of sour cream.  Look for it at Greek markets, Trader Joe's, and Whole Foods.  Or simply spoon 1 quart plain yogurt into a colander lined with cheesecloth.  Place the colander in a large bowl and let the yogurt drain in the refrigerator overnight.

                        === SWEET POTATOES ===
  4               cups  cubed (1/3") peeled red-skinned
                        sweet potatoes (yams)
  1                cup  water

     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  ground nutmeg
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
                        === CRUMB COATING ===
                        Powdered sugar
  1 1/2           cups  graham cracker crumbs
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  2 1/2       packages  cream cheese - (8-oz pkgs) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  whole-milk ricotta cheese
     3/4           cup  sugar
  4              large  eggs
  1                can  sweetened cream of coconut* - (15 oz)
                        = (such as Coco LÛpez)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lemon peel - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

                        Additional sweetened flaked coconut -- toasted

* Available in the liquor section of most supermarkets.

For Sweet Potatoes:  Combine first 13 ingredients in large saucepan.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer uncovered until potatoes are very tender and most of liquid is absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes.  Transfer mixture to processor; puree until smooth.  Whisk egg and cream in medium bowl to blend.  Add 2 1/3 cups sweet potato puree and whisk to blend well.  Cover and chill sweet potato mixture until cold.

For Crumb Coating:  Butter 10-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 1/2- to 2 3/4-inch-high sides; dust with powdered sugar.  Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter in medium bowl until crumbs are evenly moistened.  Press crumb mixture evenly over bottom and up sides of pan (coating will be thin).  Chill 30 minutes.  (Sweet potato mixture and crumb coating can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill separately.)

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, ricotta cheese, and sugar in large bowl until smooth.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time.  Add cream of coconut, lemon juice, lemon peel, and vanilla; beat until smooth.  Fold in 1 cup flaked coconut and sweet potato mixture.  Pour filling into prepared pan.

Place pan on rimmed baking sheet and bake cake until filling is just set in center, about 1 hour 20 minutes.  Transfer cheesecake directly to refrigerator and chill uncovered overnight (center may sink).  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Cover and keep chilled.)

Run small knife between cake and pan sides to loosen cake; remove sides.  Place cake on platter.  Sprinkle toasted unsweetened coconut over top edge of cheesecake.  Serve chilled.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  lean ground beef
  1 1/3           cups  grated Parmesan cheese -- divided
     1/2           cup  fresh breadcrumbs
                        = (made from crustless French bread)
  1              large  egg
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  7 1/2           cups  low-salt chicken broth -- divided
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2              large  celery stalks with tops -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  farfallini or orzo
  1              small  escarole head -- coarsely torn

Blend beef, 1/3 cup cheese, breadcrumbs, egg, garlic, salt, and pepper in medium bowl.  Using moistened hands, shape meat mixture into 3/4-inch meatballs.

Heat 1 1/2 cups broth and oil in large pot over medium-high heat.  Add meatballs and simmer until firm enough to hold shape, about 5 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer meatballs to bowl.

Boil broth until reduced to glaze, about 6 minutes.  Add celery and onion to pot.  Stir until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.

Add remaining 6 cups broth, pasta, and meatballs with any juices.  Reduce heat.  Simmer until pasta is tender, about 10 minutes.  Add escarole and simmer until wilted, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Ladle soup into bowls.  Serve with remaining 1 cup cheese.

This recipe yields 4 main-course or 6 first-course servings.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  For fresh breadcrumbs, grind chunks of crustless French bread in the processor to coarse crumbs.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  low-salt chicken broth -- more or less
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1                cup  arborio rice -- plus
  2        tablespoons  arborio rice
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  6        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1 1/2           cups  panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) -- divided
     1/2           cup  coarsely-grated Fontina cheese - (packed) -- abt 2 oz
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  1              large  egg yolk
  2              large  eggs
                        Canola oil -- for frying
                        Additional grated Parmesan cheese
                        Fresh chives -- for garnish

Bring 3 cups broth to simmer in small saucepan.  Reduce heat to very low; cover and keep warm.  Heat olive oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion; sautÈ until translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add rice; stir 1 minute.  Add wine; stir until absorbed, about 30 seconds.  Add broth, 1/3 cup at a time, and simmer until rice is just tender and risotto is creamy, allowing broth to be absorbed before adding more, and stirring often, about 18 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Mix in 6 tablespoons Parmesan and butter.  Season generously with salt and pepper.  Spread risotto in 13- by 9- by 2-inch pan and cool completely.

Mix 1/2 cup panko, Fontina cheese, parsley, chopped chives, and 1 egg yolk into risotto.  Shape into 1 1/4-inch balls; flatten to 2-inch rounds.  Arrange on rimmed baking sheet.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 250 degrees.  Set another rimmed baking sheet in oven.  Beat 2 eggs in shallow bowl to blend.  Place 1 cup panko in another shallow bowl.  Dip risotto cakes into beaten egg, then into panko to coat.  Pour enough canola oil into large skillet to coat bottom; heat oil over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, sautÈ risotto cakes until crisp and brown, about 2 1/2 minutes per side.  Transfer to baking sheet in oven.

Serve risotto cakes sprinkled with cheese and garnished with chives.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  These cakes owe their delicate, crisp coating to panko, which have a coarser, lighter texture than regular dried breadcrumbs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUNCH ===
                        Vegetable oil
  1                cup  walnut pieces - (abt 4 oz)
     2/3           cup  toffee bits - (abt 3 1/2 oz)
                        = (such as Skor)
  4          teaspoons  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === MOUSSE ===
  2               cups  chilled heavy whipping cream -- divided
     3/4           cup  sugar
  5              large  egg yolks
  1 1/4           cups  canned pure pumpkin
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
  1 1/4      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  ground allspice
  4                     cinnamon sticks

For Crunch:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line rimmed baking sheet with foil; brush generously with vegetable oil.  Toss nuts, toffee bits, sugar, and salt in medium bowl to blend.  Add butter and toss to coat.  Place mixture in center of prepared sheet; pat to single layer.  Bake until toffee bits are soft (but retain shape), about 15 minutes.  Cool crunch completely on sheet.  Transfer to work surface; chop coarsely.

For Mousse:  Whisk 3/4 cup whipping cream, sugar, and egg yolks in heavy medium saucepan to blend.  Stir over medium-low heat until thickened to pudding consistency, about 10 minutes (do not boil).  Transfer mixture to large bowl.  Mix in pumpkin, rum, vanilla, ground cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, salt, and allspice.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes.

Beat remaining 1 1/4 cups cream in another large bowl until cream holds peaks.  Transfer 1/2 cup whipped cream to medium bowl for garnish; cover and chill.  Fold remaining whipped cream into pumpkin mixture.  Cover and refrigerate mousse at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.

In each of 4 medium (10-ounce) goblets, layer 1/3 cup mousse and generous tablespoon crunch.  Repeat 2 more times (some crunch may be left).  If necessary, whisk reserved 1/2 cup whipped cream to soft peaks.  Pipe or drop dollop of cream onto mousse in each goblet.  Cover; freeze overnight.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep frozen.  Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before serving.)  Garnish with cinnamon sticks.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  With no pastry crust to wrangle, these luscious parfaits of pumpkin mousse and cream are easier to make than pumpkin pie.  Start making this dessert at least one day before you plan to serve it.

                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  penne
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
     2/3           cup  sliced shallots - (abt 5)
  1              pound  mushrooms -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1 1/2           cups  turkey gravy (preferably homemade)
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-grated GruyËre cheese - (packed) -- abt 6 oz, divided
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  3               cups  diced cooked turkey meat - (abt 1 lb)

Position rack in top third of oven; preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass or ceramic baking dish.  Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite.  Drain.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shallots; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add mushrooms and thyme; sautÈ until mushrooms are tender and dark brown, about 12 minutes.  Add pasta, gravy, 1 cup cheese, and cream to mushroom mixture; stir to blend.  Mix in turkey.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Transfer to prepared baking dish.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese.  Bake gratin until sauce is bubbling around edges and tips of pasta are golden brown, about 25 minutes.  Let stand 5 minutes and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Because GruyËre is somewhat salty, use unbrined roast turkey in this dish.  Also, and old-fashioned turkey gravy (no cider or soy sauce) will enhance the gratin best.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     lemons -- divided
  18                    Earl Grey tea bags
  11                    rosemary sprigs - (4" long) -- divided
  2               cups  coarse kosher salt
  1 1/2           cups  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  12              cups  ice cubes
  2                     turkey-size oven-roasting bags
  1                     turkey - (abt 22 lbs) -- neck, heart, and
                        gizzard reserved for gravy
  1                     disposable 12 3/4" x 9" x 2" aluminum pan
  1                     celery stalk -- crosscut into 3"
                        pieces
  1             medium  onion -- quartered
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Tea-And-Lemon Gravy -- (see recipe)

Bring 6 1/2 quarts water to boil in large pot.  Remove from heat.  Using vegetable peeler, remove peel from 3 lemons (yellow part only).  Add peel, tea bags, and 6 rosemary sprigs to water; steep 20 minutes.  Remove tea bags.  Add salt and sugar; stir to dissolve.  Stir in lemon juice.  Cool to lukewarm.  Add ice to reduce temperature to below 45 degrees.

Place 1 roasting bag inside the second, forming 2 layers.  Place inside large pot.  Place turkey in roasting bags, breast-side down.  Pour brine over turkey.  Tie bags tightly, eliminating any air pockets.  Refrigerate 36 to 48 hours.  Or, place bags into large cooler, pour brine over turkey, and tie bags securely.  Pour ice over and around turkey in bags.  Place lid securely on cooler.  Check twice a day to ensure that turkey is covered with ice (some ice will melt).  Remove top rack from grill.  Place disposable aluminum baking pan in center of barbecue (if using 2-burner gas grill, place pan on 1 side of grill; if using 3-burner grill, place pan over center burner).

Prepare barbecue (medium-low heat).  If using charcoal grill, arrange coals on each side of aluminum baking pan, dividing equally.  (You will need to add about 6 briquettes to each side of aluminum pan every 30 minutes to maintain temperature while cooking turkey.)  If using 3-burner gas grill, light burner(s) on left and right, leaving center burner(s) off.  If using 2-burner gas grill, light burner on side opposite disposable pan.  Insert instant-read thermometer into top vent of grill.  Maintain temperature at around 350 degrees.

Drain turkey; discard brine.  Pat turkey dry.  Pierce 2 lemons all over with fork.  Stuff turkey with lemons, 5 sprigs rosemary, celery, and onion.  Tie legs together.  Brush turkey all over with oil.

Place turkey directly on grill above aluminum pan.  Close grill.  Adjust temperature to maintain 350 degrees.  Roast turkey until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, about 3 hours.  Transfer turkey to platter.  Tent with foil.  Allow to rest 30 minutes before carving (internal temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees).  Serve with gravy.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  For best flavor and moist, juicy meat, brine the turkey for 36 to 48 hours.  If you are planning to brine it in a cooler, plan on needing extra ice.  Kosher salt is preferred in most brine recipes for its pure flavor and because it dissolves quickly.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TURKEY ===
  3            gallons  water
  1                     box coarse kosher salt - (3 lbs)
     1/2           cup  whole black peppercorns
     1/3           cup  fresh thyme sprigs
     1/3           cup  fresh marjoram sprigs
     1/3           cup  fresh sage sprigs
  12                    Turkish bay leaves
  1                     turkey - (abt 13 lbs)
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
                        === PEAR GRAVY ===
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  1                cup  pear juice
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh marjoram

For Turkey:  Stir 3 gallons water and salt in large pot until salt dissolves.  Stir in peppercorns and next 4 ingredients.  Add turkey to brine.  Place large plate atop turkey to submerge.  Place in refrigerator.  Soak turkey 8 to 10 hours.  Remove turkey from brine; rinse and pat dry.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Store uncovered in refrigerator.)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Place turkey on rack in large roasting pan.  Rub butter over turkey.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Place turkey in oven.  Reduce temperature to 325 degrees.  Roast turkey until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, about 2 1/2 hours.  Transfer turkey to platter; tent with foil.  Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before carving (internal temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees).

For Pear Gravy:  Spoon off fat from drippings in pan, reserving 1/4 cup fat.  Measure 2/3 cup pan juices.  Melt butter and reserved 1/4 cup fat in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Mix in flour.  Stir until light brown, about 2 minutes.  Gradually add chicken broth, pear juice, and 2/3 cup pan juices.  Simmer until thickened, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes.  Stir in rum.  Season with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle turkey with marjoram; serve with gravy.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Storage Solutions:  No room in the fridge to brine a turkey?  No problem.  Put a turkey-sized oven bag in a large cooler, then place the turkey in the bag.  Pour in the brine and seal tightly.  Place ice over and around turkey, close the lid tightly, and let it brine 8 to 10 hours, adding ice periodically to keep temperature at 40 degrees or below.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 2/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  unsalted butter - (2 1/2 sticks) -- divided, and
                        at room temperature
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract -- divided
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  3 1/2      teaspoons  whole milk -- more or less
                        Assorted decorative candies
                        = (such as colored sugar crystals, edible
                        glitter, and nonpareils)

Sift first 3 ingredients into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat 1 cup butter and 2/3 cup sugar in large bowl until smooth.  Beat in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and almond extract.  Beat in flour mixture until just blended.  Gather dough together; divide in half.  Flatten each half into disk, wrap in plastic, and chill overnight.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep chilled.  Soften dough slightly at room temperature before rolling out.)

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Working with 1 disk at a time, roll out on lightly floured surface to scant 1/4-inch thickness.  Cut out cookies with assorted cutters.  Transfer cookies to prepared baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart.  Gather scraps and roll out on lightly floured surface; cut out additional cookies.  Repeat until all dough is used.

Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until edges and bottoms are light golden, about 16 minutes.  Cool on sheets 5 minutes.  Transfer to rack; cool completely.

Sift powdered sugar into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat in 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and enough milk by teaspoonfuls to form thick icing.  Spread thinly onto cookies.  Decorate as desired.  Let stand until set, about 2 hours.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Store between waxed paper in airtight container at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 48 cookies.

Comments:  The dough needs to chill overnight before rolling out, so plan accordingly.

     1/4           cup  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        === APRICOT LAYER ===
     2/3           cup  dried apricot halves (packed/ abt 4 oz) -- coarsely chopped
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour

This recipe yields 18 bars.

Comments:  This delicious bar cookie comes courtesy of the author's mother and is a nice follow-up to the fondue. The shortbread layer is topped with a very moist apricot-walnut cake layer.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9             ounces  fresh peekytoe crabmeat
                        = (or other fresh crabmeat)
     3/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh chives
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/3           cups  whole milk
  1 1/3           cups  water
     3/4           cup  polenta or coarsely ground cornmeal -- plus
  2        tablespoons  polenta or coarsely ground cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Vegetable oil

Mix crabmeat, mayonnaise, chives, and lemon juice in medium bowl to blend.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

Bring milk and 1 1/3 cups water to boil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Gradually whisk in polenta, then butter and salt.  Remove batter from heat; let stand 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Lightly butter large rimmed baking sheet.  Heat large nonstick griddle or skillet over medium-high heat.  Brush lightly with vegetable oil.  Working in batches, spoon 1 tablespoonful batter for each cake onto griddle, spreading slightly with back of spoon.  Cook until cakes are golden brown on bottom and firm at edges, about 2 minutes.  Turn cakes over and cook until firm and golden brown, about 1 minute longer.  Transfer to prepared baking sheet.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Cool, then cover with foil and refrigerate.  Rewarm, covered, in 350 degrees oven until hot, about 7 minutes.)

Divide johnnycakes among 8 plates.  Top johnnycakes with crab mixture.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Peekytoe is a Maine rock crab prized by many chefs for its sweet, delicate flavor.  Dungeness crab is probably the closest substitute.

                  Lobster Pasta With Herbed Cream Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta
                Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     live lobsters - (1 3/4 lbs ea)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
  2              large  plum tomatoes -- chopped
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  2                     fresh tarragon sprigs
  2                     fresh thyme sprigs
  2                     fresh Italian parsley sprigs
  6               cups  whipping cream
  1 1/2         pounds  fettuccine or linguine

Bring very large pot of salted water to boil.  Add lobsters.  Boil until cooked through, about 12 minutes (or cook in batches, if necessary).  Using tongs, transfer lobsters to large rimmed baking sheet.  Remove meat from tail and claws; place meat in medium bowl.  Remove any roe from bodies and place in small bowl.  Cover and chill meat and roe (if any).  Remove tomalley (green matter) from bodies and discard.  Reserve bodies and shells.

Heat oil in heavy large pot over high heat.  Add reserved lobster bodies and shells.  SautÈ 3 minutes.  Reduce heat to low.  Add tomato paste; stir 3 minutes.  Stir in tomatoes, wine, vinegar, garlic, tarragon, thyme, and parsley.  Add cream; boil 2 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Simmer just until lobster flavor infuses cream, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.  Strain sauce into large bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible.  Discard contents of strainer.  (Lobster and sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and chill.)

Transfer sauce to heavy large saucepan.  Cut lobster meat into bite-size pieces; coarsely crumble roe, if using.  Add to sauce.  Gently rewarm over low heat, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain; return pasta to pot.  Add sauce; toss over medium-high heat until sauce coats pasta, about 4 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to large shallow bowl and serve.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  If available, add the lobsters' coral pink roe to the sauce ó it makes this dish even more luxurious.

Bring very large pot of salted water to boil.  Add lobsters.  Boil until cooked through, about 12 minutes (or cook in batches, if necessary).  Using tongs, transfer lobsters to large rimmed baking sheet.  Remove meat from tail and claws; place meat in medium bowl.  Remove any roe from bodies and place in small bowl.  Cover and chill meat and roe (if any).  Remove tomalley (green matter) from bodies and discard.  Reserve bodies and shells.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat oil in heavy large pot over high heat.  Add reserved lobster bodies and shells.  SautÈ 3 minutes.  Reduce heat to low.  Add tomato paste; stir 3 minutes.  Stir in tomatoes, wine, vinegar, garlic, tarragon, thyme, and parsley.  Add cream; boil 2 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Simmer just until lobster flavor infuses cream, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.  Strain sauce into large bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible.  Discard contents of strainer.  (Lobster and sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and chill.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer sauce to heavy large saucepan.  Cut lobster meat into bite-size pieces; coarsely crumble roe, if using.  Add to sauce.  Gently rewarm over low heat, stirring occasionally.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain; return pasta to pot.  Add sauce; toss over medium-high heat until sauce coats pasta, about 4 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to large shallow bowl and serve.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  If available, add the lobsters&apos; coral pink roe to the sauce ó it makes this dish even more luxurious.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  fresh blood orange juice
                        = (or regular orange juice)
  1         tablespoon  unseasoned rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  minced shallot
     1/2      teaspoon  honey
  3        tablespoons  pistachio oil
  2                     blood oranges
                        = (or regular oranges)
  1            package  m‚che - (4 oz)
     1/4           cup  shelled natural pistachios -- toasted
     1/4           cup  pomegranate seeds
                        = (or dried cranberries)

Whisk orange juice, vinegar, shallot, and honey in small bowl.  Gradually whisk in pistachio oil.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.

Using small sharp knife, cut off peel and white pith from oranges.  Working over small bowl, cut between membranes to release orange segments.  Divide m‚che among 4 plates.  Divide orange segments, pistachios, and pomegranate seeds among plates.  Drizzle dressing over salad and serve.

Comments:  Using blood orange juice in the dressing means less oil is necessary, which lowers the fat in this dish.  M‚che, sometimes called lamb's lettuce, can be found in four-ounce packages in the produce section of many supermarkets.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- (1/2 stick)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/3           cup  sifted all-purpose flour -- (sifted, then
                        measured)
     1/3           cup  sifted unsweetened cocoa powder -- (sifted, then
                        measured; preferably Dutch-process)
  4              large  eggs
     2/3           cup  sugar
                        === HAZELNUT CRUNCH ===
  5             ounces  imported gianduja bars -- chopped
                        = (hazelnut-flavored milk chocolat, such
                        as Callebaut)
  1                cup  crisp rice cereal
     1/3           cup  hazelnuts -- toasted, husked*,
                        and finely chopped
                        === MOUSSE ===
  10            ounces  imported gianduja bars -- chopped
                        = (hazelnut-flavored milk chocolat, such
                        as Callebaut)
  1 1/4           cups  chilled heavy whipping cream
     1/8      teaspoon  salt - (scant)
  3        tablespoons  water
  3        tablespoons  Tuaca (sweet citrus-flavored liqueur) or
                        Frangelico (hazelnut-flavored liqueur)
                        === DECORATION ===
                        Additional unsweetened cocoa powder
                        Powdered sugar

* Many supermarkets sell pre-husked hazelnuts.  if you can't find them, here's how to husk whole hazelnuts: Scatter nuts on rimmed baking sheet and toast at 350 degrees until skins darken, 12 to 15 minutes.  Wrap warm hazelnuts in kitchen towel and rub together to remove skins.

For Cake:  Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Line bottom of 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 2-inch-high sides with parchment paper.  Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat.  Remove from heat.  Spoon off foam from top of butter and discard.  Spoon clear yellow butter into small metal bowl, leaving water and milk solids in bottom of pan.  Add vanilla to butter in bowl; set clarified butter aside.

Sift flour and cocoa powder together 3 times into medium bowl.  Whisk eggs and sugar in large metal bowl to blend.  Place bowl with egg mixture in large skillet of barely simmering water; whisk constantly until egg mixture is lukewarm (105 degrees), about 2 minutes.  Remove bowl from water.  Place bowl with clarified butter in hot water in same skillet over low heat to keep warm.

Using electric mixer, beat egg mixture until cool and tripled in volume, about 5 minutes.  Sift 1/3 of flour-cocoa mixture over egg mixture and gently fold in with rubber spatula.  Fold in remaining flour-cocoa mixture in 2 more additions.  Fold 1 cup of cake batter into warm clarified butter until incorporated.  Using rubber spatula, gently fold butter-cake batter mixture into remaining cake batter.

Transfer batter to prepared pan.  Bake until tester inserted into center of cake comes out clean and top springs back slightly when gently pressed, about 30 minutes.  Cool completely in pan on rack.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; store at room temperature.)

Run knife between pan sides and cake to loosen.  Invert cake onto rack; remove parchment.  Using long serrated knife, trim top of cake horizontally, forming 3/4-inch-high cake layer.  Using bottom of 8-inch-diameter springform pan as guide, trim around sides of cake to form 8-inch round cake.  Set cake aside.

For Hazelnut Crunch:  Line bottom of 8-inch-diameter springform pan with parchment paper.  Pour enough water into large skillet to reach depth of 1 inch; bring to simmer.  Remove skillet from heat.  Place gianduja in medium metal bowl; set bowl in hot water in skillet.  Stir until gianduja is melted and smooth.  Stir in cereal and nuts.  Spread crunch evenly over parchment in pan.  Place cake atop crunch layer, pressing to adhere.  Chill until crunch is firm, about 1 hour.

For Mousse:  Place gianduja in metal bowl.  Pour enough water into large skillet to reach depth of 1 inch; bring to simmer.  Remove from heat; place bowl with gianduja in hot water in skillet.  Stir until gianduja is smooth.  Remove bowl from water; cool gianduja to lukewarm.

Using electric mixer, beat cream and salt in another bowl until very soft peaks form (when bowl is tilted, cream should be fluffy but still pourable and flow to one side).  Mix 3 tablespoons water into melted gianduja.  Pour whipped cream over and fold into gianduja just until incorporated (mousse will be very soft).

Brush top of chilled cake with liqueur.  Spread mousse over cake in pan.  Cover and chill overnight.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Keep chilled.)

Run knife between cake and pan sides to loosen.  Soak kitchen towel in hot water; wring out water.  Wrap hot wet towel around pan sides and hold 30 seconds.  Carefully remove pan sides from cake; smooth mousse with knife if necessary.  Place cake on pan bottom on rack set over baking sheet.  Sift cocoa powder lightly over top of cake.  Using stencils such as snowflakes or stars, sift powdered sugar over top of cake.  Transfer to platter and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Market Tip:  Gianduja bars are often sold only in professional quantities, but one-pound blocks (enough to make this recipe) can be ordered from Jane's Cakes and Chocolates (800-262-7630).

Comments:  Layers of chocolate mousse made with gianduja, the luscious Italian hazelnut-flavored milk chocolate, and chocolate genoise top a base of hazelnut crunch.

Do-aheads: cake layer, 1 day; assembled cake, 2 days.

Comments:  Layers of chocolate mousse made with gianduja, the luscious Italian hazelnut-flavored milk chocolate, and chocolate genoise top a base of hazelnut crunch.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  white miso (fermented soybean paste)
     1/4           cup  mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine) -- plus
  1           teaspoon  mirin
  3        tablespoons  unseasoned rice vinegar -- divided
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  4          teaspoons  toasted sesame oil (such as Asian) -- divided
  4                     skinless black cod fillets - (6 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions -- divided
  5             ounces  sunflower sprouts

Whisk miso, 1/4 cup mirin, 2 tablespoons vinegar, ginger, and 2 teaspoons sesame oil in small bowl to blend.  Place fish in 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Pour miso mixture over; turn to coat.  Let stand 30 minutes at room temperature.

Preheat broiler.  Line baking sheet with foil; brush with 1 teaspoon oil.  Place fish on foil; pour marinade over fish.  Broil until fish is cooked through and brown in spots, about 6 minutes.

Meanwhile, mix remaining 1 teaspoon mirin, 1 tablespoon vinegar, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, and 1/4 cup green onions in medium bowl.  Add sunflower sprouts; toss to coat.  Divide salad among 4 plates; top with fish and sprinkle with remaining green onions.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Miso, a salty, earthy Japanese bean paste, is rich in vitamin B and protein.  White miso, also known as shiro miso, has a more delicate flavor than darker miso pastes.  Mirin is a sweet golden wine made from glutinous rice; it is essential to Japanese cooking.  Both ingredients can be found in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets, at some natural foods stores, and at Japanese markets.

Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1              small  bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1              small  pinch freshly-ground white pepper
  2               cups  converted white rice - (abt 13 oz)
  3               cups  low-salt chicken broth

Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and bay leaf and sautÈ until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes.  Stir in salt, thyme, and white pepper.  Add rice; stir 2 minutes to coat.  Add broth and bring to boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is just tender and broth is absorbed, about 17 minutes.  Discard bay leaf.  (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.  Rewarm in microwave before using.)

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  Fluffy texture (thanks to less-starchy converted rice) and the right balance of flavors (bay, thyme, and white pepper) earn this foolproof rice its name.

This recipe is an accompaniment for Gumbo Z'Herbes (see recipe).

Comments:  Diane writes; "I'm a part-time restaurant manager and food writer, and occasionally I teach cooking classes.  One piece of advice I always share with my students is to keep the ingredients list short ó you don't need to empty out your refrigerator to make a great meal.  You just need a few quality ingredients with bold flavors."

            Rice Pudding With Persimmons And Dried Cranberries

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  ripe Hachiya persimmons
  3 1/2           cups  whole milk
     2/3           cup  arborio rice
     1/4           cup  honey
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated orange peel
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  dried cranberries

Make deep cut in pointed end of each persimmon.  Scoop out pulp into processor and puree until smooth.  Measure 2/3 cup puree.

Combine milk, rice, honey, sugar, orange peel, and salt in medium saucepan.  Bring to simmer, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Reduce heat to low and cook, uncovered, until pudding is very thick, stirring frequently, about 40 minutes.

Add cranberries and cook until softened, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in 2/3 cup persimmon puree.  Serve pudding warm or at room temperature.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and chill.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Hachiya persimmon puree flavors the pudding; using arborio (the starchy, short-grained risotto rice) gives it an especially tender, creamy texture.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRAVY BASE ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1              pound  turkey necks and/or wings
  1              pound  onions -- coarsely chopped
  3               cups  coarsely-chopped celery
  2                     bay leaves
  4                     whole cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  6               cups  apple cider
  3               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  1                     Granny Smith apple - (abt 8 oz) -- finely chopped
                        = (including core and peel)
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar
                        === TURKEY ===
  1                     turkey - (16 to 17 lbs)
  1              large  onion -- halved, and
                        cut into 1"-wide wedges
  1                     Granny Smith apple -- cut 1"-wide wedges
  6                     bay leaves -- crumbled
  7        tablespoons  room temperature butter -- divided
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth

For Gravy Base:  Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add turkey parts; sautÈ 10 minutes.  Add onions, celery, and bay leaves; sautÈ until onions are soft, about 8 minutes.  Add cloves, salt, pepper, cinnamon, and nutmeg; stir 10 seconds.  Add cider, broth, and apple; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to low; simmer uncovered 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Strain stock into medium saucepan.  Discard solids.  Stir honey and vinegar into gravy base.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled.)

For Turkey:  Set rack at lowest position in oven and preheat to 500 degrees.  Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry.  Sprinkle main cavity generously with salt and pepper.  Place onion wedges, apple wedges, and crumbled bay leaves in cavity.  Starting at neck end, carefully slide hand between skin and breast meat of turkey to loosen skin.  Rub 4 tablespoons butter over breast meat under skin.  Place turkey on rack set in large roasting pan.  Tuck wing tips under.  Tie legs together loosely to hold shape.  Rub remaining 3 tablespoons butter over outside of turkey.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Place turkey in oven and immediately reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Roast turkey 1 hour; pour 1 cup chicken broth over turkey.  Roast 1 hour, basting once with pan drippings.  Pour 1 cup chicken broth over turkey.  Roast until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, basting once with pan drippings and covering turkey loosely with foil if browning too quickly, about 1 hour longer.  Transfer turkey to platter; cover loosely with foil.  Let turkey rest 20 to 30 minutes (internal temperature of turkey will increase 5 to 10 degrees).

Pour pan juices into large measuring cup.  Spoon fat off top of pan juices and discard.  Return pan juices to roasting pan; add gravy base.  Place roasting pan over 2 burners and bring gravy to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until gravy is reduced to 31/4 cups, stirring occasionally and scraping up any browned bits, about 15 minutes.  Season gravy to taste with salt and pepper.  Strain gravy into bowl.

Serve turkey with gravy.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  The milder flavor and softer aroma of Turkish bay leaves are preferable in this dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  30                    baby beets - (1" to 1 1/2" dia ea) -- unpeeled, and
                        all but 1" of tops trimmed, rinsed - -- (abt 5 bunches)
  4              large  fresh rosemary sprigs -- plus
                        additional sprigs for garnish
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  olive oil

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Place beets in roasting pan.  Add 4 rosemary sprigs and enough water to barely cover beets.  Cover pan tightly with foil.  Roast beets until tender, about 50 minutes.  Transfer beets to work surface.  Peel while still warm; place on rimmed baking sheet.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Melt butter with oil in small saucepan.  Pour over beets on sheet; toss to coat.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Bake until heated through, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.  Transfer to bowl.  Garnish with additional rosemary sprigs and serve.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  Baby beets simply roasted to bring out their sweetness need just the barest slip of butter and a sprinkling of fresh rosemary.  Cany cane beets, if you can find them at a farmers' market, look especially festive, but so does a medley of red and yellow ones.  If baby beets are unavailable, cut peeled roasted large beets into 1-inch cubes.

               Skirt Steak With Poblano Rajas And Zucchini

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  poblano chiles -- roasted
  2                     skirt steaks - (12 oz ea)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin -- divided
  1           teaspoon  ancho chile powder
  1                cup  diced yellow or green zucchini
     3/4           cup  chopped green onions
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro

To Roast A Chile:  Using tongs, char the chile over a gas flame, or place it in the broiler, and turn it occasionally.  When chile is blackened all over, enclose it in a paper bag for 10 to 15 minutes to allow the chile to steam, which loosens the skin.

Using your fingers or the back of a knife, remove the blackened skin from the chile.  Peel, seed, and cut chiles lengthwise into 1/2-inch-wide strips.  Set aside.

Brush steaks with 1 tablespoon oil.  Mix 1 teaspoon cumin and ancho chile powder; rub spice mixture on both sides of steaks.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add zucchini, poblanos, and green onions; sautÈ until zucchini is tender, about 2 minutes.  Stir in 1 teaspoon cumin.  Add cream; boil until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes longer.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in another large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add both steaks to skillet and cook to desired doneness (about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare).  Remove steaks from pan.  Let cool 5 minutes.  Thinly slice steaks across grain.

Transfer steaks to platter.   Top with poblanos and cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Rajas are chile strips cooked with onion (raja means "slice" in Spanish).

To Roast A Chile:  Using tongs, char the chile over a gas flame, or place it in the broiler, and turn it occasionally.  When chile is blackened all over, enclose it in a paper bag for 10 to 15 minutes to allow the chile to steam, which loosens the skin.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using your fingers or the back of a knife, remove the blackened skin from the chile.  Peel, seed, and cut chiles lengthwise into 1/2-inch-wide strips.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush steaks with 1 tablespoon oil.  Mix 1 teaspoon cumin and ancho chile powder; rub spice mixture on both sides of steaks.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add zucchini, poblanos, and green onions; sautÈ until zucchini is tender, about 2 minutes.  Stir in 1 teaspoon cumin.  Add cream; boil until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes longer.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in another large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add both steaks to skillet and cook to desired doneness (about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare).  Remove steaks from pan.  Let cool 5 minutes.  Thinly slice steaks across grain.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer steaks to platter.   Top with poblanos and cilantro.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cans  medium-hot enchilada sauce - (10 oz ea)
  1                can  refried beans - (16 oz) -- divided
  1         tablespoon  chopped canned chipotle chiles*
  16                    corn tortillas - (5" to 6" dia)
  1                cup  chopped green onions - (abt 4 large) -- divided
  2               cups  diced cooked turkey meat - (abt 10 oz) -- reheated, divided
  5 1/2         ounces  coarsely-grated Monterey Jack cheese -- divided
  4             ounces  crumbled queso fresco or feta cheese -- divided
                        Diced tomatoes
                        Diced avocado

* Chipotle chiles are simply dried, smoked jalapeÒos, they're sold canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo.  Find them at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and Latin markets.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 200 degrees.  Bring enchilada sauce to simmer in medium skillet over medium heat.  Reduce heat to very low.  Combine refried beans and chipotles in another medium skillet.  Stir bean mixture over medium heat until heated through, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Dip 1 tortilla into enchilada sauce just until softened, about 10 seconds.  Using tongs, transfer tortilla to ovenproof plate.  Spread 1/3 cup bean mixture over.  Top with 1 tablespoon green onions.  Dip second tortilla into sauce; place atop bean mixture.  Top with 1/2 cup turkey meat, then 1 tablespoon green onions.  Dip third tortilla into sauce.  Place atop turkey; sprinkle with 1/3 cup Jack cheese, then 1 tablespoon green onions.  Dip fourth tortilla into sauce; place atop Jack cheese.  Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons queso fresco.  Repeat procedure with remaining tortillas, bean mixture, green onions, turkey, Jack cheese, and queso fresco.

Transfer to oven and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.  Drizzle remaining enchilada sauce over tortilla stacks.  Sprinkle each with diced tomatoes, avocado, and remaining green onions and serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

No Rolling Required:  Here the tortillas are layered with the filling (New Mexico-style) so that each person gets a neat stack.  Rewarm the turkey in broth or water in the microwave, or in a skillet on the stove.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  chili-garlic sauce*
  3        tablespoons  tamarind concentrate**
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cardamom
  2 1/4         pounds  yams - (abt 3 medium)

                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  water
     3/4         ounce  dried porcini mushrooms - (abt 3/4 cup)
  4             ounces  thinly-sliced pancetta (Italian bacon) -- coarsely chopped
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- divided
  6             ounces  fresh crimini mushrooms -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
     1/2      teaspoon  fennel seeds -- crushed
  2               cups  fresh breadcrumbs
                        = (made from crustless French bread)
  1                     turkey breast half with skin - (2 3/4 lbs) -- boned but skin left
                        intact, double butterflied
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth -- more or less
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (about) -- room temperature,
                        and divided
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  dry white wine

Bring 1 cup water and dried mushrooms to boil in heavy small saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Let stand until soft, about 30 minutes.  Drain, reserving soaking liquid.  Chop mushrooms.

SautÈ pancetta in heavy large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to paper towel to drain.  Add 2 tablespoons oil to drippings in skillet.  Add crimini mushrooms and onion.  SautÈ until mushrooms begin to brown and no liquid remains, about 8 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in pancetta and chopped porcini, then parsley, rosemary, and fennel seeds.  Mix in breadcrumbs; season stuffing to taste with salt and pepper.  Mix in enough reserved mushroom-soaking liquid by tablespoonfuls to moisten (about 3).  Cool stuffing completely.

Cover opened turkey breast with waxed paper.  Using rolling pin, pound to 1/2-inch-thick rectangle (about 14 by 10 inches).  Remove waxed paper.  Sprinkle turkey with salt and pepper.  Spread stuffing over, leaving 1-inch plain border.  Sprinkle with additional mushroom-soaking liquid if dry.  Starting at 1 long side, roll up turkey jelly-roll style.  Secure with metal turkey-lacing pins.  Tie roll crosswise with kitchen string every 1 1/2 to 2 inches to hold shape.  Tie roll once lengthwise to secure ends.  Remove metal pins.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large ovenproof skillet or heavy roasting pan over medium-high heat.  Brown turkey roll on all sides, turning often, about 12 minutes.  Pour 1/3 cup broth over.  Brush with 1 teaspoon butter.  Cover skillet with foil.  Roast turkey 30 minutes, basting 2 more times with 1/3 cup broth and brushing with 1 teaspoon butter.  Remove foil.  Roast until turkey is brown and thermometer inserted into center registers 170 degrees, basting with broth and brushing with more butter occasionally, about 15 minutes longer.  Transfer turkey to platter; tent loosely with foil.  Reserve skillet or pan.

Strain pan juices into 2-cup glass measuring cup.  Add more broth, if necessary, to measure 1 1/4 cups liquid.  Blend 2 tablespoons butter and flour in small bowl.  Place roasting skillet or pan over medium-high heat.  Add 1 1/4 cups pan-juice mixture, wine, and remaining mushroom-soaking liquid, leaving any sediment in bowl.  Simmer 5 minutes, scraping up any browned bits.  Gradually whisk in flour paste.  Simmer until gravy thickens, whisking constantly, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Remove strings from turkey.  Cut roast crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices and serve with gravy.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Prep Tip:  Ask your butcher to prepare the turkey for the roulade by double butterflying the breast to make a large, thin rectangle.

Comments:  You'll need metal turkey-lacing pins (sold at supermarkets) to secure the roulade.

Because they grow up to be portobellos, crimini are sometimes labled baby bellas.  They are often sold in 6-  to 8-ounce containers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  finely-chopped toasted walnuts
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  powdered sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1              large  egg yolk
                        Raw sugar* -- as needed

* Also called turbinado or demerara sugar; available at most supermarkets and natural foods stores.

Mix flour, walnuts, baking powder, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in egg yolk.  Add flour mixture and stir until blended.  Shape dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill until firm enough to roll, about 15 minutes.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness.  Using assorted cutters, cut out cookies.

This recipe yields about 30 cookies.

Comments:  Use a variety of holiday cookie cutters to make these classic French shortbreads.

     1/8      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1 1/3           cups  coarsely-chopped walnuts
                        === TERRINE ===
  4              large  egg yolks
  1 1/2           cups  heavy whipping cream
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
     1/2           cup  sugar
  8             ounces  high-quality white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt or Perugina)
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Blackberry-Raspberry Sauce -- (see recipe)

For Praline:  Line rimmed baking sheet with foil.  Stir sugar, 1/2 cup water, and cream of tartar in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup is pale amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 5 minutes.  Add nuts; stir with wooden spoon until coated with syrup.  Continue to cook until syrup is deep amber color, gently pushing nuts into syrup, about 3 minutes longer.

Immediately scrape mixture out onto prepared baking sheet, spreading as thinly as possible with metal spatula.  Let praline stand until cool and firm, about 1 hour.  Break praline into irregular pieces.  Set aside a few pieces for garnish.  Coarsely chop remaining praline.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

For Terrine:  Whisk yolks in bowl to blend.  Bring cream, milk, and sugar to simmer in heavy medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Gradually whisk cream mixture into yolks; return to saucepan and stir constantly until mixture thickens slightly and instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers 170 degrees, about 3 minutes (do not boil).  Transfer custard to 4-cup measuring cup; cool slightly.

Place white chocolate in medium metal bowl.  Set bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water; stir just until chocolate is melted and smooth.  Remove bowl from over water.  Gradually whisk warm custard into melted chocolate.  Mix in vanilla.  Cover and chill custard at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.

Process custard in ice cream maker.  Transfer ice cream to container; cover and freeze at least 6 hours or overnight.

Line 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan with double layer of plastic wrap, leaving 4-inch overhang.  Spread 1/3 of ice cream over bottom of prepared loaf pan; sprinkle with half of chopped praline.  Spread half of remaining ice cream over; sprinkle with remaining chopped praline.  Spread remaining ice cream over.  Fold plastic wrap over to cover.  Freeze overnight.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Keep frozen.)

Invert terrine onto platter; remove plastic wrap.  Serve terrine with sauce and garnish with reserved praline pieces.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  An elegant terrine with pretty layers of walnut praline and homemade white chocolate ice cream.

Do-aheads: praline, 3 days; sauce, 1 day; entire terrine, 3 days.
