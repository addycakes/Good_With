Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 18    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  1               dash  salt
  1                cup  sugar
  4                     egg whites
  4                     apples -- cored and diced
  1 1/2           cups  unsweetened applesauce
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spray a 10-inch tube pan with nonstick cooking spray.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt.

In a large bowl, with an electric mixer at high speed, beat the sugar and egg whites until soft peaks form.  With the mixer at low speed, blend in the apples, applesauce and vanilla.  Add the flour mixture; stir until just combined (do not overmix).

Scrape the batter into the pan; spread it smooth.  Bake until golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 55 minutes.  Cool in the pan on a rack 10 minutes.  Remove from the pan and cool on the rack 20 minutes longer; serve warm.

This recipe yields 18 servings.

Comments:  Serve this fragrant apple cake hot from the oven, topped with a scoop of vanilla nonfat frozen yogurt.  What could be more warming on a blustery autumn day?

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PANCAKES ===
     2/3           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  whole-wheat flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  double-acting baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  low-fat (1%) buttermilk
     1/3           cup  fat-free egg substitute
  1                cup  fresh or frozen blueberries
     1/2           cup  unsalted dry-roasted cashews -- halved
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/4      teaspoon  cornstarch
  1                cup  fresh or frozen blueberries
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice

To prepare the pancakes, in a medium bowl, combine the flours, the sugar, baking powder and salt.  Add the buttermilk and egg substitute; stir until just blended.  Stir in the blueberries and cashews.

Spray a large nonstick skillet or griddle with nonstick cooking spray; heat.  Spoon the batter, 1/4 cup at a time, into the skillet, making 4 pancakes.  Cook about 2 minutes on each side.  Remove the pancakes and keep warm.  Repeat with the remaining batter, making 16 pancakes.

Meanwhile, to prepare the topping, in a small saucepan, blend the cornstarch with 2 1/2 tablespoons water.  Stir in the blueberries, sugar and lemon juice; cook until the mixture boils and thickens, about 3 minutes.

Arrange 4 pancakes on each of 4 warm plates.  Top each portion with 2 tablespoons of the warm sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder -- sifted
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

In a large nonstick saucepan or Dutch oven, combine the broth, carrots, celery, potato and onion; bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.

Stir in the corn, beans, milk and pepper; increase the heat and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring as needed, until the corn is tender, about 3 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving:  194 Calories, 2 g Total Fat, 1 g Saturated Fat, 3 mg Cholesterol, 214 mg Sodium, 36 g Total Carbohydrate, 7 g Dietary Fiber, 11 g Protein, 128 mg Calcium.

Serving Provides:  1 Bread, 1 Fruit/Vegetable, 1 Protein/Milk.

Points Per Serving:  3.

Comments:  Serve this hearty corn chowder - an updated childhood favorite - with warm dinner rolls and a side salad for a no fuss dinner.  Like most soups, the leftovers refrigerate or freeze well and the flavors are even better the next day.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  whole-wheat flour
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  double-acting baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  cold reduced-calorie margarine -- diced
     3/4           cup  plain nonfat yogurt
     1/3           cup  thawed frozen orange juice concentrate
  2                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  fresh or frozen blueberries
  1                cup  fresh or frozen cranberries
  24                    dried apricot halves -- chopped

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Spray eighteen 2 3/4-inch nonstick muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray, or line with paper liners.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in the margarine until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

In a medium bowl, combine the yogurt, orange juice concentrate and eggs.  Stir into the flour mixture until just combined (do not overmix).  Gently stir in the blueberries, cranberries and apricots.

Spoon the batter into the cups, filling each about two-thirds full.  Bake until golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.  Cool on a rack 10 minutes; remove from the cups and cool completely on the rack.

This recipe yields 18 servings.

  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spray a 13- by 9-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.

In a large bowl, with an electric mixer at medium speed, beat the granulated sugar, yogurt, egg whites, vanilla and vinegar until fluffy, about 2 minutes.  With the mixer at low speed, gradually add the flour mixture; stir until just combined (do not overmix).  Add 2 cups water and stir until just smooth.

Pour the batter into the pan.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.  Cool completely in the pan on a rack.  Dust with the confectioners' sugar.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/3           cups  reduced-fat buttermilk baking mix
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  3        tablespoons  cold unsalted stick margarine -- diced
     2/3           cup  fat-free egg substitute
     1/2           cup  skim milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  1                cup  spreadable fruit (any flavor)
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spray a 15- by 10-inch jelly-roll pan with nonstick cooking spray.

In a large bowl, combine the baking mix and granulated sugar.  With a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in the margarine until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the egg substitute, milk, and the extracts; with a wooden spoon, stir until just combined (do not overmix).

Spread two-thirds of the batter into the pan, smoothing the top; spoon the spreadable fruit evenly over the batter.  Drop the remaining batter by tablespoonfuls evenly over the fruit.  Bake until light brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Cool in the pan on a rack 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, whisk the confectioners' sugar with 1 tablespoon water until smooth; drizzle evenly over the top of the cake while it is still warm.

This recipe yields 18 servings.

Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  unsalted stick margarine
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
  4                     scallions -- thinly sliced
  6               cups  shredded green leaf lettuce
  4               cups  low-sodium vegetable broth
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese

In a large nonstick saucepan or Dutch oven, melt the margarine.  Add the celery and scallions; cook, stirring as needed, until softened, about 5 minutes.

Stir in the lettuce, broth, parsley, pepper and 1 cup water; bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring as needed, until the lettuce is wilted, about 5 minutes.  Serve, sprinkled with the cheese.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    graham cracker 2 1/2" squares
  4          teaspoons  cold reduced-calorie margarine
  1           envelope  sugar-free lemon-flavored gelatin mix
                        = (four 1/2 cup servings)
     1/2           cup  boiling water
  1           envelope  reduced-cal instant vanilla pudding mix
                        = (four 1/2 cup servings)
  2               cups  aspartame-sweetened lemon nonfat yogurt
  1                cup  skim milk
  1                cup  plain nonfat yogurt

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spray a 9-inch pie plate with nonstick cooking spray.

In a food processor or blender, process the crackers until finely crumbled.  Add the margarine; process until evenly moistened.  Press the crumb mixture evenly onto the bottom and part way up the sides of the pie plate.  Bake until browned, 6 to 8 minutes.  Cool completely on a rack.

In a small bowl, combine the gelatin mix and water; stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved, about 2 minutes.  Set aside to cool slightly.

In a large bowl, with an electric mixer at medium speed, beat together the pudding mix, 1 cup of the lemon yogurt, the milk and plain yogurt.  Add the gelatin mixture and stir until thoroughly combined.

Pour into the cooled pie crust; refrigerate, covered, until firm, at least 8 hours.  Cut into 8 wedges; top each wedge with 2 tablespoons of the remaining lemon yogurt.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cans  no-salt-added whole tomatoes - (28 oz ea) -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano

  2             pounds  sole of flounder fillets -- cut into 1" pieces
     1/2           cup  minced parsley

In a large nonstick saucepan or Dutch oven, heat the oil.  Add the celery, onions and garlic; cook, stirring as needed, until softened, about 5 minutes.

Add the tomatoes, wine, basil, oregano, thyme, pepper and salt; bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the flavors are blended, about 25 minutes.

Comments:  You can make the soup stock in advance and add the fish before you serve it.  Our tasters praised its rich broth and excellent flavor and commented that it "wasn't too fishy."  With a salad and some French bread, it makes an ideal light meal.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  quick-cooking oatmeal
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  nonfat dry milk
  1           teaspoon  baking powder

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     onion -- chopped
     1/2                green bell pepper -- seeded and chopped
  1                     tomato -- diced
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
  2               cups  fat-free egg substitute
     1/3           cup  shredded reduced fat Monterey Jack cheese
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Spray a medium nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray; heat.  Add the onion and bell pepper; cook, stirring as needed, until softened, about 5 minutes.  Add the tomato and oregano; cook, stirring as needed, until the tomato is softened, about 2 minutes.

Meanwhile, spray a large nonstick skillet with non stick cooking spray; place over medium-low heat.  Add the egg substitute and cook until set, about 8 minutes, lifting the edges frequently with a spatula to let the uncooked egg substitute flow underneath.

Sprinkle the frittata evenly with the tomato mixture and the cheese; cook, covered, until the cheese is melted, about 3 minutes.  Serve, sprinkled with the black pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving:  112 Calories, 2 g Total Fat, 1 g Saturated Fat, 7 mg Cholesterol, 279 mg Sodium, 7 g Total Carbohydrate, 1 g Dietary Fiber, 16 g Protein, 134 mg Calcium.

Serving Provides:  1 Fruit/Vegetable, 2 Protein/Milk.

Points Per Serving:  2.

Comments:  The secret to making a frittata (an open face Italian omelet) is to use low heat so that the egg cooks through without burning the bottom.  Serve this with a biscuit or toast for a satisfying meal.

  2               cups  low-sodium vegetable broth
  3                     carrots -- cut into 2" chunks
  4                     onions -- chopped
  3              small  all-purpose potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 2" chunks
  1                cup  parsley leaves
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  2                     carrots -- sliced
  1                cup  sliced mushrooms
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  saffron threads -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  plain nonfat yogurt
                        Minced parsley -- for garnish

In a large nonstick saucepan or Dutch oven, bring the broth, carrot chunks, onions, potatoes, parsley leaves and 7 cups water to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the vegetables are tender, about 1 hour.

Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil.  Add the sliced carrots and mushrooms; cook, covered, stirring as needed, until the carrots are tender, about 10 minutes, adding 1 tablespoon water at a time, if necessary.  Stir in the pepper and saffron.

With a slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables from the saucepan to a blender or food processor.  Puree, then return them to the broth.  Whisk in the yogurt and stir in the sauteed vegetables; cook, stirring as needed, until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.  Serve, garnished with the minced parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  3        tablespoons  rice-wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  wasabi powder*
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  grated peeled gingerroot
  8             ounces  cooked crabmeat -- picked over,
                        and flaked
  1                cup  cold cooked sushi rice**
  1                     tomato -- chopped
     1/2                carrot -- shredded
     1/2                cucumber -- peeled and chopped

  1                     nori (dried seaweed) sheet -- (optional), cut
                        into strips

* Wasabi, the Japanese version of horseradish, has a sharp, pungent, fiery flavor. It is available in Asian markets and some supermarkets.

** Sushi rice, once cooled, has a glossy sheen and separates easily. It is available in Asian markets and some supermarkets.

In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, wasabi powder, oil and ginger.

In a large bowl, combine the crab, rice, tomato, carrot and cucumber.  Add the vinegar mixture and toss to coat.  Serve the lettuce, topped with the crabmeat mixture and garnished with the nori (if using).

  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  2               cans  no-salt-added diced tomatoes - -- (14 1/2 oz ea)
  2               cups  low-sodium vegetable broth

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     sheets phyllo dough - (abt 4 oz) -- thawed if frozen
  1           teaspoon  unsalted stick margarine
  1                     onion -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  skim milk
  1            package  frozen mixed vegetables - (16 oz) -- thawed
                        = (broccoli, cauliflower and carrots)
  2               cups  diced cooked skinless turkey breast
  1                cup  sliced mushrooms
  1             packet  instant low-sodium chicken broth and
                        seasoning mix
     1/3           cup  shredded nonfat cheddar cheese

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Cover the phyllo dough with a damp towel and plastic wrap to prevent drying.

In a large nonstick saucepan, melt the margarine.  Add the onion and cook, stirring as needed, until softened, about 5 minutes.

Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the onion is coated with the flour, about 1 minute.  Gradually stir in the milk; cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture boils and thickens, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the mixed vegetables, turkey, mushrooms and broth mix; return to a boil, stirring as needed.  Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese.

Pour the mixture into a 9-inch square baking pan.  Fold each phyllo sheet in half and place, one at a time, on top of the mixture, spraying each sheet lightly with nonstick cooking spray, including the top layer. Tuck under the overlapping edges. Bake until golden, about 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  low-sodium chicken broth
  3             ounces  capellini (angel-hair pasta)
     1/2           cup  chopped watercress
     1/2           cup  sliced radishes
     1/2         pound  reduced-fat firm tofu -- cubed
     1/2           cup  bean sprouts
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds -- toasted*

* To toast the sesame seeds, place a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the sesame seeds and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, 1-2 minutes.

In a medium nonstick saucepan, bring the broth, capellini, watercress and radishes to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the capellini is tender, about 3 minutes.

Increase the heat and stir in the tofu, bean sprouts, vinegar, tamari and oil; cook, stirring as needed, until heated though, about 3 minutes.  Serve, sprinkled with the sesame seeds.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Per Serving:  314 Calories, 9 g Total Fat, 2 g Saturated Fat, 6 mg Cholesterol, 603 mg Sodium, 40 g Total Carbohydrate, 2 g Dietary Fiber, 19 g Protein, 135 mg Calcium.

Comments:  Perhaps it's not prepared exactly as it would be in Saigon, but this fresh, flavorful, hearty soup is guaranteed to wake up your taste buds and dress up your dinner table.  Best if all, you can have it on the table in about 20 minutes - including prep time.
