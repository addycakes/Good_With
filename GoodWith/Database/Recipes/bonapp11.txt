  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ZABAGLIONE CREAM ===
  3                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  Marsala
     1/2           cup  chilled whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  sour cream
                        === TART ===
  1                     nine-inch refrigerated ready pie crust -- (half of 15-oz pkg),
                        at room temperature
  1           teaspoon  all-purpose flour - (heaping)
  1 1/2           cups  pitted fresh cherries
                        = (or frozen, thawed and well drained)
  3        tablespoons  grated bittersweet (not unsweetened) choco
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)

For Zabaglione Cream:  Whisk yolks and sugar in top of double boiler over simmering water to blend.  Gradually whisk in Marsala.  Continue whisking until mixture is tripled in volume and holds shape in spoon, about 5 minutes.

Set top of double boiler over bowl filled with ice and water and whisk zabaglione until cool.  Remove from over water.

Beat cream and sour cream in medium bowl to stiff peaks.  Whisk in zabaglione.  Cover and refrigerate until well chilled.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)

For Tart:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Dust 1 side of crust with flour.  Gently transfer crust to 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom, floured-side down.  Press into pan and press to seal any cracks.  Trim edges.  Pierce all over with fork.  Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Cool on rack.

Drain cherries on paper towels.  Arrange in crust.  Spoon Zabaglione Cream over.  Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead.)

Sprinkle with chocolate and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A sophisticated finale that's easier than pie.  If you have a little extra time, you might make your own pastry shell.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SOUFFLE ===
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  4             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) -- coarsely chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
  2                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  Cointreau
                        = (or other orange liquer)
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
  3                     egg whites -- room temperature
  1            pinches  cream of tartar
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        Powdered sugar
                        === WHIPPED CREAM ===
  1              ounce  imported white chocolate
     1/2           cup  chilled whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  grated orange peel
  1         tablespoon  Cointreau
                        = (or other orange liquer)

To make the souffle:  Cook cream and chocolate in heavy small saucepan over low heat, stirring until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.  Remove from heat and beat in yolks 1 at a time.  Mix in Cointreau and orange peel.  Cook to tepid.  (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead.  Cover and let stand at room temperature.  Stir over low heat until tepid before continuing.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter one 4-cup or two 1 3/4-cup souffle dishes; dust with sugar.  Beat whites and cream of tartar in medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Beat in 2 tablespoons sugar.  Fold 1/4 of whites into chocolate.  Gently fold in remaining whites.  Spoon into prepared dishes.  (Can be prepared 1 hour ahead.  Cover and let stand in draft-free areas at room temperature.)

Bake until souffle rises but still moves in center when touched, about 20 minutes for individuals and 30 minutes for one large.  Dust tops with powdered sugar.  Serve immediately, passing whipped cream separately.

To make the whipped cream:  Cut chocolate into 1/4-inch dice.  Combine cream, sugar and orange peel in medium bowl and beat until stiff peaks form.  Mix in Cointreau.  Fold in chocolate.  (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  dried peaches - (abt 8 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/2           cup  Pecher Mignon or other peach liqueur
                        = (do not use peach brandy)
  1         tablespoon  unflavored gelatin
  3              large  eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar, plus
  3 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  2               cups  chilled whipping cream
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
                        Fresh mint sprigs

Combine dried peaches and water in heavy medium saucepan.  Let stand 30 minutes.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer gently until peaches are very soft, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, place 1/4 cup Pecher Mignon in small bowl; sprinkle gelatin over.  Set aside to soften.

Beat 3 egg yolks, 1/2 cup sugar and remaining 1/4 cup Pecher Mignon in top of double boiler until light in color.  Set over simmering water and stir until thick enough to coat back of spoon when finger is drawn across (do not boil), about 2 minutes.   Transfer to small bowl.

Add gelatin to hot peach mixture and stir until dissolved.  Transfer to processor and puree until smooth.  Pour into large bowl.  Cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally (do not let peach mixture set up.)

Add custard to peach mixture and whisk to combine.  Using electric mixer, beat cream in medium bowl to soft peaks.  Mix 1/3 of whipped cream into peach mixture to lighten.  Gently fold in remaining cream in 2 batches.

Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in another medium bowl until frothy.   Gradually add remaining 3 1/2 tablespoons sugar and beat until smooth, glossy and almost stiff but not dry.  Fold 1/3 of whites into peach mixture to lighten.  Gently fold in remaining whites in 2 batches.  Cover bowl with plastic and refrigerate mousse 8 hours or overnight.

Spoon mousse into pastry bag fitted with large star tip.  Pipe mousse into goblets or wine glasses.  Top mousse with fresh mint sprigs and serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     1 ounce pack dried shiitake mushrooms
  1 1/2           cups  hot water
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  6                     bacon slices -- minced
  3                     shallots -- minced
  4             ounces  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- sliced
                        = (or button mushrooms)
     1/2      teaspoon  dried rosemary -- crumbled
  1                cup  beef stock
                        = (or canned unsalted broth)
  1 1/4           cups  half-and-half
  8             ounces  fettuccine
     2/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - (2 oz)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Minced fresh Italian parsley
                        Additional freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Place dried mushrooms in medium bowl.  Add hot water and let soak until softened, about 30 minutes.  Remove mushrooms from water, squeezing excess water back into bowl.  Strain and reserve soaking liquid.  Slice mushrooms, discarding stems.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add bacon and cook until fat renders, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes.  Pour off half of fat.  Add shallots to bacon in skillet and saute 1 minute.  Add dried and fresh mushrooms and rosemary and saute 3 minutes.  Add stock and mushroom-soaking liquid.  Boil until liquid is reduced to glaze, about 10 minutes.  Add half-and-half and simmer until beginning to thicken, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Add pasta to large pot of boiling salted water.  Cook until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, rewarm mushroom sauce over medium-low heat.

Drain pasta.  Add to sauce and stir until coated.  Mix in 2/3 cup Parmesan.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to plates.  Sprinkle with parsley.  Pass additional Parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Make this intriguing sauce ahead, then just heat it up while the pasta cooks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  sugar
  7 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
     3/8      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  chilled unsalted butter - (3 sticks) -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2 1/4      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  pecans - (abt 6 oz)
  1                cup  mini chocolate chips
  9        tablespoons  finely-chopped crystallized ginger
                        Sugar -- for sprinkling

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine first 4 ingredients in processor and blend.  Add butter and vanilla and cut in until mixture resembles fine meal, using on/off turns.  Add pecans and process until finely chopped.  Add chocolate chips and ginger and mix in.

Transfer mixture to bowl and gather together.  Divide into thirds.  Roll 1 piece out between sheets of waxed paper to thickness of 1/4 inch.  Cut out cookies, using 3-inch heart-shaped cutter.  Transfer to ungreased cookie sheets.  Gather scraps.  Repeat rolling and cutting with remaining dough.

Re-roll scraps and cut additional cookies.  Sprinkle cookies with sugar.  Bake until just beginning to color, about 20 minutes.  Cool on sheets on rack 5 minutes.  Transfer cookies to rack and cool.  (Cookies can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Store in airtight container.)

This recipe yields about 4 dozen.

Comments:  Easy, do-ahead heart-shaped cookies to go with the strawberries.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  lowfat cottage cheese
     1/2           cup  plain lowfat yogurt
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  8             ounces  fettuccine -- freshly cooked
                        Paprika -- for sprinkling

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add turkey and onion and cook until turkey is brown, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes.  Mix in mushrooms, wine and nutmeg.  Season turkey with salt and pepper.  Reduce heat.  Simmer 15 minutes.

Puree cottage cheese, yogurt and lemon juice in blender or processor until smooth.  Add to turkey and stir until heated through (do not boil).  Place fettuccine on platter.  Pour turkey over.  Sprinkle with paprika.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A mixture of cottage cheese, lowfat yogurt and lemon juice replaces the sour cream in the traditional version of this dish.  Ground turkey makes an especially good choice for those watching their cholesterol intake.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  pork sausage
                        = (preferably hot breakfast sausage)
     1/2           cup  diced green bell pepper

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINARA SAUCE ===
  2             pounds  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                can  tomato paste - (6 oz)
  5                     fresh basil leaves -- cut julienne
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk ricotta cheese
  1                cup  freshly-grated Romano cheese
  2                     eggs -- beaten to blend
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh Italian parsley
  16                    Manicotti Crepes -- (see below)
                        === MANICOTTI CREPES ===
  3                     eggs
  1                cup  water
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all purpose flour
                        Olive oil, as needed
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  6             ounces  mozzarella cheese -- cut into 1/4"
                        by 1/4" by 3" strips
  5                     fresh basil leaves
                        Additional freshly-grated Romano

For Sauce:  Chop tomatoes in processor.  Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add garlic and cook until soft (do not brown), about 1 1/2 minutes.  Stir in tomato paste, then tomatoes, basil and salt.  Simmer until sauce thickens, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.  Set aside.

For Filling:  Beat ricotta in medium bowl until smooth and creamy.  Mix in 1 cup Romano cheese, eggs, prosciutto and minced fresh parsley.

For Crepes:  Mix eggs and water in blender.  Add flour and blend batter until smooth.  Let stand 30 minutes.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before continuing.)

Heat crepe pan or heavy small skillet over medium-high heat.  Brush pan lightly with olive oil.  Remove pan from heat.  Stir batter and ladle 2 tablespoons into corner of pan, tilting so batter just coats bottom.  Return excess batter to bowl.  Cook crepe until bottom is set (do not brown), about 5 seconds.  Loosen edges with knife.  Turn crepe and cook until second side is set (do not brown), about 5 seconds.

Repeat with remaining batter, stirring occasionally.  (Can be prepared ahead.  Layer crepes between sheets of waxed paper and cool completely.  Wrap tightly and refrigerate 3 days or freeze 1 month.  Bring to room temperature before using.)  Store extra in the freezer for another use.  (Makes about 26)

For Assembly:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spoon 2 1/2 tablespoons filling down center of crepe.  Place 1 mozzarella strip atop filling.  Fold both sides of crepe over filling.  Arrange seam-side down in large baking dish.  Repeat with remaining filling and crepes.  (Can be prepared ahead.  Cover crepes and sauce separately and refrigerate 1 day or freeze up to 2 weeks.  Bring crepes to room temperature before baking.  Rewarm sauce over low heat, stirring occasionally.)

Stir whole basil leaves into sauce.  Pour sauce over crepes.  Sprinkle lightly with additional Romano cheese.  Cover tightly with foil.  Bake until heated through, about 35 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

     2/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling water until tender.  Drain well.  Press through food mill or ricer into same pot or return to pot and mash.  Mix in milk and 1 1/2 tablespoons butter.

Melt remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter in heavy small skillet.  Add green onions and saute until wilted, about 1 minute.  Add to potatoes.  Add Parmesan and mix gently.  Season with salt and freshly ground pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled or tripled.

Comments:  Pressing potatoes through a food mill or ricer gives them a fabulous texture.  But they're just as delicious simply mashed.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           envelope  dry yeast
     3/4           cup  warm water - (105 to 115 degrees) -- plus
  2        tablespoons  warm water - (105 to 115 degrees)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2 1/2           cups  bread flour -- or more if needed
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  1                cup  prepared pizza sauce
     3/4           cup  pitted black olives -- halved
     1/4           cup  pitted green olives -- halved
  12            ounces  mozzarella cheese -- shredded
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/3         pound  mushrooms -- sliced
     1/2                green bell pepper -- cut julienne
     1/2                red bell pepper -- cut julienne
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Minced fresh herbs -- (optional)
                        = (such as oregano, basil and rosemary)
     1/2           cup  mesquite chips -- soaked 30 minutes,
                        and drained

Sprinkle yeast over warm water in small bowl; stir to dissolve.  Let stand 5 minutes.  Stir in 2 tablespoons oil.

Mix 2 1/2 cups flour and salt in processor using on/off turns.  With machine running, pour yeast mixture through feed tube and process until combined, about 10 seconds.  Knead dough on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, adding more flour to dough if sticky, about 5 minutes.

Brush large bowl with olive oil.  Add dough, turning to coat entire surface.  Cover and let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Punch dough down; cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before continuing with recipe.)

Prepare covered barbecue grill (medium-high heat).  Brush 14-inch pizza pan with 1-inch-high sides with olive oil.  Punch dough down and knead 2 minutes.  Roll dough out on lightly floured surface to 16-inch round.  Transfer to prepared pan.

Spread sauce over dough; sprinkle with black and green olives.  Top with both cheeses, then mushrooms and bell peppers.  Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil.  Sprinkle with minced herbs if desired.

Add mesquite chips to fire.  Open bottom barbecue vent.  Place pizza on rack on lowest rung.  Cover, leaving top vent half open.  Bake until crust is golden brown, checking occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields one 14-inch pizza.

                          Our Favorite Tiramisu

Recipe By     :Suzanne Solberg, Los Angeles, CA
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate
  1                cup  sugar
  4                     egg yolks
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla
  8             ounces  cream cheese -- cut into pieces,
                        at room temperature
  1 3/4           cups  chilled whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  instant espresso powder -- diluted in
  1 1/4           cups  hot water -- cooled
  1                     prepared pound cake - (12 oz) -- cut into 3 1/2"
                        by 1" by 1/2" strips

Finely chop chocolate in processor.  Set aside.

Mix sugar and egg yolks in processor 30 seconds.  Add vanilla and process until pale yellow, about 1 minute.  Add cheese in batches and blend until smooth.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Cover and chill 1 hour.

Beat whipping cream until stiff.  Fold into cream cheese mixture.  Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, about 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.)

Pour espresso into large shallow dish.  Dip cake strips in espresso, turning to coat all sides lightly.  Arrange strips on bottom of 10-cup shallow dish, smoothing with fingers to mold together.  Sprinkle with half of chocolate.  Top with chilled cheese mixture.  Sprinkle remaining chocolate over.  Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Layers of espresso-soaked pound cake and cream cheese custard come together with chocolate.  Tiramis˘ means "pick-me-up" in Italian-and this certainly does.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced peeled fresh ginger

  12                    fresh oysters

Combine first 4 ingredients in small bowl.  Let stand 15 minutes.

To open oysters:  Using towel, hold oyster flat on work surface, flat shell up.  Insert tip of oyster knife into hinge and twist to open shell.  Slide knife along inside of upper shell to free oyster from shell; discard upper shell.  Slide knife under oyster to free from lower shell; leave in shell.

Repeat with remaining oysters.  Arrange oysters on edge of two plates.  Divide sauce between 2 small bowls.  Place one bowl in the center of each plate and serve.

Comments:  A twist on the traditional sauce for raw oysters.  It works well with steamed clams, too.

     1/2           cup  grated parmesan
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  12            ounces  Fontina or provolone -- grated

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Saute first 6 ingredients in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat until sausage and beef are brown, crumbling with fork, about 5 minutes.

Add tomatoes, tomato paste and cayenne and simmer 5 minutes, breaking up tomatoes with back of spoon.  Add kidney beans and heat through.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add mostaccioli, Parmesan and parsley and toss to combine.

Transfer to 9- by 13-inch baking dish.  Sprinkle with cheese.  Bake until cheese melts, about 30 minutes.

Comments:  Pasta Fazool is slang for the classic Italian pasta e fagioli (pasta and beans).  This recipe includes Italian sausage and beef along with kidney beans and pasta.  It's all topped with Fontina.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fresh breadcrumbs
                        = (preferably made from French bread)
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  minced green onion
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  lightly-toasted pine nuts
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh mint
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     lemon -- halved
  4                     baby artichokes
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  8                     red new potatoes - (1" to 1 1/2" dia) -- halved
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/4         pounds  rack of lamb - (to 1 1/2) -- fat trimmed
                        to 1/4" thickness
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard

Combine first 6 ingredients in medium bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover tightly and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Fill medium bowl with cold water; squeeze in juice of half a lemon.  Cut end off stem of 1 artichoke and rub with lemon.  Starting from base, bend each leaf back and snap off at natural break until half of length of exposed leaves is light green.  Cut off top dark green part of leaves.  Trim all dark green areas off artichoke.  Rub with lemon.  Cut in quarters lengthwise.  Cut out any choke and red-tipped leaves and discard.  Place in bowl of lemon water.  Repeat with remaining artichokes.

Place 1 tablespoon oil in medium baking pan and place in oven to heat.  Drain artichokes and place in another medium baking pan.  Add potatoes, 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice to artichokes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Season lamb with salt and pepper.  Place lamb fat- side down in baking pan with heated oil.  Place vegetables and lamb in oven.  Roast 15 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees and roast 5 minutes.

Remove lamb and vegetables from oven.  Spoon 3 tablespoons lamb drippings onto vegetables and mix.  Return vegetables to oven.  Spread 1 tablespoon mustard over bone side and ends of lamb; press half of breadcrumb mixture into mustard.  Turn lamb and spread 1 tablespoon mustard over fat side of lamb; press in remaining crumbs.  Return lamb to oven.  Continue roasting lamb and vegetables until thermometer inserted into center of lamb registers 130 degrees for medium-rare and vegetables are just tender, stirring vegetables occasionally, 15 minutes.

Let lamb stand 10 minutes.  Slice into chops.  Divide between plates, crossing bones in center.  Spoon vegetables onto plates and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

     1/4           cup  dry red wine
     1/4           cup  sugar, plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice

     1/3           cup  purchased balsamic vinaigrette
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  2                     round crusty rolls -- split
  2              large  portobello mushrooms - (abt 5" dia) -- stemmed

  1                     tomato -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  arugula leaves - (loosely packed)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Whisk vinaigrette and rosemary in small bowl.  Brush cut sides of rolls with vinaigrette.  Place rolls on grill, cut-side down.  Grill until lightly toasted, about 1 minute.  Transfer to 2 plates.

Brush mushrooms on both sides with vinaigrette.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.  Place mushrooms on grill, dark gill-side down.  Close grill or cover mushrooms with small metal roasting pan; cook until mushrooms begin to soften, brushing with vinaigrette once, about 5 minutes.

Turn mushrooms over.  Cover; grill until tender when pierced with knife, about 7 minutes longer.  Place 2 cheese slices on each mushroom.  Cover; grill until cheese melts, about 1 minute.

Place 1 mushroom on bottom half of each roll.  Top each with tomato, arugula, and top half of roll.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Offer deli-bought orzo salad tossed with slivered basil and Kalamata olives, along with some grilled red pepper quarters.  Raspberry gelato in sugar cones would be a cool dessert.

Comments:  Offer deli-bought orzo salad tossed with slivered basil and Kalamata olives, along with some grilled red pepper quarters.  Raspberry gelato in sugar cones would be a cool dessert.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  parsley leaves and stems - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary -- plus
                        Additional rosemary sprigs -- for garnish
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
  1                     garlic clove
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  rack of lamb

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Place parsley, chopped rosemary, grated Parmesan cheese and garlic in processor.  Process to coarse paste.  With machine running, gradually add olive oil.  Season pesto to taste with salt and pepper.

Place lamb on small rimmed baking sheet.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Spread all pesto over rounded side of lamb.  Roast 10 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees and roast to desired doneness, about 15 minutes longer for medium-rare.

Cut lamb between bones into chops.  Divide chops between 2 plates; garnish with rosemary sprigs.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Oven-roasted red potato chunks sprinkled with chives; steamed and buttered baby carrots; and a limestone lettuce salad would be good accompaniments to this elegant main course.  Finish with a strawberry-rhubarb pie from the bakery.

                  Salmon Burgers With Dill Tartar Sauce

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Sandwiches
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  skinless salmon fillet -- cut into 1" pieces
  3        tablespoons  purchased tartar sauce -- plus
     1/2           cup  purchased tartar sauce
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  2                     sesame-seed rolls -- split
                        Red onion slices
  4                     Bibb lettuce leaves

Place salmon fillets, 3 tablespoons tartar sauce, 1 tablespoon dill, salt, and pepper in processor.  Blend using on/off turns until coarsely ground.  Form into two 1/2-inch-thick patties.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Whisk 1/2 cup tartar sauce, 1 tablespoon dill, and lemon peel in medium bowl to blend.  Grill rolls until toasted.  Transfer to 2 plates and spread bottom halves generously with sauce.

Grill patties until fish is cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.  Place burgers atop sauce on rolls.  Top each with onion slices, 2 lettuce leaves, and top half of roll.  Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  These burgers are easier to handle if they are chilled for one hour before grilling.  They would be great with rice salad and cucumber slices.  Grilled pound cake topped with crushed sweetened strawberries and whipped cream.  This recipe yields a luscious finale.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  duck breast halves -- boned, with
                        bones reserved
                        Olive oil, as needed
     1/2      teaspoon  minced fresh thyme
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried thyme, crumbled)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 3/4         pounds  chicken backs or wings
  1                     onion -- quartered
  1                cup  beef stock
                        = (or canned unsalted broth)
  1                cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt broth)
                        Salt -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                     shallot -- minced
     1/2           cup  Port
  6                     dried Calimyrna figs -- stemmed, quartered
     3/4      teaspoon  minced fresh thyme
                        = (or 1/4 tspn dried thyme, crumbled)

Remove excess fat from duck breasts.  Brush breasts with oil; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon thyme and pepper.  Cover and let stand 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Refrigerate.)

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add duck bones, chicken backs and onion and cook until brown, turning occasionally, about 12 minutes.  Add both stocks.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until reduced to 3/4 cup liquid, about 1 hour.  Strain and degrease duck stock.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Season duck breasts with salt; add to skillet skin-side down and cook 4 minutes.  Turn and cook about 2 minutes longer for medium-rare.  Transfer to heated platter and tent with foil to keep warm.

Pour off fat from skillet.  Add 1 tablespoon butter to skillet and melt over medium heat.  Add shallot and saute until translucent, about 2 minutes.  Add Port and figs.  Increase heat and boil until liquid is reduced to glaze, scraping up any browned bits, about 4 minutes.  Add duck stock and boil until syrupy, adding any juices accumulated on duck platter, about 6 minutes.  Remove from heat and whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon at a time.  Season with salt and pepper.

Thinly slice duck on diagonal.  Arrange on plates.  Spoon sauce over.  Sprinkle with 3/4 teaspoon thyme.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Combine oregano, thyme and parsley in small bowl.  Transfer half of chopped herbs to processor.  Add 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 tablespoon red wine, peppercorns, coriander, 3 minced garlic cloves, cayenne, salt and vinegar.  Blend until coarse paste forms.   Place chicken on large plate.  Rub all but 2 tablespoons paste mixture over chicken.  Cover and chill until ready to use.

Divide 1/4 cup olive oil between 2 large Dutch ovens or heavy large deep skillets over medium heat.  Divide chorizo, onions, tomatoes, ham, salt pork, remaining chopped herbs and remaining 5 minced garlic cloves between Dutch ovens.  Cook until onions are soft but not brown, crumbling sausage with fork and stirring frequently, about 15 minutes.  Transfer chorizo mixture to large bowl.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate remaining 2 tablespoons herb paste, chicken legs and chorizo mixture separately.)

Divide remaining 1/4 cup olive oil between Dutch ovens.  Add half of chicken and Italian sausages to each Dutch oven and cook until brown and partially cooked, turning frequently, about 8 minutes for sausages and 12 minutes for chicken.  Transfer to plate.  Return half of chorizo mixture to each Dutch oven.

Meanwhile, bring stock and clam juice to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Add saffron and mix well.

Add half of rice to each Dutch oven.  Cook over high heat until opaque, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.  Divide remaining herb paste and remaining 7 tablespoons wine between Dutch ovens.  Bring to simmer, scraping up any bits.  Stir half of stock mixture into each Dutch oven.

Divide shrimp, clams, mussels, fish and bay leaves between Dutch ovens.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer until rice is very tender, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes.  Discard any clams or mussels that do not open.

Meanwhile, prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Brush grill and lobster with vegetable oil.  Place lobsters on grill shell-side down.  Add chicken and grill until lobster and chicken are cooked through, turning occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Transfer to large plate.  Tent with foil to keep warm.

Add Italian sausage and bell peppers to grill and cook until sausage is cooked through and pepper are brown in spots, turning frequently, about 10 minutes.  Transfer sausages and peppers to another plate.   Cut sausages into 2-inch pieces.  Cut bell peppers into 1/2-inch-wide strips.

Divide chicken, lobster, sausage, peppers and peas between Dutch ovens.  Cover, remove from heat and let stand 15 minutes.  Rearrange shellfish and peppers decoratively atop rice.  Serve with lime and lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Spanish chorizo, a fresh, garlic-flavored pork link sausage that is milder than Mexican chorizo, is available at Spanish markets.  Linguica, a similar Portuguese sausage, is available at Spanish and Latin American markets.

Combine oregano, thyme and parsley in small bowl.  Transfer half of chopped herbs to processor.  Add 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 tablespoon red wine, peppercorns, coriander, 3 minced garlic cloves, cayenne, salt and vinegar.  Blend until coarse paste forms.   Place chicken on large plate.  Rub all but 2 tablespoons paste mixture over chicken.  Cover and chill until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide 1/4 cup olive oil between 2 large Dutch ovens or heavy large deep skillets over medium heat.  Divide chorizo, onions, tomatoes, ham, salt pork, remaining chopped herbs and remaining 5 minced garlic cloves between Dutch ovens.  Cook until onions are soft but not brown, crumbling sausage with fork and stirring frequently, about 15 minutes.  Transfer chorizo mixture to large bowl.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate remaining 2 tablespoons herb paste, chicken legs and chorizo mixture separately.)

<DirT>
Divide remaining 1/4 cup olive oil between Dutch ovens.  Add half of chicken and Italian sausages to each Dutch oven and cook until brown and partially cooked, turning frequently, about 8 minutes for sausages and 12 minutes for chicken.  Transfer to plate.  Return half of chorizo mixture to each Dutch oven.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, bring stock and clam juice to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Add saffron and mix well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add half of rice to each Dutch oven.  Cook over high heat until opaque, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.  Divide remaining herb paste and remaining 7 tablespoons wine between Dutch ovens.  Bring to simmer, scraping up any bits.  Stir half of stock mixture into each Dutch oven.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide shrimp, clams, mussels, fish and bay leaves between Dutch ovens.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer until rice is very tender, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes.  Discard any clams or mussels that do not open.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Brush grill and lobster with vegetable oil.  Place lobsters on grill shell-side down.  Add chicken and grill until lobster and chicken are cooked through, turning occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Transfer to large plate.  Tent with foil to keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add Italian sausage and bell peppers to grill and cook until sausage is cooked through and pepper are brown in spots, turning frequently, about 10 minutes.  Transfer sausages and peppers to another plate.   Cut sausages into 2-inch pieces.  Cut bell peppers into 1/2-inch-wide strips.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide chicken, lobster, sausage, peppers and peas between Dutch ovens.  Cover, remove from heat and let stand 15 minutes.  Rearrange shellfish and peppers decoratively atop rice.  Serve with lime and lemon wedges.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2                     skinless boneless chicken breast halves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     shallot -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  chopped seeded tomatoes
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  drained capers -- plus
  1           teaspoon  caper brine reserved
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil

Heat olive oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle chicken breast halves with salt and pepper.  Add chicken to skillet and cook until golden and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer to plate.

Add chopped shallot to same skillet; sautÈ 30 seconds.  Stir in tomatoes, white wine, capers, and caper brine.  Boil until tomatoes release juices, about 4 minutes.  Stir in chopped basil.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.

Return chicken to skillet.  Cook until warmed through, spooning sauce over chicken, about 1 minute.  Transfer chicken with sauce to 2 plates.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Peperoncini, breadsticks, and orzo mixed with sliced oil-cured olives would round out the main course beautifully.  End with raspberries and sweetened whipped cream.

  4                     boneless chicken breast halves -- skinned
                        Salt -- to taste
  1                cup  seasoned dry breadcrumbs
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano -- crumbled

  1                     basket strawberries - (1 pint) -- hulled, halved
  1                     basket raspberries - (1/2 pint)
  1                     basket strawberries with stems - (1 pint) -- halved through
                        stem end, stems left intact
                        === BERRY COMPOTE ===
  2                     baskets strawberries - (1 pint ea) -- hulled, sliced
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  framboise liqueur or Grand Marnier
  2                     baskets raspberries - (1/2 pint ea)

To make Heart Lid:  Cut heart-shaped piece of waxed paper about 4 inches larger than 8- by 2-inch bottomless heart-shaped cake pan.  Place on cookie sheet.  Lightly oil inside of heart pan with vegetable oil.  Butter outside of pan.  Place heart pan atop paper on cookie sheet.  Press waxed paper up onto outside of buttered pan to adhere, to prevent chocolate from leaking out.  Place white chocolate in bowl.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water; stir until smooth.  Remove from over water.  Place bittersweet chocolate in another bowl.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water; stir until smooth.  Remove from over water.

Drop white chocolate by spoonfuls inside heart, spacing apart and allowing some to touch inner edge of pan.  Drop bittersweet chocolate by spoonfuls into spaces.  Move heart pan gently from side to side to distribute chocolate evenly and fill in heart completely.  Swirl mixtures together using tip of knife.  Holding cake pan to cookie sheet with hands, tap sheet firmly on counter to flatten chocolate.  Freeze until firm, about 20 minutes.

Run small sharp knife around outside of pan to loosen chocolate.  Remove pan.  Refrigerate chocolate lid until ready to use.  (Can be prepared 1 week ahead.  Cover with plastic wrap.)

To make Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour 8- by 2-inch bottomless heart-shaped cake pan.  Cut heart-shaped piece of heavy-duty foil 4 inches larger than heart cake pan.  Butter and flour foil.  Place on heavy large cookie sheet or double-stacked cookie sheets.  Center heart pan on foil.  Wrap foil around outsides of pan, folding, pressing and crimping firmly to adhere, to prevent batter from leaking out.  Place white chocolate in bowl.  Set bowl over sauce-pan of simmering water; stir until smooth.  Remove from over water.

Using electric mixer, beat yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl until pale yellow and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted, about 3 minutes.  Beat in framboise and vanilla, then butter.  Add melted chocolate and beat until just combined.

Using electric mixer fitted with clean dry beaters, beat whites in large bowl to soft peaks.  Gradually add remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and beat until just stiff.  Mix flour into chocolate mixture (batter will be very thick).  Stir in 1/4 of whites to lighten.  Gradually fold in remaining whites.  Pour batter into prepared pan.  Bake 45 minutes.  Cover top with foil.  Bake until tip of small knife inserted into center of cake comes out clean, about 20 minutes (cake will be well browned).  Cool in pan on rack.

To make Icing:  Melt chocolate, butter and corn syrup in heavy medium saucepan over low heat, stirring until smooth.  Stir in framboise.  Cool icing until firm enough to spread, about 2 hours.

Run small sharp knife around cake pan sides to loosen.  Cut cake into 2 layers using serrated knife.  Place bottom cake layer on platter cut-side up.  Spread 2/3 cup icing over.  Cover with top cake layer cut-side down.  Spread all but 1/2 cup icing over top and sides of cake.  Refrigerate cake until icing is set, about 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate cake and remaining icing separately.  Rewarm icing over very low heat until just spreadable before continuing with recipe.)

To Assemble:  Mound some hulled strawberries and raspberries on right half of heart cake.  Position lid atop berries at angle, moving berries around so that left edge of lid rests on left edge of cake.  Tuck half of strawberries with stems, stems facing out, between cake and lid.  Spread remaining icing over sides of cake where lid is attached, smoothing with spatula to create boxlike appearance.  Reserve remaining strawberries and raspberries for garnish.  Refrigerate cake until icing is set, about 1 hour.  (Can be assembled 12 hours ahead.)

To make Berry Compote:  Toss two 1-pint baskets strawberries with sugar and framboise in large bowl.  Chill at least 1 hour or up to 6 hours.  Add raspberries and toss gently.  Arrange reserved berries on platter around cake.  Serve cake, spooning compote over each piece.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  A showstopper centerpiece cake for February fourteenth.  White chocolate provides a rich, buttery texture.  To serve, remove the chocolate lid and break it into pieces to nibble along with the cake.

To make Heart Lid:  Cut heart-shaped piece of waxed paper about 4 inches larger than 8- by 2-inch bottomless heart-shaped cake pan.  Place on cookie sheet.  Lightly oil inside of heart pan with vegetable oil.  Butter outside of pan.  Place heart pan atop paper on cookie sheet.  Press waxed paper up onto outside of buttered pan to adhere, to prevent chocolate from leaking out.  Place white chocolate in bowl.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water; stir until smooth.  Remove from over water.  Place bittersweet chocolate in another bowl.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water; stir until smooth.  Remove from over water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drop white chocolate by spoonfuls inside heart, spacing apart and allowing some to touch inner edge of pan.  Drop bittersweet chocolate by spoonfuls into spaces.  Move heart pan gently from side to side to distribute chocolate evenly and fill in heart completely.  Swirl mixtures together using tip of knife.  Holding cake pan to cookie sheet with hands, tap sheet firmly on counter to flatten chocolate.  Freeze until firm, about 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Run small sharp knife around outside of pan to loosen chocolate.  Remove pan.  Refrigerate chocolate lid until ready to use.  (Can be prepared 1 week ahead.  Cover with plastic wrap.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour 8- by 2-inch bottomless heart-shaped cake pan.  Cut heart-shaped piece of heavy-duty foil 4 inches larger than heart cake pan.  Butter and flour foil.  Place on heavy large cookie sheet or double-stacked cookie sheets.  Center heart pan on foil.  Wrap foil around outsides of pan, folding, pressing and crimping firmly to adhere, to prevent batter from leaking out.  Place white chocolate in bowl.  Set bowl over sauce-pan of simmering water; stir until smooth.  Remove from over water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using electric mixer, beat yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl until pale yellow and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted, about 3 minutes.  Beat in framboise and vanilla, then butter.  Add melted chocolate and beat until just combined.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using electric mixer fitted with clean dry beaters, beat whites in large bowl to soft peaks.  Gradually add remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and beat until just stiff.  Mix flour into chocolate mixture (batter will be very thick).  Stir in 1/4 of whites to lighten.  Gradually fold in remaining whites.  Pour batter into prepared pan.  Bake 45 minutes.  Cover top with foil.  Bake until tip of small knife inserted into center of cake comes out clean, about 20 minutes (cake will be well browned).  Cool in pan on rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make Icing:  Melt chocolate, butter and corn syrup in heavy medium saucepan over low heat, stirring until smooth.  Stir in framboise.  Cool icing until firm enough to spread, about 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Run small sharp knife around cake pan sides to loosen.  Cut cake into 2 layers using serrated knife.  Place bottom cake layer on platter cut-side up.  Spread 2/3 cup icing over.  Cover with top cake layer cut-side down.  Spread all but 1/2 cup icing over top and sides of cake.  Refrigerate cake until icing is set, about 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate cake and remaining icing separately.  Rewarm icing over very low heat until just spreadable before continuing with recipe.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
To Assemble:  Mound some hulled strawberries and raspberries on right half of heart cake.  Position lid atop berries at angle, moving berries around so that left edge of lid rests on left edge of cake.  Tuck half of strawberries with stems, stems facing out, between cake and lid.

Refrigerate cake until icing is set, about 1 hour.  (Can be assembled 12 hours ahead.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CREPES ===
  1                cup  water -- (to 1 1/4)
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2                     eggs
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        Vegetable oil, as needed
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  ricotta cheese
  1                cup  grated mozzarella
     1/2           cup  grated Romano
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  prepared spaghetti sauce

For Crepes:  Whisk 1 cup water, flour, eggs and salt in medium bowl until well blended (batter should be thin).  Add additional water if necessary.

Heat heavy small skillet over low heat.  Brush pan lightly with oil.  Stir batter and ladle 3 to 4 tablespoons into corner of pan, tilting so batter just coats bottom.  Cook crepe until bottom is set (do not brown), about 1 minute.  Loosen edges with knife.  Turn crepe and cook until second side is set (do not brown), about 5 minutes.

Repeat with remaining batter, stirring  occasionally and brushing pan with oil as necessary.  (Can be prepared ahead.  Layer crepes between sheets of waxed paper and cool completely.  Wrap tightly and refrigerate 3 days or freeze 1 month.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

For Filling:  Mix ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella, Romano, egg and parsley in bowl.  Season mixture to taste with salt and pepper.

Pour 3/4 cup spaghetti sauce into large baking pan.  Spoon 3 tablespoons filling down center of crepe.  Fold both sides of crepe over filling.  Arrange seam-side down in baking pan.

Repeat with remaining filling and enough crepes to finish.  Pour remaining 3/4 cup sauce over.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake until heated through, about 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        === SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2 1/2         pounds  leeks, white and pale green parts only -- halved lengthwise,
                        and sliced into 1/2" pieces - (abt 6 cups)

                        reduced to 1/2 cup
                        === VEAL ===
  8                     veal loin chops, 1" thk - (abt 8 oz ea) -- fat and sinew
                        trimmed
                        Dried thyme -- crumbled
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  brandy
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut 6 pieces,
                        at room temperature
     1/2           cup  crumbled Roquefort cheese - (1 1/2 oz)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

For Sauce:  Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add leeks, sugar and thyme.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cook until liquid evaporates and leeks begin to soften, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes; do not brown.

Transfer all but 1 cup leek mixture to bowl and reserve for garnish.  Stir remaining leeks, reduce heat to low and cover.  Cook until leeks are very soft and lightly caramelized, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.

Puree caramelized leeks and stock in blender until smooth.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover reserved leeks and sauce separately and refrigerate.)

For Veal: Preheat broiler.  Season veal with thyme and pepper.  Melt 3 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add veal and cook until just pink inside, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer to plate and cover to keep warm.

Add brandy to skillet and cook until liquid is almost evaporated, scraping up any browned bits.  Add cream and leek sauce and bring to simmer.  Whisk in 6 tablespoons butter 1 piece at a time.  Add cheese and any accumulated meat juices and whisk until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.

Divide sauce among broiler-proof plates.  Top with veal and sprinkle reserved leeks over.  Broil until leeks are heated through, about 1 minute.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  In this elegant entrÈe, the leeks mellow to lend a bit of sweetness to the sauce.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TERRINE ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  18            ounces  imported white chocolate -- finely chopped
                        = (such as Tobler or Lindt)
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut small pieces,
                        at roomtemperature
  2        tablespoons  framboise eau-de-vie
                        = (clear raspberry brandy)
  1               pint  raspberries - (2 baskets)
                        === SAUCE ===
  1            package  frozen raspberries in syrup - (10 oz)
  1                     ripe pear - (abt 7 oz) -- halved, cored,
                        and cut into eighths
                        Mint leaves -- for garnish
  2        tablespoons  framboise eau-de-vie

For Terrine:  Coat 7 1/2- by 3 3/4- by 2-inch (3 cup) loaf pan with nonstick vegetable oil spray.  Line with 3- by 12-inch strip of waxed paper, pressing gently to fit and overlapping ends of pan.

Warm 1/3 of chocolate with cream in heavy small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly with rubber spatula until melted and smooth.  Add remaining chocolate in 2 batches, allowing second batch to melt completely before adding last third.  Remove from heat occasionally to avoid overheating chocolate.  Add 3 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon framboise.  Stir until butter is just melted.  Repeat with remaining butter and framboise.  Remove from heat; let stand in warm area while assembling terrine layers.

Pour 2/3 cup chocolate mixture into prepared pan and freeze until set but not hard, about 15 minutes.  Choose medium-size berries and arrange upside down in 9 crosswise rows of 3 berries each, spacing evenly and leaving border around edge of pan.  Press gently into chocolate.  Gently pour 1 cup chocolate mixture over berries in even layer.  Freeze until set but not hard, about 20 minutes.

Repeat layering with more berries to form second layer.  Press gently into chocolate.  Gently pour remaining chocolate mixture over.  Smooth to form even layer.  Refrigerate until firm.  Cover and chill overnight.  Reserve remaining berries for garnish.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.)

For Sauce: Combine raspberries with syrup and pear in heavy small saucepan.  Stir to coat pear with syrup.  Bring to simmer.  Simmer until pear softens, about 10 minutes.  Puree in blender until smooth.  Strain puree through fine sieve.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover tightly and refrigerate.)

Run small sharp warm knife around top edge of terrine.  If necessary dip bottom of terrine into warm water about 5 seconds.  Using waxed paper as aid, gently unmold onto small cutting board.  Peel off waxed paper.  Use spatula to smooth surface if necessary.

Heat long thin knife under warm water.  Dry knife and slice terrine into 1/8-inch-thick slices, cleaning and warming knife as necessary.  Place 2 to 3 slices in center of each plate.  Garnish one side of plate with reserved fresh berries and mint leaves.  (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Just before serving, mix framboise into sauce.  Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons sauce opposite berries.  Let stand at room temperature 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The trick to this gorgeous dessert is to use imported white chocolate and to melt it carefully, since white chocolate is extremely heat sensitive.  Let the terrine mixture get only warm enough to melt the white chocolate and butter.

     7/8         ounce  dried porcini mushrooms - (to 1 oz)
                        = (available at Italian markets and
                        specialty foods stores)
  1 1/2           cups  hot water
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2               cups  orzo
  3 1/2           cups  canned low-salt chicken broth - (to 4)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- (abt 1 1/4 oz)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Minced fresh parsley

Rinse mushrooms briefly with cold water.  Place in small bowl.  Add 1 1/2 cups hot water and let soak until softened, about 30 minutes.  Drain mushrooms, reserving soaking liquid.  Squeeze mushrooms and chop.

Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and saute until tender, about 8 minutes.  Add orzo and stir until coated with oil.  Mix in chopped mushrooms.

Meanwhile combine 4 cups broth other medium saucepan.  Bring to simmer.  Reduce heat to low and keep hot.

Add 1 cup liquid to orzo, adjust heat so liquid simmers slowly and cook until orzo absorbs liquid, stirring occasionally.  Continue adding liquid 1 cup at a time, simmering until each addition is absorbed before adding next and stirring occasionally until orzo is just tender and liquid is creamy, about 30 minutes.

Stir in Parmesan.  Season with salt and pepper.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Orzo-rice shaped pasta-is easier to find than Arborio rice (the traditional ingredient in risotto) and makes a delicious risotto-style side dish.
