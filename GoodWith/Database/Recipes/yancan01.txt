Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ALMOND PASTE ===
     1/4           cup  long-grain rice
  6             ounces  blanched almonds
  1                     orange -- thinly sliced
  1 1/2           cups  water
                        === COOKING ===
  6               cups  water
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  evaporated milk or half-and-half
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract

Soak rice in enough water to cover for at least 2 hours or overnight; drain.  In a food processor of blender, whirl rice, almonds, and 1 1/2 cups water into a smooth paste.  Transfer paste to a large pot.

Add 6 cups water and sugar to almond paste.  Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved.  Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.  Set a fine strainer lined with a double layer of damp cheesecloth over a deep bowl.  Pour soup through strainer into bowl, then gather cheesecloth and squeeze firmly to extract all remaining liquid.

Return liquid to pot; stir in evaporated milk and heat just to simmering.  Stir in almond extract.  Serve hot in individual soup bowls.  Or, cover and refrigerate until well chilled and serve cold.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

To serve, place a small portion of beef mixture, lettuce, salsa, and sour cream mixture on a warm tortilla, wrap up, and eat out of hand.

This recipe yields 12 fajitas.

                   Chicken And Seafood Trio In A Basket

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" lengths
     1/2         pound  mixed seafood
                        = (choose from firm white fish fillets,
                        scallops, and shrimp)
     1/4         pound  boneless skinless chicken breast
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1                     egg white
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  1                     green onion -- finely chopped
     3/4           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  oyster-flavored sauce
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2          teaspoons  water
                        === EDIBLE BASKET ===
  1             medium  potato or tarro root
                        = (or cooked fresh egg noodles)
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
                        Oil -- for frying

Bring a large pan of water to boil.  Add asparagus.  Cook until tender-crisp, about 2 minutes.  Drain.

Cut seafood into 1/2-inch cubes.  Cut chicken into 1/2-inch cubes.  Coat seafood and chicken with cornstarch, egg white, salt, and pepper.

Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add seafood, chicken, and green onion; stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add broth, oyster-flavored sauce, and fish sauce; bring to a boil.  Add cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens.  Add asparagus and toss to mix.  Spoon seafood mixture into basket.

To make an edible basket, you need two 6-inch metal strainers.  In a wok, heat cooking oil for deep-frying to 350 degrees.  Peel and shred or finely julienne 1 medium potato (taro root or cooked fresh egg noodles can also be used).  Rinse shredded potato under cold running water; squeeze well to remove as much moisture as possible and pat dry with paper towels.  Toss potato with 1 teaspoon cornstarch.  Dip strainers into hot oil to coat them.  Line one strainer with potato to a thickness of about 3/8-inch.  Nest second strainer on top, and immerse strainers in oil.  Deep-fry until golden brown.  Remove potato basket and drain on paper towels.  Use immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This delicate stir-fry will be a hit if you serve it in a deep-fried edible basket.  All you need are a couple of perfectly ripe mangoes, and you're up and running with this quick, exotic dish.  To make it into a complete meal, just add some plain steamed broccoli and rice.  Wonderful though they are to eat, mangoes can be difficult to cut up without their turning to mush.  The good news here is that in this dish, it doesn't matter, because the mangoes get mashed anyway.  So just cut them open and scrape out the flesh, and mince as best you can.

  3                     dried black mushrooms
  3                     eggs
     1/4           cup  cooked crabmeat -- flaked

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  hoisin sauce
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sherry
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FILLING ===
  1         tablespoon  canola oil - (to 2)
  6                     dried shiitake mushrooms -- soaked until soft,
                        and chopped
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
  1              large  carrot -- chopped
  1                     zucchini or crookneck squash -- chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped bamboo shoots
     1/2           cup  chopped water chestnuts
  2                     green onions -- chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped peanuts
  1              large  iceberg lettuce head

Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.

Filling:  Heat oil in work or large deep skillet.  Add mushrooms and ginger; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add celery, carrot and squash; stir-fry 1 minute.  Add bamboo shoots and water chestnuts; stir-fry 1 minute more.  Add green onions, peanuts and sauce; cook until sauce boils and thickens a bit, about 1 minute.

To serve, place several heaping tablespoons filling inside lettuce leaves; roll and eat with your hands.

This recipe yields 12 to 15 rolls.

Comments:  These lettuce rolls are much like cabbage rolls, but the lettuce stays cold and crisp against the stir-fried filling.

                          Firecracker Bean Curd

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  vegetable broth
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
                        = (or 2 tbspns regular soy sauce plus 1
                        tbspn dark soy sauce)
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  2        tablespoons  chopped water chestnuts
                        = (or Szechuan preserved vegetables)
  8              whole  dried red chili peppers (Thai peppers)
  1 1/2       teaspoon  chili sauce
  1              pound  medium tofu -- pressed, and
                        cut into 1/4" cubes
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2          teaspoons  water
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  2                     green onions -- chopped

Combine broth and soy sauce in a small bowl; set aside.

Heat oil in work or large deep skillet over high heat.  Add garlic, ginger, water chestnuts or Szechuan vegetables, and chili peppers; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Add chili sauce; cook 10 seconds.  Add vegetable broth mixture and tofu; simmer 2 minutes.  Add cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens, about 30 seconds.  Sprinkle with sesame oil and garnish with green onions.  Serve over rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This dish is as hot as a firecracker.

Helpful Hint:  Pressing tofu removes much of the water, making a firmer texture that absorbs sauces more readily.  Wrap tofu cake in paper or cotton kitchen towels and place in colander in sink or over large bowl.  Place a couple of cans of vegetables or similar weights on top and let sit at least 15 minutes.

Comments:  This dish is as hot as a firecracker.

Helpful Hint:  Pressing tofu removes much of the water, making a firmer texture that absorbs sauces more readily.  Wrap tofu cake in paper or cotton kitchen towels and place in colander in sink or over large bowl.  Place a couple of cans of vegetables or similar weights on top and let sit at least 15 minutes.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === POTATOES AND BROCCOLI ===
  1 1/2         pounds  russet potatoes - (abt 4 potatoes)
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cut in small pieces
  1                cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  ginger powder
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  five-spice powder
     1/2         pound  broccoli florets -- steamed, with a
                        sprinkling of salt

Combine dry rub and stuffing ingredients in separate bowls.  Rub pork with dry rub mixture to coat evenly.  Arrange stuffing along the length of the loin.  Roll up and tie with butcher's twine.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Roast the tenderloin until cooked but slightly pink, about 30 minutes, turning once midway.  Remove from oven, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes before carving into 1/2-inch thick slices.

In a small saucepan, place figs in red wine and bring to a simmer for 5 minutes.  Set aside and let steep for 20 minutes longer.  Remove figs and set aside.  Add shallots to the wine and bring to a boil.  Reduce slightly.  Add chicken broth and prunes; bring to a second boil and reduce by half.  Reduce heat and slowly add butter; season with salt and pepper.

Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch pieces.  Boil in salted water until tender but not mushy, about 25 minutes.  Drain well and mash with a potato masher.  Add butter; stir in milk, a little at a time.  Season with remaining ingredients.

To serve, place mashed potatoes slightly off-center of plate.  Place 3 slices of pork overlapping one another on lower end of plate and place alongside steamed broccoli florets. Spoon some sauce over pork and garnish with figs.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === WRAPPERS ===
  2              large  eggs
  1 1/4           cups  water
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  cooking oil -- for frying wrappers
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  julienned onion
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1                     boneless skinless chicken breast half -- thinly sliced
     1/4         pound  medium raw shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and halved
  1 1/2           cups  finely-julienned jicama
     1/2         small  carrot -- finely julienned
  2                     green onions -- finely julienned
  2          teaspoons  oyster-flavored sauce
  1           teaspoon  Filipino fish sauce (patis)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR SERVING ===
  5                     tender lettuce leaves

Prepare wrappers:  In a bowl, whisk together eggs, water, cornstarch, flour, and salt until smooth.  Strain batter.

Place a nonstick 8-inch omelet pan over medium heat until hot; brush with 1/4 teaspoon oil.  Pour 1/4 cup batter into pan; tilt pan so batter covers entire surface.  Cook until edge of wrapper is lightly browned and surface looks dry, about 45 seconds.  Loosen edge with a spatula, turn wrapper, and cook 10 seconds longer.  Turn wrapper out of pan onto a plate.  Repeat to use all batter.

Prepare filling:  Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add onion and garlic.  Stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Add chicken and shrimp; stir-fry for 2 minutes.  Remove from pan.  Heat 1 tablespoon oil.  Add jicama and carrot; stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add green onions; cook until vegetables are tender crisp, about 2 minutes.  Return chicken mixture to pan; add oyster-flavored sauce, fish sauce, and pepper; cook for 1 minute.  Cool.

Cut lettuce in half lengthwise.  For each lumpia, place a piece of lettuce on wrapper.  Spoon about 1/3 cup filling into center of wrapper.  Fold bottom third of wrapper over filling, then fold in sides.

Serve with garlic dipping sauce or a mixture of hoisin sauce and soy sauce.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  If you don't have the time to make pancake wrappers for fresh lumpia, you can also use Vietnamese rice paper wrappers, which are sold in many Asian grocery stores.  Look for round wrappers about 8 inches across.  They're paper-thin, translucent, and brittle, with a delicate lattice pattern from the woven drying racks on which they're made.  To soften them, dip them briefly in a bowl of warm water, shaking off the excess before you put the wrapper on your plate.  In a few seconds, the wrapper will be soft enough to roll around the lettuce and the filling.

Lumpia are among the most famous of all Filipino dishes.  These are not the fried, eggroll-like lumpia you may have tried, but a lighter, home-style version, in which delicate egg pancakes are rolled around lettuce and a tasty chicken, shrimp, and vegetable filling.  If you have adventurous guests, let everybody make their own lumpia right at the table -- it's a great way to get a dinner party rolling!

Prepare wrappers:  In a bowl, whisk together eggs, water, cornstarch, flour, and salt until smooth.  Strain batter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a nonstick 8-inch omelet pan over medium heat until hot; brush with 1/4 teaspoon oil.  Pour 1/4 cup batter into pan; tilt pan so batter covers entire surface.  Cook until edge of wrapper is lightly browned and surface looks dry, about 45 seconds.  Loosen edge with a spatula, turn wrapper, and cook 10 seconds longer.  Turn wrapper out of pan onto a plate.  Repeat to use all batter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare filling:  Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add onion and garlic.  Stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Add chicken and shrimp; stir-fry for 2 minutes.  Remove from pan.  Heat 1 tablespoon oil.  Add jicama and carrot; stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add green onions; cook until vegetables are tender crisp, about 2 minutes.  Return chicken mixture to pan; add oyster-flavored sauce, fish sauce, and pepper; cook for 1 minute.  Cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut lettuce in half lengthwise.  For each lumpia, place a piece of lettuce on wrapper.  Spoon about 1/3 cup filling into center of wrapper.  Fold bottom third of wrapper over filling, then fold in sides.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve with garlic dipping sauce or a mixture of hoisin sauce and soy sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  If you don&apos;t have the time to make pancake wrappers for fresh lumpia, you can also use Vietnamese rice paper wrappers, which are sold in many Asian grocery stores.  Look for round wrappers about 8 inches across.  They&apos;re paper-thin, translucent, and brittle, with a delicate lattice pattern from the woven drying racks on which they&apos;re made.  To soften them, dip them briefly in a bowl of warm water, shaking off the excess before you put the wrapper on your plate.  In a few seconds, the wrapper will be soft enough to roll around the lettuce and the filling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lumpia are among the most famous of all Filipino dishes.  These are not the fried, eggroll-like lumpia you may have tried, but a lighter, home-style version, in which delicate egg pancakes are rolled around lettuce and a tasty chicken, shrimp, and vegetable filling.  If you have adventurous guests, let everybody make their own lumpia right at the table -- it&apos;s a great way to get a dinner party rolling!

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken thighs -- cut 1" pieces
                        === MARINADE ===
  3        tablespoons  Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
  1 1/2    tablespoons  oyster-flavored sauce
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
                        === COOKING ===
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
  6              small  dried red chiles
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  2                     green onions -- cut 1" lengths
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed dried red chiles
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/4           cup  roasted peanuts -- coarsely chopped

Combine marinade ingredients in a bowl.  Place chicken in marinade and turn to coat.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

Combine sauce ingredients in a bowl.

Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add chiles and stir-fry for 10 seconds.  Add chicken and stir-fry for 2 minutes.  Add garlic, ginger, green onions, and crushed chilies; stir-fry for 1 minute.

Add sauce and cook, stirring for 1 minute.  Add cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens.

Place chicken on a serving plate and sprinkle with peanuts.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A dish fit for a general is certainly good enough for me.  The usual way to make this dish is to deep-fry the chicken.  Personally, I prefer stir-frying for a lighter fare.  With the rich and flavorful sauce, it's sure to be your favorite chicken as well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     dried black mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  finely-diced zucchini
  2        tablespoons  finely-diced carrot
  14               cup  finely-chopped cooked shrimp
  1                     green onion, including top -- minced
  1                cup  cooked medium-grain rice -- see * Note
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  14          teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  28             large  fresh mushrooms (2" dia) -- stems removed
  13               cup  chicken broth
                        === SAUCE ===
  14               cup  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  Shao Hsing wine or dry sherry
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  2        tablespoons  water

* Note:  Do not substitute long-grain rice in this recipe.  It lacks the sticky quality which is necessary to bind the filling together.

Soak black mushrooms in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut off and discard stems and finely chop caps.  Set aside.

Combine sauce ingredients in a small saucepan and set aside.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 5 seconds.  Add black mushrooms, zucchini and carrot; stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add shrimp, green onion and rice; mix well.  Stir in eggs, salt and pepper; turn off heat and mix well.

Mound about 2 rounded teaspoons of filling into each mushroom cap and press firmly.  Place mushrooms filling-side up in a shallow-rimmed baking pan.  If assembled ahead, cover and refrigerate for up to 8 hours.  Just before baking, pour broth around mushrooms.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake, uncovered, in preheated oven for 15 minutes.

With a slotted spatula, transfer mushrooms to a serving platter; cover loosely to keep warm.  Pour drippings into sauce.  Stirring constantly, cook over medium-high heat until sauce boils and thickens slightly.

This recipe yields 28 appetizers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     dried black mushrooms
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  oyster-flavoured sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
     1/8      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FILLING ===
  1         tablespoon  cooking oil
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1              small  carrot -- julienned
  3        tablespoons  julienned Szechuan preserved vegetable
     1/4         pound  bean sprouts
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2          teaspoons  water
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  8              large  napa cabbage leaves

Soak mushrooms in warm water to cover until softened, about 20 minutes; drain.  Discard stems and thinly slice caps.  Combine sauce ingredients in a bowl.

Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add garlic; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add mushrooms, carrot, and preserved vegetable.  Stir-fry for 2 minutes, adding a few drops water if wok appears dry.  Add bean sprouts; stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add sauce and bring to a boil.  Add cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens.  Remove from heat and stir in cilantro.  Let filling cool.

In a large pot of simmering water, parboil cabbage leaves just until limp, 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain, rinse with cold water and drain again.  Pat leaves dry with paper towels.

Trim leaves to make rectangles about 4 by 8 inches; discard heavy stem ends.  If necessary, use a knife to shave any remaining thick white ribs to make leaves easier to roll.  Make each roll.  Place a leaf on work surface with stem end facing you.  Spread 3 tablespoons filling in a band across bottom of leaf.  Roll leaf tightly to enclose filling.  If making ahead, cover and chill until ready to serve.

To serve, trim ends of each roll; cut rolls in half.  Stand rolls on a serving plate so filling shows.

This recipe yields 16 rolls.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/3           cups  flour
  1 1/4           cups  boiling water
     1/4           cup  solid vegetable shortening
                        = (or cooking oil)
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1                cup  chopped green onions
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Cooking oil -- as needed
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  chopped green onion
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  chili sauce

Place flour in a bowl.  Add boiling water, stirring with chopsticks or a fork until dough is evenly moistened.  On a lightly floured board, knead dough until smooth and satiny, about 5 minutes.  Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.

Combine dipping sauce ingredients in a bowl.

On a lightly floured board, roll dough into a cylinder; cut into 12 equal portions.  Roll a portion of dough into an 8-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick; keep remaining dough covered to prevent drying.  Brush with a thin film of shortening.  Sprinkle with a small portion of sesame oil, green onions, salt, and pepper.  Roll dough into a cylinder and coil dough into a round patty; tuck end of dough underneath.  Roll again to make an 8-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick.

Place a wide frying pan over medium heat until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons cooking oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add 1 cake and cook, turning once, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes on each side.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with remaining cakes, adding more cooking oil as needed.  Cut cakes into wedges.  Serve hot with dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  These unleavened fried breads are thin and flat, crisp outside, moist and chewy inside, and bursting with onion flavor.  I like to serve them the traditional way, as street vendors in Beijing do: sliced into wedges and eaten out of hand, plain or with a spicy chili-garlic dipping sauce.

                        === DRESSING ===
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  chili garlic sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === SALAD ===
  4               cups  mixed salad greens
     1/2         small  red onion -- thinly sliced
  1              small  carrot -- halved lengthwise,
                        and thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  cilantro leaves
                        Fresh basil sprigs -- for garnish

Combine marinade ingredients in a shallow pan.  Add meat and turn to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for a least 30 minutes.

Combine dressing ingredients in a small bowl; whisk until blended.

Place salad greens, onion, carrot, and cilantro in a wide, shallow serving bowl.

Lift meat from marinade; drain briefly.  Place meat on an oiled grill 3 to 4 inches above a solid bed of hot glowing coals.  Cook until meat is browned on the outside but still pink within, 4 to 5 minutes on each side.

Cut meat across the grain into thin, slanting slices.  Arrange warm meat over the salad.  Pour dressing over the salad and toss.  Garnish with basil prigs.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  I came across this dish in Thailand, and Iíve added a touch of white pepper and oyster-flavored sauce for my personal taste.  This salad is fun to prepare outdoors during barbecue season.  And for true beef lovers who appreciate a good salad, this dish can be a complete meal.

Whatís the best kind of beef for this salad?  Flank, sirloin, it doesnít matter.  Itís all in how you cook it.

                    Grilled Vegetables With Miso Glaze

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  Japanese soup stock (dashi)
  3        tablespoons  sweet cooking rice wine (mirin)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  fermented soybean paste (red miso)
  1         tablespoon  cooking oil
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2                     Asian eggplants - (abt 5" long ea)
  2                     zucchini - (abt 5" long ea)
  1             medium  onion
  8                     fresh shiitake mushrooms
  1           teaspoon  white sesame seeds

In a small pan, heat dashi, mirin, sugar, and soy sauce over medium heat just until sugar dissolves.  Remove from heat and whisk in miso until sauce is smoothly blended.

Combine cooking oil and sesame oil a small bowl.

Cut eggplants and zucchini diagonally to make ovals about 1/4-inch thick and 3 inches long.  Cut onion in half length-wise, then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  With a wooden pick, skewer each slice to keep rings together.  Discard mushroom stems.

Place sesame seeds in a small frying pan over medium beat; cook, shaking pan frequently, until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.  Immediately remove from pan to cool.

Heat a Japanese iron griddle (teppan) or wide frying pan over medium heat.  Brush hot griddle with some of the oil.  Place vegetables on griddle and brush with oil.  Cook, turning once and brushing again with oil, until vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes on each side.

Reduce heat to low.  Brush half of miso glaze on vegetables and cook for 30 seconds.  Turn vegetables.  Brush with remaining glaze, and cook 30 seconds longer.  Place on a serving plate and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:   You don't have to be serving a Japanese meal to enjoy these tasty grilled vegetables: slices of eggplant, zucchini, onion, and shiitake mushrooms, cooked on a griddle and finished with a miso glaze.

Miso-fermented soybean paste-is one of the most important staples in Japanese cooking, used in everything from soups to sauces and glazes.  It's rich in protein and makes a great "secret" flavor enhancer for all kinds of cooking.  Miso is made by mixing crushed boiled soybeans with rice, barley, or wheat; inoculating this mash with a yeast culture; and allowing the whole thing to ferment for several months.  White miso (miso shiru), made with rice, has a sweet, delicate flavor, while red miso (aka miso), made with barley, is saltier and more robust.  Both are sold in plastic tubs in many supermarkets and most natural food stores.  In our house, there's always some miso in the fridge, so we can make a quick, nutritious soup by combining it with dashi, tofu, and whatever vegetables are on hand.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16                    wonton wrappers
                        === FILLING ===
  6             ounces  ground chicken or lean ground pork
  2          teaspoons  cooking oil
  3        tablespoons  chicken broth
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  oyster-flavored sauce
  2          teaspoons  finely-julienned ginger
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced carrot
  8                     snow peas -- thinly sliced
  1                     jalapeÒo or serrano chile -- thinly sliced
                        === CHILI BROTH ===
  3               cups  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  black vinegar

  1           teaspoon  chili sauce

Combine filling ingredients in a bowl, mix well.  Let stand for 30 minutes.  Combine broth ingredients in a bowl.

To fill each dumpling, place a heaping teaspoon of filling in center of a wonton wrapper; keep remaining wrappers covered to prevent drying.  Brush edge of wrapper with water and fold in half to form a triangle; press edges to seal.

As you work, place dumplings on a baking sheet and cover with a dry towel.  Heat a large pot of water to boiling, add dumplings, and cook until they float, 2 to 3 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add oil, garlic, and ginger; stir-fry until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add carrot, snow peas, and chile; stir-fry until carrot is crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add chili broth ingredients and bring to a boil.  Drain dumplings and place in soup bowls.  Ladle chili broth over dumplings.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

     1/2         pound  medium raw shrimp
     1/4         pound  firm white fish fillet
                        = (such as red snapper)
  1                     lemongrass stalk
  1         tablespoon  cooking oil
  6               cups  chicken broth
  2             slices  ginger - (quarter-size) -- lightly crushed
  1                     small whole dried red chili
     1/2           cup  canned straw mushrooms -- drained
  3        tablespoons  lime juice or lemon juice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fish sauce
  1                     green onion -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  1         tablespoon  shredded fresh mint leaves
  1         tablespoon  shredded fresh basil leaves

Shell and de-vein shrimp; reserve shells.  Cut shrimp in half horizontally.  Cut fish into 1/2-inch cubes.

Lightly crush bottom 6 inches of lemongrass; discard remainder.

Prepare spicy broth:  Place a large pot over high heat until hot.  Add oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add shrimp shells; cook until they turn pink, about 30 seconds.  Add broth, lemongrass, ginger, and chili; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.  Strain broth and discard seasonings.

Return broth to pot and heat to simmering.  Add shrimp, fish, and straw mushrooms; simmer until shrimp turn pink, about 2 minutes.  Stir in lime juice, fish sauce, and green onion.

Combine cilantro, mint, and basil.  Ladle soup into bowls and sprinkle with fresh herbs.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Mention seafood chowder, and most people would bring up images of rustic New England.  I, on the other hand, think of exotic Southeast Asia and this exciting seafood chowder.

                     New Year Fish Salad - {Yu Sheng}

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Salads/Dressings
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALAD MIXTURE ===
     1/2                cantaloupe
                        = (or 1/4 honeydew melon)
  1                     grapefruit
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced sweet pickled ginger
  1             medium  carrot -- shredded
     1/4         pound  jicama - (a 3" wedge) -- shredded
                        === DRESSING ===
  3        tablespoons  cooking oil - (to 4)
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  3        tablespoons  plum sauce
                        === FISH ===
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds
  6             ounces  salmon fillet
  6             ounces  firm white fish fillet, such as sea bass
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  cooking oil
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4           cup  chopped roasted peanuts
  1                     green onion -- slivered

Peel melon and cut into crescents.  Segment grapefruit by cutting away the peel and white pith; cut and lift out segments.  In a bowl, combine melon, grapefruit. ginger, carrot, and jicama.

Combine dressing ingredients in a small bowl.

Place sesame seed in a small frying pan over medium heat; cook, shaking pan continuously, until tightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.  Immediately remove from pan to cool.

Remove skin and any bones from fish.  Thinly slice fish across the grain to make pieces about 1 by 2 inches.  Fan slices on a serving platter, alternating pink and white fish.  In a small bowl, combine lime juice, oil, and white pepper.

Drizzle lime juice mixture over fish.  Mound salad mixture in center of fish.  Spoon dressing over the salad.  Garnish with peanuts, sesame seed, and green onion.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  No Chinese New Year feast is complete without yu sheng, the colorful salad of raw fish and crunchy vegetables.  It's served in most Singaporean Chinese restaurants throughout the lunar new year celebration.  In recent years, the ingredients have become increasingly elaborate and exotic, including jellyfish, preserved papaya, deep-fried yam sticks, pickled shallots, and more.  You practically have to start making it a whole lunar year ahead of time!  My version is light and flavorful and a lot easier to prepare.  Use very fresh fish.  As an alternative to salmon, tuna is also delicious prepared this way.

Besides being full of flavors and textures, yu sheng is loaded with symbolic meaning.  The raw ingredients signify the renewal of life, and the sound of the word for fish in Cantonese sounds like the word for prosperity.  The most important (and fun) part of eating yu sheng is the mixing together of the ingredients.  To ensure good luck for the coming year, everyone calls out "Lo hei!" -- which means "to mix it up" but also sounds like "to prosper more and more" -- while they use their chopsticks to toss the ingredients as high in the air as they can.  Now that's what I call a well-tossed salad!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter -- for frying pancakes
                        === PANCAKES ===
  1              large  egg
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/4           cup  milk
  1                cup  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3              drops  green food color - (to 4)
                        === FILLING ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2               cups  sweetened shredded coconut
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped walnuts
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  unsweetened coconut milk
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/4           cup  chopped walnuts -- (optional)

In a bowl, blend egg, water, and milk with a wire whisk.  Add flour and salt; mix until smooth.  Add color to tint batter pale green.  Pour batter through a strainer into a bowl.

To make filling:  Melt butter in a wide frying pan over medium heat.  Add coconut and cook, stirring, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add water, brown sugar, vanilla, and nuts.  Continue to cook until water has evaporated and mixture is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a nonstick 8-inch frying pan over medium heat.  Brush with about 1/4 teaspoon butter.  Add 1/4 cup batter to pan; tilt pan in all directions so batter covers entire surface.  Cook until pancake is set and bottom is lightly brown, about 2 minutes; turn over and cook until lightly browned, about 1 minute longer.  Remove from pan; repeat to make remaining pancakes.

To prepare sauce:  In a small pan, combine coconut milk, water, and sugar.  Cook, stirring, over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Add cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until sauce bubbles and thickens slightly.  Remove sauce from heat.

To assemble, place about 1/4 cup filling in center of each pancake.  Roll to enclose filling; place on a serving plate.  Drizzle sauce over pancakes; garnish with chopped nuts, if used.

This recipe yields 8 pancakes.

Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  chicken brests -- split, skinned,
                        and boned
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground black peper
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry
                        === LEMON SAUCE ===
  2             slices  canned pineapple -- cut into quarters
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  water
  3         tablespoon  brown sugar - (packed)
  2         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  1 1/4       teaspoon  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
  1                cup  bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  sesame seeds
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten

Pound each chicken breast half to flatten.  Place chicken in a bowl and add salt, pepper, and sherry; stir to coat.  Set aside for 30 minutes.

To make lemon sauce, whirl pineapple slices in a blender until smooth.  Then combine with remaining sauce ingredients in a small saucepan; set aside.

In a shallow bowl, combine bread crumbs and sesame seeds.  Dip chicken into egg, then roll in bread crumbs, shaking off excess.  Set aside for 5 minutes.

Set wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of 2 inches.  Place over medium-high heat until oil reaches 350 to 360 degrees.  Add chicken, 2 pieces at a time, and deep fry for 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown and meat is no longer pink when slashed, turning occasionally.  Lift out and drain on paper towels.  Place on a heatproof dish and keep warm in a 200 degree oven while deep-frying remaining chicken.

Meanwhile, cook sauce over medium-high heat, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens slightly.

Cut chicken into strips and arrange on a serving platter.  Pour sauce over chicken and garnish edge of platter with additional pineapple slices.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  For a crispier crust, fry the chicken a second time before serving.

                            Red Envelope Fish

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  mild-flavored firm white fish fillets -- 3/4" thick
                        = (such as red snapper, halibut or sea bas
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
                        Flour -- for dry-coating
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
                        Slivered green onion -- for garnish
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  slivered Chinese sweet mixed pickles or
                        sweet gherkins -- drained
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  ketchup
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
     3/4      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  2        tablespoons  water

Combine sauce ingredients in a small saucepan.  Place over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens slightly.  Keep warm while preparing fish.

Cutting only 1/2-inch deep into fish, score fillets lengthwise at 1-inch intervals.  Then score fish crosswise at 1-inch intervals.  Lightly sprinkle fish with salt and pepper.  Place egg and flour in separate shallow bowls.  Dip fish in egg, drain briefly, then dredge with flour, shaking off excess.  Set aside.

Set wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of about 2 inches.  Over high heat, bring oil to 375 degrees.  Slowly dip fish fillets into hot oil and cook, turning occasionally, for 3 minutes or until golden brown.  Lift out and drain on paper towels.

Transfer to a platter.  Pour warm sauce over fish.  Garnish with green onion.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Red is a lucky color to the Chinese.  During the New Year's celebration, we exchange gifts in red envelopes to ensure good fortune.  In this dish, a spicy sweet and sour red sauce is the "red envelope" bearing a gift of succulent deep-dried fish fillets.

Comments:  Red is a lucky color to the Chinese.  During the New Year&apos;s celebration, we exchange gifts in red envelopes to ensure good fortune.  In this dish, a spicy sweet and sour red sauce is the &quot;red envelope&quot; bearing a gift of succulent deep-dried fish fillets.

  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1              large  frozen bean curd skin or sheet - (10" by 1
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  slivered Chinese sweet pickles or sweet
                        gherkins
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  ketchup
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
     3/4      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  1         tablespoon  canola oil - (to 3)
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISH ===
                        Cilantro sprigs

Filling:  Combine potato, water chestnuts, cornstarch, salt, soy sauce and sesame oil in a medium bowl.  Unfold bean curd skin; place on work surface with narrow edge toward you.  Spread potato filling evenly across middle of bean curd skin.  Fold bottom half up over filling, then fold in sides.  Brush top and side edges with cornstarch mixture (reserve remaining mixture).  Genetly roll up to form a loose cylinder; set aside.

Sauce:  Combine pickles, sugar, vinegar, ketchup, soy sauce and hot pepper sauce in a small sauceptan.  Bring to a boil over medium heat.  Add reserved cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens, about 2 minutes.

Heat oil in wok or in large deep skillet over high heat.  Carefully place filled bean curd skin into wok seam-side down and cook, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer to large serving platter.  Cut in half lengthwise, and then crosswise into 12 pieces.  Pour sauce over all and garnish with cilantro if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In China, bean curd skin is molded into a fish shape and then sliced into servings.  Its name comes from the red envelopes of money given to children by their elders during the new year celebrations.

                            Roast Drunken Duck

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  dark soy sauce
     1/2           cup  white wine or dry sherry
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice
                        === DUCK AND MUSHROOMS ===
  1              whole  duck - (3 to 3 1/2 lbs) -- cleaned
  8                     dried black mushrooms
                        === STUFFING ===
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
  4             slices  ginger - (quarter-size) -- julienned
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2             medium  onions -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  shredded bamboo shoots
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced Sichuan preserved vegetable
     1/4           cup  white wine
  1           teaspoon  Chinese five-spice
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce or char siu sauce
                        === GLAZE ===
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce

Combine marinade ingredients in a bowl.  Rub duck inside and out with marinade.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.

Soak mushrooms in warm water to cover until softened, about 20 minutes; drain.  Discard stems; thinly slice caps.

Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add ginger and garlic; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add onions and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and preserved vegetable; stir-fry for 2 minutes.  Add wine, five-spice, soy sauce, and hoisin sauce; cook for 1 minute.  Let cool.

Place stuffing inside duck; use skewers to enclose.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place duck, breast-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan.  Bake until meat is no longer pink when cut near bone, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Increase heat to 475 degrees.  Combine glaze ingredients in a bowl.  Brush glaze over duck.  Bake until skin is richly glazed, 5 to 7 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Here's my easy home-style version of Cantonese roast duck.  It's marinated in wine, filled with an aromatic stuffing, and finished of with a soy and hoisin glaze for a beautifully lacquered look.

If you live near a Chinese deli that sells roast ducks, you're in luck: You can enjoy a wonderful treat any time without running up a huge "duck bill"!  Roasting duck the Chinese way is a real art.  First, the birds are parboiled, melting away some of the fat.  Then they're blown up with air and hung up to dry to tighten their skin.  Finally, they're lacquered with a sweet glaze of honey, maltose, vinegar, and rice wine that caramelizes during roasting, making the skin crisp and brown.  You can eat Cantonese roast duck at room temperature, or warm it in the oven.  Serve it with the thin brown cooking sauce that's usually included at no extra charge, or shred the meat and use it to top a salad of greens tossed with a vinaigrette enriched either with a bit of the duck sauce, or with bottled plum sauce.

Comments:  Here&apos;s my easy home-style version of Cantonese roast duck.  It&apos;s marinated in wine, filled with an aromatic stuffing, and finished of with a soy and hoisin glaze for a beautifully lacquered look.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you live near a Chinese deli that sells roast ducks, you&apos;re in luck: You can enjoy a wonderful treat any time without running up a huge &quot;duck bill&quot;!  Roasting duck the Chinese way is a real art.  First, the birds are parboiled, melting away some of the fat.  Then they&apos;re blown up with air and hung up to dry to tighten their skin.  Finally, they&apos;re lacquered with a sweet glaze of honey, maltose, vinegar, and rice wine that caramelizes during roasting, making the skin crisp and brown.  You can eat Cantonese roast duck at room temperature, or warm it in the oven.  Serve it with the thin brown cooking sauce that&apos;s usually included at no extra charge, or shred the meat and use it to top a salad of greens tossed with a vinaigrette enriched either with a bit of the duck sauce, or with bottled plum sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     turkey (8 to 10 lbs) -- thawed, cleaned
  4             slices  uncooked bacon

  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
     1/4           cup  Shao Hsing wine
                        === STUFFING ===
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
  2                     Chinese sausages -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
     1/2           cup  thinly sliced carrots
  4                     green onions -- sliced
     1/2           cup  sliced water chestnuts
     1/2           cup  sliced fresh shiitake mushrooms
  3 1/2           cups  cooked glutinous rice
  3        tablespoons  oyster-flavored sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Carefully place bacon and ginger under the skin on the breast side of turkey.  Combine marinade ingredients in small bowl; rub all over the inside and outside of the turkey.  Refrigerate until ready to stuff.

Add carrots, green onions, water chestnuts, and mushrooms; stir-fry 2 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in glutinous rice, oyster-flavored sauce, sesame oil, and pepper.

Just before roasting, lightly stuff body and neck cavities of turkey.  Fasten openings with skewers or truss.  Place turkey, breast-side up, on rack in roasting pan; roast in preheated 325 degree oven until internal temperature of inner thigh reaches 165 degrees (allow 12 to 15 minutes per pound).  Remove stuffing from turkey to serving bowl.  Carve and serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Meatballs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  dried shrimp
  1              pound  lean ground pork
     1/4           cup  water chestnuts -- coarsely chopped
  1                     green onion, including top -- thinly sliced
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Shao Hsing wine or dry sherry
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  8              large  Chinese (napa) cabbage leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil

Soak shrimp in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Mince shrimp and combine with remaining meatball ingredients.  Set aside for 30 minutes.

Shape into 4 large meatballs, each approximately 2 1/2 inches in diameter.

Set wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of about 2 inches.  Over high heat, bring oil to 350 degrees.  Add meatballs and cook for 3 minutes or until golden brown.  Lift out and drain on paper towels.

Remove all but 2 tablespoons oil from wok and set wok over high heat until hot.  Add ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 5 seconds.  Add meatballs, broth, sugar, salt and pepper and bring to a boil.  Cover and simmer over medium-low heat for 20 minutes.

Place cabbage leaves over meatballs.  Cover and simmer for 15 minutes longer.  Sprinkle with sesame oil before serving.

If a thicker sauce is desired, transfer cabbage and meatballs to a platter with a slotted spoon.  Add 3 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 1/3 cup water to sauce, and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  These large meatballs are supposed to resemble the head of a lion, especially when served with cabbage leaves draped over them as a "mane."  They are often served on special occasions to symbolize happiness.

                     Sizzling Rice Hot And Sour Soup

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     dried black mushrooms
  5               cups  chicken broth
  1                     chicken breast half -- skinned, boned,
                        and cut into matchstick pieces
     1/4           cup  slivered bamboo shoots
     1/2           cup  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1                     green onion, including top -- cut 2" slivers
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch -- mixed with
     1/4           cup  water
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  8                     rice crusts - (2" square)

Soak mushrooms in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut off and discard stems and thinly slice caps.  Set aside.

Bring broth to a boil over medium-high heat in a large pot.  Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes.  Stir in mushrooms, bamboo shoots, vinegar, soy sauce, green onion, cilantro, hot pepper sauce, salt, and white pepper.  Return to a boil.  Add cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until soup thickens slightly.  Remove pot from heat and slowly drizzle in egg, stirring constantly.  Keep warm while preparing rice crusts.

Set wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of about 2 inches.  Over high heat, bring oil to 375 degrees.  Add rice crusts, half at a time, and cook, turning constantly, for 15 seconds or until puffed.  Lift out and drain on paper towels.  Cook remaining crusts.

Pout hot soup into a warmed serving bowl and carry to the table.  Bring hot fried rice crusts to the table and carefully slide into the soup.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Look for rice crusts in Chinese market.  To make your own Rice Crusts:  Combine 1 cup medium- or short-grained rice and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan.  Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 25 minutes.  Turn off heat and let stand for 5 minutes.

Spread cooked rice in a 1/4-inch-thick layer on a greased, shallow baking pan.  Cut into 1 1/2- to 2-inch squares with a wet knife.  Bake in a 350 oven for 50 minutes or until rice squares are firm and dry.  Store rice crusts in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 6 months.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  2             medium  potatoes
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  4             slices  ginger - (quarter-size) -- minced
  1                     fresh red or green jalapeÒo chile -- seeded, minced
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  frozen peas and carrots -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  curry powder
  2        tablespoons  oyster-flavored sauce
                        === TURNOVERS ===
  10                    egg roll or spring roll wrappers
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2        tablespoons  water
                        Cooking oil -- for deep-frying
                        Plum sauce or sweet and sour sauce

In a 2-quart pan, boil potatoes until tender when pierced, about 20 minutes; drain and let cool.  Peel potatoes and cut into 1/4-inch cubes.

Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the 2 tablespoons oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add garlic, ginger, and chile; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add onion and stir-fry until soft, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add peas, carrots, potatoes, curry powder, and oyster-flavored sauce.  Mix well and cook for 1 minute.  Remove from heat and let cool.

Cut wrappers into thirds.  Mix flour and water until smooth.  Lay two strips end to end and glue together with flour and water paste.  Place 1 tablespoon filling at one end; fold wrapper over filling bringing one corner diagonally across to form a triangle.  Continue to fold maintaining a triangle shape, (like folding a flag) until you reach the end.  Secure end with flour and water paste.

In a wok, heat oil for deep-frying to 350 degrees.  Deep-fry samosas a few at a time, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels.

Serve warm with plum sauce or sweet and sour sauce.

This recipe yields 10 turnovers.

                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  hot mustard powder
                        === DUMPLINGS ===
  30                    siu mai or wonton wrappers
     1/4           cup  frozen green peas -- thawed

In a food processor, process filling ingredients into a paste.  Transfer to a stainless steel bowl.

Combine dipping sauce in a small bowl; blend well.

To fill each dumpling, spoon a heaping teaspoon of filling into center of each wrapper, keeping remaining wrappers covered to prevent drying.  Use fingers to form a open-topped pouch.  Place one green pea on top of each siu mai; place siu mai on two greased 9-inch pie pans or other heatproof dish.

Place a steaming rack in a wok.  Add water and bring to a boil.  Place dish on the rack, cover and steam over medium-high heat for 20 minutes.  Check the water level in the wok occasionally.  If it is low, add boiling water to avoid lowering the temperature.

When the siu mai is cooked, remove the dish from the wok.  Serve the first portion while cooking the remaining siu mai.  Serve siu mai with dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 30 siu mai.

                     Steamed Tofu With Shrimp Mousse

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  soft tofu - (16 oz) -- drained
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
  1                     green onion, including top -- chopped
                        === SHRIMP MOUSSE ===
     1/4         pound  raw medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped cilantro
  1                     egg
  1 1/2      teaspoons  rice wine
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Chop the shrimp in a food processor.  Add the remaining mousse ingredients and process until the shrimp are finely diced.  Remove the shrimp mousse to a bowl and mix rapidly to incorporate air into the mixture.

Cut the block of tofu in half horizontally; cut each piece in half lengthwise, then crosswise, to make 8 equal pieces.  Lay the tofu pieces side by side in a 9-inch glass pie pan or other heat-proof dish.  Evenly spread shrimp mousse over each piece.

Place a steaming rack in a wok or saucepan.  Add water to just below the level of the rack and bring to a boil.  Place the dish on the rack; cover and steam until the shrimp mousse turns pink, about 6 to 10 minutes.

Remove the dish from the wok and carefully pour off the cooking juices.  Drizzle soy sauce and sesame oil over the tofu, sprinkle with green onions and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                      Stir-Fried Fresh Rice Noodles

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Noodles


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3         pound  raw medium shrimp
     1/3         pound  squid -- cleaned
  2                     baby bok choy - (to 3)
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1              pound  fresh rice noodles -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/4" strips
  1                cup  bean sprouts
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  regular soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  chili garlic sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Combine sauce ingredients in a small bowl.

Shell and devein shrimp; cut in half lengthwise.  Cut squid crosswise into 1/4-inch slices to make rings; leave tentacles whole.  Quarter bok choy and slice crosswise into 1-inch pieces.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add cooking oil and swirl to coat sides.  Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant 10 seconds.  Add shrimp and squid; cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add bok choy and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add sauce; cook for 30 seconds.  Add rice noodles and bean sprouts; stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add egg and cook until set, about 1 minute.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  If you've ever tried Chinese chow fun, you know that the texture of fresh rice noodles is irresistibly chewy and appealing.  Made of water and rice flour, they fry up crispy around the edges and soak up sauces like no other pasta.  You can find them in the refrigerated section of Asian markets, where they're sold as folded sheets (left whole so you can roll a filling around them or cut them into whatever width noodles you need) or as precut ribbons or spaghetti-thin strands.  It's best to use fresh rice noodles the day you buy them.  Once refrigerated, they become stiff; rinse them gently in warm water to soften them up and to remove the oily film added to keep them from sticking together.

Another stellar example of Singapore street fare chow kway teow, is all about contrasts: soft, fresh rice noodles, tender seafood and crunchy bok choy and bean sprouts -- all stir-fried in a deep, dark "secret sauce."

Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped unsalted roasted peanuts
  3        tablespoons  sugar
                        === DOUGH ===
  3               cups  glutinous rice flour
     2/3           cup  boilling water
     1/2           cup  cold water -- plus
  2        tablespoons  cold water
                        === ALSO NEEDED ===
  12                    wax paper squares, each 4" by 4"
                        Finely-shredded sweetened coconut -- for garnish

In a wide frying pan, toast sesame seeds over medium heat for about 5 minutes or until golden brown, shaking pan frequently.  Place in a small bowl and stir in remaining filling ingredients.  Set aside.

Measure rice flour in a medium-size bowl.  Make a well in the center of flour and pour boiling water into well, stirring with chopsticks or a fork until dough is evenly moistened.  Add cold water and stir until dough forms a ball.

On a lightly floured surface, knead dough for about 5 minutes or until smooth and shiny.  Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 10 minutes.  Roll dough into a 12-inch-long cylinder.  Cut cylinder crosswise into 1-inch pieces.

To shape each dumpling, flatten one piece of dough with a rolling pin to make a 1/4-inch-thick circle, keeping remaining dough covered to prevent drying.  Place 1 1/2 teaspoons of filling in center of circle.  Gather and pinch edges together at the top to seal securely.  Roll carefully between your palms to form a round ball.  Place on a square of wax paper.  Cover filled dumplings with a damp cloth while filling remaining dumplings.

Line the bottom of a steamer with a small damp towel.  Arrange dumplings, without crowding, on cloth.  Cover and steam over boiling water for 10 minutes.  Remove dumplings and sprinkle evenly with coconut.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 rice balls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  English cucumber
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === DRESSING ===
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  ground toasted Szechuan peppercorns
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar

Heat a small saucepan over medium heat until hot.  Add oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add garlic and ground peppercorns; cook, stirring, until fragrant.  Remove from pan; let cool.

Stir in rice vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, and chili oil until blended.  Pour dressing over cucumber fans; mix well.  Serve at room temperature or refrigerate and serve cold.

                     Thai Beef Salad - {Neua Nam Tok}

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  flank steak
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === DRESSING ===
  1         tablespoon  uncooked white long-grain rice
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced shallots
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped mint leaves
     1/3           cup  lime juice
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  chopped green onion or scallions
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-chopped lemon grass -- see * Note
  1 1/2      teaspoons  crushed red pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
                        === FOR SERVING ===
  3               cups  shredded iceberg lettuce
                        Mint sprigs -- for garnish

* Note:  Lemon grass is available at Thai or Asian markets, or ethnic sections in some grocery stores.

Season beef steak with salt and pepper.  Place beef in a lightly oiled grill pan over high heat.  Cook, turning once, until medium-rare to medium (depending on preference), 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  (If the flank steak is thick, cover the grill pan with a lid to cook the inside more evenly.)  Remove from stovetop grill, cover meat with aluminum foil, and let stand for 15 minutes.  Thinly slice flank steak across the grain and set aside.

To prepare dressing:  Place rice in a small frying pan, over medium heat; cook, shaking pan frequently, until lightly browned, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Immediately remove from pan to cool.  Grind rice finely in a spice grinder.  Add ground rice to shallots, mint leaves, lime juice, fish sauce, onion, lemon grass, pepper and sugar; mix well.

Arrange lettuce on a platter.  Just before serving, toss meat with the dressing and arrange on the lettuce.  Garnish with mint sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Season beef steak with salt and pepper.  Place beef in a lightly oiled grill pan over high heat.  Cook, turning once, until medium-rare to medium (depending on preference), 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  (If the flank steak is thick, cover the grill pan with a lid to cook the inside more evenly.)  Remove from stovetop grill, cover meat with aluminum foil, and let stand for 15 minutes.  Thinly slice flank steak across the grain and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare dressing:  Place rice in a small frying pan, over medium heat; cook, shaking pan frequently, until lightly browned, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Immediately remove from pan to cool.  Grind rice finely in a spice grinder.  Add ground rice to shallots, mint leaves, lime juice, fish sauce, onion, lemon grass, pepper and sugar; mix well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange lettuce on a platter.  Just before serving, toss meat with the dressing and arrange on the lettuce.  Garnish with mint sprigs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     chicken thighs
                        Sweet chili sauce -- see * Note
                        === MARINADE ===
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce -- see * Note
  3        tablespoons  finely chopped cilantro
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  grated fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
  1           teaspoon  turmeric powder
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

* Note:  Fish sauce and sweet chili sauce are available at Asian food stores.

Combine marinade ingredients in a large bowl.  Add chicken and turn to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or up to overnight.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Place chicken pieces 1 inch apart in a shallow baking pan.  Bake, uncovered, until meat near bone is no longer pink when cut, 40 to 45 minutes.

Place chicken on a serving plate.  Pass a small bowl of sweet chili sauce for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  So many of the great tastes of Thailand are found in the great outdoors, at roadside food stands.  I've discovered that this tasty chicken recipe with all the right seasonings works equally well indoors.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  Japanese soup stock (dashi)
                        = (or chicken stock)
     1/3           cup  sweet cooking rice wine -- mirin
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water
  4                     dried black mushrooms
  14            ounces  extra-firm tofu
     1/2         pound  cooked crabmeat -- flaked
     1/2           cup  small cooked shrimp -- coarsely chopped
  2                     green onions -- minced
  2                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  water
                        Cornstarch or flour -- as needed
     1/2           cup  Japanese-style bread crumbs (panko)
                        Cooking oil
                        Sliced green onion -- for garnish
                        Toasted white sesame seeds -- for garnish

Soak mushrooms in warm water to cover until softened, about 20 minutes; drain.  Discard stems; trim and finely dice caps, and place in a large bowl.

Drain tofu.  Place in a colander and crumble with your hands; let drain for 15 minutes.  Place tofu in a clean dish towel; twist towel around tofu to extract all moisture.  Add tofu to mushrooms.

Add crabmeat, shrimp, minced green onions, white of 1 egg, ginger, sugar, salt and white pepper.  Mix well.  Using about 1/4 cup for each, shape mixture into ten 1/2-inch-thick cakes.

In a small pan, combine dashi, mirin, soy sauce, sugar and ginger; simmer for 3 minutes.  Add cornstarch solution to sauce and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens.  Keep sauce warm.

Lightly beat remaining egg yolk and egg with water.  Dip crab cakes into cornstarch; shake off excess.  Dip into egg, drain briefly, then coat with bread crumbs.

Place a wide frying pan over medium heat.  Add oil to a depth of 1/4 inch.  When oil is hot, add crab cakes and pan-fry, uncovered, turning once, until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes per side.  Lift out and drain on paper towels.

Arrange cakes on a serving platter.  Pour sauce over; garnish with green onion and sesame seeds.

This recipe yields 10 crab cakes.

                    Tofu Custard With Tropical Fruits

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  water
     2/3           cup  crushed rock sugar or honey
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/2           cup  jackfruit chunks
     1/2           cup  longans
     1/2           cup  loquats
     1/2           cup  raspberries or blueberries
     1/2           cup  diced cantaloupe
  2           packages  soft tofu - (16 oz ea) -- drained

Combine water, sugar, and lemon juice in a nonreactive pan.  Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves, 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove from heat and add all the fruit.  Let cool; cover and refrigerate until chilled.

Cut tofu into 1/2-inch cubes and place in a serving bowl.  Spoon fruit and syrup over tofu.  Serve chilled.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Few desserts are this easy, this healthy, and this beautiful.  The "custard" is simply cubes of chilled soft tofu.  But when topped with a lemon syrup and a colorful array of berries and tropical fruits, the tofu tastes creamy, silky, and refreshingly light.  You can use any fresh or canned fruit, from orange, grapefruit, and mandarin orange sections to pineapple, papaya, and mango chunks.

The Topic is Tropical:  The longan, also known as "dragon's eye," looks like a lychee, small and round with a smooth brown shell.  In the West, I've seen fresh ones in Asian markets during the summer, and they're sold in cans year-round.  The loquat originated in China, and looks and tastes like a cross between an apricot and a plum.  Canned loquats are easier to find than fresh ones.  The gigantic jackfruit is a sweet tropical fruit that reaches weights of up to 100 pounds!  In the U.S. jackfruit is sold only in cans.

                        Watercress Soup With Crab

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  cooked crabmeat -- flaked
  2          teaspoons  cooking oil
  3             slices  ginger - (quarter-size) -- lightly crushed
  4               cups  chicken broth
  1                cup  water
  1              bunch  watercress - (abt 3/4 lb) -- coarse stems trimmed
     1/2           cup  sliced carrot
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === MARINADE ===
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Combine marinade ingredients in a small bowl.  Add crabmeat and stir to coat.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

Place a 2-quart pan over high heat until hot.  Add cooking oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add crabmeat and stir-fry for 1 minute.

Add broth and water; bring to a boil.  Add watercress and carrot.  Reduce heat to low and simmer until vegetables are tender-crisp, about 5 minutes.  Stir in sesame oil and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is a popular Cantonese treat, yet ironically watercress is not of Chinese origin.  It was brought to China by Western traders, and over the centuries it has found a perfect home in Chinese cuisine, as in this savory seafood broth.
