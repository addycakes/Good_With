  1                cup  fresh basil leaves - (packed)
  1                     garlic clove
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2         pound  thinly-sliced prosciutto
  2                     balls fresh water-packed
                        mozzarella cheese - (8 oz ea) -- drained, and
                        thinly sliced into rounds
  4              large  tomatoes -- thinly sliced
  6                     hard-boiled eggs -- shelled, and

           Arugula, Corn, And Tomato Salad With Shaved Parmesan

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  fresh arugula - (lightly packed)
  1 1/2           cups  fresh basil leaves - (lightly packed) -- torn
  1 1/2           cups  corn kernels
                        = (cut from about 2 small ears)
  1                cup  halved cherry tomatoes
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              piece  Parmesan cheese - (2 1/2 oz)

Toss first 4 ingredients in large bowl.  Whisk oil and lemon juice in small bowl.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Drizzle dressing over salad; toss to coat.

Divide salad among plates.  Using vegetable peeler, shave curls of Parmesan atop each salad and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Fresh kernels of raw corn are so sweet and tender that they don't need to be cooked.  Their natural sugars and crisp juiciness pair wonderfully with the salty Parmesan and peppery arugula.

  3               cups  thinly-sliced Napa cabbage

                        = (or 12-oz dried Chinese egg noodles)
     1/3           cup  oriental sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  unseasoned rice vinegar

Whisk sesame oil, next 3 ingredients, and 2 tablespoons soy sauce in small bowl.  Add to noodles.  Add sliced eggs, 3/4 cup cilantro, and cabbage mixture; toss to blend well.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill, tossing occasionally.)

Sprinkle salad with 2 chopped green onions, chopped egg, and remaining 1/4 cup cilantro and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Chinese egg noodles are at Asian markets and in the Asian foods section of the supermarket.

     1/3           cup  small mint sprigs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12             large  butter lettuce leaves

Heat peanut oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes.  Add turkey and sautÈ until brown and cooked through, breaking up with back of spoon, about 7 minutes.

Add peanut sauce, hoisin sauce, and 1 tablespoon soy sauce; heat through.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Reheat in microwave or skillet, adding water by tablespoonfuls to moisten if necessary, before continuing.)  Stir in cucumber and chopped mint.  Season with salt and pepper.

Transfer turkey mixture to medium bowl.  Place mint sprigs and lettuce leaves on platter.  To make wraps, spoon turkey mixture onto lettuce leaf, add a few mint sprigs, fold in sides over filling, and roll up.  Pass additional soy sauce alongside wraps for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  These wraps make for an informal and delightfully messy summer supper.  Complete the meal with a rice salad from the deli (adding diced bell peppers and a splash of rice vinegar, if desired) and ice cream sprinkled with minced crystallized ginger.

                Baked Pork Ribs With Hoisin Barbecue Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  baby back pork ribs
  1           teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  1                cup  hoisin sauce
     1/2           cup  bottled chili sauce
     1/4           cup  Sherry
  4          teaspoons  chili-garlic sauce
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  oriental sesame oil

Place ribs in large roasting pan.  Pierce meat with fork.  Sprinkle with Chinese five-spice powder and onion powder; rub mixture into meat.

Whisk remaining ingredients in small bowl to blend.  Pour sauce over ribs, turning to coat.  Turn ribs meat-side down; cover pan with aluminum foil and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake ribs, covered, until just tender, about 30 minutes.  Uncover and turn ribs meat-side up; bake until ribs are cooked through, basting occasionally, about 35 minutes.  Cut meat between bones to separate ribs and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  If you prefer to grill the ribs -- which will intensify the hoisin flavor -- remove them from the marinade (do not bake) and grill them over medium heat until tender and lightly charred, turning often and basting occasionally with marinade, about 25 minutes.  Look for chili-garlic sauce in the Asian foods section of supermarkets.

     1/3           cup  chilled solid vegetable shortening -- cut 1/2" cubes
  6        tablespoons  ice water - (about)
                        === TOPPING ===
  6        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  6        tablespoons  whole almonds
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  4 1/2    tablespoons  old-fashioned oats
  4 1/2    tablespoons  all purpose flour
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  quick-cooking tapioca
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  5               cups  assorted fresh berries
                        = (such as raspberries/ blackberries/
                        and blueberries -- abt 8 oz of each)

For crust:  Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Add butter and shortening; using on/off turns, cut in until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 5 tablespoons ice water and process until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if mixture is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill at least 1 hour.

For topping:  Combine all ingredients in processor.  Process until moist clumps form.  (Dough and topping can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover topping and chill; keep dough chilled.  Soften dough slightly at room temperature before rolling out.)

For filling:  Mix sugar, tapioca, and lemon juice in large bowl.  Add berries and toss gently to combine.  Let stand until tapioca softens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 15-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Trim dough overhang to 1 inch.  Fold overhang under and crimp decoratively, forming high-standing rim.  Freeze crust 20 minutes.

Spoon filling into crust.  Crumble topping evenly over filling.  Bake pie until crust and topping are golden brown and filling is bubbling, covering loosely with sheet of foil if topping browns too quickly, about 55 minutes.  Transfer pie to rack and cool at least 3 hours.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)  Cut pie into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  whole black peppercorns
  6                     tuna steaks - (5 to 6 oz ea)
  2                     bags mixed baby greens - (5 oz ea)
  1              bunch  radishes -- trimmed, sliced

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Stir soy sauce and brown sugar in pie dish until sugar dissolves.  Using mortar and pestle or spice mill, coarsely grind peppercorns.

Dip both sides of tuna steaks in soy mixture.  Sprinkle both sides of tuna generously with peppercorns, pressing to adhere.  Grill tuna to desired doneness, about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  uncooked large shrimp -- unpeeled
     3/4           cup  butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
  1 1/2           cups  bottled Italian dressing
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh mint
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  hot pepper sauce
  4                     bay leaves -- crumbled
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt

Place shrimp in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat.  Whisk in Italian dressing, lemon juice, mint, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, bay leaves, pepper, and salt.  Cool sauce to room temperature; mix into shrimp.  Refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours, tossing occasionally.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Bake shrimp until just opaque in center, about 15 minutes, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 main-course servings.

Comments:  "My mom taught me how to cook -- mostly the meat-and-potatoes fare favored in my native north Texas," writes Judy Wilkins of Tyler, Texas.  "I'll always have a fondness for that kind of meal, but now that I live in a town closer to Louisiana, I've developed a love for Cajun food.  Out of necessity, I've also developed a love for quick cooking.  Between my musician's hours (nights and weekends) and teacher's hours (daytime piano lessons), my schedule can be nuts.  When I do have the chance to cook dinner on a weeknight, whatever I make can't take too long -- and it has to taste great."

With this communal dish, the mess is part of the fun.  Lay down newspapers on the table and invite guests to peel-and-eat.  And serve crusty bread for sopping up the juices.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BEANS ===
  3               cups  dried cannellini - (abt 21 oz)
                        = (white kidney beans)
  3             quarts  cold water
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  4              whole  garlic cloves -- peeled
  1                     large bunch fresh sage leaves
  16             whole  black peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  salt
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  12             large  fresh sage leaves
  8              whole  garlic cloves -- peeled
  2             pounds  plum tomatoes -- seeded, and
                        coarsely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For beans:  Place beans in large bowl; cover generously with water.  Let stand at room temperature overnight.

Drain beans; transfer to heavy large pot.  Add 3 quarts water, oil, garlic, sage bunch, and peppercorns.  Bring to boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer uncovered until beans are tender, about 1 hour 5 minutes.  Remove from heat; mix in salt.  Cool beans 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Refrigerate in water.)

For sauce:  Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add sage and garlic; sautÈ 2 minutes.  Add tomatoes and sautÈ until tomatoes soften and begin to release juices, about 8 minutes.

Drain beans, reserving cooking liquid.  Discard sage bunch.  Mix beans into tomato sauce.  Simmer over medium-low heat until sauce thickens slightly and flavors blend, adding reserved cooking liquid by half cupfuls if mixture is dry, about 30 minutes (beans should have slightly soupy consistency).  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve beans warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Because the beans need to be soaked overnight, start making this a day or two before you plan to serve it.

     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- more or less

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  tomatillos -- husked
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  minced seeded jalapeÒo chili
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  24                    jumbo shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        tails left intact
  2        tablespoons  ground mild chili
                        = (such as ancho or New Mexican)
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
                        Queso fresco -- for serving
                        = (or feta cheese)

Cook tomatillos in large pot of boiling salted water until olive-green color, about 5 minutes.  Drain and transfer to blender.  Add onion, jalapeÒo, and garlic and process tomatillo sauce until smooth.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in skillet over medium heat.  Add sauce and bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Stir in cilantro.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cool to room temperature.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Chill.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Toss shrimp with remaining 2 tablespoons oil in large bowl.  Add ground chili, onion powder, and garlic powder; toss to combine.  Sprinkle shrimp with salt and pepper.  Grill shrimp until just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.

Spoon about 3 tablespoons tomatillo sauce into center of each of 6 plates.  Arrange shrimp atop sauce.  Sprinkle with queso fresco.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Accompany the shrimp with grilled zucchini and yellow squash.

Tomatillos (green tomato-like vegetables with paper-thin husks), ground New Mexican chilies, and queso fresco (also known as queso blanco) are available at Latin American markets and some supermarkets.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  blanched slivered almonds
  1                cup  sugar
  8             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  5              large  eggs -- separated
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted, cooled
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Powdered sugar -- as needed

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 10-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.

Combine almonds and 1/3 cup sugar in processor.  Blend until almonds are very finely ground.  Transfer almond mixture to medium bowl; do not clean processor.

Add chocolate and 1/3 cup sugar to processor.  Blend until chocolate is finely ground but not beginning to clump, about 45 seconds; stir into almond mixture.

Using electric mixer, beat egg yolks and remaining 1/3 cup sugar in large bowl until mixture falls in heavy ribbon when beaters are lifted, about 5 minutes.  Beat in almond extract and lemon peel.  Fold in chocolate-almond mixture, then butter.

Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites and salt in another large bowl until stiff but not dry.  Fold whites into chocolate batter in three additions.  Transfer batter to prepared pan.

Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 40 minutes.  Cool cake completely in pan on rack.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; store at room temperature.)  Cut around pan sides to loosen; release sides.  Sift powdered sugar over cake.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

                Chopped Spinach With Toasted Sesame Seeds

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  sesame seeds
  5            bunches  fresh spinach - (8 to 9 oz ea) -- stem ends and
                        roots trimmed, rinsed well
  4          teaspoons  oriental sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  unseasoned rice vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place sesame seeds in heavy skillet; sprinkle lightly with salt.  Stir over medium heat until seeds are light golden, about 6 minutes.  Set aside.

Line large colander with kitchen towel.  Pack spinach, with water still clinging to leaves, into heavy large pot.  Cook over high heat until wilted but still bright green, turning spinach with tongs for even cooking, about 4 minutes.

Transfer spinach to prepared colander.  Cool slightly.  Wrap towel around spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible.  Transfer spinach to work surface and chop coarsely.

Place in medium bowl.  Add sesame oil, vinegar, and hot pepper sauce.  Toss to blend evenly.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds.  (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Using a salad spinner makes short work of washing fresh spinach, which usually requires several changes of water.  Start by filling the spinner bowl with water.  Then fill the basket with spinach, submerge it in the water, and stir the spinach to release dirt.  Lift the basket out and repeat with fresh water.

                          Crab And Avocado Soup

Recipe By     :Sally Siegel, Pittsburgh, PA
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1                cup  chopped onion
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2            bottles  clam juice - (8 oz ea)
  1 1/2           cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
     1/2           cup  half-and-half
  2             medium  avocados -- peeled, pitted,
                        and diced
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  minced seeded jalapeÒo chili
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
     1/2         pound  crabmeat -- flaked, picked over
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Melt butter in large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add flour and stir 1 minute.  Add clam juice, broth, and half-and-half; bring soup to boil, whisking constantly.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until slightly thickened, whisking occasionally, about 5 minutes.

Puree soup in batches in blender, adding 1 diced avocado, 2 tablespoons cilantro, chili, and lime juice to last batch.  Return soup to pot.  Add crabmeat and simmer until heated through, about 3 minutes.  Season soup with salt and pepper.

Ladle soup into bowls.  Sprinkle with remaining diced avocado and cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  "I literally didn't know how to boil an egg until I was in my 20s -- when I tried to impress a guy by making dinner for him," writes Sally Siegel of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  "I didn't have much success with the dinner or the guy, but I regrouped and put together a repertoire of fairly elegant dishes I felt confident making.  Luckily, my husband, Loren, likes to cook as much as I do, so we really work as a team when we give dinner parties.  We're both real estate agents, and we like to entertain clients -- we've made some great friends by selling houses to them."

Silky and light, this blender soup would make a delicate summer starter.  Bonus: It comes together very quickly.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  2              large  egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  water -- more or less
                        === FILLING ===
  5              large  eggs
  1                cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  heavy whipping cream
     2/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  grated lemon peel

For Crust:  Using electric mixer, beat unsalted butter and egg yolks in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in sugar.  Beat in flour and salt just until blended, adding water by tablespoonfuls if dough is dry.

Transfer dough to lightly floured work surface.  Gather dough together.  Shape dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour.  Soften dough slightly at room temperature before rolling out.

For Filling:  Whisk eggs, sugar, cream, lemon juice, and grated lemon peel in medium metal bowl to blend.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water); whisk slowly but constantly until mixture thickens and instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers 160 degrees, about 20 minutes.  Remove bowl from over water.  Cool mixture to room temperature, whisking occasionally.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer dough to 10-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Fold in dough edges, forming double-thick sides.  Freeze crust 15 minutes.

Line crust with foil; fill with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake 15 minutes.  Remove pie weights.  Bake until crust is golden and cooked through, about 30 minutes longer.  Cool crust in pan on rack.

Spread filling evenly in crust.  Chill overnight to allow filling to set.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  This tart has a looser texture than typical lemon tarts.  Chill overnight before serving.

For Crust:  Using electric mixer, beat unsalted butter and egg yolks in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in sugar.  Beat in flour and salt just until blended, adding water by tablespoonfuls if dough is dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer dough to lightly floured work surface.  Gather dough together.  Shape dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour.  Soften dough slightly at room temperature before rolling out.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Filling:  Whisk eggs, sugar, cream, lemon juice, and grated lemon peel in medium metal bowl to blend.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water); whisk slowly but constantly until mixture thickens and instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers 160 degrees, about 20 minutes.  Remove bowl from over water.  Cool mixture to room temperature, whisking occasionally.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer dough to 10-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Fold in dough edges, forming double-thick sides.  Freeze crust 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Line crust with foil; fill with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake 15 minutes.  Remove pie weights.  Bake until crust is golden and cooked through, about 30 minutes longer.  Cool crust in pan on rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread filling evenly in crust.  Chill overnight to allow filling to set.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This tart has a looser texture than typical lemon tarts.  Chill overnight before serving.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
     1/3           cup  chopped pecans
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     2/3           cup  vanilla wafer cookie crumbs
                        = (from about 32 cookies)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- melted
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  boiling water
  1         tablespoon  instant espresso powder
                        = (or instant coffee powder)
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1                cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2              pints  caramel ice cream
                        = (such as dulce de leche)
     1/2           cup  chilled whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  powdered sugar
  2        tablespoons  chopped pecans

For crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Blend pecans and sugar in processor until pecans are finely ground.  Add cookie crumbs and cinnamon and process to combine.  Add butter and blend until moist clumps form.  Press crust onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch glass pie dish.  Bake until crust is lightly toasted, about 10 minutes.  Cool completely.

For sauce:  Stir 2 tablespoons boiling water and coffee powder in small bowl until powder is dissolved.  Whisk sugar and cocoa in heavy medium saucepan.  Whisk in 1 cup cream, corn syrup, and coffee mixture.  Add chocolate and butter.  Bring to boil over high heat, stirring constantly.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes.  Cool 30 minutes.  Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla.

Soften 1 pint ice cream at room temperature 15 minutes.  Spread evenly over bottom of crust.  Drizzle 3 tablespoons sauce over ice cream.  Freeze until sauce sets, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, soften remaining 1 pint ice cream at room temperature 15 minutes.  Spread evenly atop sauce.  Drizzle with 3 tablespoons sauce.  Freeze pie until frozen, at least 4 hours.  (Sauce and pie can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate sauce.  Keep pie frozen.)

Rewarm mocha fudge sauce over low heat, stirring often.  Whip 1/2 cup chilled cream, powdered sugar, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon vanilla in medium bowl until peaks form.  Transfer to pastry bag fitted with star tip.  Pipe rosettes of cream around top edge of pie.  Sprinkle with chopped pecans.  Cut pie into wedges and serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Start this a day ahead and freeze overnight.  For the crust, blend crumbled vanilla wafer cookies in a processor until crumbs form.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FIGS ===
  3                     oranges
  2                     lemons
  1             bottle  red Zinfandel - (750 ml)
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  honey
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  10                    whole cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  aniseed
  12            ounces  dried Calimyrna figs -- stemmed, quartered
                        === YOGURT CREAM ===
  1 1/2           cups  plain whole-milk yogurt
                        = (preferably organic)
     1/3           cup  orange blossom honey
  1 1/2           cups  chilled whipping cream
  2          teaspoons  unflavored gelatin

For Figs:  Using vegetable peeler, cut off peel from 2 oranges (orange part only) and from 1 lemon (yellow part only).  Place peels in heavy large saucepan.  Juice oranges and lemons.  Add 1 cup orange juice and 1/4 cup lemon juice to same pan (reserve any remaining juices for another use).  Add red Zinfandel, sugar, honey, and spices and bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Add dried figs; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until figs are tender and mixture is reduced to 3 1/2 cups, about 1 hour.  Transfer to bowl; cover and chill at least 6 hours.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Keep chilled.)

For Yogurt Cream:  Whisk plain whole-milk yogurt and orange blossom honey in medium bowl to blend; set aside.  Place 1/4 cup chilled whipping cream in small cup; sprinkle unflavored gelatin over.  Let stand until gelatin softens and absorbs all of whipping cream, about 15 minutes.

Bring 1/2 cup whipping cream to simmer in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add softened gelatin mixture and stir until gelatin dissolves completely, about 1 minute (do not boil).  Remove from heat.  Gradually stir in remaining 3/4 cup whipping cream.  Whisk cream mixture into yogurt mixture.  Divide yogurt-cream mixture among six 3/4-cup custard cups or ramekins.  Refrigerate yogurt creams until set, at least 4 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep yogurt creams refrigerated.)

Cut around yogurt creams to loosen.  Turn out onto plates; surround with figs and syrup and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  From Greece - On many Greek islands, figs are usually poached in a locally produced dessert wine.  The combination of red wine, citrus, and spices used here yields equally sweet results.  The honey-yogurt cream is similar to an Italian panna cotta.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  Adding softened gelatin to hot cream makes it easier to dissolve.  To be sure it is fully dissolved, turn over the spoon or spatula that you are stirring with and run a finger over the hot cream mixture.  You should not feel or see any gelatin granules.

  3        tablespoons  sliced almonds -- lightly toasted

* Note:  A flavoring extract available at liquor stores and in the liquor or specialty foods section of some supermarkets.

Using small sharp knife, cut off peel and white pith from oranges.  Thinly slice oranges into rounds.  Arrange orange slices in shallow bowl.

Combine honey, cinnamon stick, and orange flower water in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over low heat until mixture comes to simmer, about 2 minutes.  Pour hot syrup over oranges.  Cool.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  coarsely-grated whole-milk mozzarella
                        cheese
  1                     container whole-milk ricotta cheese - (15 
                        = (or part-skim ricotta cheese)
  1                cup  grated pecorino Sardo cheese
                        = (or pecorino Romano cheese)
  4          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  4               cups  bread flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4              large  eggs -- beaten to blend
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut 1/2" pieces,
                        and at room temperature
     1/2           cup  room-temperature water -- plus
  2        tablespoons  room-temperature water -- more or less
                        Corn oil or olive oil -- for frying
                        Honey -- for drizzling
                        = (preferably chestnut)

Mix all cheeses and lemon peel in large bowl; set cheese mixture aside.

Lightly flour 2 baking sheets.  Mix bread flour and salt in another large bowl; mix in beaten eggs.  Using fingertips, rub in butter a few pieces at a time until well blended.  Add 1/2 cup water; stir to blend, adding more water by tablespoonfuls if dough is dry.  Knead in bowl until dough comes together.  Turn dough out onto floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.

Divide dough into 4 pieces.  Roll out 1 dough piece on lightly floured surface to scant 1/8-inch thickness.  Using 3 1/2-inch-diameter cookie cutter or biscuit cutter and using sharp knife as aid, cut out rounds.  Repeat with remaining dough pieces.

Transfer half of dough rounds to prepared baking sheets.  Place 2 level tablespoons cheese mixture in center of each dough round on baking sheets.  Brush edges of dough rounds lightly with water.  Cover with remaining dough rounds, pressing firmly on edges to adhere and seal.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Pour enough oil into heavy large pot to reach depth of 2 inches.  Heat oil to 350 degrees.  Add 3 to 4 ravioli at a time to hot oil in pot and deep-fry until golden, turning once, about 4 minutes.  Transfer to paper towels to drain.  Place ravioli on baking sheets and keep warm in oven while frying remaining ravioli.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cool; cover and refrigerate.  Place on baking sheets and rewarm in 350 degrees oven until heated through and cheese melts, about 10 minutes.)

Place ravioli on platter.  Drizzle with honey and serve hot.

This recipe yields about 24 ravioli.

Comments:  These deep-fried dessert pastries, which are sweetened with honey, are known as sebadas.

          Fusilli With Eggplant, Pine Nuts, Currants, And Capers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     eggplants - (16 oz ea) -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/2"-thick slices
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     3/4           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
     3/4           cup  dried currants
     1/2           cup  drained capers
  2               cans  diced tomatoes in juice - (14 1/2 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  fusilli pasta
  1                cup  freshly-grated pecorino Romano cheese
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh basil

Place eggplant slices on large rimmed baking sheet.  Sprinkle with salt.  Let stand over 20 minutes.  Turn eggplant slices over.  Sprinkle with salt.  Let stand 20 minutes longer.  Rinse eggplant.  Drain; pat fry with paper towels.  Cut eggplant into 1/2-inch cubes.  Set aside.

Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until golden, about 4 minutes.  Add garlic; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add eggplant; sautÈ until tender, about 10 minutes.  Stir in pine nuts, currants, and capers; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add tomatoes with juices; bring to simmer.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but firm enough to bite.  Drain.  Return pasta to pot.  Add eggplant mixture, 1/4 cup cheese, and basil.  Toss to combine.  Transfer to large bowl.  Serve, passing remaining cheese separately.

This recipe yields 8 first-course or 6 main-course servings.

Comments:  Donít skip the first step of salting the eggplant slices; it draws out excess moisture so that the eggplant will absorb less oil and stay firm when cooked.

Place eggplant slices on large rimmed baking sheet.  Sprinkle with salt.  Let stand over 20 minutes.  Turn eggplant slices over.  Sprinkle with salt.  Let stand 20 minutes longer.  Rinse eggplant.  Drain; pat fry with paper towels.  Cut eggplant into 1/2-inch cubes.  Set aside.

Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until golden, about 4 minutes.  Add garlic; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add eggplant; sautÈ until tender, about 10 minutes.  Stir in pine nuts, currants, and capers; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add tomatoes with juices; bring to simmer.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but firm enough to bite.  Drain.  Return pasta to pot.  Add eggplant mixture, 1/4 cup cheese, and basil.  Toss to combine.  Transfer to large bowl.  Serve, passing remaining cheese separately.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 first-course or 6 main-course servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Donít skip the first step of salting the eggplant slices; it draws out excess moisture so that the eggplant will absorb less oil and stay firm when cooked.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  tomatoes -- halved, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1                cup  chopped green onions
                        = (white and pale green parts only)
  7             ounces  feta cheese -- crumbled
  6        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh dill
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  12            ounces  penne pasta

Mix first 6 ingredients in large bowl.  Set tomato mixture aside.

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain.  Add hot pasta to tomato mixture and toss to coat.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  For this warm-weather dish, a salsa cruda ‡ la Grec -- or uncooked Greek-style sauce -- is combined with hot pasta and served at once.  Be sure to use the ripest, juiciest tomatoes you can find, preferably from a farmers' market or your own backyard.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced seeded canned chipotle chilies -- see * Note
  2          teaspoons  fresh lime juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  8                     large ears corn -- husked
                        Lime wedges -- for serving

* Note:  Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat.  Add minced chipotles, fresh lime juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Reduce heat to low and cook chipotle butter 1 minute to blend flavors.  Place ears of corn on baking sheet.  Brush corn all over with chipotle butter.  (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead.  Cover corn and refrigerate.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Grill corn until cooked through and blackened in spots, turning frequently, about 6 minutes.  Serve corn with lime wedges.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This recipe has a nice balance of sweet and spicy flavors, and a drizzle of lime juice provides tang.  Serve the corn and the "Hearts Of Romaine With Roquefort And Toasted Pecans" salad (see recipe) with burgers, and check collection for potato salad suggestions.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  plain yogurt
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  1           teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  2                     eggplants - (abt 1 lb ea) -- cut crosswise
                        into 1"-thick rounds
     1/4           cup  oriental sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  coriander seeds -- cracked

Mix first 5 ingredients in medium bowl; season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Rub eggplant rounds on both sides with sesame oil.  Sprinkle with coriander, salt, and pepper.  Grill until slightly charred, about 6 minutes per side.

Arrange eggplant rounds on platter.  Serve with yogurt-mint sauce.

Comments:  The sauce is a twist on raita, the cooling yogurt side dish served with spicy foods.  Like all the best buffet dishes, the eggplant is equally good warm or at room temperature.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)
                        = (or sweet Sherry)
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  unseasoned rice vinegar
     1/4           cup  oriental sesame oil
     1/4           cup  minced garlic - (abt 15 cloves)
  2              large  green onions -- chopped
  5             pounds  Korean-style short ribs -- see * Note
                        Chopped Spinach With Toasted Sesame Seeds -- (see recipe)

* Note:  Beef chuck flanken, cut 1/3- to 1/2-inch thick across bones; about 20 pieces.

Combine first 7 ingredients in medium bowl; whisk to blend well.  Pour into heavy jumbo resealable plastic bag.  Add ribs; seal bag.  Turn bag over several times to coat ribs evenly.  Refrigerate overnight, turning bag occasionally.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Drain ribs; discard marinade.  Working in batches, grill ribs until browned and cooked to medium-rare, about 3 minutes per side.  Mound ribs on platter; surround with chopped spinach and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  In a Korean home or restaurant, grilled ribs (kalbi kui) would be accompanied by the spicy pickled cabbage called kimchi.  It's available in the refrigerated foods section of some supermarkets and at Korean and Asian markets.  For the ribs, have the butcher cut the flanken across the bones into 1/3- to 1/2-inch-thick pieces.  Begin marinating the ribs one day ahead.  What to drink: Asian lager.

                        cut lengthwise into 4 strips
  4             medium  Japanese eggplants - (abt 1 lb total) -- trimmed, each
                        cut lengthwise into 4 strips
  4             medium  red bell peppers - (abt 1 3/4 lbs total) -- stemmed, seeded,

Comments:  "I dined on the most sumptuous grilled radicchio salad at The Dish Bistro and Wine Bar the last time I was in Tucson," writes Cindy Shafer of Huntington Beach, California.  "Please get the recipe -- I must have it."

Yellow and green beans, and artichoke hearts are grilled along with the radicchio in this recipe.  Serve the salad while the vegetables are still warm.

                 Grilled Spareribs With Cherry Cola Glaze

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cans  cherry cola (12 oz ea) -- flat
  2               cups  cherry jam or preserves
     2/3           cup  Dijon mustard with horseradish
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  malt vinegar
                        = (or apple cider vinegar)
  1         tablespoon  hot pepper sauce
  7 1/4         pounds  well-trimmed pork spareribs - (to 7 1/2)

Boil cherry cola in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 45 minutes.  Stir in next 5 ingredients.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until mixture is reduced to 2 1/2 cups, stirring occasionally, about 35 minutes.  Transfer glaze to large bowl.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Cover; chill.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

Position racks in top and bottom thirds of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Sprinkle ribs with salt and pepper.  Wrap each rib rack tightly in foil, enclosing completely.  Divide foil packets between 2 rimmed baking sheets.  Bake until ribs are very tender, switching positions of baking sheets halfway through baking, about 2 hours total.  Cool ribs slightly in foil.  Pour off any fat from foil packets.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Keep covered in foil packets and refrigerate.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before continuing.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-low heat).  Cut each rib rack between bones into individual ribs.  Set aside 1 cup glaze.  Add ribs to bowl with remaining glaze and toss to coat.  Grill ribs until brown and glazed, turning to prevent burning, about 5 minutes total.  Serve, passing reserved glaze separately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Before using the cherry cola, pour it into a bowl and allow it to stand at room temperature until no longer effervescent, about four hours.  Start with a relish platter, then serve the spareribs with the "State Fair Potato Salad" (see recipe) and corn on the cob.

What to drink:  Tall glasses of iced tea or frosty mugs of lager.

            Grilled Tomato, Basil, And Goat Cheese Sandwiches

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           16 ounce  French-bread baguette
     2/3           cup  olive oil
  8              large  garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  chopped mixed fresh herbs
                        = (such as tarragon, thyme, and rosemary)
     3/4           cup  soft fresh goat cheese
                        = (plain, peppered, or herbed)
  4              large  plum tomatoes -- thinly sliced
                        into rounds
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped pitted
                        Mediterranean olives

Prepare barbecue (medium heat).  Cut baguette crosswise in half.  Cut each half lengthwise in half to form 4 pieces total.  Combine oil, garlic, and herbs in small bowl.  Brush all cut sides of bread with half of oil mixture.

Grill bread, cut-sides down, until lightly toasted, about 1 minute.  Remove from grill.  Quickly spread cut sides of toast with goat cheese.  Top with tomatoes and olives, dividing equally.  Drizzle remaining oil mixture on top.

Return open-face sandwiches to grill.  Cook until bottom sides are toasted, cheese melts, and tomatoes begin to soften, about 3 minutes.  Cut each sandwich diagonally in half and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Play off the ProvenÁal flavors by passing an arugula salad tossed with red wine vinaigrette.  Sliced peaches topped with honey and sour cream would make a great finale.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  purchased egg salad - (abt 2 cups)
  6             ounces  smoked ham -- cut 1/2" dice
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon
                        Mayonnaise -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     hero rolls or kaiser rolls -- split horizontally
  1                     red bell pepper -- sliced thin rings
  4              large  romaine lettuce leaves

Mix egg salad, smoked ham, green onions, and tarragon in medium bowl.  If the egg salad seems dry, stir in additional mayonnaise by tablespoonfuls.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Divide egg-salad mixture among bottom halves of rolls.  Top with bell pepper rings, lettuce leaves, and top halves of rolls.  Cut each sandwich in half and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Serve with potato chips, a heap of tangy coleslaw, and some sweet gherkins.  Finish with strawberry ice cream and chocolate cookies.  By the way, the filling for these quick sandwiches is delicious on toasted English muffins for breakfast.

        Hickory-Grilled Rib-Eye Steaks With Bacon-Molasses Butter

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     thick bacon slices
     1/3           cup  mild-flavored (light) molasses
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick) -- room temperature
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  hickory wood chips -- soaked 30 minutes,
                        and drained
  6                     beef rib-eye steaks, abt 1" thick

Position rack in top third of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Line small baking sheet with foil.  Arrange bacon slices on foil; brush bacon with all of molasses, then sprinkle with pepper.  Bake until bacon is cooked through but not crisp, about 15 minutes.

Transfer bacon to work surface; cool.  Chop bacon; transfer to small bowl.  Add butter and stir to blend.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  When coals are white, spread wood chips in 8- by 8-inch disposable aluminum foil pan; place pan directly atop coals.  Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper.  When chips are smoking, place steaks on grill rack.  Cover grill and cook steaks to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Transfer steaks to plates.  Spoon bacon-molasses butter atop each and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Sweet cherry tomatoes make an easy appetizer.  What to drink: Top off glasses of cold lemonade with a splash of bourbon, and garnish with fresh mint sprigs.  For wine drinkers, offer a California Pinot Noir.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  uncooked shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  4          teaspoons  fresh lime juice
  2          teaspoons  jerk seasoning
                        = (or Caribbean-style seasoning blend)
     3/4           cup  diced cantaloupe
     3/4           cup  diced honeydew melon
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/4           cup  diced red onion
  4                     lime wedges

Prepare barbecue (medium heat).  Toss shrimp, oil, 2 teaspoons lime juice, and jerk seasoning blend in medium bowl.  Let marinate 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, toss cantaloupe, honeydew, cilantro, red onion, and remaining 2 teaspoons lime juice in medium bowl.  Season salsa to taste with salt and pepper.

Thread shrimp onto metal skewers.  Grill until opaque in center, occasionally brushing with marinade, about 5 minutes.  Serve with salsa and lime wedges.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  A lightly dressed salad of baby greens would complement this entrÈe nicely; serve rum-drizzled grilled pound cake slices afterward.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  chilled solid vegetable shortening -- cut 1/2" pieces
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  orange juice
  4        tablespoons  ice water -- more or less
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pound  trimmed lean leg of lamb -- cut 1/2" pieces
                        = (or 2 lbs lamb shoulder chops, boned,
                        and fat trimmed)
  2             medium  sweet onions -- halved, thinly
                        sliced
                        = (such as Vidalia or Maui)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/4      teaspoon  crumbled saffron threads
  4             ounces  sobrasada -- casings removed,
                        and finely chopped, see * Note
                        = (or sweet Spanish chorizo)
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend

* Note:  Sobrasada is available from La EspaÒola (310-539-0455; donajuana.com) or from La Tienda (888-472-1022; tienda.com).

For Crust:  Blend flour and salt in processor.  Add shortening; using on/off turns, cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Gradually add olive oil, orange juice, and 3 tablespoons ice water; process mixture until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.

Gather dough together; divide in half.  Form each dough half into smooth ball; flatten each into disk.  Place on work surface; cover with plastic wrap.  Let stand at room temperature while making filling.

For Filling:  Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat.  Sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper.  Add lamb to skillet and sautÈ until brown, about 4 minutes.  Transfer to bowl.

Add onions and garlic to skillet and sautÈ 2 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until onions are very tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.

Return lamb to skillet.  Add wine and saffron; simmer until liquid is reduced by half, about 4 minutes.  Stir in sobrasada and sautÈ 2 minutes.  Cool filling completely.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Roll out each dough disk between 2 sheets of parchment paper to 12-inch round.

Transfer 1 dough round to ungreased rimmed baking sheet.  Spread lamb filling over dough round, leaving 2-inch plain border.  Cover filling with second dough round.  Roll up edges, pressing together to seal well.  Using small sharp knife, cut small X in center of top crust to allow steam to escape.  Brush crust with beaten egg.

Bake pie until crust is golden brown, about 35 minutes.  Let cool 15 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 appetizer or 6 main-course servings.

Comments:  Lard is the fat of choice on Majorca, but here we have substituted solid vegetable shortening in the crust, with equally delicious results.  For a truly authentic version of this dish, use sobrasada, a sausage that tastes very much like Spanish chorizo but is much softer.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1           envelope  dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/4           cup  whole milk
  3              large  egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2       packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  3              large  eggs
     2/3           cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        Strawberry Compote -- (see recipe)

For Crust:  Butter and flour 10-inch-diameter springform pan.  Combine flour, sugar, yeast, grated lemon peel, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in processor; blend 5 seconds.  Add chilled butter and cut in, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add whole milk, egg yolks, and vanilla extract and blend until soft clumps form.

Using floured hands, gather dough into ball.  Press dough over bottom and 1 inch up sides of prepared pan.  Cover pan tightly with plastic wrap.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until slightly puffy, about 2 hours 15 minutes.

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, sugar, and flour in large bowl until well blended.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time.  Add whipping cream, dark rum, grated lemon peel, and vanilla extract; beat until filling is smooth.  Transfer filling to crust (filling may be higher in pan than sides of crust).

Bake cheesecake until set in center and puffed at edges, about 40 minutes.  Cool cheesecake in pan on rack 15 minutes.  Cut around pan sides; release sides.  Cool cheesecake completely.  (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead.  Let cheesecake stand at cool room temperature.)

Cut cheesecake into wedges and serve with Strawberry Compote.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  From Majorca, Spain - When this dessert is made on Majorca, rum-soaked raisins are baked on top.  Here the filling is flavored with rum; then the cake is served with a strawberry compote.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  sweet paprika -- see * Note
                        = (preferably Spanish smoked paprika)
  3               cans  vegetable broth - (14 oz ea)
                        = (or low-salt chicken broth)
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped fresh spinach leaves
  8             slices  country-style wheat bread
                        = (4" by 3" by 1/2" ea)
                        Oil-cured black olives
                        Sliced radishes

* Note:  Available from La Tienda (888-472-1022; tienda.com) or from The Spanish Table (206-682-2827; tablespan.com).

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large ovenproof pot over high heat.  Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic; sautÈ until golden and beginning to soften, about 7 minutes.

Stir in cabbage and cauliflower; sautÈ 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes, parsley, thyme, and rosemary; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Simmer 5 minutes.

Add paprika and stir 30 seconds.  Add broth and bring to boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.

Serve stew from pot.  Pass olives and sliced radishes alongside.

This recipe yields 4 main-course servings.

Comments:  There are many different versions of this traditional island dish, which is known as sopas mallorquÌnas.  Spanish smoked paprika (pimentÛn) is distinctive and worth seeking out for its unique flavor.

              Maltese Chicken With Red Wine And Honey Gravy

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  chicken - (abt 4 lbs) -- cut 8 pieces
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  dry red wine
                        = (such as Zinfandel)
  2        tablespoons  honey
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh parsley

Rinse chicken and pat dry.  Heat oil in heavy large deep skillet over medium heat.  Add chicken to skillet.  Cover and cook until golden brown, about 15 minutes per side.

Turn chicken skin-side up; continue to cook uncovered until cooked through, about 10 minutes longer.  Transfer chicken to platter; tent with foil to keep warm.

Pour off excess fat from skillet.  Add wine and honey.  Simmer until reduced to 1/3 cup, stirring often, about 8 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Pour sauce over chicken.  Sprinkle with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  At the beach in Malta, the locals eat fried rabbit, rather than burgers, with fries.  I've adapted the recipe by using chicken and sweetening the gravy with a touch of honey.

Comments:  "Out of necessity, I've developed a love for quick cooking," writes Judy Wilkins of Tyler, Texas.  "Between my musician's hours (nights and weekends as an accompanist for local choral groups) and teacher's hours (daytime piano lessons), my schedule can be nuts.  When I do have the chance to cook dinner on a weeknight, whatever I make can't take too long -- and it has to taste great."

Comments:  &quot;Out of necessity, I&apos;ve developed a love for quick cooking,&quot; writes Judy Wilkins of Tyler, Texas.  &quot;Between my musician&apos;s hours (nights and weekends as an accompanist for local choral groups) and teacher&apos;s hours (daytime piano lessons), my schedule can be nuts.  When I do have the chance to cook dinner on a weeknight, whatever I make can&apos;t take too long -- and it has to taste great.&quot;

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2               cups  chopped onions
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (14 1/2 oz)
  1            package  frozen artichoke hearts - (8 oz) -- thawed, and
                        the hearts cut in half
     1/2           cup  chopped drained oil-packed
                        sun-dried tomatoes
     1/3           cup  chopped pitted Kalamata olives
                        = (or other brine-cured black olives)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12            ounces  linguine
  1            package  crumbled feta cheese - (7 oz)
     3/4           cup  chopped fresh basil

Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions, garlic, rosemary, and oregano.  SautÈ until onions are tender, about 5 minutes.

Add diced tomatoes with juices, artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, and olives.  Simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with pepper.

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.  Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.  Return pasta to same pot.

Add sauce; toss over medium heat until sauce coats pasta, adding reserved cooking liquid by 1/4 cupfuls to moisten if pasta is dry.  Mix in 3/4 cup cheese and 1/2 cup basil.  Transfer pasta to bowl.  Sprinkle with remaining cheese and 1/4 cup basil.

This recipe yields 4 main-course servings.

Comments:  "For me, cooking is a very relaxing and creative process -- I just wish I had more time for it," writes Katherine Burk of Seattle, Washington.  "I make a point of fixing dinner during the week, but with my hectic schedule (I work in information technology), there are some nights I'm too wiped out to attempt anything more complicated than a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Usually, though, I can put something together in under thirty minutes."

A fast, colorful, and delicious pasta dish loaded with goodies.

           Porterhouse Steaks With Arugula And Parmesan Cheese

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     porterhouse steaks, 2 to 2 1/2" thk -- (abt 3 lbs ea)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5             ounces  arugula - (abt 5 cups packed)
  1                cup  Parmesan cheese shavings

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Rub steaks with oil and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.  Grill until steaks are brown and crusty and thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 120 to 125 degrees for medium-rare, turning every five minutes, about 25 minutes total.  Using tongs, transfer steaks to cutting board; let steaks rest for 10 minutes.

Coarsely chop enough arugula to measure 2 cups and set aside.  Arrange remaining arugula on platter and sprinkle with oil, salt, and pepper.  Cut meat away from bones.  Slice meat thinly and arrange atop arugula.  Sprinkle reserved chopped arugula and cheese shavings over steak.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Tradition dictates that these Florentine-style steaks be cooked over a grate in a fireplace, but this recipe translates very well to an American-style outdoor grill.  Use a vegetable peeler to cut thin strips from a wedge of Parmesan to make the cheese shavings.

What to drink:  Chianti Classico.

Comments:  Tradition dictates that these Florentine-style steaks be cooked over a grate in a fireplace, but this recipe translates very well to an American-style outdoor grill.  Use a vegetable peeler to cut thin strips from a wedge of Parmesan to make the cheese shavings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  russet potatoes -- peeled, quartered
  1 1/4           cups  freshly-grated pecorino Sardo cheese
                        = (or pecorino Romano cheese)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed
  1            package  wonton wrappers - (12 oz)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  2             pounds  tomatoes -- chopped

Cook potatoes in large saucepan of boiling salted water until very tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain.  Return potatoes to pan and mash.  Cool potatoes.  Stir in 1 cup cheese and mint.  Season filling to taste with salt and pepper.

Line 2 baking sheets with plastic wrap; sprinkle with flour.  Stack 6 wonton wrappers on work surface.  Trim edges of wonton stack to form 2 3/4-inch square, preferably using scallop-edged pastry wheel cutter.  Repeat stacking and trimming with remaining wrappers.

Place half of wrappers on work surface.  Place 1 tablespoon filling in center of each.  Brush edges of wrappers lightly with water.  Top each with another wrapper; press on edges to seal well.  Place ravioli on prepared baking sheets.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Sprinkle lightly with flour.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill.)

Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add garlic and stir 30 seconds.  Add tomatoes and sautÈ until heated through, about 5 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer 1/2 cup sauce to large shallow serving bowl.

Working in batches, cook ravioli in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, about 3 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer ravioli to bowl with sauce.  Spoon remaining sauce over.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese and serve.

This recipe yields 4 first-course servings.

Comments:  Purchased wonton wrappers stand in for fresh pasta in this easy recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray -- as needed
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  8          teaspoons  whole milk -- more or less
  1                cup  whole almonds - (abt 5 oz) -- toasted, cooled
     1/2           cup  walnut pieces - (abt 2 oz) -- toasted, cooled
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut 1/2" pieces,
                        and at room temperature
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lemon peel
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated orange peel
  1           teaspoon  aniseed
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  2              large  egg yolks
  1                cup  golden raisins

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Spray 2 large baking sheets with nonstick spray.

Place powdered sugar in small bowl.  Mix in enough milk by teaspoonfuls (about 5) to form thick, smooth glaze.  Cover glaze; set aside.

Combine almonds and walnuts in processor.  Using on/off turns, blend until most nuts are reduced to 1/4-inch pieces (some will be very finely ground).

Combine flour, butter, 2/3 cup sugar, citrus peels, aniseed, salt, spices, and baking soda in large bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat at low speed until fine meal forms.  Add egg yolks and beat until clumps form.  Add nuts and raisins.  Beat until dough holds together, adding milk by teaspoonfuls (about 3) if dough is dry.  Knead dough briefly to compact.

Roll out 1/3 of dough on lightly floured surface to 1/4- to 1/3-inch-thick rectangle.  Cut lengthwise into 2-inch-wide strips.  Cut each strip on diagonal into 1 1/2- to 2-inch diamonds.  Transfer diamonds to baking sheet.  Gather dough scraps and reserve.  Repeat with remaining dough. Reroll scraps, cutting out more cookies, until all dough is used.

Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until golden, about 17 minutes.  Spoon generous 1/2 teaspoon glaze over each hot cookie and spread with back of spoon to coat.  Let cookies stand on baking sheets until completely cool and glaze is set.  (Can be prepared 1 week ahead.  Store airtight between sheets of waxed paper at room temperature.)

This recipe yields makes about 30 cookies.

Comments:  From Sardinia, Italy - Diamond-shaped papassinas are especially good with a cup of coffee.  The flavor of these cookies gets even better after a few days.

Comments:  "Before we got married, my husband, Gregg, and I were working at a small restaurant, and it kept us ridiculously busy," writes Anita L. S. Eberhardt of Beverly, Massachusetts.  "Now that we have both left the restaurant business, we have a much saner schedule, although raising two kids certainly keeps us busy.  My experience as a professional cook makes it easier for me to throw together a quick meal, which is good because I'm not a convenience-food mom: I try to limit fat and salt, emphasize fruits and vegetables, and use a minimum of prepared foods."

Comments:  &quot;Before we got married, my husband, Gregg, and I were working at a small restaurant, and it kept us ridiculously busy,&quot; writes Anita L. S. Eberhardt of Beverly, Massachusetts.  &quot;Now that we have both left the restaurant business, we have a much saner schedule, although raising two kids certainly keeps us busy.  My experience as a professional cook makes it easier for me to throw together a quick meal, which is good because I&apos;m not a convenience-food mom: I try to limit fat and salt, emphasize fruits and vegetables, and use a minimum of prepared foods.&quot;

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 2/3           cups  all purpose flour
     1/4           cup  polenta (coarse cornmeal)
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel - (packed)
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  14       tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (1 3/4 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/3           cup  ice water -- or more if needed
                        === FILLING AND BAKING ===
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
  4             medium  nectarines -- each pitted, and
                        cut into 16 slices
  1                     basket blackberries - (1/2 pint)
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                     egg - (for glaze) -- beaten to blend
                        Raw sugar crystals -- as needed
                        = (can be found in the baking aisle)
                        Peach preserves -- heated
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

For crust:  Combine first 5 ingredients in processor and blend 5 seconds.  Add butter; using on/off turns, blend just until butter is reduced to pea-size pieces.  (To ensure a flaky crust, be careful not to overwork the butter.)  Add 1/3 cup ice water.  Using on/off turns, blend until dough comes together in moist clumps, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap; chill at least 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Chill.  Let soften slightly at room temperature before rolling out.)

Roll out dough on lightly floured sheet of parchment paper to 14-inch round, turning dough occasionally to prevent sticking.  Slide rimless baking sheet under parchment.  Transfer dough on parchment to refrigerator.  Chill until dough firms slightly, about 30 minutes.

For filling and baking:  Stir sugar and cornstarch in medium bowl to blend.  Mix in fruit and vanilla.  Let stand until juices are released, stirring fruit occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Transfer baking sheet with dough to work surface.  Let stand 8 minutes to allow dough to soften slightly if too firm to fold.  Spoon fruit and juices into center of dough.  Arrange fruit in even 10-inch-diameter layer in center.  Brush 2-inch border of dough with egg glaze.  Lift about 2 inches of dough border and pinch to form vertical seam.  Continue around tart, pinching seam every 2 inches to form standing border.  Fold border down over fruit (center 6 inches of fruit remain uncovered).  Brush folded border with egg glaze; sprinkle with raw sugar.

Place baking sheet with tart in oven.  Bake until crust is golden brown and fruit filling is bubbling at edges, about 55 minutes.  Remove from oven; slide large metal spatula under tart to loosen from parchment.  Brush fruit with preserves.  Slide tart onto rack.  Cool 45 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature with ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                 Skillet Corn Bread With Red Bell Pepper

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  red bell pepper
                        Solid vegetable shortening -- as needed
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  canned creamed corn
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted, and
                        cooled slightly
  1              large  egg
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  2                     green onions -- trimmed, sliced

Char bell pepper over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes.  Peel and seed pepper; cut into 1/3-inch-wide strips.  Set aside.

Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 400 degrees.  Generously coat 10-inch-diameter ovenproof skillet with vegetable shortening.  Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt in large bowl to blend.  Whisk buttermilk, creamed corn, melted butter, egg, and hot pepper sauce in medium bowl to blend.  Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients and stir just until moistened.  Transfer batter to prepared skillet.  Arrange bell pepper strips in spoke pattern atop batter.  Sprinkle with sliced green onions.

Bake corn bread until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.  Cool 15 minutes.  Serve corn bread warm from skillet.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Here's the traditional southern way to bake and serve corn bread: right in the skillet.  Using shortening to grease the pan produces a nice, brown crust.

     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  8                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  3             pounds  fresh Manila clams -- scrubbed

Serve these clams with crusty bread and a salad to round out the meal.

Comments:  &quot;Can you obtain the recipe for littleneck clams from Antonio&apos;s Restaurant in New Bedford?&quot;  writes Michelle Dooley of Hanover, Massachusetts.  &quot;I read about the restaurant in your magazine, and now that I&apos;ve been there, I&apos;d like to try my hand at preparing this dish.&quot;

  1 1/2           cups  chopped red onion
  1                can  diced mild green chilies - (4 oz)
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped jalapeÒo chili with seeds
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin

Comments:  "For me, cooking is a very relaxing and creative process -- I just wish I had more time for it," writes Katherine Burk of Seattle, Washington.  "I make a point of fixing dinner during the week, but with my hectic schedule (I work in information technology), there are some nights I'm too wiped out to attempt anything more complicated than a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Usually, though, I can put something together -- my spicy black bean soup, for example -- in under thirty minutes."

A southwestern favorite, simplified: Most of the ingredients are pantry staples.

           Sun-Dried-Tomato Burgers With Balsamic-Glazed Onions

Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  ground beef
  1 1/3           cups  chopped drained sun-dried
                        tomatoes packed in oil -- 6 tbspns oil
                        reserved
     1/2           cup  grated onion
  3        tablespoons  dried basil
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3                     onions -- halved, and
                        thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  8                     hamburger buns -- toasted

Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Mix ground beef, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, 2 tablespoons reserved tomato oil, grated onion, dried basil, ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in large bowl.  Form mixture into 8 patties.  Transfer patties to prepared baking sheet.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead.  Keep chilled.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Heat remaining 4 tablespoons reserved tomato oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add sliced onions and sautÈ until soft and starting to brown, about 10 minutes.  Add balsamic vinegar.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Simmer until onions are deep brown, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat.  (Can be prepared 1 hour ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.  Wrap in foil and reheat on grill 10 minutes before serving.)

Grill burgers until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.  Place 1 burger on bottom half of each bun.  Top with onions and bun tops and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A mixture of ground sirloin and ground chuck works best for these.  (Don't use lean or extra-lean meat -- the burgers won't be nearly as juicy.)  Cold beer is the perfect accompaniment, so put bottles of Indian pale ale on ice; for guests who prefer wine, pour a fruity Beaujolais.

Grill burgers until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.  Place 1 burger on bottom half of each bun.  Top with onions and bun tops and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A mixture of ground sirloin and ground chuck works best for these.  (Don&apos;t use lean or extra-lean meat -- the burgers won&apos;t be nearly as juicy.)  Cold beer is the perfect accompaniment, so put bottles of Indian pale ale on ice; for guests who prefer wine, pour a fruity Beaujolais.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine
  1 1/2           cups  distilled white vinegar
  1                cup  balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  sugar
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled, crushed
  10                    whole cloves
  2                     bay leaves
  1 1/2           cups  fresh whole basil leaves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  whole black peppercorns
  2             pounds  small cipolline onions -- blanched, peeled
                        = (or small boiling onions)

Place all ingredients except onions in heavy large pot.  Bring to boil over high heat.  Add onions; reduce heat to medium and simmer until crisp-tender, about 10 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer onions to jar with lid.

Increase heat to high and boil until liquid is reduced to 1 3/4 cups, about 20 minutes.  Pour liquid over onions and cool.

Cover onion mixture and refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 1 week and up to 1 month.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Zia Maria is a simple but delightful restaurant in Alghero, a popular tourist resort on a part of Sardinia's west coast known as the Coral Riviera.  The dining room is very basic; a large fireplace and some antique cooking equipment are the only things to distract you from the traditional Sardinian menu.  But that's a good thing, because once you start in on pickled artichokes and mushrooms, wild boar in sweet-and-sour broth, or ricotta ravioli with tomato sauce, you'll appreciate having few distractions.  Each dish, like these tangy onions from the restaurant's selection of antipasti, is cooked and presented in straightforward fashion.

                        === GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  seedless unsweetened tamarind paste
                        = (available at Indian markets)
     1/2           cup  fresh orange juice

  1           teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
                        === APRICOT RELISH ===
  2               cups  chopped dried apricots
  6        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  minced seeded red jalapeÒo chilies
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  cracked coriander seeds
  2             pounds  boneless leg of lamb -- cut 1/2" pieces
                        = (or 4 lbs lamb shoulder chops, fat
                        trimmed, meat cut into 1/2" pieces)
  1              large  red onion -- cut 1/2" cubes
  20                    twelve-inch metal skewers

For glaze:  Bring first 4 ingredients to boil in small saucepan over high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer until reduced to 1 cup, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in lime juice.

For apricot relish:  Mix apricots and next 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Season relish to taste with salt and pepper.  (Glaze and relish can be made 1 day ahead; cover separately and chill.  Bring relish to room temperature.  Stir glaze over medium heat until heated through.)

Thread lamb and onion pieces onto skewers, using about 6 onion and lamb pieces per skewer.  (Skewers can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Sprinkle skewers with salt and pepper.  Grill lamb to desired doneness, turning once and basting with glaze during last minute of grilling, about 2 minutes total for medium-rare.  Transfer skewers to platter.  Serve with relish.

This recipe yields 6 appetizer servings.

What to drink:  A big red with lots of fruit, such as a California Zinfandel; an off-dry white with rich fruit, such as an Alsatian Pinot Gris; or pale ale.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
  2               cups  plain yogurt
  2        tablespoons  ground coriander
  2        tablespoons  mild paprika
  1 1/2    tablespoons  ground cumin
  1 1/2    tablespoons  ground ginger
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
  6                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (7 to 8 oz ea)
                        === CHUTNEY ===
  3               cups  chopped seeded tomatoes - (abt 1 1/4 lbs)
     3/4           cup  chopped red onion
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh mint
  3        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For marinade:  Whisk yogurt and next 9 ingredients in large bowl to blend.  Add chicken and turn to coat.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

For chutney:  Combine all ingredients in medium bowl.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Chutney can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Brush grill with oil.  Transfer marinade-coated chicken to barbecue grill.  Grill chicken until cooked through, about 7 minutes per side.  Transfer chicken to cutting board.  Cut crosswise on diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Transfer to platter.  Serve with chutney.

This recipe yields 6 main-course servings.

Comments:  Not only is the yogurt marinade an excellent tenderizer, but it imparts a nice, mild tang as well.  Begin marinating the chicken one day in advance.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COFFEE GELATO ===
  3        tablespoons  dark rum
  1 1/2    tablespoons  instant coffee granules
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1              large  pinch salt
  2 1/4           cups  whole milk
                        === CHOCOLATE-ALMOND GELATO ===
     1/2           cup  slivered almonds - (abt 2 oz) -- toasted, cooled
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  whole milk
  3             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
                        === ZABAGLIONE GELATO ===
  1 1/3           cups  whole milk
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  imported dry Marsala
  1              large  pinch salt

For Coffee Gelato:  Mix rum and instant coffee in small bowl until coffee dissolves.

Whisk sugar, cornstarch, and salt in heavy medium saucepan until no cornstarch lumps remain.  Gradually whisk in milk.  Cook over medium heat until mixture thickens and boils, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes.

Remove from heat; whisk in coffee mixture.  Press plastic wrap onto surface of gelato base.  Refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours.

Transfer gelato base to ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer gelato to container; cover and freeze.

For Chocolate-Almond Gelato:  Combine almonds, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in processor; blend until nuts are finely ground.

Transfer nut mixture to heavy medium saucepan.  Gradually whisk in milk.  Whisk over medium heat until mixture thickens and boils, about 5 minutes.

Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and whisk until melted.  Mix in almond extract.  Press plastic wrap onto surface of gelato base.  Refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours.

Transfer gelato base to ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer gelato to container; cover and freeze.

For Zabaglione Gelato:  Combine 1/3 cup milk, egg yolks, sugar, Marsala, and salt in medium stainless steel bowl; whisk to blend.  Place bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water).  Whisk until thick and thermometer registers 160 degrees, about 5 minutes.

Remove bowl from over water.  Whisk in remaining 1 cup milk.  Press plastic wrap onto surface of gelato base.  Chill until cold, about 3 hours.

Transfer gelato base to ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer gelato to container; cover and freeze.

(All gelati can be made 3 days ahead.  Keep frozen.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  From Sicily, Italy - In Sicily, gelato usually doesn't contain any cream or eggs.  The coffee and chocolate-almond flavors here are true to tradition; the zabaglione is enriched with eggs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cans  light tuna in olive oil - (6 oz ea) -- undrained
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  canned low-salt chicken broth
  5                     anchovy fillets -- drained
  1           teaspoon  reserved oil from anchovies
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
  2          teaspoons  drained capers -- plus
     1/4           cup  drained capers
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1            package  baby spinach leaves - (6 oz)
  2 1/2         pounds  roast turkey breast -- sliced
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh parsley

Blend tuna with oil, mayonnaise, broth, anchovies with oil, lemon juice, lemon peel, and 2 teaspoons capers in processor until smooth, about 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

Arrange spinach on platter.  Arrange turkey atop spinach.  Pour sauce atop turkey, smoothing surface with knife.  Sprinkle with parsley and 1/4 cup capers.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This is based on a classic Italian dish, vitello tonnato, in which chilled slices of veal are topped with a puree of tuna, anchovies, capers, and lemon.  Here, the veal is replaced by sliced turkey, and the sauce can be made up to a day ahead.  (Buy good-quality turkey breast from the deli section of the market.)

                        Velvety Chilled Corn Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               ears  fresh corn -- husked
  6               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth - (about)
  3                     shallots -- chopped
  1                     onion -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  crËme fraÓche or sour cream
     1/4           cup  minced English hothouse cucumber
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives

Using cleaver or heavy large knife, cut each ear of corn crosswise in half.  Place corn in heavy large pot.  Add 5 cups broth, shallots, and onion; bring to boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until corn is very tender, about 25 minutes.  Using tongs, transfer corn to large bowl to cool; reserve broth.

Cut corn kernels off cobs.  Return 4 cups corn kernels to broth (reserve any remaining corn for another use).  Working in batches, puree soup in blender until very smooth.  Strain soup through fine sieve set over large bowl, pressing on solids with back of spoon; discard solids.  Mix in enough additional chicken broth to thin soup to consistency of heavy cream.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate soup until cold, about 4 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

Ladle soup into 6 bowls.  Top each with dollop of crËme fraÓche.  Sprinkle with cucumber and chives and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This elegant first course is ideal for entertaining, because everything can be prepared a day ahead (just chop up all the toppings and refrigerate them until ready to use).

           Warm Peach Shortcakes With Bourbon-Brown Sugar Cream

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
  3          teaspoons  sugar
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" pieces
     1/2           cup  solid vegetable shortening -- frozen, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
     2/3           cup  chilled buttermilk
  1              large  egg
  1              large  egg white
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped pecans - (abt 2 1/2 oz)
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  bourbon
                        Brown Sugar Peaches -- (see recipe)
  6              large  strawberries

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 425 degrees.  Whisk flour, 6 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in medium bowl to blend.  Add butter and shortening and rub in with fingertips until coarse meal forms.

Whisk buttermilk and 1 egg to blend in small bowl.  Add to flour mixture and stir until moist clumps form.  Gather dough together; turn out onto floured work surface and knead gently just until dough holds together, about 5 turns (dough will be moist).

Pat dough into 9- by 6-inch rectangle; cut into six 3-inch squares.  Transfer squares to heavy ungreased baking sheet, spacing apart.  (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead.  Cover tightly and refrigerate.)

Whisk egg white in small bowl until foamy.  Add pecans and stir to blend.  Spread pecan mixture over top of biscuits, dividing equally.  Sprinkle squares with remaining 3 teaspoons sugar.  Bake biscuits until puffed and light golden, about 18 minutes.  Cool biscuits 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, beat whipping cream, brown sugar, and bourbon in medium bowl until soft peaks form.

Using serrated knife, cut warm biscuits horizontally in half.  Place 1 bottom half on each of 6 plates.  Top with Brown Sugar Peaches.  Spoon generous dollop of bourbon whipped cream atop each.  Cover with biscuit tops.  Garnish each with dollop of bourbon whipped cream and 1 strawberry; serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Peaches sweetened with brown sugar fill pecan-studded biscuits -- a southern-style twist on an all-American favorite.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4         pounds  yellow tomatoes -- halved
  1                cup  chopped seeded peeled cucumber
  1                cup  chopped yellow bell pepper
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
     1/2           cup  orange juice
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  Champagne vinegar
                        = (or white wine vinegar)
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1             medium  jalapeÒo chili with seeds -- chopped
                        = (abt 1 tbspn)
                        Cilantro Oil -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     avocado -- peeled, pitted,
                        and chopped

Squeeze tomato juices and seeds into strainer set over bowl.  Press on seeds to extract all juice.  Chop tomatoes.  Set aside 1/2 cup chopped tomatoes, 1/4 cup cucumber, and 1/4 cup bell pepper.

Combine remaining tomatoes, cucumber, and bell pepper in processor.  Add tomato juices, onion, orange juice, oil, vinegar, garlic, and jalapeÒo; process until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer soup to bowl; add reserved vegetables.  Cover and chill overnight.

Divide soup among 6 bowls.  Drizzle with Cilantro Oil.  Sprinkle with avocado.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Yellow tomatoes -- which are typically sweeter than red ones -- flavor a sunny Golden State version of the chilled summer soup.  Begin preparing this recipe one day before you plan to serve it.

Recipe By     :Chef Laurie Smith, Quisiana, Center Lovell, ME
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2         pounds  large leeks -- thinly sliced
                        = (white and pale green parts
                        only, abt 2 1/2 cups)
  8                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" rounds
  4 1/2           cups  canned low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
  2               cups  half-and-half
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh chives -- for garnish

Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add leeks and garlic; sautÈ until tender, about 6 minutes.  Add potatoes and zucchini; sautÈ 5 minutes.  Add 4 1/2 cups broth and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.  Cool 30 minutes.

Working in batches, puree soup in blender.  Transfer soup to large bowl.  Mix in half-and-half.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Before serving, thin with additional broth, if necessary.)

Ladle soup into bowl.  Sprinkle with chives and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments;  Zucchini gives a summery twist to the classic leek-and-potato soup; this new take on an old favorite is served at Quisiana.
