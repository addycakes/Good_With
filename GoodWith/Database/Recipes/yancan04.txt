  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     dried black mushrooms
  2              large  eggs
  1              pinch  salt
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  shredded cooked chicken breast
  2             pieces  pressed bean curd - (4 oz ea) -- cut thin strips
     1/2           cup  smoked ham in thin strips
  1                cup  spinach leaves
                        === FOR THE SEASONED BROTH ===
  1                cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  2        tablespoons  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Pour enough warm water over the mushrooms to cover them completely.  Let soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain.  Discard the stems and cut the caps into thin strips.

Beat the eggs together with a pinch of salt in a small bowl.  Heat a wide non-stick frying pan over medium heat until hot.  Add the oil.  Pour in the eggs and tilt the pan to coat the bottom evenly with a thin layer of egg.  Cook until the eggs are lightly browned on the bottom and set on top, about 1 minute.  Carefully turn the egg sheet over and cook for 5 seconds.  Slide the eggs onto a plate.

Fit the omelet into a 1-quart heat proof bowl, 6 inches in diameter and 4 inches deep so it comes up the sides and overhangs the edges.  Using the mushroom, chicken, tofu and ham, separately cover each quarter of the bottom of the omelet-lined bowl with a different ingredient.  Fill in any empty spaces with any remaining tofu.  Bring the sides of the omelet over the filling and press firmly to compact.

4.Prepare a wok for steaming.  Set the bowl into the steamer and steam until heated through, about 10 minutes.  Invert the bowl onto a large, shallow, serving bowl.  Lift the bowl carefully and with a kitchen scissors or paring knife, score the top of the omelet in a cross shape and peel back the points to reveal the filling.  Arrange the spinach around the filled omelet.

For the Seasoned Broth:  Bring the stock, rice wine, sesame oil, salt and pepper to a boil in a small saucepan.  Ladle the broth around the filled omelet and over the spinach, so it wilts the spinach.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

4.Prepare a wok for steaming.  Set the bowl into the steamer and steam until heated through, about 10 minutes.  Invert the bowl onto a large, shallow, serving bowl.  Lift the bowl carefully and with a kitchen scissors or paring knife, score the top of the omelet in a cross shape and peel back the points to reveal the filling.  Arrange the spinach around the filled omelet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Seasoned Broth:  Bring the stock, rice wine, sesame oil, salt and pepper to a boil in a small saucepan.  Ladle the broth around the filled omelet and over the spinach, so it wilts the spinach.  Serve hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     red dates -- pitted, and
                        sliced in half
  4                     maraschino cherries
  3                     dried apricots
  2                     candied kumquats -- sliced
                        = (or candied orange peel strips)
  2        tablespoons  dried cherries
  2        tablespoons  golden raisins
  1         tablespoon  toasted pine nuts
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2               cups  uncooked glutinous rice
  2 1/2           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- plus more
                        for oiling the pie plate
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  sweet lotus seed paste
                        = (or mixture of chopped 'treasures')
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water

For the Dish:  Pour enough water over the rice in a medium bowl to cover completely.  Soak for 2 hours.  Drain.

Combine the drained rice and 2 1/2 cups water in a 2-quart pot.  Cook over medium-high heat until little 'craters' form on the surface of the rice.  Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and cook until the rice is no longer firm, 15 to 20 minutes.  Scrape into a bowl and let cool.  Stir 1 tablespoon of the oil and 1/4 cup sugar into the rice.  Set aside.

Brush the bottom and sides of a heatproof 9-inch glass pie dish with vegetable oil.  Arrange the 'treasures' (dates, maraschino cherries, dried apricots, kumquats, dried cherries, raisins and pine nuts) in a decorative pattern over the bottom of the pie dish.  (If you are substituting the chopped 'treasures' for the lotus seed paste, remove and chop enough of the treasures to measure 1 cup before arranging the remaining treasures in the pie plate.)

Cover the treasures with an even layer of half the rice.  Spread the lotus seed paste (or mixed chopped treasures) over the center of rice.  Top the lotus seed paste and bottom layer of rice with an even layer of the remaining rice.  Cover the rice with a sheet of plastic wrap and press the rice down firmly with your hands to pack the ingredients tightly into the dish.

Prepare a wok for steaming.  Set the dish into the steamer and steam the pudding for 10 minutes.  Invert the pie dish onto a plate to unmold.

Heat a wide non-stick skillet over medium heat until hot.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and swirl to coat the bottom.  Slide the pudding into the pan, decorative side down.  Fry until the underside is golden, about 2 minutes.  Carefully slide the pudding onto a plate, invert it onto a second plate then slide it back into the pan.  Cook until the second side is golden, about 2 minutes.  Slide the pudding out of the pan and onto a rimmed serving plate with the decorative side up.

For the Sauce:  Bring 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water and the lemon juice to a boil in a small saucepan.  Cook, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved.  Add the dissolved cornstarch and cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens.  Pour the syrup over the warm pudding and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  dried rice vermicelli - (abt 1/2 pkg)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  vegetable oil
  1                     egg -- lightly, beaten
  2                     Chinese sausages - (abt 2 oz ea) -- cut thin strips
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced onion
  2                     fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        and caps thickly sliced
     1/2         pound  Char Siu pork -- cut thin strips
     1/2           cup  bean sprouts
  1         tablespoon  sweet red ginger -- (optional)

Add the Chinese sausage, onions and mushrooms and stir-fry until the sausage is cooked, about 2 minutes.  Add the noodles, char siu, bean sprouts, mushrooms, red ginger, soy sauce, salt and pepper.  Stir-fry until the noodles and other ingredients are warm and well combined, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.

Scoop the contents of the wok onto a serving platter.  Scatter the egg, green onion and sesame seeds over the noodles and serve immediately.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the reserved oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Crumble the ground pork into the wok, then add the onion, bay leaves, garlic and mint.  Stir-fry until the pork is browned and crumbly, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the water chestnuts and pour in the sauce; cook until the water chestnuts are heated through, about 1 minute.  Stir in the potatoes and heat through.  Pick out the bay leaves and transfer the contents of the wok to a serving platter.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     uncooked jumbo prawns -- with shells and
                        their heads intact
  1 1/4       teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR THE STUFFING ===
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
     1/4           cup  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped mushroom
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped water chestnuts
  2        tablespoons  sweet chili sauce
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped green onion
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh mint
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro
  1         tablespoon  curry paste
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
                        Cilantro sprigs -- for garnish

With kitchen shears or scissors, cut through the top shell of the prawns starting at the tail end and scoring the tail meat about 1/2 inch deep as you go.  Leave the heads intact.  Remove the sand veins and rub the meat with salt.  Let the seasoned prawns stand for 10 minutes.

For the Stuffing:  Stir the onion, garlic, mushrooms, water chestnuts, sweet chili sauce, green onion, mint, cilantro and curry paste together in a bowl until well blended.  Spoon about 2 heaping teaspoons of the stuffing along the opening of each prawn tail.  Set any remaining stuffing mixture aside.

For the Dish:  Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat until the butter is foaming.  Lay the prawns into the pan, stuffing-side down, and cook until they turn pink, 5 to 7 minutes.  Transfer the prawns to a serving plate and cover with aluminum foil, shiny-side down, to keep warm.

Scrape any remaining stuffing mixture into the pan and stir-fry over medium heat until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Pour in the wine and cook, stirring well until flavors are blended, about 1 minute.

Spoon the sauce in the pan over the prawns, garnish with the cilantro sprigs and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  boiling water
  1 1/2           cups  all purpose flour -- plus more
                        for kneading the dough
  2        tablespoons  cold water -- plus
  2          teaspoons  cold water
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  2                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        sliced thinly on the bias
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Cornstarch -- as needed

Pour the boiling water over the flour in a medium bowl and mix, using chopsticks or a fork, until combined.  Add the cold water and stir until the dough is evenly moistened.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until it is smooth and satiny, about 5 minutes.  Re-flour the surface and your hands as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking.  Return the dough to a bowl, cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for 30 minutes.

Stir the sesame oil and 1 teaspoon of the vegetable oil together in a small bowl.  Set aside.

Cut the dough into 4 equal portions.  Roll one portion of the dough into a circle 5 to 6 inches in diameter and about 1/8-inch thick.  Brush the dough circle with a thin film of the reserved oil.  Sprinkle about one-eighth of the green onions, cilantro and salt over the dough and roll the dough into a cylinder.  Coil the dough cylinder into a round patty and tuck end of dough cylinder under the patty.  Lightly dust your work surface with cornstarch.  Roll the patty out to a 1/8-inch-thick circle, dusting with more cornstarch as necessary to prevent sticking.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

Heat a skillet wide enough to fit a cake comfortably over medium heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and swirl to coat the bottom.  Slip a cake into the skillet and cook, turning once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side.  Repeat with the remaining cakes, adding more oil as needed.  Slice each pancake into 6 wedges and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 cakes.

     1/3           cup  dark soy sauce
  2             medium  lumps rock sugar
                        = (or 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar)
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  4                     bay leaves
  3              whole  cardamom pods -- cracked
  3                     cinnamon sticks
  3              whole  star anise pods
  1              stalk  lemongrass, bottom 6" only -- lightly crushed
  1           teaspoon  whole cloves
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2                     squab -- (abt 1 lb ea)
                        = (or a 2-lb cornish game hen)
                        Steamed rice -- for serving

Place a 2- to 3-quart pan large enough to hold the squab, comfortably, over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the bottom.  Add the green onions and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant about 30 seconds.  Add the stock, soy sauces, rock sugar, rice vinegar, bay leaves, cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, star anise, lemongrass and cloves.  Bring to a boil, then adjust the heat so the sauce is simmering.  Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.

For the Dish:  Meanwhile, remove the neck and giblets from the bird and reserve them for other uses if you like.  Bring a pot of water large enough to hold the squab comfortably to a boil.  Carefully lower the squab into the water and blanch for 3 minutes after the water returns to the boil.  Drain.

Rest the squab on a large wire skimmer or in a mesh strainer and lower into the pan of simmering master sauce until completely submerged.  Hold in the liquid for about 20 seconds, then remove it.  Repeat this steps four times to allow the squab's skin to take on the dark color of the sauce.  Then release the squab into the liquid, cover the pan and simmer until the flesh is no longer pink, 25 to 30 minutes for the squab, 40 minutes for the game hen.

Lift the squab from the sauce, allowing the excess sauce to drip back into the pan.  (Cut the game hen in half before serving.)  Serve warm with the steamed rice.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Variation:  You may substitute a 3 to 4 pound chicken, cut in half and back bone removed, for the squab.  Increase the cooking time to 40 to 45 minutes.

                              Mongolian Beef

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     3/4         pound  flank or tri-tip steak -- sliced across
                        the grain into 1/4" slices
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  black vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Hoisin sauce
  1           teaspoon  chili bean sauce
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1                     leek
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  2             ounces  dried bean thread noodles
  5                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" lengths

Stir the water, soy sauce, oil, ginger and cornstarch together in a medium bowl until blended.  Cut the slices of beef crosswise into 2-inch pieces and toss them in the marinade to coat.  Let stand for 20 minutes.

For the Sauce:  Stir the soy sauce, sugar, rice wine, vinegar, hoisin sauce and chili bean sauce together in a bowl.

For the Dish:  Cut the leek in half lengthwise and cut off the root and dark green ends.  Reserve one half for another use and rinse out the grit from between the layers of the remaining leek half under cool running water.  Cut the leek half into 2-inch lengths.

Pour enough of the vegetable oil into a wide, deep skillet to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium-high heat to 375 degrees.  Pull the noodles apart gently to loosen the strands.  (If the bunch of noodles is too dense, those at the center will not cook.)  Slip the bean thread noodles into the oil and fry, just until they puff and expand, about 5 seconds.  Turn the noodles in the oil if necessary, so they all puff evenly.  Scoop the noodles from the oil with a slotted spoon or wire skimmer and drain on paper towels.  Arrange the noodles on a serving platter and set aside.  Reserve the oil.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the reserved oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Scatter the steak slices into the wok and stir-fry until barely pink in the center, 1 to 2 minutes.  Scoop the beef out of the wok onto a plate and set aside.

Add the green onions and leeks to the wok and stir-fry until wilted, about 30 seconds.  Pour in the sauce mixture and return the beef to the wok.  Cook until the beef is heated through and coated evenly with sauce, 1 to 2 minutes.  Spoon the beef and sauce over the noodles and serve.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  vegetable stock
                        = (or canned vegetable broth)
  2          teaspoons  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  shrimp paste
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
     1/2         pound  whole fresh okra
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1             medium  onion -- diced
     1/2           cup  sugar snap peas -- trimmed
  1             medium  tomato -- cored, diced
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil

Stir the vegetable stock, oyster-flavored sauce, shrimp paste and sugar together until the sugar is dissolved.  Set aside.

For the Dish:  Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil.  Trim the stems from the okra pods carefully to avoid piercing the pods.  Boil the okra for 3 minutes.  Drain, rinse under cold water, and drain again.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the onion and stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the okra and sauce ingredients and bring the sauce to a boil.  Adjust the heat so the sauce is simmering, cover the wok and simmer for 5 minutes.

Stir in the sugar snap peas and tomato and cook until the sugar snap peas are tender-crisp, about 1 minute.  Pour in the dissolved cornstarch and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens, about 30 seconds.  Stir in the sesame oil, scoop onto a platter and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     dried wood ear mushrooms
  8                     dried black mushrooms
  1             medium  dried bamboo shoot
  1            package  dried bean thread noodles - (abt 2 oz)
     1/2           cup  shredded dried gluten
                        = (or textured vegetable protein)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  1                cup  shredded green cabbage
                        = (abt 1/4 medium cabbage head)
  2                     green onions -- cut into thin strips
  1             medium  carrot -- peeled, trimmed,
                        and cut into thin strips
  8                     mu shu wrappers
                        = (or 8 flour tortillas)
                        Hoisin sauce
                        === SEASONINGS ===
     1/4           cup  canned vegetable broth
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
                        = (or dark soy sauce)
  1         tablespoon  Hoisin sauce
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil

In separate bowls, pour enough warm water over the dried ingredients (wood ears, black mushrooms, bamboo shoot, bean thread noodles and dried gluten) to cover completely.  Gluten will absorb a great deal of liquid.  Soak until softened, about 20 to 30 minutes.  Drain the mushrooms, discard the stems and cut the caps into thin strips.  Drain the bamboo shoot and cut into thin strips.  Drain the bean thread noodles; using scissors cut the strands in half.  Drain the gluten and squeeze out the excess water.

Prepare the Seasonings:  In a small bowl, stir the broth, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, pepper and sesame oil together.

Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the eggs and cook, until scrambled.  Add the cabbage, green onions, carrot, both mushrooms, bamboo shoots, bean thread noodles and gluten; stir-fry until the cabbage begins to wilt, about 1 minute.  Pour in the seasoning; stir until the carrot is tender-crisp, about 2 minutes.  Scoop the mixture onto a warm serving plate.  Serve with the mu shu wrappers and small dish of hoisin sauce.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  canned beef broth
  2        tablespoons  Hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame paste
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for shallow frying
  1              small  sweet potato -- peeled, and
                        sliced thinly - (about 1 cup)
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  4              small  dried red chilies
  1         tablespoon  chili garlic sauce
     1/2         pound  flank steak or beef tri-tip -- sliced thinly
                        across the grain
     1/3         pound  uncooked medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and tails left intact
     1/2           cup  snow peas -- ends trimmed
     1/3           cup  sliced button mushroom
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil

Stir the beef broth, hoisin sauce, sesame paste, dark soy sauce and sugar together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.

For the Dish:  Heat a wok over medium heat until hot.  Pour in enough oil to fill 1 inch.  When the oil is hot (you will notice movement on the surface), add the sweet potato, stirring to separate the slices.  Shallow-fry until the sweet potato is tender, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the sweet potato with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Reserve the oil.

Return the wok to high heat.  When hot, add 2 tablespoons of the reserved oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the garlic, dried chilies and chili garlic sauce.  Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the beef and stir-fry until barely pink, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.  Add the shrimp and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add the snow peas, mushrooms, fried sweet potatoes and sauce.  Bring to a boil, then adjust the heat so the sauce is simmering.  Simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 2 minutes.  Stir in the sesame oil, scoop onto a serving platter and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                       Nori-Dusted Flounder Bundles

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     sheets Japanese nori
     1/2      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1              whole  flounder or sole - (2 1/2 lbs) -- cleaned
                        = (or 1 lb skinless flounder or
                        sole fillets)
  2         tablespoon  flour -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water -- to make a paste
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

Crumble the nori and place the pieces in an electric spice grinder.  Grind to a powder.  Turn the powder out onto a plate and stir together with the five-spice powder, salt and pepper.  Mix well.

For the Dish:  If using the whole fish, remove the fillets from both sides of the fish.  (Or ask your fishmonger to remove the fillets for you.)  Reserve the fish frame.  Remove the skin from each fillet.

Rinse the fillets under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.  Cut each fillet crosswise into 2 or 3 pieces of equal length.  If any of the fillet pieces are more than 1/4 inch thick, cut them in half horizontally to make slices of more or less equal thickness.

Place the fillet pieces, skinned-side up, on a work surface.  Roll each piece into a compact roll, sealing the end of the roll with a little of the flour paste.  Dredge the rolls in the seasonings to coat them lightly.

Pour enough oil into a wok to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Dust the fish frame with cornstarch to coat it lightly.  Using a large slotted spoon or wire basket, press the carcass against the curved bottom of the wok to make a bowl shape.  Deep-fry until golden brown, about 8 minutes.  Adjust the heat as necessary to keep the temperature of the oil constant.  Remove carefully with a slotted spoon, so the bones retain their bowl shape and drain on paper towels.  Make sure the temperature of the oil remains at 350 degrees.  Deep-fry the fish bundles, a few at a time, turning them carefully, until the flesh is opaque and the edges are golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining fish bundles.

Mound the fish in the fish "bowl" and serve with your favorite dipping sauce, such as Spicy Ginger Soy Sauce or hot mustard.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Nori-Sesame Shrimp Toasts

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  uncooked shrimp -- shelled, deveined
  1                     egg white
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  3             slices  day-old white sandwich bread
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  3                     sheets Japanese nori
  1         tablespoon  black sesame seeds
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

Combine the shrimp, egg white, green onion, cornstarch, rice wine, ginger, salt, sesame oil and pepper in the workbowl of a food processor.  Process until the mixture is smooth, stopping once or twice to scrape down the sides.

For the Dish:  Trim the crusts from the bread.  Brush one side of one of the bread slices with the beaten egg and lightly press the nori sheet over the egg.  Place the bread on a cutting board, nori-side down, and trim any of the nori that extends past the edge of the bread.  Spread about 1/4 cup of the shrimp paste over the bare side of the bread, mounding it slightly in the center.  Sprinkle the black sesame seeds over the shrimp paste.  With a chefís knife, cut each slice into four triangles.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Pour enough oil into a wok to fill 3 inches.  Heat to 350 degrees.  Slide 3 or 4 toasts, shrimp-side down, into the oil.  Cook for about 1 minute, turn over and continue cooking until edges are golden brown, about 1 minute longer.  Scoop the toasts from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with remaining shrimp toasts.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 12 pieces.

For the Dish:  Trim the crusts from the bread.  Brush one side of one of the bread slices with the beaten egg and lightly press the nori sheet over the egg.  Place the bread on a cutting board, nori-side down, and trim any of the nori that extends past the edge of the bread.  Spread about 1/4 cup of the shrimp paste over the bare side of the bread, mounding it slightly in the center.  Sprinkle the black sesame seeds over the shrimp paste.  With a chefís knife, cut each slice into four triangles.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour enough oil into a wok to fill 3 inches.  Heat to 350 degrees.  Slide 3 or 4 toasts, shrimp-side down, into the oil.  Cook for about 1 minute, turn over and continue cooking until edges are golden brown, about 1 minute longer.  Scoop the toasts from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with remaining shrimp toasts.  Serve warm.

  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2              small  taro roots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" slices
  3                     baby bok choy -- cut into quarters
  5                     fresh shiitake mushrooms -- sliced
  5                     button mushrooms -- sliced
     1/3           cup  sliced bamboo shoots
     1/3           cup  fresh gluten -- thinly sliced
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  vegetarian oyster-flavoured sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  cumin
  1                cup  water
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  coconut milk

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Make the roux:  In a small frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Sprinkle the flour into the butter and stir to form a thick paste.  Cook, stirring until flour is no longer raw but the roux has not changed in color, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat, transfer into a small bowl and cool.

For the Dish:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Bring a 2-quart saucepan of water to a boil; add the taro and cook until tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain, rinse with cold water and drain again.  Set aside.

In an oven-safe dish, arrange the taro, bok choy, both mushrooms, bamboo shoots and gluten in overlapping layers.  Set aside while making the sauce.

Prepare the Sauce:  Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the butter; when melted, add the ginger and garlic; cook, stirring until fragrant, about 15 seconds.  Add the vegetarian oyster-flavored sauce, sugar, curry powder, salt and cumin, mix well.  Pour the water, heavy cream and coconut milk into the wok; stir to incorporate the spices into the liquid.

While the sauce is boiling add the roux, stirring rapidly to prevent scorching.  Remove from heat when sauce has thickened slightly, about 45 seconds to 1 minute.  Pour onto arranged vegetables.

Cover the vegetables with aluminum foil and bake in the oven for 10 minutes.  Remove the foil and bake until the top is golden brown and the vegetables are tender, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

               Oven-Baked Salmon In Spicy Chili-Bean Sauce

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  Hoisin sauce
  2        tablespoons  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  minced onions
  2        tablespoons  minced cilantro
  2        tablespoons  minced carrots
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  chili bean sauce
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1              pound  center-cut salmon fillets -- cut 8 pieces
  4                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut in halves

Combine the soy sauce, hoisin sauce, rice wine, sugar, onions, cilantro, carrot, shallot, chili bean sauce and garlic in a blender jar.  Blend at low speed until smooth.  Pour the sauce over the salmon in a medium bowl and stir gently to coat the fish completely.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.

For the Dish:  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Arrange the green onions in a row down the center of a rimmed baking sheet.  (They will act as a rack for cooking the salmon.)  Lift the salmon from the sauce, letting the excess sauce drain back into the bowl and place atop the onions, leaving a little space between each.  Bake to desired doneness, about 10 minutes for medium doneness or up to 15 minutes for well done.

Pour any remaining sauce into a small saucepan and heat over medium heat until hot, 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer the salmon and green onions to a warm platter, drizzle a little sauce over the fish and serve the remaining sauce separately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the green onions in a row down the center of a rimmed baking sheet.  (They will act as a rack for cooking the salmon.)  Lift the salmon from the sauce, letting the excess sauce drain back into the bowl and place atop the onions, leaving a little space between each.  Bake to desired doneness, about 10 minutes for medium doneness or up to 15 minutes for well done.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour any remaining sauce into a small saucepan and heat over medium heat until hot, 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer the salmon and green onions to a warm platter, drizzle a little sauce over the fish and serve the remaining sauce separately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2                     squab - (abt 1 lb ea) -- halved lengthwise
  1                     Chinese sausage - (abt 2 oz) -- sliced on the
                        bias into 8 pieces
  8                     button mushrooms -- stems trimmed,
                        and caps halved
  4                     fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        and caps halved
  1            package  enoki mushrooms - (3 oz) -- root ends removed,
                        divided into 4 sections
  2                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" lengths
                        Cilantro sprigs -- for garnish

Stir the wine, soy sauces, oyster-flavored sauce and sugar together in a large bowl until the sugar is dissolved.

For the Dish:  Turn the squab pieces in the marinade until coated.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut 4 pieces of parchment paper or heavy-duty aluminum foil into 12- by 18-inch rectangles.  Lay them out on a work surface and divide the sausage, button and shiitake mushrooms and green onions evenly among them, mounding them slightly in the center of the parchment.

Place a half-squab, skin-side up, over each pile.  Bring the long side of the parchment rectangles together over the squab and roll the ends together to hold them together.  Seal the ends of the packet with a series of small folds.  Place the packets on a baking sheet large enough to hold them comfortably as you work.

Bake the squab 25 to 30 minutes or until desired doneness is reached (Open one packet to test the squab for doneness before serving).  Transfer each packet to a warm plate and garnish each with a cilantro sprig.  Have your guests tear or cut open their own packets, being careful of the hot fragrant steam.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus more
                        for the cookie molds
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1              pinch  salt
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/4           cup  creamy-style peanut butter
     1/4           cup  sesame oil
     1/4           cup  chopped roasted peanuts

Sift the flour, sugar, cornstarch, and salt together into a bowl.  With an electric mixer, beat the butter, peanut butter and sesame oil in a large bowl until creamy.  Add the flour mixture and mix at low speed (or by hand) until well blended.

To shape the cookies, lightly dust a 2 1/2 inch cookie mold with flour and shake out the excess.  Pack enough of the cookie dough into the prepared mold to fill half way.  Sprinkle a thin layer of chopped peanuts over the dough, then pack enough dough to fill the mold.  Level off the top of the cookie by dragging the back of a butter knife over the mold.  Tap the mold firmly on the counter to release the cookie.  Repeat with the remaining dough and peanuts, placing the cookies 2 inches apart on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet as you go.  Refrigerate the cookies for 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Bake the cookies until the edges turn golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.  Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.  Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
     3/4      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
     3/4           cup  bread flour
                        === FOR THE DOUGH ===
  4               cups  bread flour
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  3                     eggs
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
     1/4           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  non-fat dry milk
     1/4           cup  lard or vegetable shortening -- melted
                        === FOR THE TOPPING ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  non-fat dry milk
     3/4           cup  super fine sugar
     1/4           cup  chilled lard or vegetable shortening
  1         tablespoon  milk
  1         tablespoon  mashed pineapple
     1/2                egg yolk
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla -- extract
                        === FOR THE BUN PREPARATION ===
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten

Stir the dry yeast and 3/4 sugar into 1/2 cup warm water until dissolved.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Add 3/4 cup bread flour and stir until the mixture forms a paste.  Let stand until frothy, about 10 minutes.

For the Dough:  Sift 4 cups bread flour into a mound on the work surface and make a well in the center of the mound.  Add 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, the eggs, 1/2 cup warm water, 1/4 cup milk and 2 tablespoons dry milk to the well.  Using a fork, beat the ingredients in the well until blended, then gradually draw the flour from the sides of the well into the mixture to make a soft dough.

Stir the melted lard or shortening into the yeast paste.  Stir the yeast paste mixture to the soft dough until incorporated.  Stretch and pound the dough against the table several times until elastic.  Place the dough into a greased mixing bowl, turn to coat all sides and cover the bowl with a damp towel.  Let rise in a warm place until the dough is doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.

Remove the dough from the bowl and shape into roll about 18 inches long.  Cut crosswise into 24 pieces (about 2 ounces each).  Knead each piece of dough into a round ball.  Arrange the dough balls on a greased baking sheet and cover them with a damp towel.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled, about one hour.

Meanwhile, make the Topping:  Sift the flour and milk powder into a mound on the work surface.

Make a well in the center of the mound and add the extra fine sugar, 1/4 cup chilled lard or vegetable shortening, 1 tablespoon milk, the pineapple, egg yolk, baking powder, baking soda, and vanilla extract to the well.  Using a fork, gradually draw the flour into the ingredients in the well and mix to form a soft dough.

Divide the topping into 24 equal portions.  Roll each into a round 1/4-inch thick.  If the dough balls haven't risen enough by the time the topping dough is made, cover the topping dough with a damp cloth to prevent it from drying out.

For the Bun Preparation:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

When the dough balls have doubled in size, top each with a round of the topping dough and brush the tops with the beaten egg.  Bake the buns 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden brown.  Serve hot, warm or room temperature.

This recipe yields 24 buns.

Variation:  This dough can also be used to make a custard-filled bun.  After the dough has risen for the first time, divide it into 25 pieces.  With the palms of your hands or a rolling pin, flatten the dough into a 3-inch circle.  Place 1 heaping tablespoon of custard filling and 1 teaspoon chopped candied pineapple into the center.  Gather the sides of the dough together, to enclose filling and pinch to seal.  Place the bun, seam-side down, on a baking sheet.  Set in a warm place and let rise for the second time.  Before baking, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of white sesame seeds or flaked sweetened coconut over the topping.  Bake as directed above.

Stretch and pound the dough against the table several times until elastic.  Place the dough into a greased mixing bowl, turn to coat all sides and cover the bowl with a damp towel.  Let rise in a warm place until the dough is doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the dough from the bowl and shape into roll about 18 inches long.  Cut crosswise into 24 pieces (about 2 ounces each).  Knead each piece of dough into a round ball.  Arrange the dough balls on a greased baking sheet and cover them with a damp towel.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled, about one hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, make the Topping:  Sift the flour and milk powder into a mound on the work surface.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make a well in the center of the mound and add the extra fine sugar, 1/4 cup chilled lard or vegetable shortening, 1 tablespoon milk, the pineapple, egg yolk, baking powder, baking soda, and vanilla extract to the well.  Using a fork, gradually draw the flour into the ingredients in the well and mix to form a soft dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the topping into 24 equal portions.  Roll each into a round 1/4-inch thick.  If the dough balls haven&apos;t risen enough by the time the topping dough is made, cover the topping dough with a damp cloth to prevent it from drying out.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Bun Preparation:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the dough balls have doubled in size, top each with a round of the topping dough and brush the tops with the beaten egg.  Bake the buns 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden brown.  Serve hot, warm or room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 24 buns.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Variation:  This dough can also be used to make a custard-filled bun.  After the dough has risen for the first time, divide it into 25 pieces.  With the palms of your hands or a rolling pin, flatten the dough into a 3-inch circle.  Place 1 heaping tablespoon of custard filling and 1 teaspoon chopped candied pineapple into the center.  Gather the sides of the dough together, to enclose filling and pinch to seal.  Place the bun, seam-side down, on a baking sheet.  Set in a warm place and let rise for the second time.  Before baking, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of white sesame seeds or flaked sweetened coconut over the topping.  Bake as directed above.

                           Red-Cooked Fish Tail

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Chinese black vinegar
                        = (or balsamic vinegar)
  1         tablespoon  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1 1/2         pounds  fish steaks
                        = (or tail sections from firm white fish
                        such as grouper or snapper)
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  3                     green onions -- trimmed, chopped
  2             slices  ginger -- cut thin strips
                        Steamed rice -- for serving

Stir the chicken stock, black vinegar, rice wine, soy sauces, sugar, salt and pepper together in a small bowl.

For the Dish:  If using fish tails, butterfly them: Lay the tail flat on a cutting board.  With a thin knife, make a cut from one side of the fish through to the backbone, resting the knife on the top of the bones as you work.  Lift up the flap of fish you just cut to get a better view, and continue the cut along the top of the bones and through to the other side.  Repeat with the meat on the other side of the tail.  Discard the tail bone or reserve it for making fish stock.

Dust the steaks or tails lightly with the cornstarch.  Pour enough vegetable oil into a wok to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Carefully lower the fish into the hot oil.  Cook until fish is golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain.  Turn off the heat and ladle all but 2 tablespoons of the oil into a heatproof container.

Heat the oil remaining in the wok over high heat until hot.  Add 2 of the chopped green onions and the ginger and cook until fragrant, about 20 seconds.  Set the fried fish into the wok and pour in the seasonings.  Bring to a boil, then adjust the heat to simmering.  Cook, turning the fish once, until the fish is cooked through and the sauce is reduced to a glaze, 5 to 6 minutes.

Transfer the fish onto a serving platter, spoon the sauce over it and scatter the remaining green onion over the sauce.  Serve with a bowl of steamed rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  2          teaspoons  Hoisin sauce
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     3/4      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  grated ginger
  2              whole  star anise pods
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  dark soy sauce
  1                     chicken - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- cleaned
                        = (or 2 cornish game hens)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/3           cup  chopped shallot
  3        tablespoons  chopped ginger
  3        tablespoons  chopped green onions
  2               cups  rock salt -- or as needed

Stir the rice wine, hoisin sauce, sugar, sesame oil, five-spice powder, salt, ginger, and star anise together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.

For the Dish:  Stir the soy sauces together in a small bowl, then rub into the skin of the chicken or game hens.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the shallot, ginger and green onion and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the seasonings and stir to combine.

Scoop into a small bowl, cool briefly, then spoon into the cavity of the chicken (or divide between the game hens).  Wrap the chickens or game hens in parchment, tucking any overhanging paper underneath the bird(s).

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place half the rock salt into the bottom of a 2-quart clay pot or covered casserole into which the bird(s) fit snugly.  Place in oven until hot, about 10 minutes.  Set the parchment-wrapped bird over the hot salt.  Pour enough additional rock salt into the pot to cover the bird(s) completely.  Cover the pot and bake for 1 hour 15 minutes.  Remove the bird from the salt, unwrap it and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variation:  To make a crispy-skinned version of this recipe, let the cooked bird stand after removing from the parchment while heating 2 cups of vegetable oil in a wok over medium-high heat to 350 degrees.  Place a hook behind the wing joint of the cooked chicken and suspend over the hot oil.  With a Chinese ladle, spoon hot oil from the wok over the baked chicken, letting it drip back into the wok, until the skin is deliciously crisp and caramelized.

     1/3           cup  water
     1/4           cup  diced (1/2") mango
     1/4           cup  diced (1/2") pineapple
     1/4           cup  diced (1/2") red bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro

Prepare the fish for frying:  Cut 3 diagonal slices about 3/4-inch deep into the two fleshy sides of the fish.  With the tip of a knife, make two 1/2-inch deep cuts that run the length of the fish along either side of the backbone.

Marinate the fish:  Stir the soy sauce, salt and pepper in a small bowl until blended.  Rub the marinade onto both sides of the fish.  Let stand for 30 minutes.

Pour enough oil into a wok to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Dust fish with cornstarch, coat all crevices.  Carefully slip one of the fish into the oil and deep-fry until the meat along the backbone is opaque, about 3 minutes per side.  Carefully lift the fish from the oil using a large wire skimmer or two slotted spoons.  Drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the other fish, then transfer both fish to a serving platter.

Make the sauce:  Heat the rice vinegar, water, mango, pineapple, bell pepper, and sugar together in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved.  Stir in the dissolved cornstarch and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and is slightly thickened, about 30 seconds.  Pour the sauce over fried fish.  Top with the cilantro and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                  Savory Glutinous Rice In Lotus Leaves

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth or water)
  2          teaspoons  black bean sauce
     1/8      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1 1/4            cup  uncooked glutinous rice
  2                     dried lotus leaves
  5                     dried black mushrooms
     1/2         pound  boneless skinless chicken meat -- cut 3/4" cubes
  1         tablespoon  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  4                     button mushrooms -- quartered
     1/4           cup  julienned carrot
     1/4           cup  chopped water chestnuts
     1/4           cup  pine nuts

In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, stock, black bean sauce, 5-spice powder and pepper; mix well.

For the Dish:  Place the rice in a large bowl and cover with water, set aside for 4 hours or overnight.  Drain.

In a pan large enough to the hold lotus leaves, soak them in enough water to cover, until soft and pliable, about 30 minutes.  Drain and pat dry with paper towels.

In a separate bowl, soak black mushrooms in warm water to cover until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain, discard the stems and quarter the caps.

In a medium bowl, combine the chicken, oyster-flavored sauce and cornstarch; mix until the chicken is well coated.  Set aside for 10 minutes.

Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the chicken; cook, stirring, until it begins to brown, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.  Add the black and button mushrooms, carrot, water chestnuts and pinenuts; cook for 1 minute.  Add the rice and pour in the sauce; stir until the ingredients are well incorporated.  Remove mixture from the wok.

Carefully open the lotus leaves, stack one leaf on top of the other on a work surface.  Mound the rice mixture in the center of leaves.  Fold the leaves tighty to enclose the rice mixture; secure by wrapping with kitchen twine.

Bring a large stock pot of water to a boil.  Lower the lotus leaf package into the boiling water.  Cover and cook until the rice is tender, about 40 minutes.  Remove the lotus packet from the boiling water with a slotted spoon and place on a serving platter.  Cut the string that secures the package and using a knife, cut open the package.  Serve directly from leaf.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  flat rice noodles abt 1/4" wide -- fresh or dried
                        === FOR THE SEAFOOD AND MARINADE ===
     1/4         pound  squid -- cleaned
     1/4         pound  raw medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and butterflied
     1/4         pound  sea scallops -- halved horizontally
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
  1         tablespoon  oyster-flavoured sauce
  2          teaspoons  fish sauce
  2          teaspoons  dark soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  chili garlic sauce
     3/4      teaspoon  sugar
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  1                cup  thinly-sliced onion
  2                     green onions -- cut 1" lengths
     1/2                red jalapeÒo chile pepper -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  bean sprouts
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame seeds

If using the dried rice noodles, pour enough warm water over them in a medium bowl to cover completely.  Let them soak until softened, about 30 minutes.  Drain completely.  If using the fresh rice noodles, run them under warm water while separating the strands.  Drain completely.

For the Seafood and Marinade:  Separate the squid tentacles from the bodies.  Leave the tentacles whole.  Cut the bodies open along one side so they lie flat on the cutting board and lightly score the inner side in a small crisscross pattern.  Cut the scored bodies into 1 1/2- by 2-inch pieces.

Marinate the seafood:  In a bowl, combine the squid, shrimp, scallops, cornstarch, salt and white pepper; stir until evenly coated.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

For the Seasonings:  Stir the oyster-flavored sauce, fish sauce, soy sauce, chili garlic sauce and sugar together in a bowl.

For the Dish:  Bring a 2-quart saucepan of water to a boil.  Slide the seafood into the boiling water; cook until the seafood are opaque on the surface, about 2 minutes.  Remove the seafood from the water and drain.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the soaked or fresh rice noodles and stir-fry until the noodles are lightly browned along the edges, about 2 minutes.  Scoop the noodles onto a plate and set aside.

Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to wok; swirl to coat the sides.  Add the garlic, ginger, onion and red jalapeÒo pepper; cook, stirring, until fragrant and the onion is tender, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Slide the noodles into the wok, scatter the bean sprouts and seafood over them and pour in the seasonings.  Toss until the mixture is heated through and the seafood is coated evenly with the seasonings, about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.  Sprinkle with the sesame seeds, scoop the noodles onto a warm serving plate and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the Seafood and Marinade:  Separate the squid tentacles from the bodies.  Leave the tentacles whole.  Cut the bodies open along one side so they lie flat on the cutting board and lightly score the inner side in a small crisscross pattern.  Cut the scored bodies into 1 1/2- by 2-inch pieces.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the soaked or fresh rice noodles and stir-fry until the noodles are lightly browned along the edges, about 2 minutes.  Scoop the noodles onto a plate and set aside.

<DirT>
Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to wok; swirl to coat the sides.  Add the garlic, ginger, onion and red jalapeÒo pepper; cook, stirring, until fragrant and the onion is tender, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Slide the noodles into the wok, scatter the bean sprouts and seafood over them and pour in the seasonings.  Toss until the mixture is heated through and the seafood is coated evenly with the seasonings, about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.  Sprinkle with the sesame seeds, scoop the noodles onto a warm serving plate and serve.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  boneless pork -- cut thin strips
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
                        === FOR THE SOUP BASE ===
  3               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  black vinegar

                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2                     dried wood ear mushrooms
  8                     dried lily buds
  1           teaspoon  dried shrimp
  16            ounces  fresh wide Chinese egg noodles
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1              small  napa cabbage -- cored, and
                        cut crosswise into 1/2" strips
     1/4           cup  sliced bamboo shoots
  4                     oyster mushrooms
  4                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" lengths
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
     1/4           cup  water
  4                     eggs

Stir the cornstarch, soy sauce and sesame oil together in a medium bowl.  Toss the pork gently in the marinade until coated.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

For the Soup Base:  Stir the stock, soy sauce, black vinegar, sesame oil and pepper together in a bowl until blended.

For the Dish:  Pour enough warm water over the wood ears, lily buds and dried shrimp in separate bowls to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain.  Cut the wood ears into thin strips.  Trim the hard ends from the lily buds and tie each bud to form a knot in the center.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Cook the noodles according to the package directions.  Drain, rinse with cold water, and drain again.  Divide the noodles among 4 large soup bowls.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the garlic and shrimp and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the pork and stir-fry until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.  Add the wood ears, lily buds, cabbage, bamboo shoots, oyster mushrooms and green onions.  Stir-fry until the vegetables are softened, about 2 minutes.

Pour the soup base into the wok and bring to a boil.  Stir the dissolved cornstarch into the wok and stir until the soup is lightly thickened.  Turn the heat to low.  Carefully crack the eggs into the soup and cook until the whites are set but yolks are still creamy, about 2 minutes.

To serve, remove the eggs with a slotted spoon, setting one atop each bowl of noodles.  Ladle the broth into the bowls, dividing the ingredients evenly.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the Dish:  Pour enough warm water over the wood ears, lily buds and dried shrimp in separate bowls to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the garlic and shrimp and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the pork and stir-fry until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.  Add the wood ears, lily buds, cabbage, bamboo shoots, oyster mushrooms and green onions.  Stir-fry until the vegetables are softened, about 2 minutes.

Pour the soup base into the wok and bring to a boil.  Stir the dissolved cornstarch into the wok and stir until the soup is lightly thickened.  Turn the heat to low.  Carefully crack the eggs into the soup and cook until the whites are set but yolks are still creamy, about 2 minutes.

                        = (or chili garlic sauce)
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              whole  stripped bass - (abt 2 lbs) -- cleaned, scaled
                        = (or 1 1/2 lbs firm fish steaks)
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  sliced bamboo shoots
     1/2           cup  fresh wood ear mushroom -- cut thin strips
                        = (or 4 fresh shiitake mushrooms,
                        stemmed, and caps cut into thin strips)
  4                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" lengths
  6             slices  peeled ginger -- cut thin strips
  3                     garlic cloves -- sliced thinly
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water

Stir the fish stock, rice wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, brown bean sauce, sugar and hot bean sauce together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.

For the Dish:  Sprinkle the salt over the fish, inside and out, and let stand for 10 minutes.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Slide the fish into the wok and pan-fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Once the skin is firm and will no longer stick to the wok, slide the fish gently.  Remove fish from the pan using two sturdy spatulas.

Return the wok to high heat and add the remaining tablespoon of oil.  Add the bamboo shoots, wood ears, green onions, ginger and garlic.  Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the seasonings and bring to a boil, 1 to 2 minutes.

Return the fish to the wok and bring to a boil.  Adjust the heat so the liquid is simmering, cover the wok and simmer until the meat along the backbone is cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Turn the fish once during cooking.  Remove the fish carefully from the wok and place on a warm serving platter.

Stir the dissolved cornstarch into the sauce and cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens slightly, 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Spoon the sauce over the fish and serve hot.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dim Sum

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  oyster-flavoured sauce
  2          teaspoons  dark soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/4         pound  ground pork
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped smoked ham
  2               cups  cooked glutinous rice -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped bamboo shoots
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped water chestnuts
  1                     green onion -- trimmed, and
                        finely chopped
  4                     dried black mushrooms
                        === FOR THE DUMPLINGS ===
  1            package  siu mai wrappers - (16 oz)
     1/4           cup  frozen peas -- defrosted

Stir the soy sauce, oyster-flavored sauce, dark soy sauce, sesame oil and sugar together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.

For the Filling:  Pour enough warm water over the mushrooms in a medium bowl to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain.  Discard the stems and chop the caps finely.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the ground pork and ham and stir-fry until the pork is crumbly and cooked through, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms, rice, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, green onion and seasonings.  Cook, stirring, until heated through, about 1 minute.  Remove the filling from the wok and let cool.

For the Dumplings:  Place 1 tablespoon of the rice mixture in the center of a wrapper.  (Keep remaining wrappers covered with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out).  Gather up the wrapper around the filling, pleating it as you go to form an open-topped pouch.  Carefully squeeze the sides of the dumpling about half way up to give the dumpling a 'waist.'  Center a pea over the top of the dumpling.  Repeat with the remaining dumplings, keeping the formed dumplings covered with a damp cloth while filling the remaining wrappers.

Prepare a wok for steaming.  Line the inside of a bamboo steamer with cabbage leaves or parchment paper.  Place as many dumplings in the steamer as will fit without touching each other.  Steam the dumplings until the wrapper is cooked and tender to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes.  Serve with classic dim sum accoutrements like hot mustard, chili paste and soy sauce.

This recipe yields 60 pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
     1/4           cup  fish stock
                        = (or 1/4 cup dissolved seafood bouillon)
     1/4           cup  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1         tablespoon  fermented rice
  2          teaspoons  sugar
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1                     wood ear mushroom
                        Vegetable oil -- for shallow frying
     1/4           cup  thinly bias-sliced carrot
     1/4           cup  sliced bamboo shoots
  3                     shiitake mushrooms -- (optional), stems
                        removed, and caps halved
  4                     thin slices peeled ginger
  1                     green onion -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" lengths

Marinate the fish:  Stir the 1 teaspoon wine, cornstarch, salt and pepper together in a medium bowl.  Toss the fish gently in the marinade until coated.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

For the Seasonings:  Stir the stock, 1/4 cup wine, fermented rice and sugar together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.  Mix well.

For the Dish:  Pour enough water over the wood ear mushroom in a small bowl to cover completely.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain and cut into thin strips.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Pour in enough vegetable oil to fill 1/2 inch.  When the oil is hot (the surface will appear to shimmer).  Add the marinated fish and cook just until and beginning to flake, about 2 minutes per side.  Remove the fish with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Spoon off all but 1 tablespoon of the oil.

Return the wok to high heat and swirl the oil to coat the sides.  Add the wood ear mushroom, carrot, bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms, ginger and green onion.  Stir-fry until the carrot is crisp-tender, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.  Pour in the seasonings and bring to a boil.  Return the fish to the pan, and cook, stirring carefully so the fish does not break up, until heated through, about 1 minute.  Scoop onto a serving platter and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the Seasonings:  Stir the stock, 1/4 cup wine, fermented rice and sugar together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.  Mix well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Dish:  Pour enough water over the wood ear mushroom in a small bowl to cover completely.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain and cut into thin strips.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Pour in enough vegetable oil to fill 1/2 inch.  When the oil is hot (the surface will appear to shimmer).  Add the marinated fish and cook just until and beginning to flake, about 2 minutes per side.  Remove the fish with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Spoon off all but 1 tablespoon of the oil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the wok to high heat and swirl the oil to coat the sides.  Add the wood ear mushroom, carrot, bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms, ginger and green onion.  Stir-fry until the carrot is crisp-tender, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.  Pour in the seasonings and bring to a boil.  Return the fish to the pan, and cook, stirring carefully so the fish does not break up, until heated through, about 1 minute.  Scoop onto a serving platter and serve hot.

                     Shrimp And Tropical Fruit Rolls

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Spring/Summer Rolls


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             slices  candied papaya or candied mango
     1/4           cup  roasted peanuts
     1/4           cup  toasted almonds
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                     egg white
                        === FOR THE ROLLS ===
  8                     spring roll wrappers
  8                     uncooked large shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and cut in half lengthwise
  2                     bananas -- quartered lengthwise
  1         tablespoon  toasted white sesame seeds
  1         tablespoon  black sesame seeds
  1                     egg white
  1         tablespoon  flour -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water

Combine the candied papaya or mango, peanuts, almonds, sugar, and egg white in the work bowl of a food processor.  Process, using quick on/off pulses until the ingredients are coarsely chopped.

For the Rolls:  Place a spring roll wrapper, shiny-side down, and with one of the corners pointing toward you, on the work surface.  Place 2 shrimp halves end to end over the lower third of the wrapper.  Spread 1 heaping tablespoon of the filling over the shrimp and top with 1 slice of banana.  Fold the corner closest to you over filling, then fold the right and left corners over that.  Give the roll just enough of a turn to enclose the filling completely.  Brush the exposed sides and top of the wrapper with some of the flour paste.  Continue rolling into a compact roll, pressing lightly to seal.  Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling ingredients, covering the formed spring rolls with a damp towel to keep them from drying out.

Spread the toasted and black sesame seeds out on a plate.  Brush the rolls with a light coating of egg white, then roll them in the sesame seeds to coat.

Pour enough oil into a wok or 2-quart saucepan to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Slip a few of the spring rolls into the oil and fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining rolls.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 8 rolls.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  firm white fish head - (1 1/2 lbs)
                        Cornstarch -- for dusting
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" lengths
  12            slices  peeled ginger - (quarter size)
  8               cups  water
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  fish sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE SOUP ===
  8             ounces  dried rice noodles - (abt 1/4" wide)
     1/4         pound  firm white fish fillet -- sliced thinly
  2                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        sliced thinly
     1/4           cup  cilantro leaves

Rinse the fish head thoroughly under cold running water, being sure that no blood remains in the gills.  Pat dry, then dust the fish head with cornstarch to coat it lightly.

Heat a stockpot over medium heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the bottom.  Add the fish head, green onions and ginger.  Cook until the fish head is light brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Set the fish head aside.

Pour the water into the pot and bring to a boil.  Adjust the heat so the liquid is simmering and cook for 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare the Seasonings:  Stir the soy sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, salt and pepper together in a small bowl until the salt is dissolved.

For the Soup:  Strain the stock and discard the solids.  Return the stock to the pot, it will be creamy white.

Bring a pot of water to a boil, stir in the rice noodles and cook until al dente (tender but firm), 4 1/2 to 5 minutes.  Drain, rinse and drain thoroughly.  Lay the noodles out on a cutting board and cut them in half crosswise.

Reheat the stock to simmering, add the seasonings and fish slices and simmer until the fish is cooked, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Add the noodles and simmer just until heated through, about 30 seconds.  Ladle into individual serving bowls and garnish with the green onions and cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  chopped onion
     1/3           cup  Chinese rice wine
     1/3           cup  dry sherry
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  dark soy sauce
  4                     bay leaves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  turmeric powder
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2             pounds  boneless pork loin or butt -- trimmed of
                        all but a single layer of fat
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3               cups  water
     1/4           cup  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water

Stir the onion, 1/3 cup rice wine, both soy sauces, bay leaves, turmeric and pepper together in a bowl until well blended.

For the Dish:  Put the pork into a heavy resealable plastic bag, then pour in the marinade.  Squeeze the extra air out of the bag and seal.  Shake the bag gently until the pork is evenly coated.  Marinate the pork in the refrigerator overnight, turning once.

Remove the pork from the marinade and reserve the marinade.  Pat the pork dry with paper towels.  Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to the coat sides.  Place the meat, fat-side down, in the wok and cook, turning as necessary, until brown on all sides, about 2 minutes per side.

Discard the pan drippings and add the reserved marinade and the water to the wok.  Bring to a boil, then adjust the heat so the liquid is simmering.  Cover the wok and simmer until the meat is very tender, about 2 hours.

Lift the pork out of the wok and onto a carving board.  Cut into slices about 1/4-inch thick and arrange on a serving plate.  Add the wine and dissolved cornstarch to the cooking liquid and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens, about 1 minute.  Serve the sauce alongside the pork.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1 1/4         pounds  mussels
                        = (or medium hard-shell clams)
  1                     Portuguese sausage - (abt 3 oz) -- thinly sliced

For the Dish:  Scrub the mussels or clams under cold running water and discard any with open shells that donít close when tapped.

Pour enough water into medium saucepan to fill 1 1/2 inches and bring to a boil.  Add mussels or clams to the water, cover the pot, and cook until the shells have opened, 2 to 3 minutes for the mussels, slightly longer for clams.  Discard any mussels or clams with shells that do not open.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil to the wok and swirl.  When the oil is hot, add the garlic, ginger, and sausage.  Cook, stirring, until the sausage is cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Add the tomato paste and sauce.  Bring to a boil, adjust the heat to simmering and simmer for 1 minute.  Ladle the hot liquid over the clams, garnish with the cilantro sprigs and serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  water
  2                     lemongrass stalks, bottom 6" only -- sliced thinly
  4                     walnut-sized shallots
  3                     fresh red or green jalapeÒo chiles -- seeded
  4                     candlenuts or 8 almonds
  1           teaspoon  galangal powder -- (optional)
     3/4      teaspoon  shrimp paste
     1/2      teaspoon  turmeric powder
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  4             ounces  dried rice stick noodles
  8             ounces  fresh thick Chinese egg noodles
     1/2       package  regular tofu - (abt 7 oz) -- drained, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  1                cup  unsweetened coconut milk
  4               cups  water
                        = (or chicken stock)
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  6             ounces  bean sprouts -- blanched in boiling
                        water for 1 minute, then drained
  6             ounces  cooked medium shrimp -- shelled
  1              large  cooked chicken breast half -- boned, shredded
     1/2                English cucumber -- cut matchsticks
  3                     fresh red or green jalapeÒo chiles -- thinly sliced
                        Lemon or lime wedges -- for serving

Prepare the spice paste.  Combine the 1/3 cup water, lemongrass, shallots, jalapeÒos, candlenuts or almonds, galangal powder, shrimp paste and turmeric in the work bowl of a food processor.  Process until smooth.

For the Dish:  Pour enough warm water over the rice stick noodles to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 30 minutes.  Drain.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Cook the egg noodles according to package directions.  Drain, rinse, and drain again.  Mound the noodles in a serving bowl.

Deep-fry the tofu:  Press the tofu cubes gently between paper towels to remove the excess water.  Pour enough oil into a wok to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Deep-fry the tofu, turning once, until golden on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Reserve the oil.

Heat a nonstick 8- to 9-inch frying pan over medium heat until hot.  Brush with 1/2 teaspoon of the reserved oil.  Add half the eggs and tilt the pan so the the egg covers the bottom of the skillet.  Cook until lightly browned on the bottom and set on the top, about 1 minute.  Turn the egg over and cook for 5 seconds.  Slide the omlet out of the pan and repeat with another 1/2 teaspoon oil and egg.  Roll the omelets into cylinders and cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips.

Heat a wok over medium-low heat until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the spice paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 6 to 8 minutes.  Pour in the coconut milk, bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the 4 cups water and soy sauce.  Return to a boil.

Ladle the hot soup over the noodles and arrange the bean sprouts, shrimp, chicken, cucumber, sliced jalapeÒos, omelet slices and lemon wedges decoratively over the top.  Bring to the table, toss to mix the noodles with the other ingredients and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
     1/4           cup  Chinese rice wine

  2               cups  water
     3/4         pound  fresh pork belly -- in one piece
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" lengths
  2             slices  peeled ginger - (quarter size) -- cut thin strips
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1                     fresh red jalapeÒo chile -- seeded, and
                        cut into thin rings
  3               cups  sliced (1") green cabbage -- (abt 1/2 head)
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  3        tablespoons  water

Stir the stock, rice wine, sweet bean paste, sugar, soy sauce and hot bean paste and together in a medium bowl until the sugar is dissolved.

For the Dish:  Pour the water over the pork belly in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Adjust the heat so the water is simmering, cover the pan, and simmer until the pork is no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes.  Drain and starting at one of the short sides, cut the pork into 1/4-inch slices, so each slice contains some meat and some fat.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the green onions, ginger, garlic and jalapeÒo; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the sliced pork and cabbage and stir-fry until the cabbage begins to brown, about 1 minute.

Pour in the sauce, cover the wok, and simmer until the cabbage is soft and flavors have blended, about 5 minutes.

Stir in the dissolved cornstarch and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens, about 1 minute.  Spoon into warm shallow bowls.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the Dish:  Pour the water over the pork belly in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Adjust the heat so the water is simmering, cover the pan, and simmer until the pork is no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes.  Drain and starting at one of the short sides, cut the pork into 1/4-inch slices, so each slice contains some meat and some fat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the green onions, ginger, garlic and jalapeÒo; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the sliced pork and cabbage and stir-fry until the cabbage begins to brown, about 1 minute.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour in the sauce, cover the wok, and simmer until the cabbage is soft and flavors have blended, about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir in the dissolved cornstarch and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens, about 1 minute.  Spoon into warm shallow bowls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     dried tangerine peels
  1 1/3         pounds  ground beef
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  minced cilantro
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
  2                     eggs whites
  1         tablespoon  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  3        tablespoons  water chestnut powder
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4                     napa cabbage leaves -- tender leaves only

Soak the tangerine peels in warm water to cover until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain and squeeze to remove excess water.  Mince and combine in a mixing bowl with ground beef, water, cilantro and baking soda.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Add cornstarch, egg whites, oyster-flavored sauce, sesame oil, water chestnut powder, sugar and salt to beef mixture.  Use electric mixer with paddle attachments, about 5 minutes or until mixture is stiff.

Line two heat-proof 8-inch glass pie dishes with 2 napa cabbage leaves.  Using your hands, make ping pong-sized meatballs and place them onto the leaves, dividing meatballs equally between two dishes.

Prepare a wok for steaming, use 2 bamboo baskets if available to cook the two dishes of meatballs at the same time.  Set glass dishes with meatballs into steamer and steam over high heat until they are no longer pink in the center, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Repeat with remaining meatballs, if necessary.  Serve directly from steamer with Potsticker Dipping Sauce.

This recipe yields about 30 ping-pong size meatballs for 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  warm water -- (105 degrees)
  1            package  active dry yeast - (abt 2 tspns)
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus more
                        for kneading the dough
  1                cup  cake flour
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
     1/2      teaspoon  water
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  2               cups  filling
                        = (Char Siu, vegetable, or chicken)

Stir the warm water, yeast and sugar together in a large bowl.  Let stand until the mixture begins to bubble, about 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, cut fifteen 3-inch squares of parchment paper and set them aside.

Gradually stir in the all-purpose and cake flours, then beat the dough with a wooden spoon or heavy duty mixer until it holds together.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead, adding more flour as necessary to prevent sticking, until smooth and elastic, 5 to 10 minutes.  Using the vegetable oil, lightly grease the inside of a 2-gallon resealable plastic bag.  Slip the dough into the bag, add the 1/2 teaspoon water and seal the bag.  Let rise in a warm location until the dough doubles in size, 2 to 3 hours.

Remove the dough from the bag and place on a lightly floured surface.  Sprinkle the baking powder over the dough and knead, adding flour as necessary to prevent sticking, until the dough is smooth, about 5 minutes.

Divide the dough into 15 equal pieces.  Roll one piece into a round about 4 inches in diameter.  Press the edges of the dough circle with your fingers to make them slightly thinner than the center.  Place about 2 tablespoons of the filling in the center of the round.  Gather the edges of the dough over the filling, completely enclosing the filling, and twist the edges together to seal.

Place the bun, twisted-side up, on a parchment paper square and set on a baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.  Cover with a kitchen towel and let the buns rise in a warm location until puffy, about 30 minutes.

Prepare a wok for steaming.  Place half the buns in the steaming basket, cover the basket and steam over high heat until the dough is cooked and the buns have slightly cracked on top, 15 to 20 minutes.  Repeat with the remaining buns.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 15 buns.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  1 1/4           cups  low-fat milk
  3 1/2    tablespoons  ginger juice

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  minced ginger
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped cilantro -- leaves and stems
     1/2           cup  Thai or regular basil leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  8              large  uncooked prawns - (3/4 to 1 lb) -- with shells,
                        and heads intact

Combine the pine nuts, oil, garlic and ginger in the work bowl of a food processor.  Process to a coarse paste.  Add the cilantro, basil, sesame oil, salt and sugar.  Process to make a smooth puree.

For the Dish:  Clip the legs off the prawns with kitchen shears.  Cut through the top shell of the prawns, starting at the tail end, and scoring the tail meat about 1/2-inch deep as you go.  Leave the heads intact.  Arrange the prawns in a heatproof glass pie dish large enough to hold the prawns comfortably with the butterflied cavities facing up.  Rub the tail meat of each prawn with a teaspoon of the pesto.  Dot the prawns with the remaining pesto.

Prepare a wok for steaming.  Set the pie dish into the steamer basket and steam over high heat until the shells are bright pink and the meat is opaque, 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove the plate from the steamer and serve directly from the pie dish.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  XO sauce
  1         tablespoon  minced green onion
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  6              large  oysters in the shell
  4                     lettuce leaves
  1            package  dried bean thread noodles - (2 oz)

Stir the XO sauce, green onion, soy sauce, garlic and sugar together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.

For the Dish:  Pour enough warm water over the bean thread noodles in a large bowl to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 10 minutes.  Drain the noodles, lay them out on a cutting board and cut them in half crosswise.

Using an oyster knife, shuck the oysters, removing the meat from the shells and setting them aside on a plate as you go.  Discard the flat half of each shell.  Line a Chinese steaming basket with lettuce.  Nestle the reserved cupped half of each shell in the lettuce so it won't tip over during steaming.

Divide the noodles among the 6 oyster shells.  Top each bed of noodles with an oyster, then spoon about 2 teaspoons of sauce over each oyster.

Prepare a wok for steaming.  Set the steaming basket into the wok, cover the wok, and steam over high heat until the oysters are cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes.  Serve the oysters hot, directly from the steamer basket.

                        and tails left intact
  6                     fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        and caps cut into thin strips
     1/4           cup  smoked ham in thin strips
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced bamboo shoots
     1/4           cup  sliced carrot strips about 2" long
     1/4           cup  snow peas in thin strips
     1/4           cup  green onion in 2" lengths
                        = (or 12 garlic chive flowers)

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  fish - (1 1/2 to 2 lbs) -- cleaned
                        = (such as seabass or snapper)
                        === FOR THE STUFFING ===
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced ginger
     1/4           cup  trimmed green onion in thin 1" long strips
  3        tablespoons  thin strips Sichuan preserved vegetables -- rinsed, drained,
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  chopped green onion
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil

Prepare the fish for steaming:  Cut 3 diagonal slices about 3/4-inch deep into the two fleshy sides of the fish.  With the tip of a knife, make two 1/2-inch deep cuts that run the length of the fish along either side of the backbone.  Place the fish on a heatproof steaming plate.

For the Stuffing:  Stuff the fish: Stir the ginger, green onion, preserved vegetables and garlic together in a bowl until blended.  Rub half of the stuffing mixture into the cuts on the sides of the fish.  Stuff the remaining half into the cavity.  Sprinkle the fish inside and out with the salt and pepper.

For the Dish:  Prepare a wok for steaming.  Set the plate into the steamer basket.  Cover the wok and steam the fish over high heat until the fish turns opaque along the backbone, 8 to 10 minutes.

Stir the soy sauce and sugar together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.  Pour over the steamed fish.  Heat the vegetable and sesame oils in a small skillet or saucepan over high heat just until they begin to smoke.  Pour the hot oil over the fish. Stand back and watch it sizzle.  Serve with steamed rice.

             Steamed Whole Lobster With Dried Tangerine Peel

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bundle dried bean thread noodles - (2 oz)
  2             pieces  dried tangerine peel - (abt 1 1/2" square)
                        = (or 1 tbspn grated lemon zest)
     1/3           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  3        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  salted black beans -- rinsed, drained,
                        and coarsely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1                     live lobster - (2 lbs)
                        = (or two 8-oz lobster tails)

Pour enough warm water over the bean thread noodles and tangerine peel in separate bowls to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 10 minutes.  Drain the noodles, lay them out on a cutting board and cut them in half crosswise.  Spread the noodles out on a large heatproof steaming dish.  Drain the tangerine peel and mince.

Prepare the seasonings:  Stir the stock, cilantro, garlic, oil, oyster-flavored sauce, black beans, salt, sugar and tangerine peel together in a medium bowl until the sugar is dissolved.

If using a live lobster, cut off the claws and legs with kitchen scissors or knife.  Give each claw a swift whack with the back of a heavy cleaver to crack the shell.  (Be careful not to damage the shape of the claw; just crack the shell so the meat will be easy to remove after steaming.)  Discard the legs, and pull the tail off of the body with a sharp downward quarter-turn.

Butterfly the tails:  Place the tail, shell-side up, on a cutting board.  Using a large, sturdy knife and starting from the thick end of the tail, cut through the top shell and into the meat.  Donít cut all the way through to the bottom, thinner shell.  (If using the lobster tails in place of the whole lobster, follow the instructions for butterflying the tails.)

Reassemble the lobster parts over the noodles and spread the seasonings over the tail meat and claws.  (If using the lobster tails, arrange them side by side over the noodles.)

Prepare a wok for steaming.  Set the plate into the steamer basket, cover the wok and steam until the lobster is cooked through, about 8 minutes.  Serve directly from the steaming plate.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  frying chicken - (abt 3 lbs) -- cut into two
                        leg/breast halves
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
                        = (or dark soy sauce)
  12                    lettuce cups
                        === FOR THE DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  grated ginger
  3                     green onions -- trimmed, minced
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2           teaspoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2         tablespoon  vegetable oil

Arrange the chicken halves, skin-side up and side by side, in a heatproof glass pie plate.  Rub the skin with 1 tablespoon soy sauce.  Let stand for 15 minutes.

Prepare a wok for steaming.  Place the pie plate in the steaming basket and steam over high heat until the chicken is no longer pink near the bone, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Dipping Sauce:  Stir the grated ginger, green onions, sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic, ground ginger, salt and pepper together in a small heat proof bowl.  Heat the vegetable oil in a small skillet just until it begins to smoke.  Carefully pour the hot oil into the ginger-soy mixture.  (The mixture might sizzle.)  Stir well and let stand until cool.

Remove the plate of chicken from the steamer and let cool slightly.  Strip the meat from the bones and cut the meat into bite size pieces.  Place on a serving platter with the lettuce cups alongside it.  Pass the platter and dipping sauce, allowing guests to make their own lettuce cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  chili sauce
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  rice vinegar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
     3/4         pound  catfish fillets
                        = (or other white fish fillets,
                        such as sea bass or striped bass)
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
                        Vegetable oil -- for shallow frying
  3             slices  peeled ginger - (quarter size)
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2          teaspoons  water
  2                     cilantro sprigs
  1                     leek, white part only -- cut thin strips

Stir the stock, sugar, chili sauce, garlic, ginger, rice vinegar, salt and pepper together in a medium bowl until the sugar and salt are dissolved.

For the Dish:  Remove any bones or skin from the catfish and cut into about equal pieces.  Pat them dry.

Beat the egg lightly in a wide shallow bowl.  Spread the cornstarch out on to a plate.  Dust each piece of fish with cornstarch, then dip in the beaten egg to coat it evenly.  Allow any excess egg to drip back into the bowl, then return the egg-coated fish to the cornstarch and turn to coat all sides evenly.

Place a wide, deep skillet over medium heat and pour in enough oil to fill 1/4 inch.  When the oil is shimmering, add the ginger slices and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Carefully slide the fish into the hot oil.  Fry, turning the pieces once, until evenly golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Remove all but 1 tablespoon of oil from pan.  (Or, if you are not comfortable draining hot oil, simply use 1 tablespoon of the frying oil in a fresh pan.)  Place the pan over medium-high heat.  When hot, pour in the sauce and bring to a boil.  Stir in the dissolved cornstarch and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens.

Arrange the fish on a serving platter and spoon the sauce around the pieces.  Scatter the cilantro and leeks over the fish and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the Sauce:  Mash the moke stick, plum sauce, brown sugar water and soy sauce in a medium bowl to a think paste.  Add the vinegar, wine and sugar and stir until sugar is dissolved.

For the Dish:  Heat the oil in a wide stainless steel pan or non-reactive skillet, large enough to hold the pork in a single layer, over medium heat until hot.  Lift the chops from the marinade, shake off excess liquid and carefully lay them into the oil.  Pan-fry until cooked through, about 2 minutes on each side.  Drain the chops on paper towels.  Remove pan from heat.

Spoon off all but 1 tablespoon of the oil.  Return pan to high heat.  When the oil is hot, add both types of onions.  Stir-fry until tender, about 2 minutes.  Add the sauce.  Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce heat to medium and cook until the liquid is reduced by 1/3.

Slip the chops into the sauce and cook until heated through, about 30 seconds.  Serve immediately, spooning some of the sauce over each chop.

  3             slices  candied pineapple

  4                     dried figs

  1                cup  bread flour
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  chilled vegetable shortening or lard
     1/4           cup  water
                        === FOR THE INNER DOUGH ===
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  wheat starch
     1/3           cup  chilled vegetable shortening or lard
                        === FOR THE CAKES ===
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten

Place the candied pineapple and papaya and dried figs in the work bowl of a food processor and process until the fruit is chopped.  Scrape the fruit into a mixing bowl.  Add the glutinous rice flour, sugar, water, sesame seeds and oil and mix until the flour is incorporated.

For the Outer Dough:  Sift the bread flour, 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup sugar together into a bowl.  With a pastry blender or 2 table knives, cut the shortening into the flour until the shortening is the size of small peas.  Stir in the water and knead briefly to form a soft dough.  Divide the dough in half.  Roll each half into a 15-inch cylinder.  Cut each cylinder crosswise into 1-inch pieces.  Cover the dough with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.

For the Inner Dough:  Sift the 3/4 cup all-purpose flour and the wheat starch together into a bowl.  With a pastry blender or 2 table knives, cut the shortening into the flour until the shortening is the size of small peas.  Knead briefly to form a smooth dough.  Divide the dough into 30 pieces and cover as described above.

For the Cakes:  Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Shape the pastries:  Flatten a piece of the outer dough into a 3-inch circle.  Flatten a piece of inner dough to the same size and place on top of the circle of outer dough.  Roll the stacked doughs up into a cylinder and roll the cylinder out with the palms of your hands to 4 inches long.  Coil the dough into a round patty, then flatten the patty with your hand or rolling pin to make a 4-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick.

Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the filling in the center.  Bring the edges of the dough over the filling to enclose it and pinch the edges together to seal.  Place the bun seam-side down on a work surface; using a rolling pin flatten into a 4 inch circle.  Place bun onto a parchment- paper lined baking sheet.  (You will need two sheets to fit all 30 buns.)  With a paring knife, make two 1/2-inch slits in the top of the dough.  Brush with the egg yolk.  Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.

Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.  Cool slightly before serving.

This recipe yields 30 cakes.

  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh red or green jalapeÒo chiles
  1 1/2           cups  sliced (1") napa cabbage
     1/3           cup  carrot -- thinly sliced
                        on the bias
     1/3           cup  sliced bamboo shoots
     1/4           cup  chicken stock or mushroom vegetable broth
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chili garlic sauce
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/4      teaspoon  sesame oil

Place the pork in a 2-quart pan with the water, ginger, green onions, sugar and salt; bring to a boil.  Adjust the heat so the liquid is simmering, cover the pot and simmer until the pork is almost cooked through, about 8 minutes.  Set the pork aside and discard the cooking liquid.

For the Smoking:  Line the inside of a wok and the inside of the wok lid with aluminum foil.  Make the smoking mixture: Stir the tea leaves, rice and sugar together in the lined wok, then spread evenly over the bottom of the wok.  Set a round rack over the smoking mixture about 3 inches above the smoking mixture and set the pork on the center of the rack.

Place the wok, uncovered, over high heat.  When the rice mixture begins to smoke, cover the wok.  Reduce the heat to medium and smoke until the pork turns a rich, deep brown, about 25 minutes.  Turn off the heat and let stand for 5 minutes before removing the lid.  Discard the smoking mixture when it cools.

Let the pork cool briefly, then cut into 1/8-inch slices.

For the Stir Fry:  Clean the wok and heat it over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the garlic, ginger and chile and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the pork, cabbage, carrot and bamboo shoots.  Stir-fry until the cabbage is wilted, about 1 minute.

Add the stock, soy sauce and chili garlic sauce and bring to a boil.  Adjust the heat so the sauce is simmering.  Cover the wok and simmer until the carrot is tender, about 3 minutes.  Pour in the dissolved cornstarch and cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 30 seconds.  Stir in the sesame oil, scoop onto a warm serving platter and serve hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2       package  soft tofu - (14-oz pkg) -- drained
     1/2         pound  uncooked shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and minced
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
     1/4           cup  grated carrot
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE ROLLS ===
  8                     sheets Japanese nori -- cut in half
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1                     egg
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

Mash the tofu and place it in a clean towel.  Gather the towel around the tofu and squeeze firmly to remove the excess liquid from the tofu.  Shake the tofu into a bowl and stir in the shrimp, cilantro, carrot, cornstarch, salt and pepper until well blended.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

For the Rolls:  Place a half sheet of nori on the work surface with one of the long sides closest to you.  Spoon 2 tablespoons of the tofu mixture in a band 1 inch from the edge closest to you, stopping 1 inch from the sides.  Fold the bottom edge of nori over filling, then fold the left and right sides over that.  Roll up jellyroll style into a compact cylinder.  Wet the top edge and press to seal.  Place onto a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining filling and nori.

Make the batter:  Stir the flour and baking powder together in a medium bowl.  Whisk the egg, water and 1 tablespoon oil together in a separate bowl just until blended.  Stir the egg mixture into the dry ingredients until slightly lumpy.  The batter should be just thick enough to coat the nori rolls lightly.  Let the batter rest for 10 minutes.

Pour enough oil into a 2-quart pan to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Dip each roll in batter, letting the excess batter drip back into the bowl, then immediately slip the roll into the hot oil.  Deep-fry 2 rolls at a time until the batter is golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining rolls.  Slice each roll diagonally into 2 pieces and serve warm with your favorite dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 8 rolls.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     lemongrass stalks, bottom 6" only
  8             slices  peeled ginger - (quarter size)
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated lime zest
  1                cup  fish sauce
  2 3/4           cups  water
  1                cup  palm sugar
                        = (or 1 packed cup light brown sugar)
                        === FOR THE SALAD ===
  1                cup  unsweetened coconut -- toasted
     1/4           cup  dried red chili flakes
  1                cup  thinly-sliced green beans
  1                cup  thinly-sliced English cucumber
  1                cup  bean sprouts
  1                     grapefruit -- peeled, segments
                        removed from  membranes and diced
  1              small  green apple -- cored, and
                        cut into small cubes
  1                     lemongrass stalk, bottom 6" only -- minced
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated lime zest
     1/2         pound  cooked large shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and tails left intact
  4               cups  cooked long-grain rice

Bring the 3 stalks lemongrass, ginger, 2 tablespoons lime zest, fish sauce, water and palm sugar to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan over high heat.  Adjust the heat so the sauce is simmering and simmer, uncovered, until the sauce is dark and reduced to a thick syrup, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain into a sauce bowl that can be passed at the table.  Discard the solids, cover the bowl and set it aside.

For the Salad:  Arrange small piles of the salad ingredients (toasted coconut, chili flakes, green beans, cucumber, bean sprouts, grapefruit, apple, lemongrass and lime zest) on a large serving platter.  Place one cup of rice on each guestís plate and divide the cooked shrimp evenly among the plates.  Let the guests add the accompaniments they prefer to their plates.  Pass the sauce separately, for guests to drizzle a little (1 to 2 tablespoons) over their plate, then toss the ingredients together.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  vegetable stock
                        = (or canned vegetable broth)
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  Chinese black vinegar

     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  2             ounces  Chinese long beans -- cut 2" lengths
  4                     fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed,

                 Translucent Shrimp Dumpling - {Har-Gau}

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dim Sum

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  wheat starch
  1                cup  boiling water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        = (or vegetable shortening)
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
     1/2         pound  raw medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped bamboo shoots
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped cilantro
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DIPPING SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  chili garlic sauce
  1         tablespoon  Chinese black vinegar
                        = (or balsamic vinegar)
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  sugar

Place the wheat starch in a medium mixing bowl; pour in the boiling water, stirring with fork or chopsticks until the mixture forms a dough.  It is very important that the water is boiling.

Once the dough has cooled enough to handle, place it on a work surface and make a slight dent in the center.  Add the vegetable oil or shortening into the center.  Knead until the oil is incorporated and the dough feels satiny and has a shiny appearance.

For the Filling:  Pat the shrimp and bamboo shoots with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture.  In a bowl, combine the shrimp, bamboo shoots, cilantro, sesame oil, cornstarch, salt, sugar and white pepper; mix well.

For the Dipping Sauce:  Combine the soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, black vinegar, sesame oil and sugar in a small bowl; stir until the sugar is dissolved.

For the Dumpling Preparation:  Divide the dough in half and roll each piece into a 10-inch cylinder.  Cut each cylinder crosswise into ten 1-inch pieces, using your hands to roll each piece into a ball.  Cover with a damp towel while forming each dumpling.

Using a rolling pin or tortilla press, roll each piece of dough into a 3-inch circle.  With your fingers, make the edges of the circle slightly thinner.  Place a heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center of the circle; bring the edges together to form a half-circle.  Pinch to seal.  Place the dumpling on a 9-inch glass pie plate and cover with a damp paper towel while preparing the remaining dumplings.  Space the dumplings so they are not touching.

Prepare a wok for steaming.  Place the glass pie plate with dumplings into the steamer, cover and steam over medium-high heat until filling is cooked through, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Serve dumplings the directly from the steamer with the dipping sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 5 servings.

                Tricolour Melon Salad With Coconut Prawns

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  prepared wasabi paste
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR THE SALAD ===
     1/4         pound  large sea scallops
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  1                cup  diced (1") honeydew melon
  1                cup  diced (1") cantaloupe
     1/2           cup  diced (1") watermelon
     1/2           cup  Japanese breadcrumbs (panko)
     1/2           cup  shredded unsweetened coconut
  1         tablespoon  white sesame seeds
  2                     eggs whites
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
                        Cornstarch -- for dusting
  8                     uncooked large shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and tails left intact
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chopped macadamia nuts

Stir the mayonnaise, rice vinegar, honey, wasabi, sesame oil and salt together in a small bowl until well blended.

For the Salad:  In a small bowl, combine the scallops and cornstarch, stir until scallops are coated set aside.

Bring a small pan of water to a boil.  Slip the scallops into the water and simmer until opaque, about 2 minutes.  Drain and chill until ready to assemble the salad.  Toss the three melons together in a bowl.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Stir the bread crumbs, coconut and sesame seeds together in a wide shallow bowl.  Whisk the egg whites in a separate bowl until frothy.

Pour enough oil into a 2-quart saucepan to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.

While the oil is heating, coat the shrimp:  Dip the shrimp in the cornstarch to coat them lightly.  Tap off the excess.  Holding a shrimp by the tail, dip in the egg white so it covers the meat but not the tail, then let the excess egg white drip back into the bowl.  Coat the shrimp on both sides with the crumb mixture, patting lightly to help the crumbs adhere.  Repeat with the remaining shrimp and coating.

Deep-fry the shrimp, half at a time, until the coating is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Sprinkle evenly with salt.  Repeat with the remaining shrimp.

To serve, pour the dressing over the melon and toss to coat.  Mound the fruit on a serving plate; surround with the scallops and shrimp and sprinkle with macademia nuts.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Stir the mayonnaise, rice vinegar, honey, wasabi, sesame oil and salt together in a small bowl until well blended.

<DirT>
For the Salad:  In a small bowl, combine the scallops and cornstarch, stir until scallops are coated set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring a small pan of water to a boil.  Slip the scallops into the water and simmer until opaque, about 2 minutes.  Drain and chill until ready to assemble the salad.  Toss the three melons together in a bowl.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir the bread crumbs, coconut and sesame seeds together in a wide shallow bowl.  Whisk the egg whites in a separate bowl until frothy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour enough oil into a 2-quart saucepan to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the oil is heating, coat the shrimp:  Dip the shrimp in the cornstarch to coat them lightly.  Tap off the excess.  Holding a shrimp by the tail, dip in the egg white so it covers the meat but not the tail, then let the excess egg white drip back into the bowl.  Coat the shrimp on both sides with the crumb mixture, patting lightly to help the crumbs adhere.  Repeat with the remaining shrimp and coating.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Deep-fry the shrimp, half at a time, until the coating is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Sprinkle evenly with salt.  Repeat with the remaining shrimp.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, pour the dressing over the melon and toss to coat.  Mound the fruit on a serving plate; surround with the scallops and shrimp and sprinkle with macademia nuts.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  8                     eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  water
     1/8      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
  4                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        sliced thinly
     3/4           cup  bean sprouts
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/4         pound  Char Siu -- chopped

Stir the water, oyster-flavored sauce, soy sauce, cornstarch, honey and rice wine together in a small saucepan.  Set aside.

For the Dish:  In a large bowl, beat the eggs, water, and five-spice powder until well blended.  Set aside a small amount of the green onions for topping the omelet, then stir the remaining green onions along with the bean sprouts and garlic into the eggs.

Heat an 8- to 9-inch non-stick frying pan over medium heat until hot.  Pour in 1 teaspoon of the oil and swirl to coat the bottom.  When hot, add 1/3 of egg mixture (about 2/3 cup) into the pan.  Cook, without stirring, until the edges begin to set, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Carefully turn to cook the other side until light brown.  Slide omelet onto a warm plate and cover with foil, shiny-side down, to keep warm.  Repeat with the remaining egg mixture to make a total of 3 omelets.

Heat the sauce, stirring, over medium-high heat, until the sauce boils and thickens.

Place one omelet on a serving platter.  Set aside about 3 tablespoons of the chopped char siu and scatter half of the remaining char siu over the omelet.  Top with another omelet and the second half of the char siu.  Top with the third omelet.  Drizzle the warm sauce over the omelets and sprinkle the reserved char siu and green onions over the sauce.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  1         tablespoon  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  2          teaspoons  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  brown bean sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  1                     dried black mushroom
  1                cup  fish mousse
  4                     cilantro sprigs -- minced
  1                     green onion -- trimmed, minced
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1                     trout - (abt 1/4 lb) -- boned, and
                        the head left on
                        Cornstarch -- for dusting
  4                     uncooked medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and butterflied
  1                     salmon fillet - (abt 4 oz) -- cut thick strips
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  minced onions

Prepare the sauce:  Stir the chicken stock, rice wine, oyster-flavored sauce, brown bean sauce and sesame oil together in a small bowl.

For the Filling:  Pour enough warm water over the mushroom in a small bowl to cover it completely.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain.  Discard the stem and mince the cap.

Make the filling:  Stir the minced black mushroom, fish mousse, cilantro and green onion together in a small bowl until blended.

For the Dish:  Pat the inside of the fish dry with paper towels.  Dust the inside of the trout with cornstarch to coat it lightly.  Spread the filling in an even layer over the inside, then top the filling with an even layer of overlapping shrimp and salmon strips.  Make sure the filling is enclosed, then wrap the fish in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Remove the plastic wrap and dust the fish with cornstarch to coat it lightly.  Shake off the excess.  Heat a flame-proof baking pan or ovenproof non-stick skillet over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the bottom.  Lay the fish into the pan and pan-fry, turning once, until golden brown, 4 to 4 1/2 minutes per side.  Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the filling is cooked through, about 20 minutes.

Transfer the fish to a serving platter with a large heavy-duty spatula.  Drain any excess oil from the pan and return the pan to the stove over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and stir until wilted, about 2 minutes.  Pour in the sauce and cook, scraping any browned bits on the bottom of the pan, until the sauce is hot, 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Slice the fish into 1 1/2-inch pieces, spoon the sauce over the fish and serve.

                         Twice Cooked Long Beans

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/4         pound  ground pork
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  chili bean sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  sesame oil
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2               cups  vegetable oil
     3/4         pound  long beans -- ends trimmed,
                        and cut into 2" lengths
     1/2           cup  julienned daikon
  2        tablespoons  shredded Sichuan preserved vegetables -- (optional)

Stir the soy sauce and cornstarch together in a medium bowl until the cornstarch is dissolved.  Toss the pork gently in the marinade until coated.  Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes.

For the Sauce:  Stir the chicken stock, soy sauce, sugar, garlic, chili bean sauce and sesame oil together in a separate bowl until the sugar is dissolved.

For the Dish:  Bring oil in a 2-quart saucepan to 350 degrees over medium-high heat.  Carefully slide the green beans into the oil and cook, stirring continuously, until their skin is wrinkled, about 5 minutes.  Transfer the beans with a slotted spoon or wire skimmer to paper towels to drain.  Reserve the oil.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Pour in 2 teaspoons of the reserved oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Slide the pork into the wok and stir-fry until the meat is broken up and changes color, about 2 minutes.  Add the green beans, diakon, sauce and preserved vegetables to the wok and cook, stir-frying until heated thorough, about 2 minutes.  Scoop the contents of the wok onto a serving plate and serve immediately.

                         Vegetable Cabbage Rolls

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetarian oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  brown bean paste
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  canned vegetable broth
                        = (or water)
  1         tablespoon  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE ROLLS ===
  6                     dried black mushrooms
     1/4           cup  dried shredded gluten
                        = (or modified vegetable protein)
  6                     napa cabbage leaves -- tough ribs removed
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1                cup  shelled soy or green beans -- trimmed to 2"
                        lengths
  1             medium  carrot -- cut thin strips
  6                     cilantro sprigs

In a small bowl, combine the vegetarian oyster-flavored sauce, brown bean paste, sesame oil and sugar; stir until the sugar is dissolved.

For the Sauce:  In a small bowl combine the broth, rice wine, cornstarch, salt and pepper; mix well and set aside.

For the Rolls:  In separate bowls, soak the mushrooms and gluten in warm water to cover until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain the mushrooms, discard the stems and thinly slice the caps.  Drain the gluten and squeeze to remove the excess water.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Cook the cabbage leaves, 2 at a time, until tender and pliable, about 1 minute.  Remove from the water with a slotted spoon and drain.

Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the garlic; stir-fry until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the mushrooms, gluten, soybeans, carrot and seasonings to the wok; cook, stirring until the carrot begins to wilt, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Remove the mixture from the wok and cool in a bowl.

Assemble the roll:  Place one cabbage leaf on a clean work surface with the stem end closest to you.  Place 2 heaping tablespoons of the filling over the lower third of the leaf and top with one cilantro sprig.  Fold the part of the leaf that is closest to you over the filling, then fold the right and left sides over that.  Roll firmly to completely enclose the filling; continue rolling into a compact roll.  Place the roll into a heat-proof glass pie dish seam-side down.  Repeat with the remaining leaves and fillings.

Prepare a wok for steaming.  Place the glass pie dish into the steamer; steam over high heat until the center of roll is hot, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove the dish from the steamer; carefully transfer the cabbage rolls to a serving platter.  Using a paring knife, slice a 1 1/2-inch slit in the top of each roll and gently push each end to expose the filling.

Pour any liquid remaining in the steaming dish into a wok.  Place the wok over high heat and add the sauce.  Bring to a boil, stirring, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 30 seconds.  Pour the sauce over the rolls and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  firm tofu - (14 oz) -- drained
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  4                     water chestnuts -- diced finely
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch

  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
     1/3           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Chinese black vinegar
                        = (or balsamic vinegar)
  1         tablespoon  vegetarian oyster-flavoured sauce
  2          teaspoons  sugar
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2             pieces  large round bean curd sheets
  2                     sheet Japanese nori
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  flour -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  4                     fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        and caps sliced thinly
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced carrot strips
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced snow peas strips
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced bamboo shoots
  1                     green onion -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" lengths
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water

Mash the tofu and place it in a clean towel.  Gather the towel around the tofu and squeeze firmly to remove the excess liquid from the tofu.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and swirl to coat the sides.

Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the tofu, water chestnuts, cornstarch, oyster-flavored sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds and salt.  Cook, stirring, until the flavors are blended and the mixture is lightly thickened, about 2 minutes.  Remove and cool to room temperature.

For the Seasonings:  Stir the water, soy sauces, vinegar, oyster-flavored sauce and sugar together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.

For the Dish:  Rinse the bean curd sheets under cold water, drain and cover with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out.  Cut two approximately 12-inch squares from each bean curd sheet.  Center one nori sheet over each square of bean curd sheet.  (The bean curd sheet should extend about 2 inches from each side of the nori sheet.)

Divide the filling between the two nori sheets, molding each batch of filling into a fish shape about as wide as the nori sheet.  Starting at the bottom, roll the filling up in the bean curd and nori sheets, maintaining the shape of the fish as you do.  Moisten the top edge of the bean curd sheet with some of the flour paste and press lightly to seal.  Tuck the bean curd sheet that extends from the 'head' of the fish underneath the fish; make a 'tail' from the bean curd sheet at the other end of the fish by scoring it with a knife.  Sprinkle 'fish' skin with salt.

Heat a medium skillet over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom.  Slip the tofu 'fish' into the pan and pan-fry, turning once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.

Transfer the fish to a cutting board. Add the mushrooms and carrot to the skillet and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the snow peas, bamboo shoots and green onion.  Cook, stirring for 1 minute.

Pour the seasonings into the skillet and bring to a boil.  Pour in the dissolved cornstarch and cook until the sauce boils and thickens, 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Pour the sauce onto a serving plate.  Cut the tofu 'fish' into 1-inch slices with a sharp knife and slide them onto the sauce carefully to retain their shape.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Mash the tofu and place it in a clean towel.  Gather the towel around the tofu and squeeze firmly to remove the excess liquid from the tofu.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and swirl to coat the sides.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the tofu, water chestnuts, cornstarch, oyster-flavored sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds and salt.  Cook, stirring, until the flavors are blended and the mixture is lightly thickened, about 2 minutes.  Remove and cool to room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Seasonings:  Stir the water, soy sauces, vinegar, oyster-flavored sauce and sugar together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Dish:  Rinse the bean curd sheets under cold water, drain and cover with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out.  Cut two approximately 12-inch squares from each bean curd sheet.  Center one nori sheet over each square of bean curd sheet.  (The bean curd sheet should extend about 2 inches from each side of the nori sheet.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the filling between the two nori sheets, molding each batch of filling into a fish shape about as wide as the nori sheet.  Starting at the bottom, roll the filling up in the bean curd and nori sheets, maintaining the shape of the fish as you do.  Moisten the top edge of the bean curd sheet with some of the flour paste and press lightly to seal.  Tuck the bean curd sheet that extends from the &apos;head&apos; of the fish underneath the fish; make a &apos;tail&apos; from the bean curd sheet at the other end of the fish by scoring it with a knife.  Sprinkle &apos;fish&apos; skin with salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a medium skillet over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom.  Slip the tofu &apos;fish&apos; into the pan and pan-fry, turning once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the fish to a cutting board. Add the mushrooms and carrot to the skillet and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the snow peas, bamboo shoots and green onion.  Cook, stirring for 1 minute.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the seasonings into the skillet and bring to a boil.  Pour in the dissolved cornstarch and cook until the sauce boils and thickens, 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Pour the sauce onto a serving plate.  Cut the tofu &apos;fish&apos; into 1-inch slices with a sharp knife and slide them onto the sauce carefully to retain their shape.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1           teaspoon  chili garlic sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  1              small  fresh Thai chili -- thinly sliced
                        === FOR THE RICE-PAPER ROLLS ===
  2             ounces  dried rice stick noodles - (1/2 pkg)
  3               cups  shredded cooked chicken
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  chopped cilantro
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  12                    rice paper rounds - (7" dia)
  12                    cooked medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and -- cut in half
                        horizontally
  12                    red-leaf lettuce leaves -- soft upper ends only
  3                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into slivers
  12            sprigs  cilantro sprigs
                        Mint leaves -- for garnish

For the Rice-Paper Rolls:  Bring a medium pot of water to a boil.  Cook rice stick noodles for 1 minute until tender.  Drain, rinse in cold water, drain again and cut into 3-inch lengths.

While the noodles are soaking, make the Dipping Sauce:  Stir the rice vinegar, lime juice, fish sauce, chili garlic sauce and sugar together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.  Set aside.

Toss the chicken, fish sauce, sesame oil, chopped cilantro and black pepper in a medium bowl until the chicken is coated evenly.

Make the rolls:  Immerse a rice paper round in hot water just until it begins to soften, about 10 seconds, then lay it out on the work surface.  Let stand until it becomes soft and pliable, about 1 minute.  Place 2 shrimp halves, tail to head, in the center of the rice paper.  Place a lettuce leaf on top of the shrimp.  Place about 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture over the lettuce.  Top with a small mound of the rice stick noodles, 2 to 3 slivers of green onion and a cilantro sprig.  Fold the right and left sides of the wrapper over the filling, then, starting at the bottom, roll the wrapper and filling into a neat, compact roll.  Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.  Serve the bundles on a platter, garnished with the mint leaves.  Offer the dipping sauce at the table.

This recipe yields 12 rolls.
