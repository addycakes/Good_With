                        === ROASTED CORN RELISH ===
  1                cup  roasted corn kernels
  3        tablespoons  finely chopped red onion

     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste

Ladle the sauce onto a platter, slice the fish into 3/4-inch thick slices, drizzle with more of the sauce and top with the corn relish and chopped cilantro.

  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  blue cornmeal
  1              pinch  salt

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BRANDADE ===
  1              pound  salt cod
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped

                        === BRANDADE FRITTERS ===
  3               cups  canola oil
  2               cups  seasoned all-purpose flour
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten,
                        and seasoned
  2               cups  Japanese bread crumbs -- mixed with
  1                cup  finely-chopped almonds
                        === OVEN ROASTED TOMATO SAUCE ===
  8                     plum tomatoes -- halved, seeded
  4        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2                     shallots -- coarsely chopped
  1                cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  clam broth
  10                    piquillo peppers
  2          teaspoons  harissa
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

                        for garnish
  1         tablespoon  cilantro

Brandade:  In a large bowl cover the dried cod with cold water and let soak in the refrigerator for 12 to 48 hours (depending on the saltiness of the cod) changing the water frequently.  Bring a medium pot of water to a simmer.  Remove the salt cod from the soaking water and place in the simmering water.  Poach for 8 to10 minutes, let cool in liquid for another 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from poaching liquid, remove any bones and coarsely chop.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and shallots to the pan and cook until soft.  Remove the garlic and shallots to a plate.

Place cream in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer.  Place the poached and chopped cod in a food processor, add shallot-garlic mixture and half of the warm cream and process until smooth.  Add the riced potatoes, remaining cream and process until just combined.  With motor running add the oil.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Assemble:  Ladle some of the Oven Roasted Tomato Sauce into a medium shallow bowl.  Place 3 of the Brandade Fritters on top and garnish with chopped parsley.

Brandade Fritters:  Heat oil in a medium saucepan to 360 degrees.  Place a heaping saucespoon of brandade in flour.  Coat and place in egg, then in bread crumbs.  Fry fritters until the coating is lightly golden brown.

Oven Roasted Tomato Sauce:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Rub tomatoes with 2 tablespoons of oil, place in a baking dish and roast until soft, about 20 to 25 minutes.

Heat the remaining oil in a medium saucepan, add the shallots and cook until soft.  Add the wine and cook until reduced.  Add the clam broth, tomatoes and their juices and peppers.  Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes.

Place in a food processor or use a burr mixer and puree until smooth.  Add the harissa and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Finish with herbs.

Add the stock and cook until reduced by half.  Whisk in the mustards and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Remove from the heat and stir in the mint.

Serve with Braised Napa Cabbage and Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes.

Braised Napa Cabbage:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place cabbage in a roasting pan, stir in the vinegar, honey, and chicken stock and season with salt and pepper.  Cover with foil and roast in the oven until wilted, about 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and stir in the mint.

Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes:  Place the potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with cold water, and add 2 tablespoons of salt.  Bring to a boil and cook until soft.  Drain well and place back in the pan over low heat.  Add the cream and green garlic butter and mash until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Green Garlic Butter:  Place the butter, garlic, and herbs in a food processor and process until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.

     1/2           cup  grated white Cheddar
                        === POBLANO PEPPER SAUCE ===
  3                     poblano peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        seeded and chopped
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  3        tablespoons  chopped cilantro

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  olive oil

Brush bass with olive oil on both sides and season with salt and pepper.  Heat saute pan or grill pan over high heat until smoking.  Grill, skin-side down, for 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown.  Turn over and continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes for medium-well doneness.

Place a heaping mound of Yellow Pepper Grits onto 4 dinner plates.  Place a fillet on top of each and drizzle with the Poblano Sauce.

Remove the skin and seeds from the peppers.  Place 2 of the peppers in a food processor and process until smooth.  Cut the remaining pepper into fine dice and set aside.

Place the hominy in a food processor and process until smooth.  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onions, season with salt and pepper, and cook until soft.

Add the garlic and cook for an additional 2 minutes.  Add the hominy, yellow pepper puree, and heavy cream.  Season with salt, pepper, and chipotle puree.  Cook for 10 minutes and fold in the diced yellow peppers and cheddar.

  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
                        === GRILLED FONTINA-MUSHROOM SANDWICH ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2         pound  cremini mushrooms -- thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Place tomatoes in a large baking dish and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and sprinkle with the garlic, season with salt and pepper.  Roast for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft.

Heat the remaining olive oil in a medium stock pot over medium heat.  Add the onions and carrots and cook until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the roasted tomatoes, garlic, and the juices that have accumulated.  Add the stock and fresh thyme and cook for 20 minutes.

Place the cream in a small saucepan over medium high heat and cook until reduced by half.

Transfer the mixture to a blender and blend until smooth, strain into a clean saucepan over low heat, add the reduced cream, and cook for 5 minutes.

For the Grilled Fontina-Mushroom Sandwich:  Heat olive oil in a large saute pan, add the mushrooms, and cook until golden brown.  Season with salt and pepper, and stir in the sage.

Brush the bread on 1 side with the butter.  Turn 4 of the slices over on a work surface.  Divide the cheese among the slices then divide the mushrooms on top of the cheese.  Cover with the remaining 4 slices of bread, butter-side up.

Heat a frying pan over medium heat.  Add the sandwiches and cook, turning once, until golden, about 2 minutes per side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === GREEN ONION PESTO MASHED POTATOES ===
  4             pounds  baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled, and
                        cut into large cubes
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter

                        === GREEN ONION PESTO ===
  2        tablespoons  pumpkin seeds
  2                     garlic cloves
  6                     spinach leaves
  3        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  6                     green onions -- coarsely chopped
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  honey

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Whisk together the whole cumin, lemon juice, 1/2 cup olive oil, honey, and pepper in a medium baking dish.  Add the chicken and turn to coat.  Cover, and marinate for 1 hour in the refrigerator.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Heat a large ovenproof saute pan over medium high heat.  Remove chicken from marinade and wipe off any excess.  Combine the ground cumin, cotija, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.  Dust the chicken on the skin side with the mixture.

Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet.  Place the chicken, skin-side down, in the pan and cook until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Turn over and place in the oven.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until just cooked through.

Place both vinegars in a separate medium saucepan and cook until reduced by 1/2.  Add the sugar and mango puree, and reduce until the sauce coats the back of a spoon thickly.

Add the reduced chicken stock and cook for 10 minutes over medium heat until thickened, stirring occasionally.  Season with salt and pepper.

Green Onion Pesto Mashed Potatoes:  Place potatoes in a large pot of salted water and bring to a boil.  Cook until soft, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Drain well and run through a food mill into a large bowl.  Stir in the butter and cream and mix until combined.  Swirl in the Green Onion Pesto and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  (Makes 6 to 8 servings)

Green Onion Pesto:  Combine pumpkin seeds, garlic, spinach, and cilantro in food processor and process until smooth.  Add green onions and lime juice, and process until smooth.

With the motor running, slowly add the oil.  Add the Parmesan, honey, salt, and pepper, and pulse several times until combined.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1 1/4           cups  heavy cream
  6             ounces  soft goat cheese

Grilled Flank Steak:  Combine the olive oil and garlic in a large shallow baking dish.  Add the flank steak and turn to coat on both sides.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours or overnight.  Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling.

Heat the grill to high heat.  Remove the steak from the marinade and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Grill for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for rare to medium-rare doneness.  Let rest 10 minutes before slicing across

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium saucepan.  Add the shallot, remaining chopped garlic, carrots and celery and cook until softened.  Add wine and reduce by half.  Add chicken and veal stock and cook until reduced by half.

Strain the mixture into a clean medium saucepan.  Add the toasted garlic, parsley, peppers and onion and cook for 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and spoon over the steak.

Goat Cheese Potato Puree:  Place goat cheese in a small food processor with 1/4 cup of the heavy cream and process until smooth.  Rice potatoes into a large bowl.  Mix in the butter and 1 cup of the heavy cream.  Fold in the goat cheese mixture and season with salt and pepper to taste.

  2                     yellow bell peppers -- cold smoked,
                        peeled and seeded
     1/2                canned chipotle

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Season the pork with salt and pepper and brush with 1 cup of the bbq sauce, place in a medium saucepan.  Pour the stock over and bring to a simmer on top of the stove.

Cover and place in the oven to braise for 1 hour, or until cooked through.  Remove from the cooking liquid.  Bring the cooking liquid to a boil on top of the stove and reduce by half.

Preheat a grill pan until almost smoking.  Add the pork, brush with the reserved bbq sauce and grill for 2 to 3 minutes on each side or until a crust forms.  Remove, let rest and slice on the bias into 1/4-inch slices.

Lay the tortillas on a flat surface.  Place 1 tablespoon of each cheese over 1 side of each tortilla.  Place a few slices of onion over the cheese, then 3 to 4 slices of potatoes.  Add the sliced pork to the cooking liquid to moisten then place 3 to 4 slices of pork on top of the cheese, place a little more of the cheese on top of the pork, then some of the cilantro.  Fold the tortilla over and press down slightly.

Brush the tops of the tortillas with some of the oil and place on a lightly oiled baking sheet.  Bake in a 350 degree oven until the tortillas are lightly golden brown and the cheese has melted, 5 to 7 minutes.

Tomatillo-Roasted Red Pepper Relish:  Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl.  Let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Smoked Red Pepper Sauce:  In a blender, combine the peppers, onion, chipotle and lime juice and blend until smooth.  With the blender running, add the olive oil in a thin stream until the sauce is emulsified.  Season to taste.

Smoked Yellow Pepper Sauce:  In a blender, combine the peppers, onion, chipotle and lime juice and blend until smooth.  With the blender running, add the olive oil in a thin stream until the sauce is emulsified.  Add the sugar and salt and pepper to taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- coarsely chopped
  1              large  carrot -- coarsely chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- coarsely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2                     live lobsters - (1 1/2 lbs ea)
  3 1/2           cups  water -- divided
     1/4           cup  dry sherry
  2               cups  white wine
  8             sprigs  parsley
  8             sprigs  cilantro
  1                     bay leaf
  8                     white peppercorns
  2                     roasted poblano peppers -- peeled, seeded,
                        and pureed
                        Salt -- to taste
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  honey
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === TOASTED CORN RELISH ===
  2               ears  fresh corn -- silks removed,
                        and ears soaked in cold water 5 minutes
     1/4           cup  finely-diced red onion
  1                     roasted poblano -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely diced
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh tarragon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onions, carrots, celery, and garlic and cook until soft.  Do not allow them to obtain color.

Plunge a knife between the eyes of the lobsters to dispatch them.  Then split them in half lengthwise, and remove the sand sack.  Separate into tail, claw, and chest pieces and add the sections to the vegetables.  Add 1/2 cup of the water and cover the pan with a lid for 4 minutes.

Remove lid and allow the water to evaporate, then turn off the heat.  Remove the lobster pieces from the pan and set aside.  When cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the tails and claws, and reserve the meat.

Chop the shells into smaller pieces and return to the pan.  Add the sherry and ignite.  When the flames subside, add the wine and reduce by half.  Add the remaining 3 cups water, parsley, cilantro, bay leaf, white peppercorns, poblano puree, and salt, to taste and cook over low heat for 20 minutes.

Remove most of the shells and pass the soup through a sieve into a clean medium saucepan, add the reserved lobster meat and cook until reduced to 2 cups.  Blend the soup in a blender in batches then strain through a sieve into a clean, medium saucepan over medium-low heat.

Place the cream and milk in a small saucepan and reduce by half.  Add the cream to the soup and cook until just heated through and season with honey, salt and pepper.  Ladle into bowls and garnish with Toasted Corn Relish.

Toasted Corn Relish:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Preheat grill to high.  Remove ears from water.  Roast corn for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and grill in the husk for 15 to 20 minutes.

Peel the husk away, and cut corn away from the cob.  Combine the corn kernels in a medium bowl with the red onion, roasted poblano, lime juice, olive oil, and tarragon.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  4                     lobsters - (1 1/2 lbs ea) -- steamed, and
                        meat removed
                        === ROASTED BABY BEETS ===
  4                     red baby beets
  4                     yellow baby beets
  4                     candy stripe baby beets
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        === BEET VINAIGRETTE ===
  3             medium  red beets -- roasted, skinned,
                        and juiced
     3/4           cup  canola oil
  3        tablespoons  champagne vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
                        Toasted White Corn Pancakes
                        Finely-chopped chives
                        Roasted Baby Beets -- quartered
                        Beet Vinaigrette
                        Chervil leaves
                        White Truffle Butter
                        Shaved white truffle

Toasted White Corn Pancakes:  In a mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, honey and salt.  In a separate bowl, combine the eggs, milk, and melted butter.  Add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients and mix well.

Heat a griddle or cast-iron frying pan over high heat, brush with oil and add 3 tablespoons batter for each pancake (total of 20).  Fry for about 1 minute, or until dry around the edges, turn and fry for about 30 seconds until cooked through.  Keep warm in a 200 degree oven until ready to serve.

White Truffle Butter:  Place the butter in a medium bowl.  Fold in the truffles until combined and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  Leftover butter can be frozen.

Roasted Baby Beets:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Rub the beets with the oil, place on a baking sheet and roast until cooked through, approximately 20 to 30 minutes.  Let cool slightly and remove skin.  Cut into quarters.

Beet Vinaigrette:  Place the beet juice in a small nonreactive saucepan over high heat and reduce to 3 tablespoons.  Strain through a fine strainer into nonreactive bowl and let cool.

When cool, slowly whisk in the canola oil until emulsified.  Whisk together the vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon of salt in a small bowl.  Slowly whisk in the beet oil until emulsified.  Season with pepper and more salt if needed.

Assembly:  Heat 3 tablespoons of the truffle butter in a medium saute pan over low heat.  Add 1/2 of the cooked lobster meat and cook for 30 seconds or until just warmed through and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Repeat with the remaining lobster.

Place 1 of the warm pancakes on each dish, top each pancake with some of the warmed lobster meat and sprinkle with the chives.  Repeat, layering, for a total of four layers, top with the remaining 4 pancakes.

Place the assorted beets around the pancake and drizzle the beets with the beet vinaigrette and chervil leaves.  Top with a dollop of the truffle butter and shaved truffles.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  cold water
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                     white onion -- coarsely chopped

  1                     jalapeÒo -- finely diced
     1/2           cup  best quality mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  prepared horseradish -- drained
  1              liter  pound cooked lobster meat -- shredded
     1/2           cup  Japanese bread crumbs (panko)
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
  2               cups  instant flour
                        == RED CABBAGE SLAW AND BASIL DRESSING ==
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  chopped red onion
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  best quality mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves - (packed)
     3/4           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  red cabbage head -- finely shredded
  2                     carrots -- finely shredded

Bring the water, wine, white onion, celery, peppercorns, and parsley sprigs to a boil in a medium non-reactive skillet.  Reduce the heat to low, season the cod with salt and pepper and poach until just cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove the cod to plate lined with paper towels, when cool enough to handle, shred the cod into pieces with a fork.

While the cod is poaching, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a small saute pan.  Add the red onion, garlic, and jalapeÒo, and saute until soft.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Let cool slightly.

Mix the mayonnaise, mustard, and horseradish together in a large bowl.  Add the lobster, cod, and onion mixture, and mix until combined.  Fold in the bread crumbs and parsley, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Form the mixture into eight cakes, place on a baking sheet, and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Place the flour in a medium shallow bowl and season with salt and pepper.  Dredge the cakes in the flour and tap off any excess.  Heat the remaining oil in a large saute pan until almost smoking.  Saute the cakes on both sides until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.  Serve with Red Cabbage Slaw And Fresh Basil Dressing.

Red Cabbage Slaw And Fresh Basil Dressing:  Place vinegar, onion, garlic, mayonnaise, mustard, and basil in a blender and blend until smooth.  With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil until emulsified.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Combine the cabbage and carrots in a large bowl.  Pour the vinaigrette over and mix to combine.  Season with salt and pepper and let sit 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Bring the water, wine, white onion, celery, peppercorns, and parsley sprigs to a boil in a medium non-reactive skillet.  Reduce the heat to low, season the cod with salt and pepper and poach until just cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove the cod to plate lined with paper towels, when cool enough to handle, shred the cod into pieces with a fork.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the cod is poaching, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a small saute pan.  Add the red onion, garlic, and jalapeÒo, and saute until soft.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Let cool slightly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mix the mayonnaise, mustard, and horseradish together in a large bowl.  Add the lobster, cod, and onion mixture, and mix until combined.  Fold in the bread crumbs and parsley, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Form the mixture into eight cakes, place on a baking sheet, and refrigerate for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the flour in a medium shallow bowl and season with salt and pepper.  Dredge the cakes in the flour and tap off any excess.  Heat the remaining oil in a large saute pan until almost smoking.  Saute the cakes on both sides until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.  Serve with Red Cabbage Slaw And Fresh Basil Dressing.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Red Cabbage Slaw And Fresh Basil Dressing:  Place vinegar, onion, garlic, mayonnaise, mustard, and basil in a blender and blend until smooth.  With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil until emulsified.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the cabbage and carrots in a large bowl.  Pour the vinaigrette over and mix to combine.  Season with salt and pepper and let sit 10 minutes before serving.

  6                     tomatillos -- husked, scrubbed

     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
  2        tablespoons  honey
                        === RED WINE-ANCHO CHILE SAUCE ===
  2                     ancho chilIes -- soaked until soft,
                        seeded and pureed
  3               cups  dry red wine
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  honey
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  olive oil

Whisk together ancho puree, garlic, fennel, allspice, orange juice, honey, olive oil, and oregano in a medium-baking dish.  Add the tuna and turn to coat.  Refrigerate for 20 minutes, covered.

Heat grill pan over high heat.  Remove tuna from marinade and season with salt and pepper to taste on both sides.  Sear on 1 side until golden brown, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Turn over and cook for 1 minute for medium-rare doneness.

Place two Spinach-Tomatillo Rice Cakes onto a plate.  Prop a tuna steak on top of the cakes at an angle.  Drizzle the plate with the Ancho Chile Red Wine Sauce.

Spinach-Tomatillo Rice Cakes:  Place water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Heat olive oil in a medium high-sided saute pan over medium heat.  Add the rice and stir to coat.  Add 2 cups of the hot water and stir until evaporated.  Repeat with the remaining water until the rice is al dente.

Stir in the cheese and butter until combined.  Stir in the spinach and Tomatillo Sauce, season with salt and pepper.  Spread the mixture evenly out onto a sheet pan, cover and place in the refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour.

Remove the risotto from the refrigerator and cut out 8 (2-inch) circles.  Place the flour onto a plate and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Dredge the risotto circles on both sides in the flour and tap off the excess.

Heat the butter and oil in a large saute pan over high heat.  Saute the cakes until golden brown on both sides.  Remove to a plate lined with paper towels.

Tomatillo Sauce:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place tomatillos, garlic, and onions on a medium baking sheet, toss with oil and season with salt and pepper.  Roast until all vegetables are soft, about 20 to 25 minutes.

Place roasted vegetables and remaining ingredients in a food processor and process until smooth.

Red Wine-Ancho Chile Sauce:  Combine ancho puree and wine in a small saucepan and cook until reduced by half.  Add the mixture to a blender with the vinegar and honey, blend until smooth and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil and blend until emulsified.  Re-season, if needed.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     bone-in pork loin roast - (3 to 4 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Molasses Glaze -- (see below)
  1                     Spanish onion -- finely diced
  1              large  carrot -- finely diced
  1                     celery stalk -- finely diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1                cup  dry white wine
  6               cups  chicken stock
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  4             sprigs  parsley
                        Black Pepper Dumplings -- (see below)
                        Chopped parsley -- for garnish
                        === MOLASSES GLAZE ===
  1 1/2           cups  molasses
  2        tablespoons  whole grain mustard
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === BLACK PEPPER DUMPLINGS ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening -- very cold
     1/3           cup  milk

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat.  Season the pork with salt and pepper and sear on all sides until golden brown.  Transfer the pot to the oven and roast about 1 hour.  Brush the pork liberally with the Molasses Glaze and continue roasting until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees.  Remove the roast to a platter, brush with more of the glaze and let rest 15 minutes.

Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan and place on top of the stove over medium heat.  Add the onions, carrots, celery, and garlic and cook until soft, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Add the wine, increase the heat to high, and cook until reduced by half.  Add the stock and the herbs, and bring to a boil, cook until reduced by 1/3.  Reduce the heat to low and let the broth simmer.

Drop the dumplings into the broth, cover, and simmer until they are puffed and cooked through, about 12 to 5 minutes.

Molasses Glaze:  Combine ingredients in a small bowl.

Black Pepper Dumplings:  Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, black pepper, parsley, and thyme in a medium mixing bowl.  Using your fingers, cut the shortening into the flour mixture until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the milk, stirring just until the mixture is moistened.  Gather the dough into a ball, knead it a few times, and cut into 12 equal pieces.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  20                    dried corn husks
  1 1/2           cups  fresh or frozen corn kernels -- preferably fresh
  1             medium  onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     roasted garlic head -- cloves removed
  2               cups  chicken stock or water
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  6        tablespoons  vegetable shortening
  1 1/2           cups  yellow cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  honey
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  sweet potato - (or 2 med) -- roasted at 375
                        degrees for about 1 hour or until soft,
                        then peeled and flesh mashed
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1           teaspoon  ground allspice
  3        tablespoons  maple syrup
                        Pecan Butter -- (see below)
                        === PECAN BUTTER ===
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/4           cup  toasted pecans -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  maple syrup
  1              pinch  cinnamon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Heat olive oil in a medium saute pan, over high heat.  Season pork with salt on both sides.  Dredge pork in the spice rub and tap off any excess.  Sear the pork on both sides until golden brown.  Cook in the oven to medium doneness, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Let pork rest for 5 minutes before slicing into 12 slices.  Plate 3 slices per plate.  Drizzle with the Bourbon-Ancho Sauce.  Place a Sweet Potato Tamale, topped with Pecan Butter next to the slices of pork.

New Mexican Rub:  Combine all ingredients in a small bowl.

Bourbon-Ancho Sauce:  Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook until soft.  Add the bourbon and cook until completely reduced.  Add the remaining ingredients and cook until reduced by half.

Strain through a fine mesh strainer, return mixture to the pan, and cook to sauce consistency, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of bourbon and cook for 2 minutes.  Season with salt.

Sweet Potato Tamales:  About 2 hours before you plan to form the tamales, clean the husks under running water.  Soak them in warm water for 2 hours, or until softened.

Puree the corn, onion, roasted garlic, and stock in a food processor.  Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and cut in the butter and shortening.  Using your fingers, mix in the cornmeal, honey, and salt and pepper until there are no visible lumps of fat.  Fold in the sweet potato puree, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and maple syrup.  The mixture will be a lot looser than you think it should be, but when the tamales are steamed it will dry out.

Remove the cornhusks from the water and set aside the best 20 husks.  Drain and pat dry.  Tear the remaining husks into 1-inch wide strips to be used for tying.

Lay 2 husks flat on a work surface, with the tapered ends facing out and the broad bases overlapping by about 3 inches.  Place about 1/3 cup of masa mixture in the center.  Bring the long sides up over the masa, slightly overlapping, and pat down to close.  (If the masa drips out a little at the seam, that is no problem.)  Tie each end of the bundle with a strip of cornhusk, pushing the filling toward the middle as you tie.  Trim the ends to about 1/2-inch beyond the tie.

Arrange the tamales in a single layer on a steaming rack, cover tightly with foil, and steam over boiling water for 45 minutes.

To Serve:  Slice a slit on top of each tamale and push both ends of the tamale toward the middle to expose the masa.  Top each with 1 tablespoon of Pecan Butter.

Pecan Butter:  Combine all ingredients in a bowl.  Scrape into a ramekin and refrigerate until solid, about 2 hours.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat olive oil in a medium saute pan, over high heat.  Season pork with salt on both sides.  Dredge pork in the spice rub and tap off any excess.  Sear the pork on both sides until golden brown.  Cook in the oven to medium doneness, about 8 to 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Let pork rest for 5 minutes before slicing into 12 slices.  Plate 3 slices per plate.  Drizzle with the Bourbon-Ancho Sauce.  Place a Sweet Potato Tamale, topped with Pecan Butter next to the slices of pork.
</DirT>
<DirT>
New Mexican Rub:  Combine all ingredients in a small bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bourbon-Ancho Sauce:  Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook until soft.  Add the bourbon and cook until completely reduced.  Add the remaining ingredients and cook until reduced by half.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Strain through a fine mesh strainer, return mixture to the pan, and cook to sauce consistency, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of bourbon and cook for 2 minutes.  Season with salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sweet Potato Tamales:  About 2 hours before you plan to form the tamales, clean the husks under running water.  Soak them in warm water for 2 hours, or until softened.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Puree the corn, onion, roasted garlic, and stock in a food processor.  Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and cut in the butter and shortening.  Using your fingers, mix in the cornmeal, honey, and salt and pepper until there are no visible lumps of fat.  Fold in the sweet potato puree, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and maple syrup.  The mixture will be a lot looser than you think it should be, but when the tamales are steamed it will dry out.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the cornhusks from the water and set aside the best 20 husks.  Drain and pat dry.  Tear the remaining husks into 1-inch wide strips to be used for tying.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lay 2 husks flat on a work surface, with the tapered ends facing out and the broad bases overlapping by about 3 inches.  Place about 1/3 cup of masa mixture in the center.  Bring the long sides up over the masa, slightly overlapping, and pat down to close.  (If the masa drips out a little at the seam, that is no problem.)  Tie each end of the bundle with a strip of cornhusk, pushing the filling toward the middle as you tie.  Trim the ends to about 1/2-inch beyond the tie.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the tamales in a single layer on a steaming rack, cover tightly with foil, and steam over boiling water for 45 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To Serve:  Slice a slit on top of each tamale and push both ends of the tamale toward the middle to expose the masa.  Top each with 1 tablespoon of Pecan Butter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pecan Butter:  Combine all ingredients in a bowl.  Scrape into a ramekin and refrigerate until solid, about 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             pounds  chicken legs and thighs -- skin removed
                        Salt -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  ancho chile powder
  1              large  yellow onion -- thinly sliced
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1                     ancho chile -- coarsely chopped
  2                     New Mexican chilies -- coarsely chopped
  4               cups  chicken stock
  6                     cilantro sprigs -- plus more chopped,
                        for garnish
  12                    flour tortillas -- warmed
                        === SALSA VERDE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     jalapeÒo -- coarsely diced
  8                     tomatillos -- husked, and
                        coarsely chopped
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  honey
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Season chicken with salt and ancho chile powder.  Sear, skin-side down, in the oil until golden brown.  Turn over and brown on the other side.  Remove the chicken to a plate.

Add the onion to the pan and cook until lightly golden brown.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute longer.  Add the chicken back to the pot, add the chiles, stock, and cilantro, and bring to a boil.  Cover and roast in the oven until the chicken easily falls away from the bone, about 40 minutes.  Remove the chicken from the pot and strain the cooking liquid into a bowl.

When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove bones and cut or shred the meat into bite-sized pieces.  Place the reserved cooking liquid into a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer.  Add the shredded chicken, turn off the heat and let warm.

Divide the warm chicken among the warm tortillas, top with Salsa Verde and chopped cilantro.

Salsa Verde:  Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the onions and jalapeÒo and cook until soft.  Add the tomatillos and cook until soft, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Transfer the mixture to a blender, add the lime juice, honey, and cilantro, and blend until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  1                     small head escarole -- torn bite size
  2                     Belgian endive -- leaves separated
  2                     celery stalks -- cut on the diagonal
                        into thin slices
  1                     Granny Smith apple -- halved, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
                        Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano -- for garnish
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
     1/2                shallot -- finely diced

Heat olive oil and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onions and sugar, and cook until the onions are golden brown and caramelized.  Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes.

While the onions are cooking, place the potatoes in a medium saucepan filled with cold salted water.  Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are just cooked through.  Drain the potatoes and set aside.

Add the clam broth to the onions and bring to a simmer.  Add the oysters and the potatoes and simmer just until the oysters have cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Whisk in the creme fraiche and season with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and stir in the tarragon.  Serve with Winter Green Salad.

Winter Green Salad:  Combine greens, celery, apples, and cheese in a large bowl.  Whisk together both vinegars and the shallot.  Slowly whisk in the oil, and season with salt and pepper.  Toss the salad ingredients with some of the vinaigrette.

Heat the garlic in a medium saucepan and saute until soft.  Add the wine and cook until dry.  Add the clam juice and reduce by 3/4.  Add the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Add tomatillo-herb puree and cook for 2 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  rice flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  milk
  2               cups  white cornmeal
  4              whole  rainbow trout - (8 to 10 oz ea) -- scaled, gutted
  6        tablespoons  vegetable or peanut oil
  2                     lemons
  2             sticks  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped pecans
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
                        === SAUTEED SWISS CHARD WITH RED ONION ===
  2 1/2         pounds  Swiss chard
     1/2         pound  slab bacon -- cut small dice
  2             medium  red onions -- halved, and
                        thinly sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  Serrano Chile Vinegar -- (see below)
                        === SERRANO CHILE VINEGAR ===
  4                     serrano chiles -- coarsely chopped
  2               cups  white wine vinegar
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

Place rice flour in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper.  Mix eggs and milk in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper.  Place cornmeal in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Open up and cut the trout, diagonally, into 2 fillets.  Season both the flesh and skin sides of the fillet with salt and pepper, to taste, and then dip each fillet into rice flour, then egg mixture, then cornmeal.  Repeat with remaining trout.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet until almost smoking.  Saute 4 fillets at a time until golden brown on both sides.  Repeat with the remaining oil.  Transfer to a large baking sheet and repeat with the remaining 2 trout.  Place in the oven and bake for 5 to 6 minutes until just cooked through.

Zest and juice both lemons, separately reserving the zest and the juice.  Set aside.

While the trout is baking, melt the butter in a nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat.  Watching carefully and lowering the heat if necessary, allow the butter to foam and turn golden brown.  Immediately add the lemon juice, zest and salt and pepper, to taste.

While the butter is still foaming, add the pecans and parsley.  Do not allow the butter to burn or it will be unusable.

Place 2 fillets on each of 4 dinner plates and pour the Pecan-Brown Butter over the top.  Serve alongside the Sauteed Swiss Chard with Red Onion and Serrano Chile Vinegar.

Sauteed Swiss Chard with Red Onion:  Tear Swiss chard leaves from thick white stalks, discard the stalks and coarsely chop leaves, set aside.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the bacon and cook until golden brown and fat as rendered.  Remove bacon to a plate with a slotted spoon.

Add the onions and cook in the rendered fat until soft.  Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute.  Add the Swiss chard, season with salt and pepper and stir to coat the leaves in the fat.  Cook until the leaves have completely wilted.

Add the bacon back to the pan.  Add the Serrano Chile Vinegar and continue cooking for 2 minutes.  Serve with additional vinegar on the side.

Serrano Chile Vinegar:  Bring chiles, vinegar, and a teaspoon of salt to a boil in a medium nonreactive saucepan.  Remove from heat, pour into a bowl, cover and let steep for at least 2 hours or overnight at room temperature.  Strain through a fine strainer into a bowl or glass jar.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/4           cup  black walnuts
  4             ounces  Maytag blue cheese -- crumbled

For the Roast:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Season the pork with salt and pepper and sear well on all sides.

Drain off the fat, and add the remaining ingredients to the pot.  Place in the oven and cook until the internal temperature of the meat registers 150 degrees, about 2 hours.

Remove the meat to a plate and remove the vegetables and herbs with a slotted spoon.  Add more water if needed.  Bring the cooking liquid to a boil and reduce by half.  Whisk in the butter and season with salt and pepper to taste.

For the Spicy Orange Vinaigrette:  Place orange juice in a small nonreactive pan over high heat and cook until reduced to 1/4 cup.  Place reduced orange juice, vinegar, onion, jalapeÒo and ancho powder in a blender and blend until smooth.  With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil until emulsified.  Add the honey and salt and pepper to taste.

For the Apple Salad:  Heat 3/4 cup of the Spicy Orange Vinaigrette in a medium saute pan over medium high heat.  Add the apples, cut-side down and saute until golden brown, turn over and saute until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes.

Place the watercress and frisee in a medium bowl and toss with a few tablespoons of the remaining Spicy Orange Vinaigrette, season with salt and pepper and divide among 4 plates.  Arrange 2 apple quarters on each plate, garnish with walnuts and blue cheese and drizzle with some of the remaining vinaigrette.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        === GRILLED VEGETABLES ===
  2                     zucchini -- cut on bias
                        into 1/2" thick slices
  1                     yellow squash -- cut on bias
                        into 1/2" thick slices

Heat oil to 375 degrees.  Add them in batches, separating them when they hit the oil.  Fry until golden brown, remove and drain on paper towels and salt liberally.

Blue Cheese Dip:  Heat butter in medium saucepan over medium heat until melted.  Whisk in flour and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Whisk in the hot milk and cook until the sauce has thickened.  Stir in the blue cheese and cook until the cheese has melted.  Season with cayenne and salt.  Pour into ramekins and serve with the fries.

  1                cup  orange juice
  2               cups  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  unsalted cold butter
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped chives
                        === POLENTA ===
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2                     shallots -- finely diced
     3/4         pound  assorted wild mushrooms -- chopped
                        = (shiitake, oyster, cremini)
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1                cup  polenta
  4               cups  water
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese

Marinade:  Bring ingredients to a boil in a medium saucepan and reduce to 2 cups and let cool.

Chicken:  Place chicken in a large baking dish.  Brush 1 cup of the marinade over the chicken and inside the cavity.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or up to 8 hours.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Remove the chicken from the marinade and place the oranges, garlic and onions in the cavity and truss.  Season well with salt and coarsely ground black pepper.  Brush with more of the marinade.

Place the chicken in a medium roasting pan and roast in the oven for 15 minutes.  Turn the heat down to 375 degrees and continue roasting for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, basting with the marinade every 15 minutes.  Remove the chicken to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.

Degrease the pan and place the roasting dish with the drippings on top of 2 burners over high heat.  Add the wine and orange juice and reduce by half.  Add the chicken stock and reduce by half.  Swirl in the butter and add the chives.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Polenta:  Heat oil and butter in a large saute pan over high heat.  Add the shallots and cook until soft.  Add the mushrooms and cook until golden brown.  Add the wine and cook until completely reduced.  Season with salt and pepper and fold in the thyme and parsley, set aside.

Heat a small saute pan over high heat.  Add the polenta and toast until lightly golden brown.  Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of salt.  Slowly whisk in the toasted polenta, and reduce the heat to low.

Switch to a wooden spoon and continue cooking until the mixture begins to pull away from the pan.  Add the mushrooms, cheese and season with salt and pepper.  If the mixture is too thick, add more water.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RAVIOLI ===
  2                     butternut squash -- halved, seeded
  1              pinch  cinnamon
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped orange zest
  2          teaspoons  chipotle puree
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped parsley
     1/4           cup  finely-grated Parmesan cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     sheets pasta dough
                        = (12" to 14" long by 4" wide)
  2                     eggs -- mixed with
  2        tablespoons  water
                        Finely-chopped chives -- for garnish
                        === BROWN BUTTER SAUCE ===
  2             sticks  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  coarsely-ground hazelnuts
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  8                     sage leaves -- cut chiffonade
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Ravioli:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Place squash on a baking sheet and roast until soft.  Scoop out flesh and run though a food mill.

Place the puree into a medium saucepan and cook over low heat until almost dry.  Add the remaining ingredients and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Lay a sheet of pasta dough on a lightly floured work surface and distribute a heaping teaspoon-sized portion of the filling at least 2 inches apart.  Use your fingertip or a brush to moisten the edges of the pasta sheet with the egg wash.  Carefully place a second sheet of the pasta dough on top of the first and press with your fingertips to separate the rows of filling.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

With a ravioli cutter or pastry wheel, cut along straight lines on the vertical and horizontal to form each ravioli square.  Press the edges closed with your fingertips to seal well.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Carefully drop in the ravioli and cook for about 5 minutes.  Drain, plate and spoon butter sauce over and garnish with finely chopped chives.

Brown Butter Sauce:  Melt butter in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add hazelnuts and cook until the hazelnuts are golden brown.  Add the heavy cream and cook for 1 minute.  Add the sage and season with salt and pepper, to taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PANZANAELLA DRESSING ===
  1                     loaf sour dough bread -- cut 1/4" cubes
                        = (abt 8 cups)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cups  drained diced canned tomatoes
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
                        Salt -- to taste
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
                        === ROASTED GARLIC CORNISH HENS ===
  1              bunch  rosemary
  2                     Cornish hens
  1                     roasted garlic head -- cloves removed,
                        and mashed to a paste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SAUTEED BROCCOLINI ===
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely sliced
  1 1/2         pounds  broccollini -- trimmed, blanched,
                        shocked in cold water and drained
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Panzanaella Dressing: Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Spread the bread cubes on a baking sheet and bake in the oven until golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Grease a 2-quart high-sided baking dish with olive oil.

Combine the tomatoes, garlic, parsley, and rosemary in a large bowl and season with salt and red pepper flakes.  Add the toasted bread cubes and the olive oil and stir to combine.

Place the mixture into the baking dish, cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes.  Remove the foil and continue baking until the dressing is crisp and golden brown, about 10 minutes longer.

Roasted Garlic Cornish Hens:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Divide the rosemary in half and place in the cavity of the hens and tie the legs together with butcher's twine.

In a small bowl, mix together the garlic paste and the olive oil.  Rub the mixture over the hens and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Place the hens in a saute pan, with a heat-resistant handle, and sear on all sides.

Put in the oven and roast until just cooked through, about 35 to 40 minutes.  Let rest for 10 minutes.  Pour off the fat from the roasting pan and add any accumulated juices from the hen.

Sauteed broccolini:  Heat oil in large saute pan over medium heat.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Add broccolini and saute for 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VEAL CHOPS ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped lemon zest
  4                     veal chops, 1" thick - (12 oz ea)
                        === GRILLED MUSHROOM RELISH ===
  1              pound  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed
  1                     yellow onion -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/2" thick slices

  2                     plum tomatoes -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  2                     yellow tomatoes -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  sherry vinegar
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === BRAISED AND GRILLED ARTICHOKES ===
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  8                     artichokes -- quartered, choke
                        removed, placed in acidulated water
  2        tablespoons  fresh parsley
                        Salt -- to taste

Veal Chops:  Combine oil, rosemary, garlic and zest in a large shallow baking dish.  Add the veal chops and turn to coat.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator at least 4 hours or up to 8 hours.  Preheat grill.

Remove chops from marinade and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Grill chops, turning once until the centers are slightly pink, (registers 150 degrees internal temperature), about 15 to 17 minutes.

Grilled Mushroom Relish:  Brush mushrooms and onions with olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Grill each for 10 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally until just cooked through.

Remove from the grill and cut into 1/2-inch pieces.  Place in a bowl with the tomatoes and thyme.  Drizzle in the vinegar and oil, mix well and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Braised and Grilled Artichokes:  Place the olive oil, vinegar, wine, and garlic in a large saute pan and place on the side burner of the grill and bring to a simmer.

Drain the artichokes and add, cut-side down in a single layer in the pan.  Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat and cover the pan.  Cook until barely tender, about 12 minutes.

Remove the artichokes from the pan, season with salt and pepper and grill for 4 to 5 minutes until lightly golden brown on both sides.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Hominy Croutons:  Heat oil in a small saute pan.  Cook onions and garlic until soft.  Add wine and reduce by half.  Place the water in a medium saucepan and add 2 tablespoons of salt, bring to a boil.  Slowly whisk in the cornmeal and cook for, 15 to 20 minutes.

Season with salt and pepper and spread into a buttered 11- by 17-inch baking sheet.  Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.

Heat the oil in a cast-iron skillet or a deep fryer to 350 degrees.  Cut the polenta into 1/2-inch squares.  Dredge lightly in cornmeal and fry in batches until golden brown.

Parmesan Crisps:  Heat a large saute pan over medium heat.  Combine the cheese and flour in a medium bowl.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the cheese into the pan to form a 4-inch circle.  Cook until the cheese is somewhat melted but not firm.  Using a spatula, turn the cheese over and cook until firm.  Drape the crisp over a large rolling pin until cool.  Repeat.

Salad:  Put all ingredients except oil in a blender and blend until smooth.  Slowly add the oil and season with salt and pepper.  Place the romaine in a large bowl and toss with some of the dressing.  Divide among 4 plates.  Scatter croutons around and place a Parmesan crisp in the center of the salad.

Pork:  Season pork with salt and pepper on both sides.  Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan until almost smoking.  Cook the pork for 3 to 4 minutes on 1 side or until golden brown, turn over, reduce heat to medium and continue cooking to medium doneness.  Remove to a plate and keep warm.

Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat.  Add the garlic and onions and cook until soft.  Add the wine and cook until reduced by half.  Add the stock and cook to a sauce consistency.  Whisk in the mustards and thyme and season with salt and pepper to taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  fennel seeds
  4               cups  blood orange juice
  1                cup  orange juice
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  honey
  4                     tuna fillets - (abt 6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FENNEL AND BLOOD ORANGE RELISH ===
  3        tablespoons  sherry vinegar
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     blood oranges -- segmented
  1                cup  finely-sliced fennel
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
                        === SUATEED WATERCRESS ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced

Fennel and Blood Orange Relish:  Whisk together the sherry, oil and salt and pepper in a medium bowl.  Add the orange segments and fennel and mix to combine.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and fold in the parsley.  Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.

Sauteed Watercress:  Heat oil in a large saute pan.  Add the garlic and cook over medium-high heat for 1 minute.  Toss in the watercress and cook just until it wilts.  Add the vinegar, toss and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RIOJA RED WINE VINAIGRETTE ===
  1             bottle  Rioja red wine
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  Dijon Mustard
  1           teaspoon  honey
  1                cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SKEWERED LAMB ===
  2                     garlic heads -- peeled, crushed
  1 1/2           cups  pure olive oil
  8                     rosemary sprigs
  4              pound  lamb loin -- cut 2" cubes
  32                    roasted pearl onions

Make the vinaigrette:  In a medium nonreactive saucepan over high heat, reduce the wine to 1/4 cup.  Place it in a blender with the vinegar, mustard and honey and blend until combined.  With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil until emulsified.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  May be refrigerated up to 2 days.  Bring to room temperature before using.

Make the lamb:  Soak 8 bamboo skewers 6 inches long in water for 2 hours or overnight.  In a large bowl, combine the garlic, olive oil, rosemary and lamb and marinated the lamb 4 to 6 hours in the refrigerator.

Prepare a grill or broiler.  Thread the lamb cubes and roasted onions on the skewers and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Grill until rare to medium-rare, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side.

Place the skewers on a serving platter and drizzle the Rioja vinaigrette over them.  Can serve with instant couscous made with chicken stock.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Prepare a grill or broiler.  Thread the lamb cubes and roasted onions on the skewers and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Grill until rare to medium-rare, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side.

  4                     plum tomatoes -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
     1/4           cup  golden raisins
     1/2         ounce  Mexican Ibarra chocolate
  2        tablespoons  maple syrup

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cold smoke the lamb and tomatoes:  Burn charcoal or wood in smoker and let burn down to embers.  Lay chips of soaked aromatic (e.g. oak, hickory) wood on the ashes.

Place the lamb on the grill rack, place the cover on the smoker and open the top vent slightly.  Smoke the lamb for 5 minutes.

Rub the tomatoes with olive oil, remove the cover and add the tomatoes and continue smoking along with the lamb for 10 minutes.  Or buy smoked lamb or use regular lamb and grill in pan.

Slice the lamb in half vertically and then crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces.  Dice the tomatoes into 1/2-inch dice.

Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan until almost smoking.  Add the lamb, season with salt and pepper and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until browned.  Add the scallions and tomatoes and cook 3 to 4 minutes, for medium-rare doneness.

Lay the tortillas flat on a surface.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the Monterey Jack on each of the tortillas place some of the lamb mixture over the cheese and sprinkle with goat cheese and cilantro, fold the short ends in and roll tightly lengthwise.  Ladle the Almond Mole Sauce over and garnish with cilantro.

Almond Mole Sauce:  In a large frying pan over medium heat, heat the oil to 360 degrees.  Fry the tortillas and all the chiles until crisp.  Remove with tongs and place in a food processor or blender.

Add the onion and garlic to the oil and fry until browned, about 2 minutes; add to the processor.  Pour out all but 2 tablespoons of the oil and toast the almonds until golden brown.  Add to the processor.

Add 1 cup of stock to the processor and process the tortillas, chiles, onion, garlic and almonds to a puree, adding more stock if needed.

Pour the puree into a medium saucepan and add the remaining stock, the tomatoes and raisins.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce the heat to medium and simmer 1 hour and 20 minutes, stirring frequently.

Add the chocolate, maple syrup, cinnamon, cloves and lime juice.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and simmer another 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Soup:  Heat a medium saucepan over high heat.  Add chorizo and cook until lightly golden brown and fat has rendered.  Remove chorizo to a paper-towel lined plate and pour out all but 2 tablespoons of the rendered fat.

Add the onions, garlic, carrots and celery to the fat and cook until soft.  Add the kale and cook until slightly wilted.  Add the wine and the chicken stock and bring to a simmer.  Add the beans and cooked chorizo and cook until the beans and the kale are soft, about 1 hour.  Ladle soup into bowls and serve with the toast.

Oven Dried Tomato Toast:  Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Place sliced tomatoes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Place tomatoes in the oven and bake in the oven for 6 to 8 hours or until the tomatoes are dried and have lost all of their moisture.

Heat oil in a small saucepan over low heat.  Add garlic, remove from heat and let sit for 20 minutes.  Increase the heat in the oven to 350 degrees.  Brush the bread on both sides with the garlic oil.  Place a slice of tomato on each piece of bread, season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with some of the oregano.  Bake in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes, until the bread is lightly golden brown.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saute pan.  Place 4 of the fillets in the pan, tapenade-side down, and saute until a crust forms, about 2 minutes.  Turn the fish over and continue cooking for about 5 minutes for medium-rare doneness.

Serve the salmon with the Roasted Onions.

                        === CROUTONS ===
  4             slices  country-style bread
                        Olive oil -- as needed

  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  4                     beef fillet steaks - (abt 6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  shiitake mushrooms -- cleaned, quartered
  2                     shallots -- finely diced
  1                cup  red wine
  1                cup  beef broth
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter
                        === ONION AND POTATO GRATIN ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3              large  Spanish onion -- peeled, and
                        sliced thinly
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              large  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        sliced thinly
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1 1/4           cups  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  1                cup  grated Gruyere cheese

Croutons:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place bread on a work surface and using a 3-inch cookie cutter, cut a round crouton from the center of each piece of bread.  Brush both sides of the croutons with olive oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Place the croutons on a baking sheet and bake for 5 to 7 minutes or until lightly golden brown.

Tournedos and Sauce:  Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over high heat.  Season the fillets with salt and press the coarsely cracked black pepper onto 1 side of each fillet.  Place the fillets pepper-side down into the skillet and sear until golden brown, turn the fillets over and continue cooking for 4 to 5 minutes for medium-rare doneness.  Remove the steaks to a plate.

Remove all but 3 tablespoons of the fat in the pan and return to high heat.  Add the mushrooms and cook until golden brown and their liquid has evaporated.  Add the shallots and cook until soft.  Add the red wine and reduce by half.  Add the broth and cook until reduced by half.  Whisk in the mustard and butter and cook for 30 seconds.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Place each fillet on top of a crouton and spoon some of the sauce over.

Onion and Potato Gratin:  Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium heat.  Add the onions and cook slowly until caramelized.  Add the garlic and balsamic vinegar and cook for 2 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a 9-inch baking pan and place a layer of potatoes on the bottom and season with salt and pepper.  Spoon 1/5 of the onion mixture over the potatoes and top with 1/4 cup of the heavy cream and a tablespoon of parsley.

Repeat to make 5 layers.  Sprinkle the cheese over the top of the potatoes.  Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft and the cream has been absorbed.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Croutons:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place bread on a work surface and using a 3-inch cookie cutter, cut a round crouton from the center of each piece of bread.  Brush both sides of the croutons with olive oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Place the croutons on a baking sheet and bake for 5 to 7 minutes or until lightly golden brown.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tournedos and Sauce:  Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over high heat.  Season the fillets with salt and press the coarsely cracked black pepper onto 1 side of each fillet.  Place the fillets pepper-side down into the skillet and sear until golden brown, turn the fillets over and continue cooking for 4 to 5 minutes for medium-rare doneness.  Remove the steaks to a plate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove all but 3 tablespoons of the fat in the pan and return to high heat.  Add the mushrooms and cook until golden brown and their liquid has evaporated.  Add the shallots and cook until soft.  Add the red wine and reduce by half.  Add the broth and cook until reduced by half.  Whisk in the mustard and butter and cook for 30 seconds.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Place each fillet on top of a crouton and spoon some of the sauce over.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Onion and Potato Gratin:  Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium heat.  Add the onions and cook slowly until caramelized.  Add the garlic and balsamic vinegar and cook for 2 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a 9-inch baking pan and place a layer of potatoes on the bottom and season with salt and pepper.  Spoon 1/5 of the onion mixture over the potatoes and top with 1/4 cup of the heavy cream and a tablespoon of parsley.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Repeat to make 5 layers.  Sprinkle the cheese over the top of the potatoes.  Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft and the cream has been absorbed.

                        === MIXED GREENS SALAD ===
  6               cups  mixed greens -- torn into pieces
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  champagne vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste

  2        tablespoons  pink peppercorns in brine -- drained

Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a small saute pan over medium high heat, saute the cubes of bread until golden brown on all sides, remove to a plate.

Season each fillet on both sides with salt and pepper to taste.  Season the flour with salt and pepper to taste.  Dredge each fillet lightly on the skin side and tap off extra flour.

Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until potatoes are tender.  Remove from oven and sprinkle with chervil and salt and pepper.  Serve hot or at room temperature.

Mixed Greens Salad:  Place greens in a medium bowl.  Whisk together the mustard, vinegar and salt and pepper.  Drizzle in the olive oil and whisk until emulsified, add peppercorns, and season with salt and pepper.  Pour some of the vinaigrette over the salad and toss to coat.

  1                     boneless turkey breast - (abt 2 lbs)
  4               cups  chicken stock
  4                     parsley sprigs

     1/2         pound  turnips -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces

  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              large  leek, white and pale green part -- sliced thinly
  1              large  shallot -- finely sliced
  5        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  fresh sage chiffonade
                        === CRUST ===
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped sage
  1         tablespoon  chopped rosemary
  1         tablespoon  chopped thyme
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" pieces
     1/2           cup  chilled solid vegetable shortening
     1/2           cup  ice water

Butter a 4-quart baking dish.

Place turkey breast in a medium saucepan, cover with stock, and add parsley, bay leaf, thyme, and peppercorns.  Bring stock to a boil, reduce heat to low.  Cover pot and simmer until turkey is just cooked through, about 20 minutes.

Transfer turkey to a plate, remove herbs and peppercorns with a slotted spoon.  When turkey is cool enough to handle, cut into 1/2-inch thick pieces and transfer to the buttered baking dish.

Add carrots and turnips to the broth and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes.  Transfer carrots, turnips and thawed peas to the buttered baking dish.  Strain broth into a bowl.

Melt butter in the same pot over medium heat.  Add leeks and shallots and cook until soft.  Add flour and stir for 2 minutes.  Stir in broth and white wine.  Increase heat to high and bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  Cook until reduced slightly.  Add cream and cook until sauce thickens enough to coat a spoon.  Season with salt and pepper and add the parsley and sage.  Pour the sauce over the turkey and vegetables in the baking dish.

For the Crust:  Place flour, herbs, and salt in a food processor and process until herbs are finely chopped.  Add butter and shortening and process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add a few tablespoons of the cold water at a time and pulse until the mixture just comes together.  Gather dough into ball and chill for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Roll dough into a 15- by 10 1/2-inch rectangle and place dough over onto filling.  Trim overhang, tuck dough edge inside dish.

Bake until crust is golden and gravy is bubbling, about 1 hour.  Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.

Blend vinegar and shallot in a blender until smooth.  Slowly drizzle in the oil until emulsified.  Add the honey and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Pour the vinaigrette over the sauteed mushrooms, drizzle with white truffle oil and mix to combine.  Re-season with salt and pepper if necessary.

Aged Sherry Vinaigrette:  Whisk together the vinegar, mustard and honey in a medium bowl.  Slowly whisk in the olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Salad:  Place the chicory into a large bowl and toss with 1/4 cup of the Aged Sherry Vinaigrette, season with salt and pepper and divide among 4 large plates.  Divide the cheese among 4 plates.  Place the sliced squab breast on each of the 4 plates and drizzle with some of the Wild Mushroom Vinaigrette.  Garnish with chives and diced peppers.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUSTS ===
  2               cups  gingersnaps crumbs
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === LIME FILLING ===
  1              large  egg
  4              large  egg yolks
  2               cans  sweetened condensed milk - (15 oz ea)
  1                cup  bottled key lime juice
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated lime zest
  1              pinch  salt
                        === WHITE CHOCOLATE TOPPING ===
     1/4           cup  whole milk
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  8             ounces  good quality white chocolate -- chopped
                        === GINGER MINT SYRUP ===
     1/2           cup  water
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped candied ginger
  1         tablespoon  ginger liqueur, such as Canton
     1/4           cup  mint leaves - (packed)
                        === GARNISHES ===
                        Mint sprigs
                        Sweetened whipped cream
                        White chocolate curls
                        Candied lime peels
                        Ginger Mint Syrup
                        Chopped and toasted macadamia nuts

Crusts: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine all ingredients in a bowl and press into a 9- by 13-inch baking dish lined with aluminum foil that extends 2 inches beyond the short end of the pan.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, remove from oven.  Then reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees.

Lime Filling:  Whisk all ingredients together in a medium bowl.  Pour the filling over the prepared crust.  Bake until the filling is almost set, about 20 to 22 minutes.  Cool the bars completely in the pan set on a wire rack.  Refrigerate the bars for at least 2 hours, until chilled.

White Chocolate Topping:  In a medium saucepan, bring the milk and cream to a gentle boil.  Add the chopped chocolate and let stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate.  Whisk the mixture until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth.  Set the topping aside to cool to room temperature for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cool.

Pour the cooled white chocolate topping over the chilled bars and, using a small, offset metal spatula, spread it into an even layer.  Freeze the bars in the pan for at least 1 hour before cutting.

Ginger Mint Syrup:  In a small saucepan, combine the water, sugar, and candied ginger and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Continue to boil until the syrup is reduced to about 1/3 cup.  Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool for 5 minutes.

Stir in the ginger liqueur and pour the syrup into a blender.  Add the mint leaves and blend until the mint is finely chopped.  Transfer the syrup to a squeeze bottle and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.

Garnish with:  Mint sprigs, sweetened whipped cream, white chocolate curls, candied lime peels, Ginger Mint Syrup, and Chopped and toasted macadamia nuts

This recipe yields ?? servings.
