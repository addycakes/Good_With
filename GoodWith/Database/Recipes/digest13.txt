  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

     1/4           cup  vegetable shortening
  3        tablespoons  cold water - (to 4)

In a mixing bowl, stir together the flour and salt.  Add the butter and shortening and, using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut them in until the mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs.  Sprinkle in the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring gently with a fork after each addition and adding only enough of the water to form a rough mass.

Using floured hands, pat the dough into a smooth, round flattened disk.  Use immediately, or wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 days.

This recipe yields enough dough for one 9-inch ouiche or tart shell.

Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  unsalted chilled butter -- diced
     2/3           cup  lowfat buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  4                     black or Kalamata olives -- pitted, and
                        finely chopped

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a food processor, combine the flour with the baking powder, baking soda, and salt and process to just combine.  Add the butter and pulse until a coarse meal is formed.  Add the buttermilk and cheese and process until just mixed.  Add the olives and pulse for a few seconds to combine until a slightly sticky dough is formed.

Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface and with lightly floured hand, knead it 3 or 4 times.  Roll the dough out to 1/2-inch thickness and cut rounds with a small 1 1/2-inch biscuit cutter or similar size cookie cutter.  Lightly coat the biscuits with butter-flavored non-stick cooking spray.

Place the biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes or until lightly golden.  Remove from the oven and serve piping hot.

This recipe yields sixteen 1 1/2-inch biscuits

Variation:  For a sweet biscuit, omit the cheese and olives and add 1/2 cup raisins, currants, dried cherries, or dried blueberries.

Do-Ahead Prep:  The biscuits can be prepared a day in advance, kept in an airtight container, and warmed just before serving.  The biscuits can also be frozen in sealed containers or plastic bags for 2 to 3 months.

Comments:  This lightened biscuit uses one-third of the shortening in a traditional recipe, and is enriched with lowfat buttermilk and enhanced with pungent olive and cheese flavors.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (or cold-pressed safflower oil)

  1              bunch  kale - (abt 1/4 to 1/3 lb) -- coarsely chopped
  1              whole  chicken - (abt 3 lbs)
                        = (organic preferred)
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
                        = (or filtered water)
  1           teaspoon  thyme
  3                     potatoes -- peeled, quartered

In a large, heavy-bottomed casserole, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add onions, garlic, and kale, and sautÈ until kale begins to wilt, about 5 minutes.

Wash chicken in cold water.  Sprinkle inside and out with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds pepper.  Set aside.

Add stock, 1/2 teaspoon salt, a few grinds of pepper, and thyme, and stir.  Place chicken in casserole.  Bring stock to a boil, covered, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook about 50 to 60 minutes.

Using a large fork and tongs, lift chicken from casserole to a serving platter.  Cover with parchment paper and foil to keep warm.

Skim off any visible fat in casserole.  Add potatoes and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes.

Arrange vegetables around chicken.  Pour braising liquid into a gravy boat and serve on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Vitamin K is found in leafy green vegetables including the kale in this dish.  We hear little about this vitamin, but it does important work -- assisting in liver function and the storage of glucose for energy.  Vitamin K lessens the symptoms of perimenopause.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Basic Quiche And Tart Pastry -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  small broccoli florets
  3                     eggs
  2                     green onions, including some
                        of the tender green tops -- thinly sliced
  1 1/2           cups  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  6             ounces  creamy fresh goat cheese

Preheat an oven to 425 degrees.

On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the pastry dough into a round 12 inches in diameter.  Drape the round over the rolling pin and carefully transfer to a 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom.  Gently ease the pastry into the pan.  Trim the pastry even with the pan rim.

Prick the bottom and sides of the pastry shell with fork tines.  Form a double-thick 12-inch square of aluminum foil, poke a few holes in it, then press it into the pastry-lined pan.  Bake for 8 minutes.  Remove the foil and bake until the pastry looks dry but not brown, about 4 minutes longer.  Remove from the oven; reduce the temperature to 325 degrees.

Bring a saucepan three-fourths full of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add the broccoli and cook until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes.  Drain well, pat dry, and set aside.  In a bowl, using a fork, beat the eggs until lightly frothy.  Stir in the green onions, milk, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

Scatter the broccoli evenly in the pastry shell.  Drop small clumps of the goat cheese evenly among the florets; carefully pour in the egg mixture.  Bake until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.  If the edges are browning too quickly, cover them with strips of aluminum foil.

Transfer to a rack to cool for 15 minutes.  Remove the pan rim and place the quiche on a serving plate.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields one 9-inch quiche; 4 to 6 servings.

In a medium pot, dry-roast bulgur and walnuts, stirring constantly until aromatic, about 4 or 5 minutes.  Be careful not to overheat and burn.  Add stock, salt, and pepper.  Bring to a boll, covered, then lower flame and cook until water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.

Place green beans on top of bulgur mixture and cook, covered, another 5 minutes.  Turn off heat and allow pot to stand 5 minutes.

With a fork, fluff grain to loosen and stir in green beans.  Pour into a serving bowl.

Bulgur is one of the grains that needs no washing and cooks quickly.  The next day, with vinaigrette, this dish becomes salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Start with an easy-to-cook whole grain and add walnuts, the nut of nuts for menopause.  Walnuts are the highest in omega-3 fatty acids, which are generally in short supply in our standard diet, and also contain manganese, copper, and magnesium.  Walnuts are nourishment for all your vital organs that are busy changing gears.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              small  baking potatoes - (8 oz)
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  lowfat cottage cheese
  3        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives or scallion tops

Bake potatoes for 50 minutes at 400 degrees.  Cut a thin slice from the top of each potato.  Remove the pulp from the potatoes, being careful not to tear the shells.  Place the potato pulp in a mixing bowl and mash.  Cover and set aside.  Keep the shells warm.

Cook the onion in a medium skillet, covered, over very low heat until soft, stirring occasionally and adding a little water if necessary to prevent scorching.  Add the mashed potatoes, buttermilk, cottage cheese, and Parmesan and mix well.  Heat through.

Stuff the potato mixture back into the warm shells.  The mixture will be heaped way over the top.

To serve, sprinkle the top of each stuft spud with 1 tablespoon of chopped chives or scallion tops.  If you have prepared the potatoes in advance, reheat them in a 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes, or until hot, before adding the chopped chives or scallions.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Recipe By     :Pamela Sheldon Johns
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
     1/2           cup  cold unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  ice water - (to 5)
                        === ONION AND APPLE FILLING ===
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  red sweet onions -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  minced pancetta - (3 oz) -- optional
     1/2           cup  apple juice
  1                     Rome apple -- peeled, cored,
                        And diced
  3                     pippin or Granny Smith apples
  1                cup  milk
  2                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
     3/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese - (3 oz)

To make the pastry:  Cut the butter into tablespoon-sized pieces.  In a food processor, combine the flour and salt.  With the machine running, drop in 1 piece of butter at a time, processing until evenly distributed.  Pulse, adding water just until the dough comes together.  Do not over-process, or the dough will be tough.  Place in plastic wrap and flatten into a disk shape.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out to a thickness of 1/4 inch.  Fit the dough into a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  Line with parchment paper and fill with pastry weights.  Bake for 35 minutes, or until firm and lightly colored.  Place on a wire rack to cool slightly.

To make the filling:  In a sautÈ pan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil and sautÈ the onions and pancetta until lightly browned, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with the apple juice, scraping the sides to loosen particles of cooked-on onion.  Bring to a boil.

Add the diced Rome apple to the pan, lower heat to a simmer, and cook until the apple is falling-apart tender and the liquid is reduced, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Let cool.

Peel, core, and slice the apples.

In a bowl, beat the milk, eggs, and coriander together.  Stir into cooled apple-onion mixture.  Fold in the sliced apples and pour into the pastry shell.

Top with Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the cheese is golden brown and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Transfer to a wire rack and let cool slightly before cutting.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This sweet and savory tart goes well with roasted pork and poultry dishes.  It could also be served as an appetizer or first course.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  sliced or slivered almonds
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  16       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
  2          teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
                        Finely-minced zest of 1 large orange
                        Powdered sugar

Position a rack in the center of the oven.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place the almonds in a cake pan or pie plate and toast 5 minutes.  Shake the pan and continue to toast until light golden, about 5 more minutes.  Let cool.  Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

Place the almonds, flour, sugar, cardamom, and salt in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade.  Pulse briefly to blend.  Add the butter and pulse until it is cut into tiny pieces.  Add the vanilla and orange zest and process the dough until it wraps itself around the blade, 30 to 60 seconds.

Pinch off pieces of the dough and roll them into balls about 1 inch in diameter.  Place the balls on the lined baking sheets, leaving 1 inch of space between them.

Bake about 20 minutes, until lightly golden and set.  Cool on baking sheets on racks.  Dust the cookies with powdered sugar.

  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract

Beat ingredients except cashews, Orange Glaze, and orange peel in medium bowl with electric mixer on medium speed about 2 minutes or until well blended.  Stir in cashews.  Spread over baked crust.

Bake 19 to 22 minutes or until top is golden brown and set around edges.  Cool in pan on wire rack.

Prepare Orange Glaze.  Mix ingredients until smooth and spreadable.  Spread glaze evenly over baked layer.  Cut into 2- by 1 1/2-inch bars.  Garnish with orange peel.

                      Catfish With Lemon-Caper Sauce

Recipe By     :Jean-Pierre Brehier
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     skinless and boneless catfish fillets - -- (6 to 8 oz ea)
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- seasoned with
                        salt and pepper -- for dredging
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  finely-diced red onions
     1/2           cup  dry vermouth
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  small capers
  1           teaspoon  sugar -- dissolved in
     1/4           cup  evaporated skim milk

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Dredge the fish fillets in the seasoned flour. Tap off the excess flour.

In a nonstick sautÈ pan, heat the olive oil to sizzling and sautÈ the catfish until a light golden brown on one side.  Flip the fillets to the other side.  Transfer to an oven-proof dish and bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 7 minutes, or until cooked to your liking.

In the meantime, in the same sautÈ pan, add the onions.  Cook for 2 minutes until translucent.  Add the vermouth and cook until reduced by half.  Add the lemon juice, capers, and sweetened evaporated milk.  Heat for less than 1 minute, but do not bring to a boil!

Take the fish out of the oven and arrange on serving plates with the sauce on top of each fillet.

Serve with couscous and asparagus spears gently sautÈed in butter.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe is an easy introduction to cooking this delicate catfish, which is a mild-tasting fish with a great texture.  No other fish quite compares to it!  But if you prefer, you can replace it with snapper, mahi-mahi, or even swordfish.

Preheat broiler.  Line a baking tray with aluminum foil and place red bell peppers on tray.  Spray peppers with olive oil spray.  Broil 5 minutes per side.

Heat oil in a medium-sized nonstick frying pan on medium-high heat.  Add onion and garlic and sautÈ 5 minutes.  Remove peppers from broiler, and core, seed, and slice them.  Add peppers and tomatoes to frying pan.  Simmer 15 minutes.  If mixture is watery, cook a few minutes more.  Sprinkle with sugar and toss well.  Add salt and pepper to taste.

Place pita in broiler, which should still be warm from cooking peppers, for 2 minutes before serving.  Spoon warm salad into a serving bowl or on individual plates with couscous salad and serve with warm pita bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN ===
  2               cups  vegetable broth
                        = (or filtered water)
  3                     skinless chicken breasts on the bone -- split in the middle
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1                     chili pepper
  1                     bay leaf
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
     1/2                celery stalk -- cut into chunks
  6                     black peppercorns
                        === SALAD ===
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds - (to 3/4)
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped bok choy stalks
                        = (the white part)
  1                cup  seedless organic red grapes -- cut in half
  1                cup  organic plain yogurt
     1/2      teaspoon  turmeric - (to 3/4)
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  watercress

Place all chicken ingredients in a shallow pan and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and cook for about 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove from heat and cover.  Allow chicken to cool until you can handle it without burning your fingers.  Remove from bones and slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces.

Combine all the salad ingredients except for the watercress while the chicken is a little lukewarm, to blend flavors.  Adjust seasonings by adding the turmeric and the salt and ground pepper to taste.

Clean and dry the watercress, and serve the chicken salad on watercress.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  If you like chicken salad, you'll love this one!

Tip:  Try bok choy stalks diced into your favorite salads instead of celery, to increase your intake of breast-protective cruciferous vegetables.

Breast-Protective Power Foods:  Almonds, bok choy, red grapes, yogurt, turmeric, watercress, garlic, chlli pepper, onion, celery.

                Chicken Scaloppine With Ham And Asparagus

Recipe By     :Nick Stellino
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless chicken breasts - (6 to 8 oz ea)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4        tablespoons  flour
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  4        tablespoons  cold butter
  3                     garlic cloves -- thickly sliced
     1/8      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  thyme
     1/2         pound  asparagus -- cut into 1/4" pieces
                        = (if spears are fat, cut in half
                        lengthwise before cutting into pieces)
     1/2           cup  honey-glazed ham -- cut into small dice
     1/2           cup  white wine
     1/2           cup  chicken stock

Remove the chicken tenderloin, the thin tapering piece of meat on the lower edge of the breast, from each breast half and freeze for another use.  Slice each chicken breast into 3 pieces, widthwise across the grain.  Pound the slices lightly between 2 pieces of plastic wrap to a thickness of 1/4 inch.  Sprinkle both sides of the chicken pieces with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper and dust with the flour, shaking off any excess.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large sautÈ pan set on high heat until the olive oil starts to sizzle, about 2 minutes.  Add the prepared chicken slices in one layer and cook 1 minute on each side, until lightly browned.  You may need to brown the chicken in 2 batches, depending on the size of the pan.  Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.

Add the remaining olive oil to the same pan set on high heat.  Cook the garlic, red pepper flakes, thyme, asparagus, and ham for 1 minute, stirring well.  Pour in the wine and boil until reduced by half, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir in the chicken stock and the remaining salt and pepper and bring to a boil.  Cook for 1 minute.  Return the browned chicken to the pan to reheat for 1 minute.  Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the chicken to serving dishes.  Stir the remaining butter into the sauce to thicken.  Top the chicken with the sauce and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  When sweet honey ham and tender asparagus pieces are served with meltingly tender chicken breast slices, the result is irresistible!  The most important step is to pre-pound the meat slices to the proper thickness.  This can be done a day ahead of time.  Just put the pieces between layers of plastic wrap or wax paper and store in the refrigerator.

                   Chicken With Greek Olives And Cheese

Recipe By     :Peggy Fallon
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (3 1/2 lbs) -- cut into 8 pieces
  5        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh oregano
                        = (or 1 1/2 tspns dried oregano)
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
  1             medium  onion -- sliced 1/4" thick
  1                cup  chicken broth
  1                can  diced peeled tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz) -- drained
  16                    kalamata olives - (abt 1/3 cup) -- pitted
  1               dash  cayenne
  4             ounces  feta cheese
                        Oregano sprigs
                        Lemon wedges

Rinse the chicken under cold running water and pat dry.  Place the chicken in a heavy-duty 1-gallon plastic bag.  Add 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice, 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, 1 tablespoon of the oregano, the garlic, and pepper.  Seal the bag securely and turn several times to coat the chicken.  Let stand 1 hour at room temperature.  Remove the chicken, pat dry, and season with salt.  Discard any leftover marinade.

In a 12-inch nonreactive skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat.  Add the chicken and cook, turning, until nicely browned, about 10 minutes.  Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.  Drain off all but 2 teaspoons of the fat from the pan.

Add the onion to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, 3 to 5 minutes.  Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice and the chicken broth.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Stir in the tomatoes, olives, and cayenne.

Return the chicken to the skillet and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the chicken is white throughout but still juicy, 20 to 30 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken and olives to a warm serving platter.  Increase the heat to medium-high and cook until the sauce has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes.

Crumble the feta cheese over the chicken and cover with the warm sauce.  Sprinkle with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oregano.  Garnish with the oregano springs and lemon wedges.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The lusty flavors of this sauce requires a crusty loaf of coarse, country-style white bread for maximum enjoyment.

Rinse the chicken under cold running water and pat dry.  Place the chicken in a heavy-duty 1-gallon plastic bag.  Add 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice, 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, 1 tablespoon of the oregano, the garlic, and pepper.  Seal the bag securely and turn several times to coat the chicken.  Let stand 1 hour at room temperature.  Remove the chicken, pat dry, and season with salt.  Discard any leftover marinade.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 12-inch nonreactive skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat.  Add the chicken and cook, turning, until nicely browned, about 10 minutes.  Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.  Drain off all but 2 teaspoons of the fat from the pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the onion to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, 3 to 5 minutes.  Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice and the chicken broth.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Stir in the tomatoes, olives, and cayenne.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the chicken to the skillet and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the chicken is white throughout but still juicy, 20 to 30 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken and olives to a warm serving platter.  Increase the heat to medium-high and cook until the sauce has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Crumble the feta cheese over the chicken and cover with the warm sauce.  Sprinkle with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oregano.  Garnish with the oregano springs and lemon wedges.  Serve at once.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The lusty flavors of this sauce requires a crusty loaf of coarse, country-style white bread for maximum enjoyment.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     artichokes
     1/2                lemon
                        === SPICY MUSTARD SAUCE ===
  1                cup  nonfat or lowfat yogurt
  3        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
                        = (grainy-style preferred)
  2        tablespoons  low-fat mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  horseradish
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Lemon wedges

Wash each artichoke and slice off both ends so that it can sit flatly on a surface.  Immediately rub the cut ends with the lemon half to prevent discoloration.  Cut away any ragged leaves, and snip off the sharp edges of the leaves with a kitchen scissor.

Steam the artichokes in a vegetable steamer, or on a rack in a pot with 1 inch of water and cook for 40 to 45 minutes, over medium heat, or until a leaf can be removed easily.  (Be carefull not to let the water boil away.)  Remove from the pan with tongs, drain thoroughly, and chill in a covered container in the refrigerator.

Whisk the sauce ingredients together and chill until ready to use.

Serve each chilled artichoke with a small container of sauce, garnished with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Artichokes can be successfully cooked in a microwave oven.  Place the trimmed artichokes in a microwave-safe dish and cover with plastic wrap or a domed lid.  Cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or until tender.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/4           cups  coarse-grind yellow cornmeal
                        = (or masa harina para tamales)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  buttermilk
  2                     eggs
     1/3           cup  corn oil
  2                     canned whole chipotles in adobo
  1                cup  shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Grease a cast-iron skillet and place it in the oven.  Or grease a 10-inch springform or pie plate and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a food processor or blender, combine the buttermilk, eggs, oil, and chipotles.  Blend until the chipotles are finely chopped.  Add the buttermilk mixture and the cheese to the dry ingredients and stir with a spoon or rubber spatula until ingredients are just blended.  Take care not to overmix.  Pour the batter into the skillet or pan.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden around the edges.  A cake tester inserted into the center will come out clean.  Let stand for 15 minutes before cutting into wedges to serve.

This recipe yields one 10-inch round bread.

Comments:  Chipotle, smoked and dried jalapeÒos, are readily available canned.  This corn bread is best baked in a cast-iron skillet, but you can use a spring-form or pie pan.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  cake flour
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  2               cups  egg whites - (12 to 14 eggs)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cream of tartar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        Confectioners' sugar -- (optional)
                        Strawberry or peach slices -- (optional)

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.

Sift together the cake flour, the cocoa, and 3/4 cup of the granulated sugar onto a sheet of waxed paper.  Repeat the sifting 2 more times.  Set aside.

Put the egg whites in a large bowl.  Using an electric mixer set on low speed, beat just until foamy on top, about 30 seconds.  Add the cream of tartar, salt, and vanilla; increase the speed to medium and beat until the whites have increased to about 5 times their original volume and have formed a foamy white mass that is still quite soft and flattens out when you stop beating.

Continuing to beat, gradually add the remaining 3/4 cup granulated sugar, taking about 15 seconds to incorporate it.  Then beat until the whites form a shiny, voluminous mass of very tiny bubbles.  They should barely hold their shape when the beater is lifted, and slide when the bowl is tilted.

Sift the flour-cocoa mixture over the whites, then, using a rubber spatula, gently and quickly fold it in, just until there are no unblended drifts of flour.  Pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch angel food or tube pan and tap the pan firmly but gently on the counter once or twice to settle the batter.

Bake until the cake has risen to the top of the pan, or higher, and a thin wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Invert the pan; if it doesn't have legs around the top rim, place the tube over an inverted metal funnel or the neck of a bottle for support.  Cool upside down for at least 2 hours, or longer.

To remove the cake from the pan, run a long metal icing spatula between the cake and the pan.  Gently ease the cake out of the pan onto a serving plate.  Dust the top with confectioners' sugar, if desired.  Cut into wedges to serve and accompany with sliced fruit, if desired.

This recipe yields one 10-inch cake; 10 servings.

                             Cold Salsa Verde

Recipe By     :Jane Butel
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Salsa
                Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  raw -- quartered tomatillos
                        = (or a 10-oz can undrained tomatillos)
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped Spanish onion
  2        tablespoons  fresh cilantro leaves
  1                     fresh jalapeÒo chile -- or to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Steam the tomatillos in boiling water until tender, about 8 minutes, or open a can and drain.  Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor.  PurÈe them, then adjust seasonings and piquancy.  This sauce is predictably hot.

This recipe yields 1 pint.

Comments:  Here is a very traditional green sauce that is excellent over chicken, seafood, or pork dishes, and is also frequently served as a table relish.  Tomatillos (Mexican green tomato-like fruit) are called for here to give the sauce its traditional flavor; they are increasingly available at gourmet and chain food stores and Mexican specialty shops.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/4         pound  bacon -- cut small dice
  1                     chicken - (4 lbs) -- cut 12 pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  dry red wine
                        = (such as Cabernet Sauvignon or
                        CÙtes-du-Rhone)
  4               cups  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-chopped parsley -- plus
  6                     fresh parsley sprigs -- tied together with
                        kitchen string
  2                     parsnips -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" lengths
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" lengths
  1                     turnip -- peeled, and
                        cut into wedges
  1                     rutabaga -- peeled, and
                        cut into wedges
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

In a large, heavy pot over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter.  Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden, about 10 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a plate.

Rinse the chicken pieces and pat dry with paper towels.  Sprinkle on all sides with salt and pepper.  Raise the heat to medium-high and, working in batches, add the chicken pieces to the pot.  Cook, turning as necessary, until lightly golden, about 10 minutes.

When all of the chicken is golden, return the pieces to the pot along with the bacon.  Raise the heat to high and add the wine, stock, tomato paste, garlic, bay leaves, chopped thyme, and parsley sprigs.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the chicken juices run clear when a thigh is pierced, 25 to 30 minutes.  Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a large shallow dish and keep warm.

Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve and return it to the pot.  Place over high heat and add the parsnips, carrots, turnip, and rutabaga.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables to the dish holding the chicken.

In a small bowl, using a fork, mix the flour and the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to form a paste.  Bring the liquid in the pot to a boil over high heat and whisk in the flour-butter mixture.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid lightly coats a spoon, 2 to 3 minutes.

To serve, add the chicken and vegetables to the pot and heat through.  Using the slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables and chicken to a warmed platter.  Drizzle with the sauce and garnish with the chopped parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Root vegetables come in a range of colors, shapes, and sizes.  If you like, substitute baby root vegetables for the regular-sized ones called for here.

                               Corn Pudding

Recipe By     :Joyce White
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  fresh corn kernels
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- more if desired
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine
  2                     eggs -- room temperature
  1                cup  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Generously butter a 2-quart baking dish and set aside.

Place 1/2 cup of the corn in the blender and whirl until purÈed.

In a large bowl, combine the purÈed corn, remaining corn kernels, flour, sugar, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper and mix well.  Cut the butter or margarine into small pieces and stir into the corn mixture.

Place the eggs into a medium bowl and beat vigorously until they are light and foamy.  Add the beaten eggs and the milk to the corn mixture, stirring well.  Pour the pudding into the baking dish.  Sprinkle the top with the nutmeg.

Set the dish into a large roasting pan and pour enough water into the roasting pan to reach about one-quarter of the way up the sides of the baking dish.  Carefully set the roasting pan (with the baking dish inside) in the hot oven on the middle shell.

Bake the pudding for 40 to 45 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Remove from the oven, let set a few minutes, and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 or more servings.

Comments:  "We try to make people feel comfortable, regardless of how they are attired or their station in life," says Dr. Wells, who is president of the Women's Division of the Pennsylvania Baptist State Convention.  "When we feed the homeless we are sharing our bounty.  We want them to eat just as we do.  We don't have the homeless standing in line here.  We have to do more to reaffirm our people."

Dr. Wells sends this recipe for corn pudding, which she says has been in her family for generations.

                            Cranberry Muffins

Recipe By     :Chuck Williams
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Muffins

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  dried cranberries -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  Cointreau
                        = (or other orange-flavored liqueur)
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                     lightly-beaten egg -- room temperature
  1                cup  milk -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- melted

Preheat an oven to 375 degrees.  Butter 12 cups of a standard muffin tin(s).  Place the cranberries in an oven-proof bowl and stir in the liqueur.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil and place in the oven until the cranberries puff up and absorb the liquid, 5 to 10 minutes.  In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.

In yet another bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, and melted butter until well blended.  Using a wooden spoon, quickly fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture, then stir in the cranberries; do not overmix.  Spoon the batter into the prepared cups, filling them two-thirds full.

Bake until well risen and browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let stand in the tin(s) for about 3 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 12 muffins.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  3        tablespoons  flour
     3/4           cup  chopped onion
  1            package  portobello caps, stems, or slices - (6 oz) -- cut into 1" chunks
                        Salt -- to taste
  2               cups  milk
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
  2        tablespoons  Marsala or sweet sherry
  2             ounces  Roquefort or blue cheese -- (optional)

Heat 3 tablespoons of the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Add the flour and stir constantly until a paste (roux) forms.  Continue to stir and cook for another minute, until the flour is cooked.  Remove from the heat and set aside.

Place the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onion and sautÈ until golden, about 2 minutes.  Add 2 tablespoons of water to the pan and then add the mushrooms.  Salt lightly, reduce the heat, and cover.  Let the pan sit over the heat for about 10 minutes.

Remove the lid and add the milk, cream, pepper, and thyme.  Increase the heat and bring almost to a boil -- when bubbles form around the edge of the pan.  Stirring, add all of the butter-flour mixture to the milk.  Add the Marsala or sherry and stir with a whisk over medium heat until the soup thickens, 3 to 4 minutes.  Adjust for salt.  Ladle the soup into bowls and sprinkle a little of the cheese over the top, if desired.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                  Curried Tofu With Spinach And Tomatoes

Recipe By     :Lorna Sass
Serving Size  : 3     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  extra-firm or firm tofu block -- frozen defrosted,
                        and drained
  1         tablespoon  ghee (clarified butter)
                        = (or peanut oil)
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped onion
  1                cup  water
     1/4           cup  mild curry paste -- (see comments)
  3        tablespoons  unsweetened grated dried coconut
  3              large  plum tomatoes -- cored, and
                        cut into eighths
     3/4         pound  spinach -- thoroughly washed,
                        trimmed, and coarsely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/3           cup  chopped cilantro - (to 1/2) -- optional

Set the block of defrosted tofu between 2 plates and, pressing the plates firmly together, tip them over the sink as the tofu releases excess water.  Release the pressure slightly, then press the plates firmly together again 4 or 5 more times, or until no more water is expressed.  With a serrated knife, slice the tofu into 1-inch cubes.  Set aside.

Heat the oil in a large, heavy saucepan or wok over medium-high heat.  SautÈ the onions, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.  Add the water and blend in the curry paste and coconut.  Stir in the reserved tofu, taking care to coat the tofu thoroughly with the curry sauce.  Stir in the tomatoes.

Cover and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are soft, about 5 minutes.  If the mixture seems quite dry, stir in 1/4 cup water at this point.  Add the spinach.  (If your pot isn't big enough, you may need to add half, cover, and let it wilt before adding the remainder.)  Cover and continue cooking until the spinach is tender, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add salt and the cilantro, if you like.

This recipe yields 3 servings.

Comments:  You'll find 10-ounce jars of Patak's curry paste (and a myriad of other pickles and chutneys made by this venerable British company) in any Indian grocery and in many specialty-food shops, or you can order it by mail or substitute your own favorite brand of curry paste.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  chickpea miso
                        = (or sweet mellow white)
                        Juice of 2 lemons
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled, minced
  2                     leeks -- cleaned thoroughly,
                        halved both horizontally and vertically
  2                     salmon fillets
  4             sprigs  fresh cleaned dill - (to 5)

Mix miso, lemon juice, and garlic in a suribachi using a grinding motion.  The sauce should be the consistency of a creamy salad dressing.

Line a stainless steel steamer basket with the leeks.  Gently rinse salmon fillets in filtered water and place on bed of leeks.  Pour sauce over salmon and leeks.

Place steamer containing fish and leeks in a large pot with a half inch of filtered water.  Cover, bring to a low boil, and steam for 15 to 20 minutes depending on thickness of steaks.  Add dill during the last 3 minutes.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Tip:  The delicious sauce with this flavorful dish goes well with long-grain boiled rice.  Enjoy with a salad or lightly steamed vegetables for a gourmet meal.

Comments:  Steaming salmon preserves powerful fish oils (EPA and DHA) and also contributes to a tender moist dish.  Broiling, grilling, or sautÈing cold water fish not only destroys protective oils, but creates potent carcinogens found in burned fats.

Breast-Protective Power Foods:  Salmon, leeks, lemon juice, dill, miso, garlic.

  4                     cod, scrod, or haddock steaks - -- (1/2 lb ea)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  fresh or frozen peas
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the garlic and sage.  Stir until the garlic turns golden, about 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes with 1/2 cup of the reserved juices and bring to a simmer.  Cook until the sauce thickens slightly, about 10 minutes.

Add the fish, salt, and pepper.  Cover and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the peas and continue cooking until the fish flakes easily, 3 to 5 minutes.  Sprinkle with the parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The Livornese make this dish with small, whole mullets from the Tuscan coastline, but it is just as delicious with thick steaks of firm, white-fleshed fish like cod or haddock.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (3 to 3 1/2 lbs)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  flour
  1                     celery stalk
  2                     onions
  2                     garlic cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  2        tablespoons  oil
  2               cups  chicken broth

Cut the chicken into serving pieces: the breast into halves, the legs and thighs separated, plus the wings, for a total of 8 pieces.  Trim away any visible fat and discard.  Rinse the chicken well under cold running water.  Pat dry with paper towels.

Sprinkle the chicken with the salt and black pepper.  Place the chicken in a plastic or brown bag.  Pour the flour into the bag and shake well to cover the chicken all over.  Remove the chicken from the bag and dust off excess flour.  Save 1 tablespoon of the flour to use to thicken the gravy.

Dice the celery, slice the onions, and mince the garlic.  Crush the thyme.  Set aside.

Heat the oil in a large skillet that has a cover.  Add the chicken and sautÈ over medium-low heat for about 20 minutes, turning occasionally to brown evenly.  When golden brown, push the chicken to the side of the pan.  Add the reserved tablespoon of flour and sautÈ, stirring, until lightly browned.

Add the celery, onion, and garlic to the skillet and sautÈ for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the vegetables are tender.  Stir together the chicken and vegetables.

Add the chicken broth.  Bring to a gentle boil.  Reduce the heat to very low, cover, and simmer the chicken for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the chicken is fork-tender and the juices run clear when pierced.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                    Florentine Beef Stew With Potatoes

Recipe By     :Anna Teresa Callen
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             pounds  trimmed beef stew meat -- cut 1" cubes
                        = (such as chuck)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1             medium  carrot -- chopped
  1             medium  celery rib -- chopped
     3/4           cup  dry red wine
  1                can  peeled tomatoes - (16 oz) -- coarsely chopped,
                        juices reserved
  1           teaspoon  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  3             medium  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes

In a large Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the meat in 2 or 3 batches and cook, turning the pieces occasionally, until browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes per batch.  Return all the beef to the pot.  Season with the salt and pepper.

Add the onion, chopped carrot, and celery to the pot and reduce the heat to medium.  Cook, stirring often, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes.  Add the wine and bring to a boil, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Cook until the wine evaporates, 4 to 6 minutes.  Add the tomatoes with their juices, the tomato paste, 1 tablespoon basil, and 1 tablespoon parsley.

Cover and reduce the heat to low.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, 1 hour.  Add the potatoes and simmer 30 to 45 minutes longer.  Sprinkle with the remaining basil and parsley.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  The Florentines have a knack for cooking beef, certainly because the best steer in Italy is from Tuscany.  This kind of saucy stew is called a stufatino.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     egg yolks
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  granulated white sugar
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
                        Finely-grated zest of 2 lemons
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  granulated white sugar (for caramelized
                        tops)
                        Lemon peel for garnish

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  In a large bowl, combine yolks, eggs, and sugar.  Whisk until smooth.  Stir in lemon juice, zest, and cream.  Allow oils from the zest to seep into the custard mixture for about 10 to 15 minutes.  Strain into a large bowl, skimming off any foam or bubbles.

Divide mixture among 6 ramekins or custard cups.  Place in a water bath, and bake until set around the edges, but still loose in the center, about 40 to 50 minutes.  Remove from oven and leave in the water bath until cooled.  Remove cups from water bath and chill for at least 2 hours, or up to 2 days.

When ready to serve, sprinkle about 2 teaspoons of sugar over each custard.  For best results, use a small, handheld torch to melt sugar.  If you don't have a torch, place under the broiler until sugar melts.  Re-chill custards for a few minutes before serving.  Garnish with thin strips of fresh lemon peel.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Soak the beans overnight in water to cover, with the minced rosemary.

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.

In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat the 3 tablespoons oil and sautÈ the onion, carrot, and celery until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Add the chicken stock and drained beans.  Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.  Add rosemary sprig and cook uncovered, at a simmer for approximately 2 hours, or until beans are tender but not falling apart.

Meanwhile, place the tomatoes cut-side up on a wire rack on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle with sea salt and put in the warmed oven for approximately 2 hours.  Tomatoes will dehydrate and intensify in flavor but still be a little soft.

Remove the tomatoes from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees.

Toss the potatoes with the remaining olive oil and season liberally with sea salt.  Place in a roasting dish and roast, turning occasionally, for 40 to 45 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork and the cut edges are golden brown.

When the beans, tomatoes, and potatoes are all done, cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain well and place in a large bowl.  Add the beans and their cooking liquid and the potatoes.  Add the tomatoes and sprinkle the Parmigiano-Reggiano chips over the top.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Timing is everything in this recipe.  Use your toaster oven to roast the potatoes while drying the tomatoes in the regular oven.  If you don't have a second oven, cook the potatoes on top of the stove and finish them under the broiler just before serving.

                            Ginger-Lemon Brew

Recipe By     :Brenda Adderly with Lissa De Angelis
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  unsweetened apple juice
                        = (or water)
  4                     thin fresh ginger slices
  1                     lemon -- organic preferred
  2          teaspoons  honey -- (optional)

In a medium-sized saucepan, heat the apple juice and ginger.  Juice the lemon and add, with the rinds, to the juice mixture.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes.

Strain through a sieve into 2 mugs, and sweeten with honey, if desired.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Yummy and warming, this brew contains many bioflavonoids in the citrus.  This Joint Strengthener Drink slows the inflammation response and hastens the healing of athletic injuries.

Healthful Hint:  Include ginger in foods frequently.  It will help to reduce swelling and to override the discomforts from inflammatory osteoarthritis.  It is also beneficial to the digestion by aiding in the breakdown of fatty foods, preventing flatulence, and stimulating the liver.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Granny Smith or McIntosh apples -- quartered, and
                        core removed
  1                     onion -- peeled, quartered
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled
     1/2         bunch  fresh parsley -- thick stems
                        removed and washed
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2         pounds  lean ground turkey
     1/2           cup  rolled oats or whole grainbread crumbs
  2                     eggs -- organic preferred
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     3/4      teaspoon  marjoram
     1/2      teaspoon  sage
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a blender or food processor, pulse mince the apples, onion, garlic, and parsley.

Melt the butter in a medium skillet, on a moderate flame.  Add the apple mixture.  Cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.  Stir frequently.  Remove from the flame and cool.

In a large bowl or processor, mix the apple mixture, turkey, oats, eggs, mustard, marjoram, sage, salt, and pepper.

Lightly oil a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan.  Pat the turkey mixture into the pan.  Bake until the top is golden, about 1 hour.

Remove the loaf from the oven, pour off any excess fat, and invert onto a platter.  Slice and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  An updated version of an old favorite, this meat loaf is a healthy and hearty entrÈe.  Leftover slices make great sandwiches.

Healthful Hint:  Ground turkey from the supermarket often contains turkey skin, which increases its fat content substantially.  For the leanest ground turkey, call ahead and ask the butcher to grind skinless turkey breast for you.  It will be ready to pick up when you get there.

        Grilled Rubbed Chicken Breast On Baby Greens With Dressing

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN BREAST RUB/BASTE ===
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  2        tablespoons  pure ground mild New Mexico chile
  2        tablespoons  pure ground hot New Mexico chile
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground ginger
  2          teaspoons  ground coriander
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon zest
                        = (the yellow part only; a zester works
                        best)
  2        tablespoons  pure Spanish olive oil
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
                        Green Chile Dressing -- (see recipe)
                        Baby Greens -- (see recipe)

Combine all the ingredients except for the oil and the chicken in a shallow, nonreactive bowl that is large enough to hold the 4 chicken breasts, and then add the oil.  Trim the chicken breasts of cartilage and fat.  Rub the mixture evenly over the breasts, using all of it.  Allow the chicken to remain in the bowl until ready to grill.

Preheat the grill to medium hot or 450 degrees or heat the broiler or a heavy frying pan.  Grill the chicken about 3 to 5 minutes on each side or until done.  (The amount of time is dependent on the thickness of the chicken breast.)  To check doneness, slice into the meatiest portion; the meat should be white, not clear or pink.  Immediately remove to a cutting board and slice across the grain into 1/2-inch-wide strips.

Prepare the Green Chile Dressing.  For each serving, place the greens on four chilled plates.  Top with the sliced chicken on each.  Garnish each serving with the fresh diced tomatoes and scallions.  Either serve the salad dressing on the side or drizzle on each serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The rub/baste on the chicken breast truly raises it above the ordinary and is rather quick and easy to make.  Do be careful to evenly rub and pat it into the breast on both sides, allowing it to marinate at least an hour.  Don't worry if the chile seems to stain your hands when you rub it into the breasts -- chile washes right off with soap and water.

In the meantime, rinse and prepare the greens, spinning or patting them dry.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  ripe tomato -- finely chopped,
                        (optional)
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced white onion
  1                     fresh jalapeÒo chile -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped, (optional)
  3                     ripe avocados
     1/4           cup  finely-minced cilantro leaves - -- (lightly packed)
                        Juice of 1/2 lime
                        = (lemon juice can be substituted)
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        === FOR THE GARNISH ===
                        Leaves from 1 cilantro sprig -- chopped

Place the tomato, onion, and chile in a molcajete or a bowl and mash a bit but leave it chunky.  Halve the avocados lengthwise, remove the seeds, and scoop or squeeze all the flesh into the tomato mixture.  Mix together with the cilantro, lime juice, olive oil, and salt to taste.

Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve at once if possible.  The guacamole can be kept at room temperature for up to 1 hour.  First clean the sides of the bowl with a damp paper towel, then cover the surface directly with a piece of plastic wrap.  It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 or 3 hours, but it's best to wait and mix in the salt and cilantro when ready to serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                       Harvey Girl Orange Pancakes

Recipe By     :Beth Hensperger
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs
                        Grated zest of 2 oranges
  1                cup  fresh orange juice
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh orange or tangerine sections

In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, zest, orange juice, milk, and oil.  Combine the mixtures with a few swift strokes.  Fold in the orange sections.  Do not overmix.  The batter will be thin.

Heat a griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat until drops of water sprinkled on the surface dance over it, then lightly grease.  Using a 1/4-cup measure for each pancake, pour the batter onto the griddle.  Cook until bubbles form on the surface, the edges are dry, and the bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Turn once.  The second side will take about 1 minute to cook.  Serve at once or keep warm in a 200 degree oven until ready to serve.

This recipe yields about 16 pancakes.

Comments:  This is an adaptation of pancakes served in the Harvey Houses, dining facilities that were established on the Santa Fe railroad line from Kansas to California.  The waitresses were called Harvey girls.  These unique pancakes were originally made the size of a silver dollar.

Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  uncooked brown rice
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onions
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2             medium  carrots -- sliced 1/4"-thick
                        rounds
  2               cups  sliced fresh mushrooms
  1                cup  cooked chickpeas (garbanzo beans)
  2                     eggs -- beaten
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley or cilantro
  20                    toasted cashews or almonds -- coarsely chopped
                        Soy sauce

In a saucepan, bring the water and salt to a boil, and add the rice.  Bring the contents back to a boil, cover the pan, and turn the heat to the lowest setting.  Simmer for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the rice is tender.

About 20 minutes before the rice is done, heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the onions, and sautÈ, stirring frequently, until they soften, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and the carrots, and continue to sautÈ, stirring often, for 5 more minutes.  Add the mushrooms, and cook for another 10 minutes, stirring often, until the mushrooms are beginning to brown.  Add the chickpeas, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.

When the rice is ready and you are ready to eat, pour the eggs into the skillet, and cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until the eggs are just set, about 2 minutes.

Take the egg-mushroom mixture off the heat, and stir in the pepper, the parsley or cilantro, and the cashews or almonds.  Add the cooked hot rice, and stir well.  Serve the pilaf along with soy sauce for adding at the table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The kind of rice you use is up to you -- long- or short-grain brown rice, brown basmati rice, wehani rice -- any of these will do.  You can even, use 2 cups of reheated leftover rice.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2         pound  Gorgonzola cheese -- rind removed,

               Mango And Jambon Quesadillas, Yucatan Style

Recipe By     :Jane Butel
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  sweet (unsalted) butter -- melted
  6             medium  flour tortillas - (6" to 8" dia)
  1 1/2           cups  grated asadero cheese, Monterey Jack, or
                        combination of Jack and cheddar
  3                     thin fully-cooked ham slices -- diced
  1              large  ripe mango - (or 2 small) -- peeled and diced
  1                cup  Cold Salsa Verde -- (see recipe),
                        optional
     1/2           cup  sour cream
                        Lettuce or watercress -- to garnish

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.  Preheat a griddle or comal on medium-high heat.  Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the preheated griddle or comal with the butter, forming it in a half-circle the size of half the tortilla.

Place the tortilla on the griddle.  Add 1/4 cup grated cheese, spreading it over the buttered half-circle and allowing a 1-inch margin around the edge.

Add 1/6 of the ham and mango, reserving a few pieces of the mango for a garnish.  Then fold the tortilla over the filling.  Grill until the first half is lightly browned and the cheese is beginning to melt.  (You can tell this by gently pulling the tortilla apart to peek at the cheese.)  Brush the top side of the tortilla with a bit of melted butter and turn to brown the second side.  Place on a cookie sheet in a warm 250 degree oven.  Warm the plates.

Continue until all 6 have been made.  To serve, place each on a cutting board and cut as a pie into wedges.  Then place on the warm plate and spoon the tomatillo salsa over the center of the points where they come together.  Top with a dollop of sour cream, the reserved mango bits, the lettuce garnish, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  These are wonderful!  You can make them ahead and keep them warm in the oven while warming the plates.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  nonfat (skim) milk
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
     3/4           cup  pure maple syrup
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract

In a small saucepan, whisk together flour and milk.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is a thick paste, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool in refrigerator at least 1 hour.

In a medium bowl, combine butter, maple syrup, vanilla, and cooled paste and beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.  Chill in refrigerator at least 90 minutes before using.

This recipe yields enough frosting for a 2-layer, 9-inch cake.

Comments:  With its deep, rich maple flavor, this creamy, easy-to-work-with frosting is a perfect complement to apple or spice cake.

                      Maple-Glazed Balsamic Carrots

Recipe By     :Meesha Halm
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  baby carrots
     1/2           cup  homemade beef broth
                        = (or low-sodium canned broth or
                        substitute chicken broth or fruit juice)
     1/4           cup  maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar

In a medium skillet, combine the carrots, .broth, maple syrup, butter, salt, and pepper.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Cover and cook for 3 minutes (or 5 minutes for softer, candied-style carrots).

Increase the heat to high and uncover.  Cook, stirring often, until the carrots are just tender and the liquid is reduced to 2 tablespoons, 5 to 6 minutes.

Stir in the vinegar and cook until the liquid is reduced to a glaze, 1 to 2 minutes.  Serve hot.  (The carrots can be prepared up to 1 day ahead, covered, and refrigerated.  Reheat the carrots, covered, in a skillet over low heat before serving.)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Glazed carrots are a favorite side dish at family meals.  This very easy version is an elegant makeover, resulting in al dente carrots with a sweet, piquant glaze.  If you like softer, candied-style carrots, cook the covered carrots for an additional 2 minutes.  Peeled baby carrots are available at most supermarkets, but you can also use regular carrots cut into sticks 1 1/2 inches long by 1/2 inch wide.

Recipe By     :Jann Johnson
Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
                        === MAPLE GLAZE ===
  2        tablespoons  maple syrup
  3        tablespoons  sifted confectioners' sugar

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Lightly butter an 8-inch round pan, preferably one with a removable bottom, or use an ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheet.

In a medium bowl, with an electric mixer on low speed or a wooden spoon, beat the butter until light in color, about 1 minute.  Mix in the sugar, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, and salt.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.  Gradually mix in the flour until just combined.

Press the dough evenly into the pan, and use the back of a soup spoon to smooth the surface of the dough.  Or, pat the dough into an 8-inch round on the baking sheet and decoratively score or flute the edges.  Prick the dough attractively with a fork.

Bake in the center of the oven for about 45 minutes, until set and firm to a light touch.  Using a pastry brush, evenly coat the warm shortbread with the glaze.  Place the pan on a wire rack and let the shortbread cool completely.  Transfer the shortbread from the pan to a cutting board.  With a sharp, thin knife, cut into 16 wedges.

For the Maple Glaze:  In a small bowl, whisk maple syrup and sifted confectioners' sugar together until mixed.  Cover until use.

This recipe yields 16 wedges.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter -- melted, and
                        cooled for pan
  2          teaspoons  all-purpose flour -- for pan
  2               cups  sifted cake flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  16       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
  1 2/3           cups  granulated sugar
  5              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar

Position a rack in the center of the oven.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Brush the insides of a 9-inch-round tube or kugelhopf pan with the 2 teaspoons butter, then lightly dust with the 2 teaspoons flour, and shake out the excess.

Sift together the cake flour, baking powder, spices, and salt into a medium bowl; set aside.

In the bowl of a stand mixer or a medium bowl, using the flat-beater attachment or a hand-held mixer, beat the butter until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.  Gradually add the sugar and beat the mixture until thoroughly blended.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stop and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula frequently.  Add the vanilla and blend well.  Blend in the dry ingredients in 3 stages, mixing well after each addition.

Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and bake 55 to 60 minutes, until a wooden pick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Cool in pan on a rack 15 minutes.  Then invert the pan onto the rack and leave a few minutes for the cake to drop out of the pan.  Remove the pan and let the cake cool completely.

Dust the top of the cake with powdered sugar before serving.  The cake will keep 3 days at room temperature, well wrapped in plastic wrap.

This recipe yields one 9-inch tube cake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CARAMEL ===
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        === FOR THE CUSTARD ===
  2               cups  milk
                        A small pinch of salt
  3                     two-inch canela sticks
                        = (or 1 1/2 sticks cinnamon)
                        Peel of 1 orange -- left as whole as
                        possible with the white pith removed
  3                     eggs
  2                     egg yolks
  6        tablespoons  sugar

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Lightly butter six 4-ounce ramekins or custard cups.

To make the caramel, stir together the water and sugar in a heavy pot over medium-high heat.  Using a pastry brush dipped in water, brush the sides of the pot just above the sugar every minute or so to prevent crystals from forming.  Cook the sugar until a rich dark color is achieved.  Since the caramel will continue to cook once it has been removed from the heat, it should be "shocked" to prevent it from becoming too dark and bitter.  This is best done by setting the pot into a bowl of ice.  Be very careful not to get ice or water inside the pot, as a boil-over could result.  Spoon the cooled caramel into the mold or molds.  If the caramel becomes too thick or sets up completely, warm it over very low heat until it is pliable again.  Pour about 2 teaspoons caramel into each mold and tilt them from side to side to coat the bottom.  Reserve the remaining caramel for garnish.

For the custard, combine the milk, salt, and canela in a medium saucepan.  Bring the milk to a strong simmer over medium-high heat, stir in the orange peel, and remove from the heat.  Let the milk cool for 30 minutes.

Combine the eggs and egg yolks in a medium bowl and whisk in the sugar until the mixture is blended but not foamy.  Strain the milk into the eggs and sugar and whisk until blended.  Pour the custard into the prepared molds.  Place the molds in a baking pan and place in the oven.  Add water to 1/3 to 1/2 of the way up the sides of the molds.  Bake the flans for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until set.  Remove the flans carefully from the water bath and allow them to cool to room temperature.  Cover tightly and refrigerate them at least 4 hours or up to overnight.

When ready to serve, loosen the flans from the edges of the mold with your fingertips or a sharp knife pressed firmly against the edges of the pan.  Unmold individual flans directly onto their serving plates.  If making one large flan, put the serving plate on top of the mold and invert them both in tandem.  Lift the mold off carefully.  If desired, rewarm the remaining caramel with a few drops of water and drizzle around the flans.

This recipe yields 6 flans.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh chard
                        = (or 12 oz frozen chard)
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2                     anchovy fillets -- crumbled
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  orecchiette
                        Freshly-grated pecorino -- for serving

Cook the chard in a pot of salted boiling water (3 to 4 minutes for frozen, 8 to 10 minutes for fresh).  Drain well and squeeze out any extra moisture.  Chop finely.

Combine the garlic and crumbled anchovy fillet in a large sautÈ pan with the oil.  SautÈ until the garlic turns gold in color.  Add the chard.  Season with salt and pepper.

Cook the orecchiette in a large pot of salted, boiling water until al dente.  Drain well and transfer to the sautÈ pan with the sauce.  Toss for 1 to 2 minutes over medium-high heat.  Serve immediately with lots of freshly grated pecorino for sprinkling on each portion.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variations:  If you like hot dishes, this one works very well with 1/2 teaspoon crushed chilies.

For slightly different but equally delicious dishes, replace the chard with the same quantity of florets and diced stalks of green broccoli or cauliflower, or shredded savoy cabbage.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 2") -- trimmed, and
                        cut into eighths
     1/3           cup  hot water - (to 1/2)
     1/2           cup  nonhydrogenated unsalted peanut butter
  2        tablespoons  sweet white miso
  1         tablespoon  shoyu -- more or less
  3        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
                        Chili oil or ground cayenne pepper -- to taste (optional)

With the motor of the food processor running, pop the garlic and then the ginger through the feed tube and continue to process until they are finely chopped.  Remove the lid, scrape down the work bowl, and add 1/3 cup of water, the peanut butter, miso, and shoyu.  Blend until smooth.

Add the lime juice and a dash of chili oil (if using), and pulse a few times to distribute.  Thin with additional water, if you wish.  Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 5 days.  Shake well before each use and thin with extra lime juice or water if the mixture thickens on standing.

This recipe yields 1 1/4 cups.

Comments:  Use one-third cup water for a thickish dipping sauce, and thin the mixture with a few additional tablespoons of water for a dressing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  flank steak -- all visible fat
                        removed
  2          teaspoons  coarsely-cracked pepper
                        Vegetable oil spray -- as needed
                        === SAUCE ===
  1           teaspoon  light margarine
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
                        = (or 1/2 tspn bottled minced garlic)
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  fat-free milk
  2        tablespoons  crumbled blue cheese - (abt 1/2 oz)
  2        tablespoons  finely chopped green onion
  1         tablespoon  dry white wine or
                        nonalcoholic white wine -- (optional)

Make 6 shallow crisscross slashes on the meat (3 in each direction).  Rub meat with about half the pepper.  Make 6 slashes on other side of meat.  Rub with remaining pepper.

Lightly spray the unheated rack of a broiler pan with vegetable oil spray.  Broil meat 3 to 5 inches from the heat for 5 minutes.  Turn and broil 3 to 5 minutes, or until desired doneness.

Meanwhile, for sauce, melt margarine in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Add garlic; cook for 1 minute.

Stir in flour, then stir in milk all at once (a whisk works well).  Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly, about 5 minutes; cook and stir 1 minute more.  Remove from heat.  Stir in remaining sauce ingredients.

To serve, thinly slice meat diagonally across the grain.  Serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving:  177 calories;  21g protein;  8g total fat;  3g saturated fat;  0g polyunsaturated fat;  3g monounsaturated fat;  5g carbohydrates;  52mg cholesterol;  136mg sodium.

Comments:  Blue cheese has a strong flavor, so a little goes a long way.  That means you get a rich, creamy sauce for only a few extra calories and a little extra total fat and saturated fat.

                  Pot Roast Of Beef With Aceto Balsamico

Recipe By     :Chuck Williams
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              piece  beef rump, chuck, or round - (4 to 5 lbs)
  1                     yellow onion -- sliced
  1                     carrot -- peeled, sliced
  1                     celery stalk -- sliced
  1                     bay leaf
  3                     whole cloves
  3                     fresh thyme sprigs
                        = (or 1 tspn dried thyme)
  3                     fresh parsley sprigs
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil.  When hot, add the meat and brown well on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate.

Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion, carrot, and celery.  SautÈ, stirring, until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.  Add the bay leaf, cloves, thyme, and parsley.  Return the meat to the pot, sprinkle with the vinegar, and add the water.

Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook at a very gentle simmer for 2 hours, turning once halfway through the cooking.  Season with salt and pepper to taste, re-cover, and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes longer.

Remove from the heat and let rest in the pot, covered, for 5 minutes.  Transfer the meat to a warmed platter.  Tent loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm.  Strain the pot juices through a fine-mesh sieve into a saucepan and skim off the fat with a large spoon.  Place over high heat and boil until reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes.  Taste and adjust the seasonings.

Carve the pot roast.  Pour the reduced juices into a warmed bowl and serve alongside.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  As balsamic vinegar becomes more and more popular, find original ways to use it.  Serve this over potatoes or noodles to soak up alI the fragrant juices.

             Quiche With Broccoli, Chevre, And Roasted Pepper

Recipe By     :Dewey Gram
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Main Dish
                Quiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     red bell peppers
  1                     unbaked 9" pie shell
  1              large  egg white -- lightly beaten
  4              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  coarsely chopped fresh broccoli -- (abt 1/4" pieces)
     1/4           cup  shredded smoked Cheddar cheese - -- (abt 2 oz)
                        = (or other semi-hard cheese to your
                        liking)
     1/4           cup  cubed chËvre cheese - (abt 2 oz)
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter

Roast the peppers over an open gas flame, holding with a pair of tongs, or broil in the oven 4 to 6 inches from the heat, turning as needed until blackened and blistered all over, about 15 minutes.

Place in a paper bag and close.  When cool enough to handle -- don't want to scorch any fingers -- peel off the charred skin.  Core, seed, and dice the roasted pepper "meat" into small, pretty cubes.  Reserve.

Preheat your oven to 425 degrees.  Line pie shell with foil and fill with dried beans or rice.  Bake until just set, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from oven and carefully remove foil with beans (save beans or rice in a coffee can for other crusts).  Brush crust with egg white, and return to oven for 2 minutes.  Set aside.  Now the crust is sealed and won't get soggy.

Turn the oven down to 350 degrees.

In a bowl, beat eggs.  Beat in the flour, baking powder, milk, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.  Fold in broccoli, half the red pepper, the Cheddar, and the chËvre.  Pour into pie shell.  Dot surface with butter, and sprinkle with remaining red pepper.

Bake in 350 degree oven 45 to 50 minutes, or until quiche is set and slightly firm in center.  Loosely cover crust with foil if it browns too quickly.  Slide a knife into the center -- it should come out clean, or practically clean.

Serve hot from the oven with a fresh fruit salad.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                          Rice Salad With Shrimp

Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Salads/Dressings
                Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Juice of 1 lemon -- plus
  3        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1 3/4         pounds  raw shrimp in shell
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cups  rice
  4        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped arugula (rocket)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring 2 quarts of salted water and the juice of 1 lemon to a boil.  Add the shrimp and cook over high heat for 5 minutes.

Drain, let the shrimp cool slightly, and shell: detach the head, press the tail with two fingers at its base, and the body will slip out.

Put the shrimp in a bowl with almost all the oil.

Cook the rice in 2 1/2 quarts of salted, boiling water, stirring occasionally and allowing 13 to 15 minutes cooking time from when the water comes to a boil again.

When the rice is cooked, drain and pass under cold running water.  Drain thoroughly and transfer to the bowl with the shrimp.

Mix carefully, and add pepper to taste.  Check if more salt is needed and add the remaining lemon juice and oil.

Just before serving, add the arugula and mix again.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variation:  Shelling shrimp is not particularly complicated but it can be tedious.  It may be easier to buy shelled boiled shrimp in brine which only have to be drained and rinsed: they are excellent.  Alternatively, use frozen shelled shrimp which only have to be boiled for a few minutes.

Comments:  This salad makes an appetizing main course and can be prepared ahead of time.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  reddish brown-skinned sweet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  1              small  butternut squash - (abt 1 1/4 lbs) -- halved, seeded,
                        peeled, and cut into 1" pieces
  1                     onion -- quartered
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh sage
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  5               cups  chicken stock
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === HERBED SOUR CREAM ===
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh sage
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Finely-chopped fresh thyme -- for garnish

Preheat an oven to 425 degrees.

In a large bowl, combine the sweet potatoes, squash, onion, thyme, and sage.  Add the olive oil and toss to coat all the vegetables evenly with the oil.  Spoon the mixture onto a large baking sheet, spreading out the vegetables in a single layer.

Roast the vegetables, stirring twice, for 35 to 40 minutes, or until caramelized.  Use long oven mitts to protect your hands when stirring.  Remove from the oven and place half of the vegetables in a food processor fitted with the metal blade.  Add 2 cups of the chicken stock and process until smooth.  Place in a large saucepan and repeat with remaining vegetables and 2 cups of the stock.

Add the remaining 1 cup stock, the nutmeg, salt, and pepper to the soup, and bring to a sinuner over medium heat.  Taste for seasoning.

Meanwhile, prepare the Herbed Sour Cream:  In a small bowl, stir together all the ingredients.  Taste for seasoning.

To serve, ladle the soup into bowls.  Swirl a spoonful of the Herbed Sour Cream into each bowl and sprinkle with the thyme.  Serve immediately.

Advance Preparation:  Can be prepared up to 1 day ahead, covered, and refrigerated.  Reheat gently.  This soup also freezes well for up to 1 month.  Adjust the seasonings when you reheat the frozen soup.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  In this recipe, it is important to select the moist, reddish brown-skinned sweet potatoes (often labeled yams), rather than the drier, yellowish-skinned sweet potatoes, which are far less sweet.  Swirling in a dollop of herb-laced sour cream enhances the flavor and texture of this smooth orange soup without adding lots of fat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  cooked salmon -- canned or fresh
  1              small  onion
  1                     egg -- beaten
     1/2           cup  soft bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  hot sauce - (to 1/2)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley
     1/4           cup  flour
  4        tablespoons  butter or margarine
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

If using canned salmon, drain and pick over carefully to remove dark cartilage and bones.  Finely chop the onion.

Using a fork, flake the salmon and then combine in a medium bowl with the onion, egg, bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, black pepper, cheese, and parsley.  Using about one-third cup salmon mixture for each cake, shape the mixture into rounds, about 1/2-inch thick.

Sprinkle the flour on a plate or board.  Dredge the patties in the flour, coating well, but dusting off excess flour.

Place the patties in the refrigerator and let set for 30 minutes or longer.

Heat the butter or margarine in a large skillet until foamy and hot.  Add the patties and brown on both sides, cooking about 5 minutes.

Remove the salmon cakes from the pan and drain on paper towels.  Serve warm immediately, with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Hazel Knox remembers that years ago services at the all-black Bethpage Presbyterian Church in Concord, North Carolina, were considerably sedate, but the food served was just as finger-lickin' good as that at the other black churches in the community.

               Salmon With Gingered Balsamic Vinegar Sauce

Recipe By     :Meesha Halm
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  shredded fresh ginger
                        = (use the coarse holes of a cheese
                        grater)
  1         tablespoon  minced green onion
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed through
                        press
                        Nonstick vegetable oil cooking spray
  4                     salmon fillets - (abt 6 oz ea)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Position a flat broiler pan 6 inches from the source of heat and preheat the broiler.

In a small saucepan, bring the vinegar, ginger, green onion, and garlic to a simmer over low heat.  Remove from the heat and set aside.

Meanwhile, spray the broiler pan with nonstick cooking spray.  Season the salmon with salt and pepper.  Broil the salmon, skin-side down, until just opaque when flaked in the center with the tip of a knife, 5 to 7 minutes.

The salmon can also be grilled outside.  Prepare a fire in a kettle-type charcoal grill.  When the coals are hot and turn white, spread them evenly in the bottom of the grill.  Lightly oil the grill grate.  Place the salmon, skin-side down, on the grill grate and cover.  Cook until the fish is opaque when flaked in the center, about 5 minutes.

Transfer the fish to warmed dinner plates.  Spoon the vinegar with its seasonings over the fish and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Grilled or broiled salmon is an elegant dish that can be put on the table in a hurry.  Many Italians prefer to season their grilled fish with balsamico instead of the ubiquitous lemon wedge.  This recipe gets an added East-West dimension from the vinegar's infusion with ginger, green onions, and garlic.

     3/4           cup  pumpkin seeds -- coarsely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  dried white bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  mild extra-virgin olive oil

                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  boned chicken
                        = (preferably thigh meat)
  2                     scallions -- washed, chopped fine
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  1                     Scotch bonnet chile -- seeded, chopped fine
                        = (add extra if you like very hot food)
  1         tablespoon  mild curry powder
  1                     celery stalk -- washed, and
                        finely chopped (optional)
                        Leaves from 3 or 4 thyme sprigs -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Flesh of 1 whole coconut
                        Parsley sprig -- for garnish

Place the chicken pieces in a bowl with the scallions, garlic, onion, chile, curry powder, celery, thyme, and salt and pepper.  Stir together to mix, cover, and store in the refrigerator overnight.

To make the coconut cream, break the coconut flesh into pieces and grate it finely.  Save 1 tablespoon of the grated coconut for garnish.  Place remaining coconut in the bowl of a food processor or blender and add 4 cups of water.  Process until the coconut is totally liquefied, pour the liquid into a jug, and let it stand until it separates, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Strain off the resulting coconut cream and reserve 1 cup of the residual water.

Place the seasoned chicken and vegetables in a large saucepan and add the reserved coconut water.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until tender.  Add the coconut cream and simmer over low heat for a further 50 to 60 minutes.

Adjust the salt and pepper seasoning.  Add more chopped Scotch bonnet chile if desired.  Toast the reserved 1 tablespoon of grated coconut in a small, dry frying pan over low heat.

Put the chicken mixture into a serving dish, sprinkle with toasted coconut, and garnish with parsley.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Serve this dish with plain rice and a green salad.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  peanut oil
  1              pound  lean ground pork
     1/2         pound  shredded iceberg lettuce - (1 cup)
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Shaoxing rice wine

  2          teaspoons  Asian sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped scallions

Heat a wok or large frying pan until it is hot.  Swirl in the peanut oil, and when it is very hot and slightly smoking, add the pork and stir-fry it for 2 minutes.  Stir constantly to break up any lumps.

Toss in the lettuce; pour in the soy sauce, rice wine, and sesame oil.  Sprinkle in the sugar and continue to stir-fly for another 3 minutes, or until the pork is cooked.

Toss in the scallions and give the mixture several good stirs.  Serve at once.

Comments:  In this Chinese-American creation, iceberg lettuce is used as a vegetable, but substitute spinach, watercress, or Swiss chard, if you wish.  Any leafy vegetable in season will do.

  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  low-sodium chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried tarragon)

Peel the carrot, quarter it lengthwise, and then cut crosswise into pieces 1/2 inch thick.  Set aside with the onion and mushrooms.

Coat a large nonstick frying pan with nonstick cooking spray and place over medium-high heat.  When hot but not smoking, add the chicken breast halves and sprinkle with the 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Cook, turning once, until browned, about 2 minutes on each side.  Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.

Return the pan to medium-high heat and add the oil.  When hot but not smoking, add the carrot, onion, and mushrooms and cook briskly, stirring frequently, until the vegetables have softened and are lightly browned, about 7 minutes.  Sprinkle with the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until fully blended, about 2 minutes longer.  Add the broth and tarragon and bring to a boil, stirring frequently until slightly thickened.

Return the chicken breasts to the pan, pushing them down into the liquid.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the chicken breasts are opaque throughout when cut into with a knife and the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.

Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Smothered chicken is an old-fashioned dish that commonly appeared in early cookbooks.  It is satisfying, filling, and full of flavor, and is delicious served over rice.

                          Sole With Portobellos

Recipe By     :Jack Czarnecki
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2        medium  onion -- coarsely chopped
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon or lime juice
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  6             ounces  sliced portobello caps
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh dill or other herbs
                        = (or 1/4 tspn dried dill or other herbs)
  4                     sole fillets - (4 to 6 oz ea)

Pour the oil in a large skillet with a cover over medium heat.  Add the onion and sautÈ for about 30 seconds.  Add the lemon juice and soy sauce.  Add the mushrooms and season them lightly with salt.  Continue to sautÈ, stirring gently the whole time, until the mushrooms become limp and lose their chalk-white appearance.  When the mushrooms are very soft, in 10 to 12 minutes, add the herbs.  Continue to stir for another minute or so.

Season the sole fillets with salt and place over the mushroom mixture in the skillet.  Cover and place over medium heat.  Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until the fillets are just cooked.  Serve covered with the portobellos.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Mushrooms and fish always make an intriguing combination, but there are several important things to keep in mind, especially with delicate fish such as sole.  Since mushrooms have a natural earthy flavor, lighten that character a bit with a little lemon juice (but not too much!).  This portobello topping can be used with virtually any kind of fish, including oily fish like bluefish or salmon.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butler
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/4           cups  milk -- heated with
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, minced
  1              pound  fresh spinach -- stemmed, washed,
                        and chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     2/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese - (3 oz)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil a 13- by 9-inch baking dish.

Remove 1/4 cup of the sauce from the saucepan and set aside.  Add the spinach mixture to the saucepan and blend well.  Pour into the prepared baking dish.

Stir the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the reserved 1/4 cup sauce and pour over the top of the spinach mixture.  Bake for 15 minutes, or until heated through.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Keep this classic side dish tightly covered until ready to reheat and serve.

                              Split Pea Soup

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     smoked ham hocks - (abt 3/4 lb ea)
  1 1/2           cups  yellow or orange split peas
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     yellow onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     carrot -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  8               cups  chicken stock, vegetable stock or water -- plus
                        extra stock or water as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Coarsely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Bring a large saucepan three-fourths full of water to a boil.  Add the ham hocks and simmer for 1 minute.  Drain and set aside.

Pick over the split peas and discard any damaged peas or impurities.  Rinse the peas and drain.

In a soup pot over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the onion and carrot and sautÈ, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes.  Add the ham hocks, split peas, and stock or water.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer gently until the peas are soft, 50 to 60 minutes.

Remove from the heat.  Remove the ham hocks and let stand until cool enough to handle.  Let the soup cool slightly.

Using a blender and working in batches, purÈe the soup on high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes for each batch.  Return the purÈe to a clean soup pot and thin with more stock or water, if needed.  Place over medium heat and reheat to serving temperature.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

While the soup is heating, remove the meat from the ham hocks and discard the skin and bones.  Cut the meat into small pieces and add to the soup.  Stir to heat through.

To serve, ladle the soup into warmed bowls and garnish with parsley.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Dried peas and beans have long been menu standards of the winter months, Richly flavored split peas paired with smoked ham hocks is a classic cold-weather combination.  Top with buttery croutons before serving if you like.

                Steamed Halibut With Ginger And Scallions

Recipe By     :Ken Hom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  halibut fillets
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  Shaoxing rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
     1/4           cup  homemade chicken stock
                        = (or reduced-salt canned broth)
  8                     thin ginger slices
  5                     scallions -- cut into 3" pieces

Cut the halibut fillets into 2-inch chunks.  Place the fish in a heat-proof bowl and toss well with the salt.  Drizzle in the rice wine and stock, then scatter the ginger and scallions around the fish.

Next set up a steamer, or put a rack into a wok or deep pan, and fill it with 2 inches of water.  Bring the water to a boil over a high heat.  Carefully lower the bowl onto the rack.  Turn the heat to low and cover the wok or pan tightly.  Steam gently for 15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked.  When it is cooked, the fish should be firm to the touch.

Remove from the steamer and serve at once with rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variation:  This recipe is just as delicious with salmon fillets or any firm white fish fillets, such as sea bass.

Comments:  This is a fine example of South Chinese home cooking at its best: simple ingredients blended carefully and respectfully.

                       Sun-Dried Tomato Sandwiches

Recipe By     :Carol Field
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  30                    sun-dried tomatoes
     1/3           cup  fine dry bread crumbs
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/3           cup  grated pecorino cheese
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley - (to 3)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 5)

If you are using dry-packed sun-dried tomatoes, soak them in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes to reconstitute them; pat them dry.  If you are using sun-dried tomatoes in oil, barely pat them dry.

In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, garlic, grated cheese, parsley, and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Place half the tomatoes, skin-side down, on a clean work surface.  Pat 1 teaspoon of the mixture over the top of each, and cover with another sun-dried tomato, skin-side up, to make a sandwich.

Warm the remaining olive oil in a large sautÈ pan and very gently sautÈ the tomato sandwiches for a minute or two on each side.  Drain, pat them dry on paper towels, and serve at room temperature as part of an antipasto or as an informal appetizer with a glass of wine.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  "See," says Giovanna Passannanti, "Sicily has such incredible ingredients that it is easy for us to make fabulous food."  Point proved with this extraordinary addition to an antipasto.

You have a choice of sun-dried tomatoes for this dish: You can buy them already plumped in oil or you can refresh them yourself in warm water.  Taste your sun-dried tomatoes to be sure that they are not overly salty and look them over to be sure they are without holes.

               Sweet And Sour Beet Soup With CrËme Fraiche

Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  onions
  2             medium  carrots
     1/4         small  cabbage head
  2                     garlic cloves
  1              pound  fresh beets
  2             pounds  ripe tomatoes
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
  1 1/4         quarts  homemade vegetable stack
                        = (or canned vegetable broth or water)
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        = (or 1 tspn if using canned broth)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  rice or cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  honey
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Grated zest and juice of 1 small orange
                        = (about 1 tbspn grated zest and 1/4 cup
                        juice)
                        CrËme fraiche or sour cream -- for garnish
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh dill -- for garnish

Chop the onions.  Trim the carrots and thinly slice.  Shred the cabbage.  Finely chop the garlic.  Peel and dice the beets.  Peel, seed, and chop the tomatoes (or chop them whole, if you don't mind the skin and seeds).

In a large soup kettle or pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onions, carrots, and cabbage, and cook, covered (this is called sweating, since the vegetables give up their juices), until tender, about 7 minutes.  Add the garlic, and cook for another minute or two.

Stir in all the remaining ingredients, except the garnishes.  Simmer over low heat, uncovered, for at least 1 hour, or until all the vegetables are tender.  Taste for the sweet and sour balance, and correct with a splash of orange or lemon juice if need be.

This rich and tangy soup can be served piping hot right out of the pot, or chilled for a hot-weather meal.  If prepared a day in advance and serving chilled, check the seasoning -- the refrigerator chill will dampen the flavors.

Top with a swirl of crËme fraiche or sour cream and a sprinkle of chopped fresh dill.

Serve with fresh, home-baked rye bread or pumpernickel, with a crock of sweet Hoggett butter -- and mugs of good, cold beer or ale.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

                           Sweet Potato Souffle

Recipe By     :Joanne Weir
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  sweet potatoes
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     white onion -- minced
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose (plain) flour
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
  6                     eggs -- separated
  1                cup  shredded GruyËre cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat an oven to 375 degrees.

Pierce the potatoes two or three times with a fork and place on a baking sheet.  Bake until easily pierced with a knife, 30 to 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool.  Cut in half and scrape out the pulp into a bowl.  Using a potato masher, mash to form a smooth purÈe; you should have 2 1/2 cups.  Leave the oven temperature set at 375 degrees.

Butter a 2-quart soufflÈ dish and dust the bottom and sides with 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese.

In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the onion and sautÈ, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the milk until small bubbles appear along the edges of the pan; remove from the heat.

Add the flour to the onion and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes.  (Do not brown.)  Whisk in the milk all at once and simmer, continuing to whisk, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the nutmeg, allspice, and ginger.  Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add the sweet potato purÈe and the GruyËre cheese and stir until well blended.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

In a bowl, using an electric mixer set on high speed, beat the egg whites until they just hold stiff peaks.  Using a rubber spatula, fold one-fourth of the egg whites into the sweet potato mixture to lighten it.  Then gently fold in the remaining whites just until no white streaks remain.  Pour into the prepared soufflÈ dish.  Sprinlde with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.

Bake until puffed and golden, 45 to 50 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Contrary to popular belief, the tuberous roots most people refer to as sweet potatoes or yams are not related to the russet potato.  These natives of the New World are members of the morning glory family.  Their characteristic sweetness develops even further after harvest.

                           Sweet Potato Waffles

Recipe By     :Jeanne Jones
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Waffles

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  sweet potatoes -- peeled, cooked,
                        and mashed (3/4 cup)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  corn-oil margarine -- melted
  1             medium  egg white -- lightly beaten
     3/4           cup  lowfat (2 percent) milk
     1/2           cup  whole-wheat flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Preheat a waffle iron.

Combine the cooked sweet potatoes, margarine, egg white, and milk in a large bowl and beat until well blended.  Add the flour, baking powder, and salt and mix until smooth.

Spray the hot waffle iron with nonstick cooking spray.

Spoon 3/4 cup of the batter onto the center of the waffle iron and bake until it stops steaming.  Continue to make another waffle in the same manner with the remaining batter.

This recipe yields 2 waffles, or 4 servings.

Comments:  At Canyon Ranch these wonderful waffles are served with fresh fruit and pure Vermont maple syrup.  If you're in a hurry, you can substitute 3/4 cup of canned pumpkin for the sweet potato in this recipe.  You can also use this batter to make pancakes if you don't have a waffle iron.

                        Tacos Of Crispy Pork Bits

Recipe By     :Marilyn Tausend with Miguel Ravago
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  boneless pork shoulder, butt, or
                        meaty country-style ribs
  2                     white onions -- quartered
  6                     garlic cloves
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano, preferably Mexican
  2                     canned whole pickled jalapeÒo chiles - -- (to 3)
                        Sea salt -- to taste
     3/4           cup  Dr Pepper or Coca-Cola
     3/4           cup  orange juice
                        Zest or peel of 1/2 orange -- cut narrow 1"-long
                        strips
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE TACOS ===
                        Store-bought corn or flour tortillas -- warmed
                        Guacamole -- (see recipe)
                        One or more salsas of choice

Trim off much of the excess fat from the outside of the meat but leave the thin inner strips.  Cut into irregular chunks approximately 1 1/2 inches square.

Place the meat in a wide, heavy pot, such as a Dutch oven or cast-iron skillet, with a lid.  Cover with water by 1/2 inch -- no more.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and skim off any foam that may rise to the surface.  Add the onions, garlic, oregano, chiles, and salt to taste.

When the water begins to boil again, lower the heat and simmer, partially covered, about 1 hour, until the meat is almost tender.  A bit more water might be needed if the pork is still tough.  Stir occasionally.  If there is liquid remaining in the pan when the meat is ready, turn up the heat and boil until it is all evaporated, but watch the meat so that it doesn't scorch.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Remove the chiles from the pot.  Add the soda pop, orange juice, zest, pepper, and any needed additional salt, and mix well with the pork.  If the meat is not in a single layer, it should be put into a flatter pan so that it can brown evenly.  Bake, uncovered, about 30 to 40 minutes, until the meat is crispy and glazed with the syrup.  The meat will have to be stirred often because the sugar in the soda and orange juice will burn easily.

Drain off any accumulated melted fat and put the carnitas in a serving dish.  Scoop the carnitas up with the tortillas, add some chunky guacamole, and fold into the tacos with lots of salsa.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

         Vegetable Spring Rolls With Baked Tofu And Dipping Sauce

Recipe By     :Lorna Sass
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Spring/Summer Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  bean thread noodles -- cooked according
                        to package directions and well drained
  1 1/2           cups  shredded napa or Chinese cabbage
                        = (rinse leaves and spin dry before
                        shredding)
     1/2           cup  grated carrot
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced scallion greens
  12                    round rice papers - (8" dia)
  4             ounces  tofu -- cut 1/2" cubes
  20             large  fresh basil leaves - (to 24) -- rinsed, spun dry
                        Peanut Miso Dressing And Dipping Sauce -- (see recipe)

Gently squeeze the cooked bean thread noodles to release excess moisture.  Chop them coarsely.  In a large bowl, toss together the noodles, cabbage, carrot, and scallion greens.

Fill a 10-inch pie plate with warm water.  Submerge one of the rice papers in the water and soak just until pliable, 30 to 60 seconds.  Transfer to a clean kitchen towel and blot gently to dry.  Arrange about 1/4 cup of the noodle mixture along the bottom third of the rice paper.  Distribute 5 to 6 tofu cubes and 2 basil leaves on the noodles.  Lift the bottom edge over the filling, fold the sides toward the center, and roll up as tightly as possible.  Set on a plate, seam-side down.  Repeat with the remaining rice papers.

Serve the spring rolls immediately.  Alternatively, refrigerate in a tightly sealed container for up to 2 days.  (Return to room temperature before serving.)  Divide the dipping sauce among several small bowls and serve alongside.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 spring rolls.

Gently squeeze the cooked bean thread noodles to release excess moisture.  Chop them coarsely.  In a large bowl, toss together the noodles, cabbage, carrot, and scallion greens.

<DirT>
Fill a 10-inch pie plate with warm water.  Submerge one of the rice papers in the water and soak just until pliable, 30 to 60 seconds.  Transfer to a clean kitchen towel and blot gently to dry.  Arrange about 1/4 cup of the noodle mixture along the bottom third of the rice paper.  Distribute 5 to 6 tofu cubes and 2 basil leaves on the noodles.  Lift the bottom edge over the filling, fold the sides toward the center, and roll up as tightly as possible.  Set on a plate, seam-side down.  Repeat with the remaining rice papers.

Serve the spring rolls immediately.  Alternatively, refrigerate in a tightly sealed container for up to 2 days.  (Return to room temperature before serving.)  Divide the dipping sauce among several small bowls and serve alongside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 to 12 spring rolls.

Recipe By     :Joanne Weir
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4           cups  dried black beans
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     yellow onions -- chopped
  2                     fresh serrano or jalapeÒo chile peppers -- seeded, minced
  5              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  6        tablespoons  chili powder
  3        tablespoons  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  2               cans  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  coarsely-grated Monterey Jack cheese - -- (4 oz)

Pick over the beans and discard any damaged beans or impurities.  Rinse the beans.  Place in a bowl and add water to cover generously.  Let soak for about 3 hours.  Drain the beans and set aside.

In a large, heavy saucepan over low heat, warm the olive oil.  Add the onions and chili peppers and sautÈ, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft, about 10 minutes.  Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, cayenne, and oregano and sautÈ, stirring, for 2 minutes longer.  Add the beans, tomatoes, and water to cover by 3 inches.

Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until the beans are very tender and have begun to fall apart, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  Add water if the beans begin to dry out but are not yet cooked.

Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Ladle into warmed bowls, sprinkle with the cheese, fresh cilantro, and sour cream.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                         Veggie Vitality Cocktail

Recipe By     :Bonnie Trust Dahan
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     kale leaves - (to 4)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  4                     carrots -- scrubbed, but
                        not peeled
  1                     apple -- seeded, but
                        not peeled

Put the kale, parsley, carrots, and apple through a juicer.  Stir well until the cocktail has a uniform consistency.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Comments:  Juicing concentrates the vitamins and minerals found in fruits and vegetables so that immediately after drinking them you often can experience a beneficial boost to your system.  This particular combination is designed to allay stress and fatigue.  It provides magnesium, potassium, and calcium -- all rich nutrients that nourish the body.  Chlorophyll, which is also plentiful in green leafy vegetables, has a rejuvinatinq effect.  Nourishing to the intestines, it helps filter toxins from the liver.  Carrots are rich in vitamin A, which supports the immune system and promotes skin health.  The apple adds a sweet taste and contains pectin, another cleansing and purifying agent.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VANILLA SYRUP ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  honey
  2                     cinnamon sticks - (3" ea)
                        = (or 1/2 tspn ground cinnamon)
  1                     vanilla bean -- split
                        = (or 1 tspn vanilla extract)
                        === WALNUT CAKE ===
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  6                     eggs -- separated
  2               cups  ground walnuts
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest

For the Vanilla Syrup, combine the sugar, water, and honey in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boll over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Add the cinnamon sticks or ground cinnamon and vanilla bean or vanilla extract, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.

For the Walnut Cake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour a 9- by 13-inch cake pan.  Sift together the flour, baking powder, ground cloves, and salt.  Set aside.

With an electric mixer, beat the butter and brown sugar in a large bowl until creamy.  Add the egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add the dry ingredients, mix well, then stir in the nuts and orange zest.

Clean the beaters carefully.  In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks fonn.  Stir one-third of the beaten whites into the batter, then gently fold in the remaining whites.  Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 40 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and springs back when touched lightly with a finger.  Remove from the oven.

Remove the cinnamon sticks and vanilla bean (if used) from the syrup and slowly pour it over the cake.  It may seem as if there is too much syrup, but it will all be absorbed by the cake in about 10 minutes.  Cut the cake into 18 squares and serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 18 servings.

Comments:  Dense, nutty, and lightly spiced with a honey-cinnamon syrup, this cake satisfies your sweet tooth without the extra calories of frosting.  Make sure you use fresh nuts.

                       White Cheddar-Bacon Crackers

Recipe By     :Jann Johnson
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Snacks

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  1                cup  grated sharp white Cheddar - (4 oz)
  2                     strips bacon -- cooked crisp,
                        drained and crumbled
  1                cup  all-purpose flour

In a medium bowl, with an electric mixer on low speed or a wooden spoon, beat the butter until light in color, about 1 minute.  Add the Cheddar and bacon.  Gradually mix in the flour until just combined.

On a sheet of waxed paper, knead the dough a few times.  Divide the dough in half.  Roll each portion into a 6-inch-long log.  Wrap the logs in waxed paper and twist the ends closed.  Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Unwrap the shortbread logs and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Place the slices 1 inch apart on an ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheet.  Bake in the center of the oven for about 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden.  Let the crackers cool on the baking sheet for about 2 minutes, then carefully transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

This recipe yields about 48 crackers.

Comments:  White Cheddar, a fine-quality sharp cheese, is so good with crisp bits of bacon.  These will disappear quickly.

Tip:  Crisply cooked diced pancetta is a wonderful alternative to bacon.

Bake in the center of the oven for about 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden.  Let the crackers cool on the baking sheet for about 2 minutes, then carefully transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

<DirT>
This recipe yields about 48 crackers.

Comments:  White Cheddar, a fine-quality sharp cheese, is so good with crisp bits of bacon.  These will disappear quickly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tip:  Crisply cooked diced pancetta is a wonderful alternative to bacon.

                      Winter Herb And Lemon Spaetzle

Recipe By     :Joanne Weir
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose (plain) flour
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh sage
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf (Italian) parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh winter savory -- (optional)
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lemon zest
  5                     eggs
     2/3           cup  milk
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted

Butter a large ceramic baking dish and set aside.

Place the flour, all the herbs, and the lemon zest in a bowl.  In another bowl, whisk together the eggs until blended.  Gradually whisk the eggs into the flour mixture.  Stir in the milk, salt, and pepper.  Let stand for 30 minutes.

Preheat an oven to 275 degrees.

Bring a large pot three-fourths full of water to a boil.  Working in batches, pour some of the batter into a large colander and, using the back of a large spoon, push strips of batter into the water.  Alternatively, force the batter through the holes of a spaetzle maker into the water.  As soon as the dumplings float to the surface, after 1 to 2 minutes, they are cooked.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to the prepared baking dish and place them in the oven to dry the excess moisture.  As each batch of dumplings is cooked add it to the baking dish, gently tossing the freshly cooked dumplings with those already in the dish.

To serve, drizzle with the melted butter and toss gently to coat.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Spaetzle are tiny dumplings that originated in Germany and Austria.  Served simply with melted butter, they are among that region's cherished comfort foods.  Most spaetzle are formed by hand, although inexpensive spaetzle makers -- typically a colanderlike tool for releasing the batter -- can be found in cookware shops.
