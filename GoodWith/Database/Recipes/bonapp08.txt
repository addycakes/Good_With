                       Almost Grandmother's Challah

Recipe By     :Arthur Wenner; La Jolla, CA
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  warm water -- plus
     2/3           cup  warm water -- (105 to 115 degrees)
  2        tablespoons  dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- plus
     3/4           cup  sugar
  5              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  7 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour - (about)
  1              large  egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  water

Combine 1/2 cup warm water, yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in large glass measuring cup and stir until yeast dissolves.  Let yeast mixture stand at room temperature until foamy, about 10 minutes.

In large bowl of heavy-duty mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat 5 eggs until blended.  Add oil, salt and 3/4 cup sugar and beat until pale yellow and slightly thickened, about 4 minutes.  Beat in 2/3 cup warm water.  Add yeast mixture and beat until blended.

Remove whisk and fit mixer with dough hook.  Add enough flour 1 cup at a time to form smooth dough, beating well after each addition.  Beat on medium speed until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, adding flour by tablespoonfuls if sticky.  Turn out onto floured surface and knead 2 minutes.

Lightly oil large bowl.  Add dough, turning to coat with oil.  Cover with plastic wrap, then with clean kitchen towel.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough.  Cover with plastic and clean kitchen towel and let rise 30 minutes.

Grease 2 large baking sheets.  Turn out dough onto lightly floured surface.  Divide dough into 2 equal portions.  Divide each portion into 3 equal pieces.  Roll each piece into 9-inch-long rope.  Braid 3 ropes together; pinch ends together to seal.  Repeat with remaining dough pieces, forming 2 braids.  Place each braid on baking sheet.  Cover with towel.  Let rise in warm area until almost doubled, about 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Whisk yolk with 1 tablespoon water to blend.  Brush dough with egg mixture.  Bake 10 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Bake until bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on bottom, about 35 minutes.  Transfer loaves to rack and cool completely.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Wrap tightly in plastic and store at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 2 loaves.

Comments:  To make this bread easier to prepare, shape the dough into two loaves after the second rising instead of forming braided loaves, as is traditional.  Place each loaf in a buttered 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan and continue as per recipe.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  water
  2                     extra-large beef bouillon cubes -- (1/2 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2 1/4         pounds  trimmed boneless beef chuck -- cut 1 1/2" cubes

  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (14 1/2 oz)
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped fresh lemongrass
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
  2                     bay leaves
  2              large  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  2              small  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  8             ounces  button mushrooms -- trimmed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh parsley

Bring 4 cups water to boil in large saucepan.  Add bouillon and stir to dissolve; set aside.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large pot over high heat.  Working in batches, add beef and sautÃˆ until brown, about 6 minutes per batch.  Using slotted spoon, transfer beef to bowl.

Add 1 tablespoon oil, onions and garlic to same pot; sautÃˆ until onions are tender, about 5 minutes.  Add bouillon mixture, tomatoes with juices, lemongrass, curry powder and bay leaves.  Return beef and any accumulated juices to pot.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until beef is almost tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.

Add carrots, potatoes and mushrooms to stew and simmer until vegetables are just tender, about 20 minutes.  Uncover and simmer until potatoes are very tender and stew is slightly thickened (potato pieces will thicken liquid), about 10 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer to serving bowl.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  frozen unsweetened raspberries - (12 oz) -- thawed
  12            ounces  cream cheese -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  2               cups  chilled whipping cream
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  40                    Champagne biscuits from two 3.5-oz pkgs
                        = (crisp ladyfinger-style cookies)
                        Fresh raspberries
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- (optional)

Puree thawed raspberries in processor until smooth.  Strain into medium bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible.  Discard seeds in strainer.

Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl until smooth.  Beat chilled whipping cream in another large bowl until peaks form.  Gently fold whipped cream into cream cheese mixture.  Add pureed raspberries and fold just until combined.

Bring remaining 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water and lemon juice to boil in small saucepan, stirring frequently.  Cool slightly.

Dip 1 biscuit briefly into lemon syrup, turning to coat.  Place flat-side up in bottom of 12-cup trifle dish.  Repeat with enough biscuits to cover bottom of trifle dish, trimming biscuits to fit if necessary.  Spread 1/3 of raspberry-cream cheese mixture over biscuits in trifle dish.

Dip more biscuits into lemon syrup and arrange atop raspberry-cream cheese mixture in dish, covering completely and trimming to fit if necessary.  Repeat layering with more raspberry-cream cheese mixture, then biscuits; top with remaining raspberry-cream cheese mixture.

Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.  Garnish with fresh raspberries and with fresh mint sprigs, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Raspberries replace the coffee flavor in a refreshing and fruity take on tiramisË˜.  This simple recipe can be prepared a day ahead.

                        = (such as Baker's German's Sweet
                        Chocolate)
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

  1                cup  semisweet chocolate chips
     1/4           cup  chopped walnuts

Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts.

Spread half of chocolate batter (about 1 1/4 cups) in prepared pan.  Using rubber spatula, spread cream cheese mixture over chocolate batter.  Spoon remaining chocolate batter over top of cream cheese mixture.  Using tip of knife, gently swirl through batter, forming marble design.  Bake brownies until tester inserted into center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 30 minutes.  Cool brownies in pan on rack.  Cut into squares.

                 Cheese Blintzes With Caramelized Apples

Recipe By     :Arlen Grad; San Francisco, CA
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  water
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- plus
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2       packages  hoop cheese - (7.5 oz pkg) -- abt 1 1/2 cups
                        = (or 1 lb large-curd cottage cheese)
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  3        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        Caramelized Apples -- (see recipe)

Place 3/4 cup water, 2 eggs, vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon salt in blender.  Add flour and blend thoroughly until smooth.  Let batter stand 1 hour.

Place hoop cheese in processor.  If using cottage cheese, place in center of kitchen towel and squeeze to remove excess moisture until cheese is very dry and measures 1 1/2 cups packed; transfer to processor.  Add 1 egg, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon salt.  Using on/off turns, blend until mixture is almost smooth.  Transfer filling to bowl.  Cover and refrigerate.

Heat heavy small skillet with 6-inch-diameter bottom over medium-high heat.  Brush lightly with some melted butter.  Pour 2 1/2 tablespoons batter into skillet, tilting to spread evenly.  Cook until crepe is lightly browned on bottom, about 30 seconds.  Turn crepe out onto paper towel and cover with another paper towel.  Repeat with remaining batter, brushing skillet with more melted butter as needed.

Place 1 crepe on work surface.  Place 3 tablespoons filling just below center of cooked side of crepe.  Fold bottom over filling, then fold sides in; roll to enclose filling.  Transfer to foil-lined plate.  Repeat with remaining filling and 7 more crepes (reserve remaining crepes for another use).

Heat 2 tablespoons oil and any remaining melted butter in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat until hot.  Place blintzes, seam-side down, in skillet.  Cook until bottoms are brown and crisp, shaking pan occasionally, about 6 minutes.  Turn blintzes over; cook until bottoms are brown and crisp, about 5 minutes.  Transfer 2 blintzes to each of 4 plates.  Top with Caramelized Apples and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Hoop cheese is available at Jewish delicatessens and in the refrigerated deli section of some supermarkets.

                Chocolate Alphabet Cookies - {Quaresimali}

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     egg whites
  1              pinch  salt
     1/4           cup  superfine sugar
     1/4           cup  powdered sugar
  6        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2        tablespoons  flour

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, beat egg whites and salt until foamy.  Add superfine sugar slowly, beating until stiff, but not dry, peaks are formed.  Sift powdered sugar and cocoa over beaten eggs and use a spatula to combine ingredients well.  Don't worry about deflating the mixture.  Sift flour over the mixture, again using a spatula to combine ingredients.

Transfer mixture to a pastry bag equipped with a number 10 tip.  (You may substitute a large plastic sandwich bag and snip a 1/4-inch diameter hole off of its corner.)  Pipe 2-inch letters of the alphabet onto parchment paper or, preferably, a nonstick baking mat.  You can put them close together, because they won't spread.  Bake for 12 minutes.  If you use parchment paper, then remove the cookies from the paper the moment they come out of the oven.  In any case, remove them with a spatula while still warm.

This recipe yields about 24 cookies.

Comments:  These cookies are a tradition during Lent (Quaresima) in Florence, Italy.  They are easy, low in fat, and fun to make with children.  If you are not a strict observer of Lent, you might use the egg yolks left over from this recipe to make schiacciata alla fiorentina, a festive flat bread popular with Florentines in the earlier season of Carnevale.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick)
  6              large  eggs -- separated

Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Candies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  12            ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier -- plus
  2          teaspoons  Grand Marnier
                        = (or other orange liqueur or orange
                        juice)
  4          teaspoons  grated orange peel
                        Unsweetened cocoa powder
                        = (preferably Dutch-process cocoa)

Bring cream to simmer in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add chocolate and stir just until melted and smooth.  Add butter and stir until melted.  Remove from heat.  Stir in Grand Marnier and orange peel.  Pour mixture into 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Refrigerate until mixture is firm enough to shape, about 1 hour 30 minutes.

Line baking sheet with foil.  Using scant 2 tablespoonfuls for each truffle, spoon 16 mounds of chocolate mixture onto prepared sheet.  Using 2 serving teaspoons to form eggs and holding 1 teaspoon in 1 hand and second teaspoon in other hand, scoop 1 mound of chocolate from the first spoon to the second.  Scoop chocolate from 1 spoon to the other several times, running spoon over surface of mounded chocolate to smooth oval as much as possible.

Using palms of hands, roll chocolate mound into egg shape, smoothing surface as much as possible (surface will not be completely smooth).  Place on plate.  Repeat with remaining chocolate mounds.  Refrigerate chocolate eggs until firm, about 45 minutes.

Working in batches and using table knife or fingers, smooth surface of chocolate eggs again, if necessary.  Chill until firm, about 15 minutes.  Sift cocoa powder over chocolate eggs, covering completely.  Cover and refrigerate.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

This recipe yields about 16.

Comments:  For convenience, these can be made up to three days ahead.

  1           teaspoon  cumin seeds or fennel seeds -- finely crushed or
                        ground in spice grinder
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray

Mix cheese and cumin in medium bowl.  Spray medium nonstick skillet with nonstick spray; heat over medium heat.  Sprinkle 3 tablespoons cheese mixture in 4-inch round lace-like pattern over bottom of skillet.  Cook until cheese is melted, bubbling and golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Remove skillet from heat.

Using thin metal spatula, carefully and gradually loosen edges of cheese crisp; gently transfer to paper towels to cool.  Repeat with remaining cheese mixture, cooking 1 cheese crisp at a time and spraying skillet with nonstick spray before each crisp is cooked.  Cool.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.)  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 8 crisps.

Comments:  Italians call these irresistible treats frico, or "little trifles."  Served on their own, they make nice cocktail snacks.

                            Double-Salmon Dip

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     containers whipped cream cheese - (8 oz ea
  3        tablespoons  whole milk
  4             ounces  thinly-sliced smoked salmon -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                jar  red salmon caviar - (2 oz)

Using rubber spatula, mash whipped cream cheese and milk in medium bowl to blend.  Fold in salmon and 1 tablespoon chives.  Season with pepper to taste.  Gently fold in caviar.  Cover and refrigerate 2 hours to blend flavors.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

Sprinkle dip with remaining 1 tablespoon chives.  Serve dip chilled.

This recipe yields about 3 cups.

Comments:  Be sure to use the whipped cream cheese sold in tubs-it will give this dip a smooth, light texture-and not the regular cream cheese in blocks.  If the dip seems a little salty, just serve it with unsalted chips.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  2              large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  1 1/2           cups  dried cranberries - (abt 6 oz)
  1                     egg white
  6             ounces  good-quality white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt or Baker's, or use white
                        chocolate chips)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line heavy large baking sheet with parchment paper.

Combine 2 1/2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt in medium bowl; whisk to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar, butter, 2 eggs and almond extract in large bowl until well blended.  Mix in flour mixture, then dried cranberries.  Divide dough in half.

Using floured hands, shape each piece into 2 1/2-inch-wide, 9 1/2-inch-long, 1-inch-high log.  Transfer both logs to prepared baking sheet, spacing evenly.  Whisk egg white in small bowl until foamy; brush egg white glaze on top and sides of each log.

Bake logs until golden brown (logs will spread), about 35 minutes.  Cool completely on sheet on rack.  Maintain oven temperature.  Transfer logs to work surface.  Discard parchment.  Using serrated knife, cut logs on diagonal into 1/2-inch-wide slices.  Arrange slices, cut-side down, on same sheet.  Bake 10 minutes; turn biscotti over.  Bake until just beginning to color, about 5 minutes.  Transfer biscotti to rack.

Stir chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water until smooth.  Remove from over water.  Using fork, drizzle chocolate over biscotti.  Let stand until chocolate sets, about 30 minutes.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Freeze in airtight container.  Thaw at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 28.

         Florentine Carnival Cake - {Schiacciata Alla Fiorentina}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1             packet  active dry yeast
                        = (or 2 tspns rapid-rise yeast)
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  eggs -- at room temperature
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
                        Grated zest of one orange
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  2                     egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  powdered sugar - (to 4 tbspns) -- for garnish

Lightly brush sides and bottom of an 11- by 7- by 1 1/2-inch baking pan with olive oil.

Dissolve the yeast in water and follow directions on the package regarding how long to let it sit.  Using a mixer at medium speed (or processor with dough blade), blend into the yeast mixture the following (in order): the flour, half of the sugar (1/4 cup plus two tablespoons), the salt, 1/4 cup olive oil, the two whole eggs.  Blend at medium speed until smooth and well combined.

Add the remaining 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the orange zest, and cinnamon, blending until oil is incorporated into dough.  This mixture will be sticky and unkneadable.  Scrape the dough into a very lightly oiled bowl.  Wrap the bowl in plastic wrap or a large towel and put it in a warm place (75 to 80 degrees, no drafts) for 1 1/2 hours to allow dough to rise.

Using mixer (or processor with dough blade), again at medium speed, into the risen dough blend egg yolks and the remaining granulated sugar until fully incorporated.  It should form a smooth, yet loose ball.  Scrape mixture into the oiled baking pan.  With your knuckles, even the dough to a uniform thickness, cover with a towel (preferable to plastic wrap, because the dough may expand over the pan edge), and place it in that warm place again until it rises to the edge of the pan, approximately 8 hours.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake dough until golden, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove from oven, run a knife around the edge of the pan.  Let it cool for 10 minutes.  Then, with a decisive motion, slam the pan on a counter to dislodge cake.

Cover the cake with a heavy dusting of powdered sugar.  For decoration, you may cut out a stencil (click here for a sample) of a Florentine lily and lay it on the cake before its sugar coating for a traditional and very handsome design.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2               cups  whole milk
  6                     egg yolks
     1/3           cup  sugar - (to 1/2 cup)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  egg yolks
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  grated orange peel
  2 3/4           cups  chilled whipping cream
     1/3           cup  dried Calimyrna figs -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  dried cranberries -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  minced crystallized ginger
                        Blackberry Sauce -- (see recipe)

Line 9- by 5- by 3-inch metal loaf pan with plastic wrap, extending over sides by 3 inches.

Whisk egg yolks, sugar and white wine in medium metal bowl to blend.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water; whisk egg mixture constantly until candy thermometer registers 160 degrees, about 5 minutes.  Remove from over water.  Using electric mixer, beat until cool and thick, about 5 minutes.  Beat in orange peel.

Beat chilled whipping cream in large bowl until peaks form.  Add egg mixture and gently fold together.  Fold in chopped figs, chopped cranberries, and minced ginger.  Transfer mixture to prepared pan.  Cover with plastic wrap overhang; freeze overnight.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Keep frozen.)

Turn semifreddo out onto platter.  Peel off plastic wrap.  Let stand 5 minutes to soften slightly.  Slice semifreddo.  Place 1 slice of semifreddo on each plate.  Drizzle Blackberry Sauce over each slice and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  This is like a frozen mousse, which helps explain its name: semifreddo, or "half-frozen."  Start preparation a day ahead.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RAVIOLI ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3              large  shallots -- minced
  8             ounces  arugula -- chopped - (8 cups)
  6             ounces  soft fresh goat cheese, such as Montrachet -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - (1 1/2 oz
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  42                    wonton wrappers - (from one 12-oz pkg)
  2              large  egg whites -- whisked just
                        until foamy
                        === TOMATO-PANCETTA BUTTER ===
  6             ounces  thinly-sliced pancetta or bacon -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
  6              large  plum tomatoes -- quartered, seeds
                        and membranes discarded, tomatoes diced
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR SERVING ===
  5        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  12                    fresh basil leaves
                        Fresh thyme sprigs

Make Ravioli:  Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add shallots; sautÃˆ 10 minutes.  Add arugula; toss until wilted but still bright green, about 3 minutes.  Transfer arugula mixture to large bowl and cool.  Mix in goat cheese and Parmesan cheese.  Season filling with salt and pepper.

Line 2 baking sheets with heavy-duty foil; spray foil with nonstick spray.  Place 4 wonton wrappers on work surface; cover remaining wrappers with plastic to prevent drying.  Lightly brush entire surface of each wrapper with egg white.  Spoon 1 generous teaspoon filling into center of each wrapper.  Fold wrappers diagonally in half, forming triangles.  Press edges firmly to seal.  Arrange ravioli on prepared sheets.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.  (Can be made ahead.  Cover with plastic and chill up to 1 day; or cover with plastic, then heavy-duty foil, and freeze up to 1 week.  If frozen, do not thaw before cooking.)

Make Tomato-Pancetta Butter:  Cook chopped pancetta in large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp and brown.  Using slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to paper towel; drain.  Set aside.  Pour off all but 1 tablespoon drippings from skillet.  Add butter to drippings in skillet; melt over medium-high heat.  Add tomatoes and thyme; sautÃˆ until tomatoes are tender, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Cook and serve ravioli:  Place melted butter in large bowl.  Cook half of ravioli in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 4 minutes for fresh or 5 minutes for frozen.  Using large strainer, transfer ravioli to colander and drain; place in bowl with butter and toss to coat.  Cover to keep warm.  Cook remaining ravioli in same pot of boiling water.  Drain and add to bowl of buttered ravioli.  Toss gently to coat.

Divide ravioli among bowls.  Rewarm tomato butter over medium heat.  Add reserved pancetta and basil; sautÃˆ 1 minute.  Spoon sauce over ravioli; garnish with thyme.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a great entrÃˆe for entertaining or for a special weeknight dinner for your family.  Either way, no one except you will know how easy it is to make.  And your secret is safe with us.  Pancetta, Italian bacon cured in salt, is available at Italian markets and in the deli case at many supermarkets.

Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onions - (abt 2 med)
     1/3           cup  raisins
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground coffee
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
  1                cup  long-grain white rice
  2               cups  water
                        Salt -- to taste
  18                    grape leaves from jar - (about) -- rinsed, drained,
                        tough stems trimmed, see * Note
                        Plain yogurt
                        Lemon wedges

* Note:  Available at Greek, Middle Eastern and most Italian markets.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly oil 11- by 7-inch glass baking dish.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onions and saute until golden brown, about 8 minutes.  Mix in raisins, ground coffee, oregano, pepper and cumin.  Add rice and 1 cup water; stir to blend.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer until rice is partially cooked and no liquid remains, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes.  Season to taste with salt.

Pour 1 cup water over rolled grape leaves.  Cover with foil; bake until rice is tender, about 40 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Cover; refrigerate.)  Serve warm or cold with yogurt and lemon wedges.

This recipe yields about 18.

                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh chives
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh tarragon
     3/4           cup  olive oil
     3/4           cup  chopped shallots
  2                     Cornish game hens -- each quartered
  2              heads  radicchio -- each cut into 6
                        wedges
     1/2           cup  balsamic vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  beef stock or canned beef broth
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  1           teaspoon  white truffle oil -- see * Note

* Note:  Available at Italian markets, specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.

Mix herbs, 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup shallots in bowl.  Place hens in large resealable bag.  Add herb oil and seal; shake well.  Chill overnight.

Place radicchio on large rimmed baking sheet.  Whisk balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup olive oil in small bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  Pour all but 1/4 cup marinade over radicchio, turning to coat.  Let stand 3 hours.

Boil stock, 1/4 cup shallots and reserved 1/4 cup marinade in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 6 minutes.  Add lemon peel.  Cool.  Add truffle oil.  Season lemon vinaigrette with pepper.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Place hen pieces on another rimmed baking sheet.  Bake until brown and cooked through, about 45 minutes.

Heat large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add radicchio with marinade; sautÃˆ until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side.  Serve hens and radicchio with vinaigrette.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  At the Fifth Floor, this is prepared with quail.  Game hens make an easy-to-find substitute.

  4                     lamb blade shoulder chops -- (8 to 10 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  small elbow macaroni - (2 cups)
  1 1/2           cups  grated GruyÃ‹re cheese - (packed) -- abt 6 oz
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1                cup  whole milk
  3             ounces  thinly-sliced prosciutto -- coarsely chopped
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground balck pepper -- to taste

Position rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 400 degrees.  Butter 11- by 7-inch glass baking dish.  Cook macaroni in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite.  Drain well.

Whisk 1/2 cup GruyÃ‹re, cream, milk, prosciutto, Parmesan and nutmeg in large bowl to blend.  Add macaroni and toss to coat.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to prepared baking dish.  Sprinkle remaining 1 cup GruyÃ‹re over.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "Every time I visit my sister in Los Angeles, we make a point of having dinner at Mimosa, a popular French bistro," writes Frances Candler Brown of Birmingham, Alabama.  "I like to think IÃ­m an adventurous diner, but my order there has become only too predictable: a glass of wine, a salad and the restaurantÃ­s delectable version of macaroni and cheese."

This French take on macaroni and cheese has a nice assertive flavor.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lemon -- halved
  12                    baby artichokes
                        Nonstick olive oil spray
  2              large  fennel bulbs -- trimmed, each
                        cut lengthwise into 8 wedges
  6                     slender leeks, white and pale green parts -- root ends trimmed,
                        and each leek cut lengthwise in half
  18                    thick asparagus spears -- tough ends trimmed
  12                    slender small carrots -- peeled
                        Olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Salsa Verde -- (see recipe)

Squeeze juice from lemon halves into large bowl; add lemon halves.  Fill bowl with water.  Trim stem of 1 artichoke.  Starting at base, bend leaves back and snap off where leaves break naturally, continuing until all tough outer leaves have been removed.  Using small sharp knife, trim outside of base until smooth and no dark green areas remain.  Cut artichoke lengthwise in half.  Using tip of knife, remove any purple-tipped leaves from center.  Add artichoke to lemon water.  Repeat with remaining artichokes.

Bring large pot of salted water to boil.  Drain artichokes.  Add to boiling water; cook until just tender, about 8 minutes.  Drain; set aside.  (Can be made 1 day ahead; cover and chill.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Spray 3 large rimmed baking sheets with nonstick spray.  Arrange artichoke halves, fennel and leeks in single layer on 2 prepared sheets.  Arrange asparagus and carrots in single layer on third sheet.  Brush vegetables with olive oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast vegetables until tender, turning over halfway through, about 35 minutes total for artichokes, fennel and leeks and 20 minutes total for asparagus and carrots.

Divide vegetables among 6 plates.  Drizzle Salsa Verde over and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  heavy cream -- minus 2 tbspns
                        to dissolve the gelatin
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  gelatin - (1/2 packet)
  4        tablespoons  fruit pureÃˆ - (to 8 tbspns)
                        = (or sweetened fruit or chocolate sauce)

Heat cream with sugar, simmering for 15 minutes.  Sprinkle gelatin over 2 tablespoons of cream.  Remove simmered cream from heat and add gelatin mixture, stirring to dissolve.  Pour 1/2 cup of this new mixture into four lightly-oiled metal molds and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours.

Dip mold in hot water and run a knife around the edge; unmold panna cotta onto individual serving dishes.  Serve each with 1 to 2 tablespoons sauce, either fruit puree, sweetened fruit or chocolate sauce.

Comments:  This recipe is from the Osteria Giusti in Modena.  Osteria Giusti uses saba -- grape must cooked for 12 hours until thick -- not worth attempting without a source of wine-grape must.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  milk
  1                cup  water
     3/4           cup  yellow cornmeal
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  1                can  whole green chilies - (7 oz) -- drained
  1                cup  drained canned corn
     2/3           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  2               cups  grated Monterey Jack cheese
     1/2           cup  whipping cream

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Butter 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Mix first 5 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly.  Cook until polenta is tender and thickens, stirring often, about 12 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Stir in Parmesan.

  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Parmesan cheese shavings

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.  Pierce eggplants all over with fork.  Transfer, cut-side down, to baking sheet.  Roast until tender, about 45 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Remove peel and discard.  Cut eggplants into large pieces.  Rinse eggplant pieces under running water.  Drain well.  Set aside.

Char bell peppers over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes.  Peel, seed and coarsely chop peppers.

Heat oil in large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onions and leek and sautÃˆ until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add garlic; sautÃˆ 1 minute.  Stir in eggplant, peppers, chicken stock, and tomato paste.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer uncovered until vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.  Stir in basil and thyme.  Cool slightly.

Working in batches, puree soup in blender until smooth.  Return soup to pot.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add butter and lemon juice; stir over low heat until soup is heated through, about 5 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Bring to simmer before continuing.)  Transfer to large bowl; garnish with Parmesan.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Eggplant adds a nutty flavor.  Open a light-bodied Valpolicella from Italy for the meal.

       Sauteed Baby Artichokes, Oven-Dried Tomatoes, Olive Dressing

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lemon
  2             pounds  baby artichokes - (abt 18)
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground balck pepper -- to taste
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  dried herbes de Provence -- see * Note
     1/2           cup  canned vegetable broth
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  8             ounces  fresh crimini mushrooms -- quartered
                        Oven-Dried Tomatoes -- (see recipe)
                        Green-Olive Dressing -- (see recipe)
                        Lemon slices -- for garnish

* Note:  A dried herb mixture sold at specialty foods stores and in the spice section of some supermarkets.  A mix of dried thyme, basil, savory, and fennel seeds can be substituted.

Fill large bowl with cold water.  Cut lemon in half; squeeze juice into water in bowl, then add lemon halves.  Cut off stem and top quarter from 1 artichoke.  Bend back dark green outer leaves and snap off at artichoke base until only pale green and yellow leaves remain.  Cut artichoke lengthwise in half.  Using point of knife, remove any purple-tipped leaves from center of artichoke.  Place artichoke halves in lemon water.  Repeat with remaining artichokes.

Drain artichokes well.  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add artichokes, sprinkle with salt and pepper and sautÃˆ 3 minutes.  Add garlic and herbes de Provence and sautÃˆ until artichokes begin to brown slightly, about 6 minutes.  Add broth and wine and bring to boil.  Reduce heat; cover and simmer until artichokes are tender and most liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.  Uncover and simmer until all liquid is absorbed, about 3 minutes.  Transfer artichokes to platter; cover and keep warm.

Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in same pot over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms and sautÃˆ until tender and golden brown, about 8 minutes; season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer mushrooms and Oven-Dried Tomatoes to platter with artichokes.  Spoon Green-Olive Dressing over.  Garnish with lemon slices and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Unlike their big brothers, baby artichokes are almost completely edible and require minimal preparation.  For this first course, sautÃˆing the artichokes instead of steaming adds good flavor.  Some people donÃ­t like to have artichokes with wine because they can make the wine taste either metallic or strangely sweet.  In Italy, though, artichokes and wine are usually served together.  A crisp, steely Pinot Grigio does the trick.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4                     firm medium Bartlett pears -- cored, peeled,
                        and quartered - (abt 25 oz total)
  1                     pork tenderloin - (16 oz) -- sliced into
                        twelve 1/2"-thick medallions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground balck pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  canned low-salt chicken broth
     2/3           cup  tawny Port
  2 1/2      teaspoons  whole grain Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add pears and sautÃˆ until lightly browned, about 4 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer pears to plate (do not clean skillet).

Sprinkle pork medallions with salt and pepper.  Coat pork medallions with flour; shake off excess.  Add to same skillet and cook over medium-high heat until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.  Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to plate with pears.

Add broth, Port and both mustards to skillet.  Boil until reduced by half, about 4 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium.  Return pork, pears and any juices to skillet and simmer until pork is just cooked through and sauce is reduced to glaze, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Combining smooth and grainy Dijon mustards results in a sauce that has both depth of flavor and satisfying texture.

Recipe By     :Grace Gordon; Orinda, CA
Serving Size  : 18    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  old-fashioned oats
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled solid vegetable shortening -- cut into pieces
     1/4           cup  buttermilk

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Butter 2 heavy large baking sheets.  Place oats in large bowl.  Sift flour, sugar, baking soda and salt into same bowl.  Using fingertips, rub in shortening until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add buttermilk; stir until dough forms.

Transfer dough to floured surface.  Roll out dough to 1/4-inch thickness.  Using 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out rounds.  Arrange on prepared sheets, spacing apart.  Gather scraps, reroll and cut out additional rounds.

Bake oatcakes until edges are pale golden, about 12 minutes.  Transfer baking sheets to racks and cool 5 minutes.  Transfer cakes to racks; cool completely.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 18.

Comments:  These slightly sweet rounds are a cross between a cookie and a cracker.  Eat them plain or with jam for breakfast, or top them with cheese for a snack.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  small uncooked shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        and shells reserved
  1 3/4           cups  water
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  2 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced leeks, white and pale
                        green parts from about 2 large leeks
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced stemmed drained peperoncini -- (abt 4 whole)
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh oregano
  2          teaspoons  minced lemon peel
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1              pound  linguine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh parsley

Place shrimp shells in medium saucepan.  Add 1 3/4 cups water and a generous pinch of salt.  Bring to boil over medium-high heat.  Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced to 1 cup liquid, about 15 minutes.  Strain into measuring cup, pressing on shells to extract as much liquid as possible.

Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shrimp and sautÃˆ until opaque, about 2 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to medium bowl.

Reduce heat to low.  Add remaining 3 tablespoons oil to same skillet.  Add garlic and sautÃˆ until soft, about 1 minute.  Stir in leeks, peperoncini, oregano, and lemon peel.  Cover and cook until leeks are soft, about 3 minutes.  Uncover; add wine, lemon juice, and shrimp-shell liquid.  Increase heat to high and boil until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.  Add pasta and shrimp to skillet with sauce and toss to coat.  Add enough reserved cooking liquid to moisten if necessary.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer to large bowl.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR CAKE ===
  10            ounces  semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  1 1/4           cups  butter - (2 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  8              large  eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/4           cups  roasted unsalted peanuts -- coarsely chopped
  1                cup  cake flour
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
                        === FOR BUTTERCREAM ===
  5                     egg yolks
  1 1/2           cups  sugar -- plus
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  water
  10            ounces  semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  2 1/4           cups  unsalted butter - (4 1/2 sticks) -- cut into
                        tablespoon-size pieces, room temperature
  10                    Snickers bars - (1 oz ea) -- chopped small
                        pieces

Make Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease three 8-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line bottoms with waxed paper.  Melt chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water; stir until smooth. Remove from over water and cool to barely lukewarm.

Using electric mixer, cream butter in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Gradually add 1 1/4 cups sugar, beating until smooth.  Beat in egg yolks 1 at a time.  Mix in vanilla.  Stir in chocolate, then peanuts.  Sift flour over batter and gently fold in.  (Batter will be very thick.)

Using clean dry beaters, beat whites with cream of tartar in another large bowl to soft peaks.  Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until stiff but not dry.  Fold 1/2 of whites into batter to lighten.  Gently fold in remaining whites.  Divide batter among prepared pans.

Bake until tester inserted in centers comes out clean and tops are crusty, 25 to 30 minutes.  Cool in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Run small sharp knife around pan sides to loosen, if necessary.  Turn out onto racks.  Peel off paper.  Cool to room temperature.  (Cakes can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Wrap tightly and refrigerate.)

Make Buttercream:  Using electric mixer, beat yolks in bowl until pale yellow and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted, 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, stir sugar and water in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until candy thermometer set in syrup registers 234 degrees to 240 degrees (soft-ball stage).  Beat hot syrup into egg yolks in slow steady stream.  Continue beating until thick and cool, about 10 minutes.

Melt chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water; stir until smooth.  Remove from over water and let stand until cool but still liquid.  Gradually beat butter into yolk mixture 1 tablespoon at a time.  Add chocolate and stir to combine.  Transfer 2 cups buttercream to small bowl; stir in chopped Snickers bars.

Make Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease three 8-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line bottoms with waxed paper.  Melt chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water; stir until smooth. Remove from over water and cool to barely lukewarm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using electric mixer, cream butter in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Gradually add 1 1/4 cups sugar, beating until smooth.  Beat in egg yolks 1 at a time.  Mix in vanilla.  Stir in chocolate, then peanuts.  Sift flour over batter and gently fold in.  (Batter will be very thick.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using clean dry beaters, beat whites with cream of tartar in another large bowl to soft peaks.  Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until stiff but not dry.  Fold 1/2 of whites into batter to lighten.  Gently fold in remaining whites.  Divide batter among prepared pans.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake until tester inserted in centers comes out clean and tops are crusty, 25 to 30 minutes.  Cool in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Run small sharp knife around pan sides to loosen, if necessary.  Turn out onto racks.  Peel off paper.  Cool to room temperature.  (Cakes can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Wrap tightly and refrigerate.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make Buttercream:  Using electric mixer, beat yolks in bowl until pale yellow and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted, 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, stir sugar and water in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until candy thermometer set in syrup registers 234 degrees to 240 degrees (soft-ball stage).  Beat hot syrup into egg yolks in slow steady stream.  Continue beating until thick and cool, about 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water; stir until smooth.  Remove from over water and let stand until cool but still liquid.  Gradually beat butter into yolk mixture 1 tablespoon at a time.  Add chocolate and stir to combine.  Transfer 2 cups buttercream to small bowl; stir in chopped Snickers bars.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble cake:  Place one cake layer on platter top side down.  Spread half of Snickers buttercream over.  Top with second cake layer.  Spread remaining Snickers buttercream over.  Top with third cake layer.  Spoon 1 cup plain buttercream into pastry bag fitted with medium star tip.  Frost top and sides of cake with remaining buttercream.  (Can be assembled 2 days ahead.  Cover with cake dome and refrigerate.)  Bring cake to room temperature before serving.

                             Spicy Peanut Dip

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              large  shallot -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
     1/8      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  1                cup  canned low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
     1/2           cup  creamy peanut butter -- do not use
                        old-fashioned or freshly ground
  4          teaspoons  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  brown sugar - (packed)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat oil in nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add shallot, ginger and garlic; sautÃˆ until shallot is tender, about 3 minutes.  Add curry powder and crushed red pepper. Stir until aromatic, about 15 seconds.  Stir in 1 cup broth, peanut butter, lime juice, soy sauce, and brown sugar; whisk to blend.  Simmer until mixture thickens, whisking constantly, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Transfer to bowl and cool, whisking occasionally.  Cover and refrigerate 2 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)  Thin dip with more broth by tablespoonfuls if needed.  Serve dip chilled or at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 1 1/3 cups.

Comments:  Similar to the peanut sauce that accompanies an Indonesian satay, this would be nice with chips or cruditÃˆs.

                  Toasted Barley And Asparagus "Risotto"

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 3/4" pieces
  2               cups  pearl barley
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  finely chopped onion
  3              large  garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  8 1/2           cups  canned vegetable broth - (about)
  2               cups  drained canned diced tomatoes in juice
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2           cup  chopped arugula
                        =  (or 3 tbspns chopped fresh parsley)
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cook asparagus in pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain.  Transfer to bowl of ice water and cool.  Drain.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Stir barley in heavy large saucepan over medium heat until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes.  Transfer barley to bowl.

Melt butter in same saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and garlic; sautÃˆ until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add barley and stir to coat.  Add 2 cups broth; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until liquid is absorbed, stirring frequently, about 7 minutes.

Mix in 2 1/2 cups broth and simmer until absorbed, stirring frequently.  Add 3 cups broth and simmer until barley is tender and creamy but still slightly firm to bite, stirring frequently and adding more broth if mixture is dry, about 45 minutes.

Add tomatoes and asparagus; stir until heated through, about 3 minutes.  Mix in cheese, arugula and lemon peel.  Season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Risotto, by definition, is made with rice.  But other grains -- like the barley in this main-course recipe -- can be prepared in the same style with equally terrific results.  Toasting the barley enhances its nutty flavor and keeps it from getting soft and mushy.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  superfine sugar - (to 1 1/2 cups)
  3              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  lemon or orange zest
     3/4           cup  whole milk
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2 1/2           cups  cake flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Oil and flour a ten-inch springform pan.  Over the bottom piece of the pan, clamp a circle of parchment paper, which makes removing the cake easier.

With an electric hand mixer, beat the eggs, sugar, and zest until pale yellow and thick, about 5 minutes.  Mix in the milk and oil.  Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt together and then fold the dry mixture into the liquid until thoroughly combined.

Pour batter into the pan and bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until the top is golden brown and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  Remove cake from oven, allow it to cool for 10 minutes, run a knife around the edge of the pan and remove the ring of the springmold.  Cool completely and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Vary this yellow cake according to your mood and whatÃ­s available.  For instance, add sliced and lightly sugared fruit on the top of the unbaked batter, or top it with crushed nuts before baking, or split the baked and cooled cake to spread it with a layer of preserves, then dust it with powdered sugar.

Serving Size  : 30    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  sugar
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- room temperature
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  white baking chips

Line large baking sheet with double thickness of foil.  Sift flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in large bowl to blend.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time, then vanilla.  Beat in flour mixture.  Stir in semisweet and white chips.

Drop dough by heaping tablespoonfuls onto prepared sheet in two 10- to 11-inch-long strips, spacing 3 inches apart.  Using metal spatula or wet fingertips, shape strips into 11- by 2 1/2-inch logs.  Refrigerate 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake logs until tops are cracked and dry and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes; cool 10 minutes.

Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees.  Using foil as aid, lift logs onto work surface.  Line baking sheets with clean foil.  Using serrated knife, gently cut warm logs crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick slices.

Arrange half of slices, cut-side down, on each prepared baking sheet.  Bake biscotti until just dry to touch, about 8 minutes.  Turn biscotti over.  Bake until top is dry to touch, about 8 minutes.  Cool on sheets.

This recipe yields about 30.

                   Tuscan Vegetable Soup - {Acquacotta}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  red onion or 1 leek -- roughly chopped
  1 1/2                 celery stalks -- roughly chopped
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  Swiss chard -- clean, torn in half
                        = (or 1/2 oz porcini mushrooms, soaked
                        and drained)
                        Half of a peperoncino or any
                        hot red pepper, fresh or dried
     1/2           cup  tomato pulp -- seeded, juiced,
                        and chopped if fresh or drained
                        and diced if canned
  3               cups  simmering water
                        Sea salt -- to taste
  2                     eggs (preferably organic)
  2             slices  rustic country-style bread -- lightly toasted
  1           teaspoon  chopped parsley
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or
                        Tuscan pecorino cheese

Place the toasted bread in two soup bowls.

Place the onion and celery in a 3-quart, heavy-bottomed, nonreactive pot.  Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and stir to coat.  Cook over a medium-low heat, or until the onion is translucent but not brown.  Add Swiss chard (or porcinis, if using) and stir briefly to wilt.  Add hot pepper, tomatoes, and simmering water.  Season lightly with salt and cook over a low heat (barely a simmer) for 20 minutes, until vegetables are very soft.

As vegetables are cooking, bring about an inch of water and a half teaspoon of salt to a boil in a deep skillet.  At the end of the vegetables' cooking time, turn the skillet heat down to a gentle simmer.  Add the parsley to the soup.

Break the eggs into a small bowl, one at a time, and slide them into the simmering water.  Cook for about 3 minutes, until the whites are set, but the yellow is still runny.  When done, use a large slotted spoon to place one egg on each toast slice in bowls.  Ladle broth and vegetables over each egg and top with a generous sprinkling of the cheese.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

                        thinly sliced into rounds

For Ice Cream:  Bring cream and half-and-half to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Add peanuts.  Cover; remove from heat.  Let stand 30 minutes.  Strain cream mixture through sieve set over large bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible.  Whisk in sugar and yolks.  Return to saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until custard thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 4 minutes (do not boil).  Strain into medium bowl.  Chill uncovered until cold.

Transfer custard to ice cream maker and process according to manufacturerÃ­s instructions.  Transfer ice cream to container.  Mix in brittle.  Cover and freeze until firm.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Keep frozen.)

For Tartlets:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Using electric mixer, beat 2/3 cup sugar and butter in medium bowl until well blended.  Beat in yolks.  Mix in flour, then nuts.  Set peanut cream aside.

Unfold pastry (2 sheets) on work surface.  Cut each pastry sheet into 4 squares; pierce all over with fork.  Place 4 pastry squares on each of 2 baking sheets, spacing apart.  Brush egg glaze over pastry.  Spread 2 tablespoons peanut cream over each pastry, leaving 1/2-inch plain border.  Arrange bananas in overlapping slices atop peanut cream.  Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar.

Bake until crusts are golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Transfer to plates.  Serve warm with ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Executive chef Bridget Batson of Hawthorne Lane serves this dessert with homemade caramel sauce (you can use purchased if you like).  If youÃ­re running short of time, omit the homemade ice cream and mix chopped peanut brittle into your favorite vanilla ice cream.

Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper.  Place fish in 8- by 8-inch glass baking dish.  Pour wine over fish.  Bake until opaque in center, basting occasionally with wine and juices in dish, about 15 minutes.

Divide fish among 4 plates.  Spread all of fennel butter over fish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  These steaks are delicious served with creamed spinach and roasted new potatoes.

                                Zabaglione

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  egg yolks -- at room temperature
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  Moscato d'Asti wine
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Butter or hazelnut cookies
                        = (or fresh fruit like peaches,
                        mango, or berries)

Place ingredients in a 2-quart pot (copper is nice but not essential).  If you want to duplicate Cesare's paiolo, which is a pot with a rounded bottom, use a copper or stainless-steel bowl, holding the edge with a pot holder.

Beat ingredients with a hand mixer at high speed until foamy.  Place over medium heat and continue beating.  The mixture will thicken and increase greatly in volume.  When mixture feels warm, remove the pot from heat.  Continue beating, periodically placing the pot back over heat and quickly removing the pot again once the mixture is warm.  Do not overheat it or you will curdle the eggs.  Practice makes perfect.  When ready, the zabaglione will be thick, foamy, and warm -- but not hot -- to the touch.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  When showing me his straightforward technique for making this traditional dessert, chef Cesare Giaccone (at Da Cesare restaurant in Albaretto della Torre) credited a parrish priest in a nearby hamlet for giving him new understanding of zabaglione.  Whether that meant pointers or inspiration was hard to tell, but knowing that this ambrosia has such a godly source allows me to enjoy it even more!
