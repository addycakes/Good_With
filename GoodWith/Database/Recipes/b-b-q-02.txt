                Acorn Squash With Apple-Cornbread Stuffing

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     acorn squashes -- halved lengthwise,
                        seeds discarded
  2               cups  cranberry juice
                        === STUFFING ===
  1                     Granny Smith apple -- halved, cored
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  2               cups  cornbread -- crumbled
     1/4           cup  dried cranberries
     1/4           cup  pecans -- toasted, chopped
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  sage
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Grill the squash halves, cut-side down, over Indirect Medium heat for 40 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill and let stand at room temperature.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, cook the cranberry juice until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 20 minutes.

To make the Stuffing:  Grill the apple, cut-side down, over Direct Medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Allow to cool slightly; chop and set aside.

In a large sautÈ pan over medium heat, warm the oil.  Add the garlic and onion and sautÈ until the onion is translucent, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the chopped apple along with the rest of the stuffing ingredients including salt and pepper to taste.

Put 1 tablespoon of the reduced cranberry juice in the cavity of each squash half then spoon in about 1/2 cup of the stuffing.  Grill over Direct Medium heat until squash is tender and stuffing is golden, about 5 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This festive side dish captures the reassuring flavors of winter comfort food with a warm medley featuring caramelized apples and seasoned cornbread in a "bowl" of grill-roasted squash.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BUTTER ===
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/3           cup  chopped toasted pecans
  1         tablespoon  maple syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === SQUASH ===
  2                     acorn squashes - (1 1/2 to 2 lbs ea)
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the Butter:  In a small bowl, combine the butter, pecans, maple syrup, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and pepper.  Mix well with a fork.

To prepare the Squash:  With a large, heavy knife cut the squash in half lengthwise.  Remove the seeds with a spoon.  Lightly brush the exposed flesh with the oil.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Put the squash halves, cut-sides down, on the cooking grate and grill over Indirect High heat until grill marks are clearly visible, about 30 minutes.

Turn the squash halves cut-sides up.  Spread the exposed flesh with the pecan butter.  Continue grilling until the flesh is tender, 20 to 30 minutes.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  On cool autumn nights, a sweet, buttery glaze over tender acorn squash is about as comforting as food gets.  If you like, substitute butternut squash for equally good results.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  quick-cooking oatmeal -- (not instant)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
     1/2           cup  chopped pecans
                        === APPLES ===
  4              large  baking apples -- halved crosswise

Brush the cut side of the apples with the melted butter.  Arrange the apples cut-side down on the grill and cook over Direct Medium heat for 20 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill.

Mound the topping over the cut side of the apples, distributing evenly.  Return apples to the grill and continue grilling over Direct Medium heat until the topping is golden brown, about 6 minutes.

Serve warm or at room temperature with the heavy cream drizzled over the apples.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Crumb topping is a favorite on almost any dessert, but wait until you try it on grilled apples.  Use apples that are good for baking such as Winesap, Rome Beauty, or Granny Smith.

                      Apricot-Ginger Pork Tenderloin

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground red pepper
  2                     well-trimmed pork tenderloins -- (3/4 to 1 lb ea)
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  apricot preserves
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped crystallized ginger
  1         tablespoon  sherry vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme

In a small bowl, combine oregano, salt, thyme, black pepper, and red pepper.  Rub mixture on all sides of pork tenderloins, pressing it into meat surface.

Place tenderloins in center of cooking grate.  Grill 25 to 30 minutes for medium (160 degrees) and centers are still slightly pink, turning occasionally throughout grilling time to brown them evenly.

Meanwhile, make Sauce:  In small saucepan, combine all sauce ingredients.  Cook over medium heat 2 to 3 minutes until jelly is melted and sauce is hot.  Remove from heat and keep warm.

Remove tenderloins from grill.  Carve into slices and serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  The pork calls for a white, but the apricot and ginger call for spice; a Gew¸rztraminer, particularly one from the Alsace region of France, answers both calls.

Beer Recommendation:  Just about any American lager will cruise alongside this dish, although the microbrews will taste best.

Comments:  If youíve got an herb garden, by all means, use fresh ones here.  Substitute three parts fresh to one part dried.

                  Arabian Nights Grilled Herbed Chicken

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped flat leaf parsley
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh fennel tops
                        = (or 2 tspns dried fennel seed)
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped green onions
  1             carton  nonfat plain yogurt - (8 oz)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     chicken - (abt 3 lbs) -- butterflied
  1           teaspoon  olive oil

Combine parsley, fennel, onions, yogurt, in a glass bowl.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Cover and chill until ready to use.

Remove excess fat from chicken.  Rinse and pat dry.  To butterfly chicken, use poultry shears or a sharp knife to split the bird lengthwise along one side of the backbone.  With the breast side up, pull the body open, pressing down firmly on the breast until the rib bones crack and the bird lays reasonably flat.

Place fingers between the skin and meat of the chicken to separate and make space for the herb mixture.  Place herb mixture under chicken skin, pushing it in gently under skin until all parts of meat are covered.  Massage the chicken to evenly distribute herb mixture under the skin.  Let sit at least 30 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator.

Brush chicken skin lightly with oil; season with salt and pepper to taste.  Place breast side up in center of cooking grate and grill for 45 to 55 minutes or until the juices run clear and the skin is crisp.  It is not necessary to turn chicken.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A full-bodied Zinfandel with plum, cherry, and black pepper notes makes a great match for the fennel in the moist chicken.

Beer Recommendation:  A traditional M‰rzen beer will have the light body and spicy profile to match this refreshingly herbaceous chicken.

Comments:  The yogurt and fresh herbs make this chicken so moist, flavorful, and low-fat, youíll make this recipe often!  In a hurry?  Have your butcher butterfly the chicken for you.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  boneless chicken breast halves with skin -- (abt 8 oz ea)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === STUFFING ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1                jar  artichoke hearts - (7 oz)
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3             ounces  fresh goat cheese -- crumbled
  3        tablespoons  minced oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh basil

To make the Stuffing:  In a medium sautÈ pan combine the olive oil, thyme, and red pepper flakes.  Set the pan over medium-high heat to warm the mixture for 1 to 2 minutes.  Drain, rinse, and coarsely chop the artichokes and add along with the garlic, salt, and pepper.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat.  Add the goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and basil.  Mix to evenly distribute the ingredients and allow to cool.

Rinse the chicken breasts under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Place each breast between two sheets of plastic wrap and, with a meat mallet or back of a small pan, pound to flatten to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.  Place the breasts, skin-side down, and spread each one with a quarter of the stuffing.  Fold the breasts in half over the stuffing and use toothpicks to skewer the sides closed.  Brush or spray both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.

Grill the breasts over Direct Medium heat until the meat juices run clear and the cheese is melted, 8 to 12 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill and carefully remove the toothpicks.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Whatís needed to bring out the earthiness, richness, and sweetness of this dish is a fruity, semi-dry white.  A Riesling Kabinett from Germanyís Rheingau or Pfalz regions should do the trick.

Beer Recommendation:  A malt-driven brew is just the ticket for this grilled dish.  We canít think of a better match than Anchor Steam, brewed in San Francisco and available across the U.S.  The spicy, flavorful malt and the restrained bitterness of Anchor Steam make it as much a sauce as a beverage.

Comments:  A tasty departure from the ordinary. If flare-ups occur, finish these breasts over Indirect Medium heat.

  6                     pork loin chops, 1/2" thk - (abt 6 oz ea)
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  chicken broth
  2                     roasted red peppers -- quartered
  5                     apricots - (abt 1/2 lb) -- halved, pitted
                        = (or 5 dried apricots)
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-grated lemon zest
                        Soy sauce -- to taste
                        Jasmine rice -- for serving

To make the Pork Chops:  In a small bowl combine soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and anise powder.  Place pork chops in a large plastic resealable bag.  Pour marinade over chops; close bag.  Marinate in refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours, turning occasionally.

Meanwhile, make the Sauce:  In a 2-quart saucepan place chicken broth, roasted red peppers, apricots, garlic, and lemon zest. Simmer over low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

In a blender or food processor, purÈe until smooth and thickened.  Adjust consistency by adding more chicken stock to thin or using heat to reduce and thicken, as needed.  Add soy sauce, to taste.  Keep warm.

Remove chops from bag; discard marinade.  Place chops in center of cooking grate.  Grill 12 to 16 minutes for medium (160 degrees) or 17 to 20 minutes for well-done (170 degrees), turning once halfway through grilling time.

Serve each chop with some sauce and jasmine rice.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A Gamay Beaujolais Nouveau will have plenty of fruit to support this saucy dish.

Beer Recommendation:  Try a dry, pale lager from Southeast Asia, such as Thailandís Singha, to celebrate each distinct flavor in this dish.

Comments:  The grill adds a special dimension to this delicious, authentic Asian dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  hoisin sauce
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil

In a small saucepan combine all ingredients.  Cook and stir until bubbly.  Serve with grilled duck, chicken, beef, or pork, or lightly brush sauce on meat during last 10 minutes of grilling time.  Cover and store in refrigerator up to 2 weeks.

This recipe yields sauce for 12 servings.

Comments:  The flavors of this sauce are so intense, you can use it sparingly, as you would a steak sauce.  When brushing the sauce on during grilling time, use less than you would use of a typical barbecue sauce.

Comments:  Youíll find this straightforward sauce indispensable for easy Asian grilling.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     thickly-sliced strips smoked bacon
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  sherry wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves -- stripped from stems
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === VEGETABLES ===
  1              pound  asparagus -- washed, and
                        tough ends removed
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
     1/4        medium  red onion -- cut into thin
                        lengthwise slivers

In a large skillet over medium heat cook the bacon until browned and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes.  Drain on a double thickness of paper towel.  Cut into 1/4-inch crosswise pieces and set aside.

To make the Vinaigrette:  In a small bowl whisk the vinaigrette ingredients, including a grinding of black pepper.  Set aside.

Drizzle the asparagus with 1 tablespoon of the vinaigrette and season with salt.  Grill over Direct Medium heat until crisp-tender, 6 to 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Transfer the asparagus to a large deep platter.  Drizzle with the vinaigrette.  Sprinkle with bacon pieces and slivered red onion.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Use a lightly smoked bacon for the best flavor.  Serve as a first course with a baguette to soak up any remaining dressing.

Grill lamb chops 7 to 9 minutes for rare (140 degrees), 10 to 13 minutes for medium (160 degrees), or 14 to 17 minutes for medium-well (170 degrees), turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve lamb chops with grilled pineapple rings.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Want to blow your taste buds away?  Try a Shiraz bursting with black cherry and ripe tannins.  'Nough said.

Beer Recommendation:  Okay, if you insist on beer, make it a stout.  A full-flavored one like Cooper's Extra from South Australia is a natural match.

Comments:  If there's one thing Australians understand, it's how to make great lamb chops.  This recipe lets you in on the secret.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  mango chutney
     1/2           cup  orange juice
     1/4           cup  sweet and tangy barbecue sauce
  8                     pineapple chunks -- each abt 1" square
  12             large  prawns -- peeled, deveined
  12             large  sea scallops
  8                     cherry tomatoes
  8                     pearl onions -- blanched, peeled

In a food processor or blender purÈe chutney, orange juice, and barbecue sauce until smooth.

Thread four 12-inch skewers in the following order; pineapple, prawn, scallop, tomato, onion, prawn, scallop, tomato, onion, prawn, scallop, pineapple.

Brush skewers liberally with sauce and place in center of cooking grate.  Grill 6 to 8 minutes or until prawns are pink and scallops are opaque, turning and brushing liberally with sauce again halfway through grilling time.  Serve with remaining sauce for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A Semillon-Chardonnay blend from Australia will accommodate this citrusy sauce just brilliantly.

Beer Recommendation:  How to dance around the seafood and still tango with the mango?  Just say "ale."  A yeasty Hefe-Weizen will do wonderfully.

Comments:  The tangy mango sauce makes an irresistible addition to this Australian seafood celebration.  You can find mango chutney in gourmet markets and specialty stores.

                Baby Back Ribs With Spiced Apple-Cider Mop

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE MOP ===
  2               cups  apple cider
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced seeded jalapeÒo
     1/4           cup  ketchup
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  dark brown sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR THE RIBS ===
  2                     slabs baby back pork ribs - (to 3) -- abt 4 lbs total
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the Mop:  In a small saucepan combine the apple cider, shallots, and jalapeÒo.  Bring to a boil and cook over medium-high heat until about 1 cup of the liquid remains, 15 to 20 minutes.  Add the remaining mop ingredients, bring to a boil, and remove from the heat.  (The mop may be made ahead and refrigerated until ready to use.)

Allow the ribs to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling.  Season with salt and pepper.  Grill, rib-side down, over Indirect Medium heat until the meat is very tender and has pulled back from the ends of the bones, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Baste the ribs frequently with the mop throughout grilling time, but stop basting during the last 10 minutes.  Remove from the grill and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing into individual ribs.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A Gew¸rztraminer from Alsace will have the complexity and flavor intensity to complement the mop and more than enough body for the sweet grilled rib meat.

Beer Recommendation:  A fruit-infused Belgian-style beer made with raspberries, cranberries, or peaches will make a salad with the marinade while its acidic finish cuts through the sweetness.

Comments:  If you like your ribs a little crispy on the outside, grill them, meat-side down, over Direct Medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes before finishing them over Indirect Medium heat.  Donít expect leftovers.

Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit
                Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- melted
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
                        = (juice of 1 lime)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon - (to 1)
  4                     firm bananas -- peeled
     1/3           cup  dark rum
  4             scoops  ice cream

In a small bowl combine sugar, melted butter, lime juice, and cinnamon.  Brush bananas with about 1/4 cup of butter mixture.

Place bananas on center of cooking grate.  Grill 2 to 4 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling.  Slice grilled bananas and place slices in a flameproof dish.  Pour remaining 1/2 cup butter mixture into dish.  Place dish on center of cooking grate.  Cook 5 minutes.

Remove dish from grill.  Quickly pour rum over bananas.  Light rum with long kitchen matches.  After flames die out, serve immediately over ice cream.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A sweet dessert wine will know just how to coddle the butter and rum, or a sweeter Gew¸rztraminer will make a great companion to the bananas.

Beer Recommendation:  For your flaming dessert, a sip of stout.  For the best match, pick one from the Caribbean.

Comments:  For a dramatic, festive finale, try this flaming tropical dessert.

For another tropical treat, you can substitute 2 semi-firm mangos for the bananas.  Peel and cut into 1-inch thick slices.

  1           teaspoon  light brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === THE SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  barbecue sauce
  1                cup  Cabernet Sauvignon
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the Rub:  In a small bowl combine the rub ingredients.

Trim the ribs of any excess fat.  Press the rub into the meat, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours.

Allow the ribs to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling.  Sear over Direct Medium heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes, turning once halfway through searing time.  Transfer to a heavy-gauge aluminum pan large enough to hold the ribs in one layer.  If necessary, cut the ribs into smaller sections.

To make the Sauce:  In a medium saucepan whisk together the sauce ingredients.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Pour the sauce over the ribs and tightly cover with aluminum foil.

Grill the ribs over Indirect Medium heat until very tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Remove the ribs from the pan and cut into one- or two-rib pieces.  Skim off any fat from the sauce and season with salt and pepper.   Serve the ribs hot with the sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Easy pick; a great Cabernet Sauvignon from the Napa Valley from the spectacular 1994 or 1995 vintages.  The ripe tannins will bring out the ribs' sweetness, while the smoky grilled flavors will enhance the fruit of the wine.  This is the kind of match that makes a red meat/red wine fan more than a little crazy!  Comments:  Beef and wine are natural partners, and this recipe shows the tenderizing power of the grape.  Beef ribs never had it so good!

Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  top round or beef tenderloin
     1/4           cup  creamy peanut butter
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                     green onion -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  light soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes

To make the Marinade:  In a small bowl whisk together the marinade ingredients with 1/4 cup water.

Cut the beef into 3/4-inch cubes.  Place the cubes in a large, resealable plastic bag and pour in the marinade.  Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly.  Turn the bag to distribute the marinade, place in a bowl, and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.

Remove the meat from the bag, reserving the marinade.  Thread the meat onto skewers, leaving space between the cubes.  Allow to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling.

Grill the beef cubes over Direct High heat until medium-rare, 3 to 5 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Pour the reserved marinade into a small saucepan, bring to a boil over high heat, and boil for one full minute.  Add the peanut butter, return to a boil, and whisk until the sauce thickens.  Serve warm with the beef skewers.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A Pinot Noir from Californiaís Central Coast will open up wide to embrace these delectable beef skewers.

Beer Recommendation:  The beef calls for a darker beer, the chiles call for a creamy brew.  A Pilsener like San Miguel Dark from the Philippines is the perfect choice.

Comments:  An inspired use for peanut butter.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  beef short ribs -- cut 6" lengths
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2              large  tomatoes -- peeled, chopped
     1/2           cup  apple cider
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  catsup
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  prepared mustard
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin

To make the Sauce:  In a saucepan or large skillet heat oil.  Add onions and garlic and sautÈ 5 minutes or until translucent.  Add remaining sauce ingredients.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Process in a blender or food processor until smooth.  Chill in refrigerator until ready to use or up to 3 weeks.

Make 4 vertical cuts about 1 inch apart in each short rib from top of rib to the bone.  Place ribs and 1 1/2 cup sauce in jumbo resealable plastic bag.  Close bag and marinate in refrigerator overnight. Chill remaining 1/2 cup sauce.

Remove ribs from bag and discard used sauce.  Place ribs in center of cooking grate.  Grill 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours or until tender.  Brush with reserved 1/2 cup sauce during last 20 minutes of grilling.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  The tangier the ribs, the fruitier the red; for this dish, a Pinot Noir from Anderson Valley in California.

Beer Recommendation:  A golden amber ale thatís heavy on the hops will corral the numerous spices in this dish.  Yee haw!

Comments:  This recipe uses two vinegars to make the most tender beef ribs you ever ate.

                       Beef Stroganoff On The Grill

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  onion -- cut 1/2" slices
  2             pounds  top sirloin steak
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        === SAUCE ===
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves
  1              pound  mushrooms -- quartered
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  flour
  3               cans  beef broth - (14 1/2 oz ea)
  1                cup  red wine
  3        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  sour cream
                        === FOR SERVING ===
  1              pound  egg noodles -- cooked

Season the onion slices and steak with the salt and pepper, then lightly brush or spray with the olive oil.  Grill over Direct High heat for 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill, cool slightly, then chop the onion and cut the steak into 1/8-inch slices.  Set aside.

To make the Sauce:  In a large sautÈ pan over medium heat, warm the olive oil.  Add the garlic and sautÈ for 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and sautÈ 3 minutes more.

In a large stockpot over medium heat, melt the butter.  Whisk in the flour and cook for 5 minutes, whisking occasionally.  Add the garlic and mushrooms along with the rest of the sauce ingredients and stir to combine.  Reduce the heat, partially cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Blend in the sour cream and cook 15 minutes more.  Serve immediately over the cooked noodles; gently toss to combine.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Look for a smooth red wine, such as an Oregon Pinot Noir, to match this dish's velvety texture.

Beer Recommendation:  For beer lovers, a red ale with a touch of sweetness works just as well.

Comments:  Grilled steak and onion slices give this classic recipe a new lift.  On the grill, the natural sugars in the onion slices caramelize on the surface, giving them a slightly sweet flavor.  The grilled steak adds just a wisp of smoke.  A nice romp for your taste buds.

To make the Sauce:  In a large sautÈ pan over medium heat, warm the olive oil.  Add the garlic and sautÈ for 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and sautÈ 3 minutes more.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large stockpot over medium heat, melt the butter.  Whisk in the flour and cook for 5 minutes, whisking occasionally.  Add the garlic and mushrooms along with the rest of the sauce ingredients and stir to combine.  Reduce the heat, partially cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Blend in the sour cream and cook 15 minutes more.  Serve immediately over the cooked noodles; gently toss to combine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  Look for a smooth red wine, such as an Oregon Pinot Noir, to match this dish&apos;s velvety texture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beer Recommendation:  For beer lovers, a red ale with a touch of sweetness works just as well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Grilled steak and onion slices give this classic recipe a new lift.  On the grill, the natural sugars in the onion slices caramelize on the surface, giving them a slightly sweet flavor.  The grilled steak adds just a wisp of smoke.  A nice romp for your taste buds.

                             Beer Can Chicken

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  chicken - (4 to 5 lbs)
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1                can  beer - (16 oz) -- tall boy
                        === THE RUB ===
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  granulated onion
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

To make The Rub:  In a small bowl combine the rub ingredients.

Remove and discard the neck, giblets, and any excess fat from the chicken.  Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Lightly spray or brush all over with the vegetable oil and season, inside and out, with the rub.

Open the beer can and pour off half of the beer.  Set the half-full can on a flat surface and slide the chicken over the top so the can fits inside the cavity.  Transfer the bird to the grill, keeping the can upright.  Carefully balance the bird on its two legs and the can.  Grill over Indirect Medium heat until the juices run clear and the internal temperature reaches 170 degrees in the breast and 180 degrees in the thickest part of the thigh, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.

Wearing barbecue mitts, carefully remove the chicken and the can from the grill, being careful not to spill the beer -- it will be hot.  Let the chicken rest for about 10 minutes before lifting it from the can.  Discard the beer.  Cut the chicken into serving pieces.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Beer Recommendation:  Finish off the rest of the six-pack.

Comments:  Hereís a technique that delivers great-tasting chicken and makes a lively conversation starter as well.  Weíve used one of our special rubs, but you can sub in 2 to 3 tablespoons of your favorite one.  Bottoms up!

Categories    : Appetizers                      Chicken
                Grilling                        Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     boneless skinless chicken thighs -- (abt 4 oz ea)
  6                     flour or corn tortillas - (6" to 7" dia)
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                cup  dark Mexican beer
                        = (such as Negra Modelo)
  2        tablespoons  dark sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
                        === GUACAMOLE ===
  2                     ripe Haas avocados
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt

To make the Marinade:  In a small bowl whisk together the marinade ingredients.

Rinse the chicken thighs under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Place them in a large, plastic resealable bag and pour in the marinade.  Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly.  Turn the bag to distribute the marinade, place the bag in a bowl, and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours, turning the bag occasionally.

To make the Muacamole:  Cut the avocados lengthwise around the pits, twist the halves apart, and remove the pits.  Scoop the flesh into a medium bowl.  Add the lime juice and salt.  Using a potato masher or the back of a spoon, mash the ingredients together.  Cover with plastic wrap, placing it directly on the surface to prevent browning, and refrigerate until about 1 hour before serving.

Remove the chicken thighs from the bag and discard the marinade.  Grill the chicken thighs over Direct Medium heat until the meat is firm and the juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and cut the thighs into thin strips.

Warm the tortillas over Direct Medium heat for about 1 minute, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Pile the sliced chicken inside the tortillas.  Top each taco with a spoonful of guacamole.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Pour a glass of soft red wine with lots of fruit, such as a California Pinot Noir.

Beer Recommendation:  A dark Mexican beer tastes just right for this grilled apperitivo.

Comments:  Many Americans are accustomed to guacamole loaded with tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and fiery chiles, but a more traditional version in Mexico and parts of Texas is simply mashed avocados with a bit of salt and lime juice.  Itís rich and buttery -- a fabulous topping for these juicy chicken tacos.

Categories    : Desserts                        Grilling


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  fresh or frozen blueberries
  2               cups  fresh raspberries or
                        sliced strawberries
     2/3           cup  brown sugar - (packed) -- divided
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  salt
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  almond biscotti or
                        amaretti cookie crumbs
     1/2           cup  chopped toasted almonds

In a large bowl, mix all berries and 1/3 cup brown sugar.  Divide evenly among 8 large, disposable aluminum cupcake cups.

Combine flour, remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt.  Cut butter into flour mixture until it makes small crumbles.  Gently stir in crumbled cookies and almonds.  Sprinkle evenly over fruit in cupcake cups.

Position cups in center of cooking grate.  Grill 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly browned and bubbly.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Make more than dessert -- make a lasting impression by serving this dish with a concentrated dessert wine such as an Italian Vin Santo.

Beer Recommendation:  The natural match for a dessert bursting with berries?  A cherry Lambic, of course.  Served in flute glasses, it makes a lovely final presentation.

Comments:  This delightful crisp can also be made with other summer fruits such as peaches, nectarines, and plums.

                Bliss Potatoes With Sour Cream And Caviar

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              small  red bliss potatoes - (abt 1 1/2" dia)
  1              quart  water
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              pinch  salt
  8          teaspoons  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chervil
                        = (or 1 tspn dried chervil leaves)
  1              ounce  sevruga or osetra caviar

Place potatoes in a medium saucepan; add water and salt.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Cover; reduce heat to simmer and cook 15 to 20 minutes or until tender.  Drain and cool until easy to handle.

Cut a flat spot on opposite ends of each potato.  Cut each potato in half between the flat spots.  Remove 1 scoop out of the inside of the potato with a small melon baller.  Place potato halves in a bowl, drizzle with oil and toss gently to coat.  Sprinkle with salt.

Place potatoes on cooking grate and grill 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from grill and cool slightly.

Spoon 1 teaspoon sour cream into each potato half.  Sprinkle with chervil and top with caviar.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Champagne, of course.  Choose one from Epernay, France, and you canít go wrong.

Comments:  Osetra and sevruga are the next best thing to the hard-to-find Beluga caviar -- and definitely worth the splurge!

           Boneless Salmon Japonaise With Creamed Green Onions

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  reduced-sodium soy sauce
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
     1/4           cup  white wine or sake
  2                     shallots -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- diced
  1         tablespoon  grated ginger
  4                     salmon fillets - (abt 8 oz ea)
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing salmon
                        === CREAMED GREEN ONIONS ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  12                    green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
                        === THICKENER ===
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives -- for garnish

In a mixing bowl combine soy sauce, sugar, lemon juice, wine, shallots, garlic, and ginger; mix well.  Place salmon fillets in a resealable plastic bag.  Pour marinade over salmon.  Seal bag and marinate in refrigerator for 2 hours.

Just before grilling salmon, make the Creamed Green Onions:  In small saucepan melt butter.  Add green onions and cook over low heat 3 to 5 minutes or until opaque.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add cream and stir to heat through.  Keep warm.

Remove salmon from marinade; reserve marinade.  Brush marinated fillets lightly with oil.  Place fillets in center of cooking grate.  Grill 6 to 10 minutes or until fish is opaque and flesh flakes easily with a fork, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Meanwhile, process marinade in blender or food processor until smooth.  Pour into a small saucepan and bring to a boil; simmer one minute.  In small bowl combine water and cornstarch.  Add cornstarch mixture to heated marinade; stir until slightly thickened.

To serve, pour some marinade on each plate, top with some creamed green onions, top with salmon fillet, and sprinkle chives over each fillet.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  You can rely on a Gew¸rztraminer to balance the soy sauce and ginger with the salmon.

Beer Recommendation:  For this Japanese-style dish, the best "brew" is a Ginjo Genshu (premium) sake served cold.

Comments:  Don't just throw another plain salmon steak on the grill -- try this recipe!  The minimal effort delivers a big flavor reward.

                    Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry.  Brush with oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Place chicken breasts in center of cooking grate.  Grill 10 to 12 minutes or until tender and no longer pink inside, turning once halfway through cooking time.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The basic how-to for the indispensable chicken breast.

Tasty variations:  Grilled chicken breasts can be sliced and served on top of a tossed green salad with a light vinaigrette dressing.  Grilled chicken breasts make delicious sandwiches.  Place grilled breast on a bun and top with lettuce and sliced tomato or a grilled red pepper half.  Serve with your favorite dressing.  For a quick salad, cube grilled chicken breasts, combine with chopped walnuts, celery, apple cubes, and mayonnaise or salad dressing; season to taste.  Grill up a couple extra to toss into tomorrow nightís pasta dish!

              Bratwurst Wraps With Onion-Sauerkraut Filling

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork                            Sausage


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     fresh bratwurst - (1 lb)
  1             bottle  beer - (12 oz)
  1                cup  chopped onion
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              pound  fresh sauerkraut -- rinsed, and
                        fully drained
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  4                     flour tortillas - (10" dia)
     1/4           cup  honey-Dijon mustard
  4             slices  smoked Swiss cheese

Place bratwurst and beer in medium saucepan; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 10 minutes.  Remove from heat; let bratwurst cool in beer.

In 10-inch frying pan cook onion in oil over medium heat until browned, 8 to 10 minutes.  Add sauerkraut, sugar, salt, and red pepper; mix well.  Continue cooking for 5 minutes to blend flavors.

Place bratwurst in center of cooking grate.  Grill 5 to 6 minutes or until browned and heated throughout, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Split each in half lengthwise.

Place 1/4 of sauerkraut mixture down center of each tortilla.  Place 2 bratwurst halves on top of filling.  Spread 1 tablespoon mustard on bratwurst and top with a slice of cheese.  Fold two sides of tortilla over cheese; fold remaining bottom and top halves of tortilla to close.

Place tortilla wraps flap-side down on grill; grill 3 to 4 minutes or until browned and heated through, turning once halfway through grilling time.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A rich Muscat will cut through the spicy, vinegary filling and match the intensity of the cheese and sausage.  Open wide for a mouthful of flavor power!

Beer Recommendation:  A strongly malted pale lager will bow to the tangy sauerkraut and crown the bratwurst king of your taste buds.

Comments:  This cultural-fusion dish is as much fun to make as it is to eat!

Place bratwurst and beer in medium saucepan; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 10 minutes.  Remove from heat; let bratwurst cool in beer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In 10-inch frying pan cook onion in oil over medium heat until browned, 8 to 10 minutes.  Add sauerkraut, sugar, salt, and red pepper; mix well.  Continue cooking for 5 minutes to blend flavors.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place bratwurst in center of cooking grate.  Grill 5 to 6 minutes or until browned and heated throughout, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Split each in half lengthwise.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 1/4 of sauerkraut mixture down center of each tortilla.  Place 2 bratwurst halves on top of filling.  Spread 1 tablespoon mustard on bratwurst and top with a slice of cheese.  Fold two sides of tortilla over cheese; fold remaining bottom and top halves of tortilla to close.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place tortilla wraps flap-side down on grill; grill 3 to 4 minutes or until browned and heated through, turning once halfway through grilling time.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  A rich Muscat will cut through the spicy, vinegary filling and match the intensity of the cheese and sausage.  Open wide for a mouthful of flavor power!
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beer Recommendation:  A strongly malted pale lager will bow to the tangy sauerkraut and crown the bratwurst king of your taste buds.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This cultural-fusion dish is as much fun to make as it is to eat!

                    Bread Pudding With Dried Cherries

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Grilling


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            slices  French bread
                        = (approximately 5 cups cubed)
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/4      teaspoons  nutmeg
  1 1/4      teaspoons  cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2               cups  skim milk
  1                cup  dried cherries
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
                        Low-fat vanilla frozen yogurt -- (optional)

Grill the bread over Direct Medium heat until toasted and grill marks appear, about 2 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Cut bread into cubes and set aside.

In a large bowl, beat the eggs until frothy, about 3 minutes.  Add the sugar, vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, and melted butter.  Beat until well blended.  Add milk, then stir in dried cherries and lemon zest.  Add bread cubes and toss until mixed well.  Let rest for about 45 minutes, patting the bread down into the liquid occasionally.

Transfer bread and egg mixture to a 5- by 9-inch loaf pan.  Place pan in center of cooking grate and grill over Indirect Medium heat for 50 to 60 minutes or until top is well-browned and puffy.  Slice and serve warm with low-fat frozen yogurt, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A thick, sweet dessert wine like a "chewy" Muscat from California will make a great sauce for this low-fat pudding.

Beer Recommendation:  A cherry beer with a refreshing acidity in the finish is perfect here -- try one from Belgium, Wisconsin, or Colorado.

Comments:  This classic dessert is right at home on your Weber Grill.  Let it bake while you're enjoying dinner.

Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VEGETABLES ===
  1                can  artichoke hearts - (14 oz)
  4                     plum tomatoes -- cut in half
  2                     baby eggplants -- cut in half
  1              small  onion -- cut four wedges
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  white balsamic vinegar
                        Juice of 1 lemon
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
                        === POLENTA ===
  3               cups  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  butter
     3/4           cup  instant polenta
     1/2           cup  sour cream
                        === CHOPS ===
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8                     lamb chops, abt 1 1/2" thick

To make the Vegetables:  In a large bowl, combine artichokes, tomatoes, eggplant, and onion with the olive oil, salt, pepper, thyme, vinegar, and lemon juice.  Let marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes.

Remove vegetables from the bowl, shaking off excess marinade.  Grill over Direct Medium heat for 6 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from grill and chop roughly.  Put vegetables in a medium saucepan and add the chicken broth.  Simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and keep warm.

To prepare the Polenta:  In a medium saucepan, combine chicken broth and butter; bring to a boil.  Add polenta and stir well.  Reduce heat and simmer for 12 minutes, covered.  Remove from heat and stir in sour cream.

To grill the Chops:  In a small bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, salt, and pepper.  Roll each lamb chop in the breadcrumb mixture.  Grill chops over Direct Medium heat for 9 minutes for medium-rare, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve with creamy polenta and grilled vegetables.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Comfort food like this calls for an earthy but elegant wine to enhance the warmth of the moment.  A robust Italian red from the province of Umbria -- try a Torgiano Rosso Riserva, for example.

Beer Recommendation:  Black and Tan is what you'll want with this homey dish.  The beer simultaneously acts as a rich sauce and a palate cleanser, inviting the next bite, the next sip.

Comments:  This family-style recipe embodies the splendor of home cooking; simple, yet oh so tasty.

                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BRINE ===
  3        tablespoons  kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3              whole  branches fresh rosemary
                        === PORK CHOPS ===
  4                     bone-in loin pork chops, 1" thick
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed

To prepare the Brine:  In a medium bowl combine the salt and sugar.  Pour 1 cup of hot water into the bowl, and whisk to dissolve the salt and sugar.  Add 2 cups of cold water along with the remaining brine ingredients.

Place the pork chops in a large, resealable plastic bag and pour in the brine.  Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly.  Turn the bag to distribute the brine, place the bag in a bowl, and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours.

Remove the pork chops from the bag and pat dry with paper towels.  Discard the brine.  Lightly brush or spray both sides of the chops with oil.  Allow to stand at room temperature for about 20 minutes before grilling.

Sear the pork chops over Direct High heat for 6 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Continue grilling over Indirect Medium heat until the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes.  Serve warm with an herbed pasta salad, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Pour a soft Italian red like Sangiovese.

Beer Recommendation:  A well-crafted American lager fits nicely.

Comments:  A good soak in a seasoned brine puts osmosis to work inside your pork chops.  The meat absorbs moisture and flavor, giving you a shot at your best chops yet.

Note:  The chops are first seared over Direct High heat and then finished over Indirect Medium heat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  water
     1/4           cup  pickling spice - (half of 1 1/2-oz jar)
     1/3           cup  salt
  1                     broiler-fryer chicken -  (2 1/2 to 3 lbs)

In a Dutch oven or large stock pot, bring water, pickling spice, and salt to a boil over high heat.  Remove from heat and chill completely.

Remove giblets from chicken; rinse and pat dry.  Submerge chicken in chilled pickling marinade.  Marinate in refrigerator 12 hours.

Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade.  Pat chicken dry with paper towels, brushing off excess pickling spice.  Place chicken, breast-side up, in center of cooking grate. Grill 1 to 1 1/4 hours or until meat thermometer registers 180 degrees and the drumsticks move easily in their sockets.  Serve hot while skin is still crispy.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Look for a fresh and perky Napa Riesling with notes of bright green apples.

Beer Recommendation:  A highly hopped brew with a very crisp finish would be perfect.  Can you say Pilsener?  Try one from the Old World -- definitely worth the money.

Comments:  This chicken grills up so deliciously brown, crispy, and juicy, you may never make it any other way again!

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Poultry                         Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  turkey breast - (5 to 6 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  butter -- melted
                        === THE BRINE ===
     2/3           cup  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  honey
  10             whole  allspice -- crushed
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped peeled fresh ginger
  4                     garlic cloves -- bruised with
                        the side of a knife
  4                     whole cloves
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     cinnamon stick

To prepare The Brine:  In a large, 8-quart stockpot, dissolve the salt in 2 cups of very hot water.  Add the rest of the brine ingredients and stir to combine.  Cool to room temperature.

Rinse the turkey breast under cold water, drain, and place the turkey in the brine.  Surround it with about 6 cups of ice cubes.  Add enough water to totally cover the turkey breast by at least 1/2 inch.  Carefully stir the brine one last time.  Cover and refrigerate 12 hours or overnight.

Remove the turkey breast from the pot and discard the brine.  Pat turkey dry with paper towels.

Place the turkey, skin-side up, in a roasting pan set in a disposable aluminum pan.  Brush the skin with the melted butter.  Grill over Indirect Medium heat until the skin is golden and the internal temperature reaches 170 degrees, about 1 1/2 hours.  Transfer the turkey breast to a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving into thin slices.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This tasty number is just the ticket for a smaller crowd, or to supplement the menu for a large one.

          Buffalo Steaks With Grilled Mushroom And Garlic Gravy

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Buffalo                         Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === THE STEAKS ===
  4          teaspoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  peanut oil
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  cardamom
     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
  4                     buffalo strip steaks - (abt 10 oz ea)
                        === THE GRAVY ===
  2                     portobello mushrooms - (abt 3 oz ea)
  4        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon-pepper seasoning
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- divided
  2        tablespoons  minced onion
  6                     garlic cloves - (to 8) -- minced
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  red wine
  1 1/2           cups  brown gravy

To make the Steaks:  Combine all ingredients except steaks.  Rub on both sides of the steaks, cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours.

Meanwhile, prepare the Gravy:  Rub the portobello mushrooms with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, lemon-pepper seasoning, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt.  Grill the mushroom for 8 to 10 minutes over Direct Medium heat.  Remove from grill, cut into small dice, and set aside.

SautÈ the minced onion and garlic in the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil for 1 to 2 minutes; add the wine and reduce until wine is gone.  Add the brown gravy and reserved mushroom.  Stir to blend; simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

For gas grills, increase heat to High.  Grill steaks over Direct High heat for 8 to 12 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time, or until desired doneness.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  This intensely rustic, meaty entree calls for a rustic red wine with forward fruit and deep complexity.  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano from Tuscany is full of juicy Sangiovese fruit and has enough nobility to challenge the richness of the meat.

Beer Recommendation:  Try an amber ale to mirror the balance in this hearty dish.  From its frothy head to its mild bitterness, this medium- to full-bodied brew makes a lively backgrounder for the recipe's assertive flavors.

Comments:  Buffalo is a wonderfully flavorful, lower-fat alternative to beef.  Searing these steaks directly over a hot fire keeps them tender and moist.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RIBS ===
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  hot pepper sauce - (to 3)
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1                     slab pork back ribs - (to 2) -- abt 1 to 3 lbs
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  2             ounces  blue cheese -- finely crumbled
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1         tablespoon  milk - (to 2)
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare the Ribs:  In small bowl, whisk together vinegar, oil, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, and brown sugar.  Place ribs in a resealable plastic bag; pour marinade mixture over ribs, turning to coat ribs, and close bag.  Marinate in refrigerator 4 hours or overnight, turning occasionally to distribute marinade.

Meanwhile, make the Dressing:  Combine all dressing ingredients and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Remove ribs from marinade; reserve marinade.  In small saucepan, bring reserved marinade to boil; boil at least 1 minute at a full rolling boil.

Place ribs in center of cooking grate.  Grill 30 to 35 minutes or until tender, turning occasionally and brushing with boiled reserved marinade.  Season ribs with salt and pepper to taste.  Cut ribs into individual portions and serve with dressing.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  You need a wine that can tame the bite of the sharp blue cheese: call on an Australian Shiraz or a northern RhÙne red.  Shazam!

Beer Recommendation:  A spicy amber brew with an herbaceous nose will tickle these ribs.

Comments:  What could be better than hot and spicy grilled ribs?  Dip them in this creamy dressing and you'll find out!

                        Juice of 1 lemon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil

To make the Spinach:  In a large skillet, heat olive oil.  Add onion and garlic; sautÈ 4 minutes.  Add tomatoes, soy sauce, ginger, and hot sauce; simmer 5 minutes.  Add spinach; bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and keep warm.

In a dish or resealable plastic bag, place calamari, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.  Toss to coat calamari.  Marinate 10 minutes.

Thread six 12-inch skewers with calamari.  Brush with sesame oil.  Place skewers in center of cooking grate.  Grill 4 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve skewers on warm Asian spinach.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  The briny squid and the soy-and-ginger spinach need a complex dry white. An AlbariÒo from Spain will amaze you.

Beer Recommendation:  An Asian lager, such as Tiger from Singapore, will know just how to honor the squid and handle the Asian spices in this delicate dish.

Comments:  Fresh frozen calamari is the best type for peak flavor.  Thaw it in your refrigerator, never at room temperature, and grill it quickly to keep it tender.

Note:  If using wooden skewers, soak in water thirty minutes before using so ends won't burn during grilling time.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                cup  lime juice
     1/2           cup  vegetable juice cocktail
     1/4           cup  chopped onion

  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === CARNE ASADA ===
  1                     beef flank steak - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  2                     sweet red or green peppers -- cut thin strips

To make the Marinade:  In a medium bowl whisk together all marinade ingredients.

Place steak in a resealable plastic bag set into a shallow dish.  Pour marinade over steak; close bag.  Marinate in the refrigerator 3 to 4 hours, turning bag occasionally to distribute marinade.

Meanwhile, cut an 18-inch square of heavy-duty aluminum foil.  Place peppers and sliced onion in center of foil.  Dot with butter.  Bring up 2 opposite edges of foil and, leaving a little space for expansion of steam, tightly seal top, then each end.

Remove steak from marinade, reserving marinade.  Place steak in center of cooking grate.

Place foil packet of vegetables on the cooking grate beside steak during the last 10 minutes of grilling time.

Wrap tortillas in heavy-duty aluminum foil; place on cooking grate beside steak during the last 5 minutes of grilling time.  Turn tortilla packet once halfway through grilling.

Slice steak diagonally across the grain into thin slices.  Serve in tortillas with peppers and onions, salsa, and guacamole.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Transform ordinary flank steak into a tender, flavorful fiesta for the mouth.  The secret's in the marinade!

                    Cedar-Planked Salmon On The Grill

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  salmon fillet - (18" long, abt 2 1/2 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest
                        = (zest of 1 lemon)
  3             sprigs  fresh dill -- snipped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish

Immerse an untreated, 20-inch cedar plank suitable for cooking use in water; soak at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.  Place salmon fillet, skin-side down, on soaked plank.  Sprinkle with lemon zest, dill, salt, and pepper.

Place planked salmon in center of cooking grate.  Grill 25 to 30 minutes or until salmon is opaque in center and flesh flakes easily with a fork.  Garnish with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  The absolute best way to celebrate the pure salmon flavors of this dish is with a crisp brut or extra dry Champagne.

Comments:  Simple is divine.  This very old method of cooking fish celebrates the pure, clean taste of fresh salmon.

Note:  Make sure the plank you choose is virgin cedar.  Buy one specially made for food preparation, usually sold in cookware stores.

               Cedar-Smoked Pork Loin With Pineapple Salsa

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pork loin roast - (3 to 3 1/2 lbs)
  1                     untreated cedar plank - (abt 4" by 12")
                        === SALSA ===
  4               cups  finely-diced pineapple
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1           teaspoon  minced jalapeÒo pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     green onions, white part only -- finely sliced
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped fresh basil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        === THE RUB ===
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh sage
  2          teaspoons  paprika
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Immerse the untreated cedar plank in water; place a weight on it to keep it submerged.  Soak for 4 to 24 hours.

To make the Salsa:  In a large sautÈ pan combine the pineapple, sugar, vinegar, lime juice, jalapeÒo, cumin, salt, and pepper.  Bring to a boil and cook over medium-high heat until thickened, 7 to 10 minutes.  (If there is still a lot of liquid left, use a slotted spoon to transfer the pineapple to a bowl and continue to cook the liquid over high heat for 5 minutes more, then pour the liquid over the pineapple.)  Mix in the onions and basil.  Season with salt, if desired.

To make The Rub:  In a small bowl combine the rub ingredients.

Trim any excess fat from the pork loin.  Spread the rub over the roast and place on the cedar plank.  Allow to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling.

Grill over Direct Medium heat until the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees, about 1 hour.  Carefully remove the roast and plank from the grill and loosely cover the roast with foil.  Allow to rest for 3 to 5 minutes before carving.  Serve warm with the pineapple salsa.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  To enhance the smoky sweet-and-sour flavors jumping off the grill, try a spicy, dry, full-bodied white; a Gew¸rztraminer from Alsace.  It wonít hurt the pineapple, either.

Beer Recommendation:  From its fruity and nutty attack on the palate to its smoky, dry finish, Irish Red Ale is perfect for this dish.

Comments:  Fresh herbs, cedar smoke, and a sweet and kicky relish add loads of personality to this dream cut of pork.  Be sure to use wood that's completely untreated.  Many barbecue or cooking-supply stores carry food-safe cedar planks.

Comments:  Fresh herbs, cedar smoke, and a sweet and kicky relish add loads of personality to this dream cut of pork.  Be sure to use wood that&apos;s completely untreated.  Many barbecue or cooking-supply stores carry food-safe cedar planks.

                           Cheesy Onion Quiche

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     uncooked pie crust - (9" dia)
                        === SAUCE ===
  1              large  red bell pepper
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  crushed walnuts
  2          teaspoons  tomato paste
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FILLING ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut four pieces
  1                cup  finely-chopped red onion
  3              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  1 1/2           cups  grated Jarlsberg, Swiss, or GruyËre cheese
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh chives
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

To make the Sauce:  Grill the bell pepper over Direct Medium heat until the skin is evenly charred on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes, turning every 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove the pepper from the grill and place in a paper bag; close tightly.  Let stand 10 to 15 minutes to steam off the skin.

Remove the pepper from the bag and peel away the charred skin.  Cut off the top and remove the seeds.  Coarsely chop the pepper and put in a food processor.  Add the remaining sauce ingredients and process until smooth.  Pour into a small serving bowl, cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

To make the Filling:  In a medium sautÈ pan over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the red onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.  Transfer to a medium bowl and allow to cool for a few minutes.

In a small bowl whisk the eggs and cream together and add to the butter-onion mixture.  Add the remaining filling ingredients and mix thoroughly.

Line a 9-inch metal pie tin with the crust.  Pour the filling into the crust.  Grill over Direct Medium heat until the edges of the crust and the filling begin to turn golden brown, about 15 minutes, then continue cooking over Direct Low heat until the filling is no longer wet in the center, about 15 minutes more.  Remove from the grill and allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes.  Serve with the sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This one is super rich, so follow it with a light entrÈe, such as grilled fish or a vegetable pasta.  Note: The quiche is grilled over Direct Medium heat to start and finished up over Direct Low heat.

Wine Recommendation:  For a ripe and moderately oaked Viognier the RhÙne is your best bet, but if you look around, youíll find one or two excellent ones from Napa.  Happy hunting!

Beer Recommendation:  Because cheese is both sweet and savory, a Scotch Ale is the perfect match.  Its burnt coffee notes and sweet caramel overtones will do the job.

       Chicken And Mesclun Salad With Raspberry-Walnut Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Poultry                         Salads/Dressings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (abt 1 1/4 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil - (to 2) -- crushed
  1         tablespoon  tri-colored peppercorns
     1/3           cup  walnut oil
  2        tablespoons  raspberry vinegar
  2          teaspoons  maple syrup
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6               cups  mesclun -- rinsed, dried
                        = (mixed spring greens)
                        Salt -- for chicken
  1                cup  fresh raspberries
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped pecans -- toasted

Rinse chicken and pat dry.  Brush chicken lightly with olive oil; press peppercorns evenly onto both sides of chicken.

Place chicken in center of cooking grate; sear 3 to 4 minutes, turning once halfway through searing time.  Continue grilling chicken 7 to 8 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink in center and juices run clear, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Meanwhile, prepare vinaigrette by whisking together walnut oil, raspberry vinegar, maple syrup, salt, and pepper.  Set aside.

Divide greens among 4 individual plates.  Season chicken with additional salt to taste.  Carve into thin slices and arrange on greens.  Top with raspberries and pecans.  Drizzle with vinaigrette.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Summer is all about lightness and that means salad -- and bubbles! -- for dinner... as in a dry sparkling white.

Beer Recommendation:  Sip an amber ale to highlight the nutty flavors of this dish.  Or if youíre nuts about fruit, try a raspberry wheat.

Comments:  Raspberry vinegar and walnut oil conspire to conquer your taste buds in this refreshing summer dish.

                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless chicken breast halves with skin -- (abt 6 oz ea)
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  hot chili oil
  2          teaspoons  dark sesame oil

To make the Marinade:  In a medium bowl whisk together all the marinade ingredients.

Rinse the chicken breasts under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Place the chicken breasts in a large, resealable plastic bag and pour in the marinade.  Press out the air and seal the bag tightly.  Turn the bag to distribute the marinade, place the bag in a bowl, and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or as long as 24 hours.

Remove the chicken breasts from the bag and discard the marinade.  Grill over Direct Medium heat until the meat is firm and the juices run clear, 8 to 12 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve warm with green beans, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Open a bottle of red wine with lots of fruit, like a California Cabernet Sauvignon.

Beer Recommendation:  A Vienna-style malt with a spicy sweetness is tremendous here.

Comments:  Every ingredient in this marinade adds up to all the difference in this chicken of unusually tasty character.  This combination also works well with pork chops.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRILLED ONIONS ===
  1                     red onion -- sliced 1/2" thick
  1           teaspoon  crushed coriander seeds
  1           teaspoon  fresh chopped thyme
     1/2           cup  white wine
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
                        === BURGERS ===
  4             slices  white bread -- crusts removed,
                        and cubed
  3        tablespoons  teriyaki sauce
  1              pound  ground chicken or turkey
                        = (preferably leg meat)
  3        tablespoons  finely-diced onion
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  fresh chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  mustard
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  3              drops  hot sauce - (to 4)
                        === GRILLED PINEAPPLE ===
  1                     small can pineapple rings -- drained
  1           teaspoon  freshly-crushed pink peppercorns
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Olive oil spray -- as needed

To make the Grilled Onions:  Place onion slices in a shallow baking dish.  In a small saucepan, combine coriander seeds, thyme, wine, oil, and lemon juice; bring to a boil over medium heat.  Let cool slightly, then pour mixture over onions.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.

To make the Burgers:  In a large bowl, combine cubed bread with teriyaki sauce and let rest for 5 minutes.  Fold in ground meat.  In a small pan, sautÈ onions, garlic, and parsley in sesame oil for 1 minute.  Add to ground meat mixture and combine.  Add mustard, egg, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and hot sauce.  Mix well.  Mold into 4 patties and refrigerate, covered, for 1 hour.

To make the Grilled Pineapple:  Place pineapple slices on paper towels to drain.  Remove and sprinkle with pink peppercorns and salt.  Spray lightly with oil.  Set aside.

Spray burgers lightly with oil and place in center of cooking grate.  Grill 6 to 8 minutes until well done and internal temperature registers 180 degrees, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Place onions on grill for 4 to 6 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time, and grill pineapple for 1 to 2 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Place burgers on grilled buns; top with pineapple and onion.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A good Blanc de Noirs sparkler from Californiaís North Coast will be an elegant match for this unusual burger.  The berry flavors of the Pinot Noir grapes will enhance the earthiness of the dish and cleanse the palate for the next bite.

Beer Recommendation:  A Japanese lager -- Kirin or Asahi -- is a great match with this dish.  Honestly, lager from Japan is not much different from any other classic lager, but something magical happens when you pair a Japanese-style dish with a classic Japanese beer.

Comments:  Take your taste buds for a joy ride with this Asian-inspired spin on the classic American burger.

To make the Grilled Onions:  Place onion slices in a shallow baking dish.  In a small saucepan, combine coriander seeds, thyme, wine, oil, and lemon juice; bring to a boil over medium heat.  Let cool slightly, then pour mixture over onions.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Burgers:  In a large bowl, combine cubed bread with teriyaki sauce and let rest for 5 minutes.  Fold in ground meat.  In a small pan, sautÈ onions, garlic, and parsley in sesame oil for 1 minute.  Add to ground meat mixture and combine.  Add mustard, egg, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and hot sauce.  Mix well.  Mold into 4 patties and refrigerate, covered, for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Grilled Pineapple:  Place pineapple slices on paper towels to drain.  Remove and sprinkle with pink peppercorns and salt.  Spray lightly with oil.  Set aside.

<DirT>
Spray burgers lightly with oil and place in center of cooking grate.  Grill 6 to 8 minutes until well done and internal temperature registers 180 degrees, turning once halfway through grilling time.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place onions on grill for 4 to 6 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time, and grill pineapple for 1 to 2 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Place burgers on grilled buns; top with pineapple and onion.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  A good Blanc de Noirs sparkler from Californiaís North Coast will be an elegant match for this unusual burger.  The berry flavors of the Pinot Noir grapes will enhance the earthiness of the dish and cleanse the palate for the next bite.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beer Recommendation:  A Japanese lager -- Kirin or Asahi -- is a great match with this dish.  Honestly, lager from Japan is not much different from any other classic lager, but something magical happens when you pair a Japanese-style dish with a classic Japanese beer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Take your taste buds for a joy ride with this Asian-inspired spin on the classic American burger.

                            Chili On The Grill

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Chili
                Grilling                        Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  plum tomatoes -- cores removed
  3                     celery stalks
  2             medium  yellow onions -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/2" slices
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  1             medium  jalapeÒo pepper -- stem removed
  2        tablespoons  pure chile powder -- divided
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pound  top sirloin steak, abt 3/4" thick
  3                     boneless pork loin chops, 3/4" thk -- (abt 5 oz ea)
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  1             bottle  ale - (12 oz)
  1                cup  beef broth
  1                can  pinto beans - (14 oz)
  1                cup  grated sharp Cheddar cheese
  1                cup  sour cream

Grill the tomatoes over Direct Medium heat until the skins are lightly charred on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes, turning as needed.  Transfer the tomatoes to a food processor and purÈe (in batches, if necessary), then pour into a large saucepan.

Brush or spray the celery and onion slices with the olive oil.  Grill the celery, onions, and jalapeÒo over Direct Medium heat until well marked, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Transfer the vegetables to a cutting board.  Chop the celery and onions into 1/4-inch pieces.  Mince the jalapeÒo.  Add the vegetables to the tomato purÈe.

In a small bowl combine 1 tablespoon of the chile powder, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and the pepper.  Season both sides of the steak and the chops with the spices.  Brush or spray the meat with the oil and grill over Direct Medium heat for about 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill and cut into 3/4-inch cubes, then add to the tomato mixture.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon chile powder, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, oregano, garlic, cayenne, ale, and broth to the meat mixture.  Bring to a boil over high heat.

Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the meat cubes are very tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Add the pinto beans and simmer for 15 minutes more.

Serve warm in individual bowls and top with the cheese and sour cream.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  For incredible chili, use pure chile powder -- not the "chili powder" (a blend of ground chiles, garlic, oregano, and other spices) that you find in most spice racks.  The pure stuff is simply ground ancho chiles (dried poblanos).

Categories    : Duck                            Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             gallon  fresh apple cider
  1                     duck - (4 1/2 lbs)
  2                     Granny Smith apples -- quartered
  1              small  onion -- sliced
  1              small  carrot -- sliced
  2                     celery ribs -- roughly chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In large saucepan bring apple cider to a boil.  Continue boiling for about 3 hours until reduced to one pint.  The resulting glaze will be intensely flavored, rich, and thick.

Remove neck, giblets, wing tips, and any excess fat from duck; reserve.  Rinse duck and pat dry.  Prick the duck all over with a fork.  Place apples inside the body cavity.  Tie the legs closed and set aside.

In a 13- by 9-inch heavy-gauge foil pan, place neck, giblets, wing tips, reserved fat, onion, carrot, and celery.  Season with salt and pepper.  Place the duck on top of the mixture.

Place pan in center of cooking grate.  Grill duck 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until internal temperature reaches 180 degrees.  Halfway through grilling time, start glazing duck with the cider reduction (pour into a plastic squeeze bottle for cooking use, or use a basting brush).  Continue glazing every 15 minutes until duck is done.  Remove duck from grill and let stand 10 minutes.

Discard neck, giblets, wing tips, fat, vegetables, and apples.  Serve duck with remaining cider glaze, if desired.  Store any leftover glaze in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks and use on other grilled poultry or pork.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A deep, rich Zinfandel balanced in fruit and tannin will create a second fruit sauce for the duck to swim in.

Beer Recommendation:  A smoked beer will create a cozy nest for this rich little bird.

Comments:  This easy-to-make cider glaze is so delicious youíll want to try it on other meats as well.

                        Clams With Munster Cheese

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 9     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             slices  bacon -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped green bell pepper
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped red bell pepper
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  grated Munster cheese
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  3              dozen  medium clams -- shucked, and
                        bottom shells reserved
                        Juice of 1 to 2 lemons

In a small skillet cook bacon until crisp.  Remove bacon and reserve.  Add green pepper, red pepper, and garlic to bacon drippings; cook 5 to 6 minutes or until tender.  Return bacon to pan; stir to combine.  Meanwhile, in small bowl combine Munster cheese and parsley.

Place 1 teaspoon vegetable mixture over each clam in shell.  Squeeze lemon juice over clams.  Sprinkle clams with cheese and parsley mixture.  Chill about 1 hour.

Arrange clams, open-side up, in center of cooking grate.  Grill 8 to 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 9 servings.

Comments:  To check clams for freshness, put them in a sink full of water.  Discard any broken clams, ones that float, or ones that do not snap shut or remain tightly closed when touched.

To shuck clams, firmly hold a clam upright, hinge-side down, on a pot holder.  Place the sharp side of a clam knife (straight-sided knife with a blunt, rounded four-inch blade and a two-inch handle) between the shells.  Then place shell in palm of hand (you may want to wear an oven mitt).  Pull the blade through the seam to sever the clam's muscle.  Force the clam open, being careful not to spill any of its juices, as they add great flavor to this recipe.  Run the knife along the top shell to free the meat.  Break the top shell off by twisting it; discard top shell.

In a small skillet cook bacon until crisp.  Remove bacon and reserve.  Add green pepper, red pepper, and garlic to bacon drippings; cook 5 to 6 minutes or until tender.  Return bacon to pan; stir to combine.  Meanwhile, in small bowl combine Munster cheese and parsley.

Place 1 teaspoon vegetable mixture over each clam in shell.  Squeeze lemon juice over clams.  Sprinkle clams with cheese and parsley mixture.  Chill about 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange clams, open-side up, in center of cooking grate.  Grill 8 to 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 9 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  To check clams for freshness, put them in a sink full of water.  Discard any broken clams, ones that float, or ones that do not snap shut or remain tightly closed when touched.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To shuck clams, firmly hold a clam upright, hinge-side down, on a pot holder.  Place the sharp side of a clam knife (straight-sided knife with a blunt, rounded four-inch blade and a two-inch handle) between the shells.  Then place shell in palm of hand (you may want to wear an oven mitt).  Pull the blade through the seam to sever the clam&apos;s muscle.  Force the clam open, being careful not to spill any of its juices, as they add great flavor to this recipe.  Run the knife along the top shell to free the meat.  Break the top shell off by twisting it; discard top shell.

                        Classic Bacon Cheeseburger

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             slices  bacon
  2             pounds  ground chuck (80% lean)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     thin slices extra-sharp Cheddar cheese
  6                     hamburger buns
  6                     crisp lettuce leaves
  6             slices  ripe tomato
                        Ketchup -- (optional)
                        Mustard -- (optional)

In a large sautÈ pan over medium heat, cook the bacon until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes, turning occasionally.  Remove the bacon and set aside on paper towels to drain.  Remove the pan from the heat.

Gently shape the ground chuck into six burgers of equal size and thickness (about 3/4 inch thick).  Season both sides of the burgers with salt and pepper.

Grill over Direct Medium heat until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees for medium, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Top each burger with a slice of the cheese during the last minute or two of grilling time and allow the cheese to melt.  During the last 30 seconds, grill the buns over Direct Medium heat until lightly toasted.

Serve the cheeseburgers hot on the toasted buns with a lettuce leaf and a slice of tomato, topped with a slice of the bacon.  Serve with ketchup and mustard on the side, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A jammy red wine will match this classic burger perfectly.  Consider a Zinfandel, a ripe Beaujolais from a recent vintage, or a heady CÙtes-du-RhÙne or Vacqueyras from southern France.  Chill your selection for a short while beforehand.

                Poultry                         Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     oven-ready turkey
                        = (select size to fit your grill)
  1         tablespoon  oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Herbs, rub, or seasoning -- to taste

Rinse turkey and pat dry.  Turn wings back to hold neck skin in place.  Return legs to tucked position.  Brush turkey with oil.  Season to taste, inside and out.

Place turkey, breast-side up, in a roast holder set inside a large heavy-gauge foil pan.  Place in center of cooking grate.

Comments:  One of our most sought-after recipes.  Grill just one turkey and youíll never go back to making it in the oven!

To collect drippings for making gravy, pour a little water into foil pan.  Replenish water as needed to keep drippings from burning.  Remove pan from under turkey about 30 minutes before bird should be done and make gravy.  (Continue cooking turkey in the center of the cooking grate).

                Coffee-And-Pepper-Crusted New York Steaks

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  whole coffee beans
  2        tablespoons  whole black peppercorns
  4                     New York strip steaks -- 1" thk - (3/4 lb ea)
                        Vegetable oil spray -- for spraying steaks
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

Coarsely grind the coffee beans and peppercorns in a food processor or coffee grinder.  Press the mixture evenly on both sides of the steaks.  Spray steaks lightly with oil then grill the steaks over Direct High heat for 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time, or until desired doneness.

Remove the steaks from the grill.  Season both sides with salt.  Allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Try a rich, mellow red with lots of fruit and very little tannin; a young California Merlot or Zinfandel, or a fully mature Cabernet Sauvignon from a top vintage.

Comments:  In this unusual recipe, the piquancy of peppercorns meets the mellowness of coffee beans with stellar results.  Turn the steaks when you see beads of juice on the surface.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               ears  sweet corn in husks -- trimmed of silk,
                        and soaked in water for 30 minutes
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onion

                   Corned Beef And Cabbage On The Grill

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  corned beef with spice packet
  1                     celery stalk -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1/2" diagonal slices
  1                     carrot -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" diagonal slices
  1              small  yellow onion -- cut thin wedges
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed with the
                        side of a knife
  1                can  Italian plum tomatoes in juices - (28 oz)
     1/2          head  green cabbage - (abt 1 lb) -- cut 4 wedges,
                        cores slightly trimmed
  10             small  red potatoes -- cut in half
  2          teaspoons  whole-grain mustard

Unwrap the corned beef and pat dry with paper towels.

Arrange the celery, carrot, onion, and garlic in a 13- by 9-inch roasting pan.  Place the corned beef on top of the vegetables.  Sprinkle the contents of the spice packet over the corned beef and rub into the surface of the meat.  Add the tomatoes; fill the empty tomato can with water and add to the pan.  With kitchen shears cut the tomatoes into 1-inch chunks.

Cover the pan tightly with heavy-duty foil and grill over Indirect Medium heat for 2 hours.  Remove the pan from the grill.  Add the cabbage wedges and potatoes around the corned beef and spoon the cooking juices on top.  Cover the pan with foil and continue grilling over Indirect Medium heat until the corned beef, potatoes, and cabbage are tender, about 1 hour more.

Transfer the corned beef to a cutting board and spread the mustard on top.  Let stand 5 minutes before carving meat across the grain into 1/2-inch slices.  Serve corned beef slices with the cabbage and potatoes, with juices spooned over all, along with grilled rye bread, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Slowly simmering dishes like this develop a complexity that calls for a rich, round wine like Merlot or Syrah.

Beer Recommendation:  For an Irish traditionalist, thereís only one choice; Guinness stout!

Comments:  The term "corned" refers to the curing of the meat with salt.  Legend has it that when the recipe was first developed as a means of preserving beef brisket, the grains of salt were as large as kernels of corn.  Hence the name.  Long after refrigeration has made curing unnecessary (and salt shrunk), this recipe endures purely for the sake of good taste.

Unwrap the corned beef and pat dry with paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the celery, carrot, onion, and garlic in a 13- by 9-inch roasting pan.  Place the corned beef on top of the vegetables.  Sprinkle the contents of the spice packet over the corned beef and rub into the surface of the meat.  Add the tomatoes; fill the empty tomato can with water and add to the pan.  With kitchen shears cut the tomatoes into 1-inch chunks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cover the pan tightly with heavy-duty foil and grill over Indirect Medium heat for 2 hours.  Remove the pan from the grill.  Add the cabbage wedges and potatoes around the corned beef and spoon the cooking juices on top.  Cover the pan with foil and continue grilling over Indirect Medium heat until the corned beef, potatoes, and cabbage are tender, about 1 hour more.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the corned beef to a cutting board and spread the mustard on top.  Let stand 5 minutes before carving meat across the grain into 1/2-inch slices.  Serve corned beef slices with the cabbage and potatoes, with juices spooned over all, along with grilled rye bread, if desired.

Wine Recommendation:  Slowly simmering dishes like this develop a complexity that calls for a rich, round wine like Merlot or Syrah.

                           Crown Roast Of Pork

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === THE RUB ===
  10                    garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh sage leaves
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === THE ROAST ===
  1                     crown roast of pork - (7 to 8 lbs) -- tied in a circle

To make The Rub:  Press the garlic cloves through a garlic press into a small bowl.  Add the rosemary, sage, salt, and pepper and blend with a fork.

Spread the rub all over the roast and in the crevices.  Let stand at room temperature one hour before grilling.

Grill the roast, over Indirect High heat for 30 minutes.  Then, reduce the grill temperature and continue grilling over Indirect Medium heat until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees, about 2 1/2 hours longer.  Remove from the grill, lightly cover with foil and let rest 20 minutes before carving.

Cut and remove string from the roast and slice the roast between the rib bones.  Serve with grilled seasonal vegetables.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The secret to this herb-crusted roast is a good searing to start with.  Then itís slowly roasted to perfection.  Be sure to cover and rest the meat so it reaches a safe finished temperature of 160 degrees.

                             Curried Lobster

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Madras curry powder
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped red finger chile pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     frozen lobster tails - (6 to 8 oz ea) -- thawed, cleaned
     1/4           cup  lime juice
                        = (juice of 2 limes)

In a small saucepan melt butter.  Add curry powder and chile pepper; heat for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add salt and pepper to taste.

Rinse lobster tails and pat dry.  Turn lobster tails shell-side down.  To expose meat, cut lengthwise through bottom shell with kitchen shears or sharp knife.  Bend tail along cut to crack open shell a little wider.  (You can also cut bottom shell lengthwise along each side and remove.)  Sprinkle 1/2 tablespoon lime juice on meaty portion of each lobster tail.  Spread 1 tablespoon of butter mixture on each lobster tail.  Reserve remaining butter mixture.

Place lobster tails shell-side down on center of cooking grate.  Grill 8 to 10 minutes or until meat is opaque.  Serve with remaining butter mixture, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A Chardonnay from the Carneros area of California, with accents of pineapple and melon, will counterbalance the spicy curry and chile pepper.

Beer Recommendation:  Just about any cold lager will do this lobster justice, but if you really want a treat, try a crisp hard cider.

Comments:  A decadent foray into the sweet and zesty, this lobster recipe is excellent for parties.

Madras curry powder is a sweeter blend than standard curry powder, sometimes available in the spice section of the grocery store.  If you can't find Madras curry powder at your local grocer's, add a pinch of sugar with the regular curry powder.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Breads/Rolls
                Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  self-rising flour
  1 1/4           cups  milk
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing dough
                        Butter -- for serving
                        Jam or marmalade -- for serving

In a large bowl or food processor bowl combine flour and milk.  Mix to make a stiff dough, kneading and adding more flour if necessary.

Form dough, 2 tablespoons at a time, into balls.  On a lightly floured surface, roll balls into 2 1/2-inch "sausage" shapes.  Lightly oil skewers; push single skewers lengthwise through the shaped dough.

Lightly oil dough on skewers and place in center of cooking grate.  Grill 10 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally.  Serve warm with butter and jam.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Grill these Australian rolls the traditional way, on hickory or maple twigs.  Camping?  Reconstituted powdered milk works great, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  crushed Szechwan peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  hot chili oil
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
                        = (or 2 tbspns chopped fresh parsley)
  1 1/2         pounds  raw medium shrimp - (abt 45 to 60) -- peeled, deveined
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  angel hair or vermicelli pasta -- cooked
     1/3           cup  grated Romano or Parmesan cheese

In small saucepan, combine butter, garlic, peppercorns, and chili oil; simmer over low heat until butter is melted and garlic begins to sizzle.  Remove from heat; stir in cilantro.

Thread shrimp on four or five skewers.  Brush with olive oil.  Place shrimp in center of cooking grate.  Grill 4 to 5 minutes until pink and just opaque, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Do not overcook.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Remove shrimp from skewers; toss with butter mixture, hot pasta, and cheese.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Which grape can quench the fire of this sauce and yet cradle the tender shrimp flavor?  Sauvignon Blanc to the rescue!

Beer Recommendation:  A Mexican lager is well-versed in handling fiery spices and simple shellfish, and really comes alive when the food is grilled.  Ole!

Comments:  A quick and delicious recipe to toss together on busy week nights.

Note:  If using wooden skewers, soak in water thirty minutes before using so ends won't burn during grilling time.

                    Fire-Roasted Tomato And Bread Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Soups/Stews
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  chicken broth
  2             slices  day-old Italian bread, 1/2" thick
     1/2         small  red bell pepper -- cored, seeded
  25                    plum tomatoes -- halved, cored,
                        and seeded
  1             medium  onion -- peeled, and
                        cut in 1/2" slices
                        Olive oil -- as needed
     1/4           cup  basil leaves
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a large stockpot, add the chicken broth and bread, and set aside for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables:  Flatten the pepper half with the palm of your hand.  Brush the pepper half, tomato halves, and onion slices with oil.  Grill the vegetables over Direct High heat until lightly charred, 6 to 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from grill.

When tomatoes and pepper are cool enough to handle, remove their skins.  Rough chop all the grilled vegetables.

Add the grilled vegetables and the rest of the ingredients to the pot and simmer over low heat for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Serve with crusty Italian bread or baguette.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  This hearty peasant-style dish calls for an earthy red.  We love a young Chianti Classico or Chianti Rufina with this; nothing fancy, just a wonderful heart-warmer that will bring a smile of satisfaction with every sip.

Comments:  Healthful, soothing, and oh so easy to make.  The perfect bowl of comfort!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HERB PASTE ===
     1/4           cup  parsley - (tightly packed)
     1/4           cup  cilantro - (tightly packed)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  onion powder

     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  olive oil

           Garlic Bread With Ripe Tomatoes And Manchego Cheese

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  freshly-made bread, 3/4"-thk and 2" dia
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled
  8             slices  Manchego or Parmesan cheese, paper thin
  2                     ripe tomatoes -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh basil

Brush or spray the bread on both sides with the olive oil.  Grill the bread on one side over Direct Low heat until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer the bread to a work a surface with the toasted sides facing up.

Rub the toasted sides vigorously with a garlic clove.  Place a slice of cheese on top of each and return to the grill over Direct Low heat until the cheese melts slightly, 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer the bread to a plate.

In a small bowl toss the chopped tomatoes with olive oil, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste.  Top toasted bread with the tomato mixture and garnish with basil.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A tangy fino sherry from Spain is right at home here.

Beer Recommendation:  Crack open a nutty brown ale.

Comments:  In Catalonia, a coastal region near Barcelona, Spain, these simple but sensational tapas (or bar snacks) are called pan con tomate.  When tomatoes are in season, this is among the most popular ways to savor them.  If you like, add some chopped anchovy fillets to the topping or serve Serrano ham on the side.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  prawns -- peeled, deveined
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/3           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  tomato sauce
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon
                        = (or 2 tspns dried tarragon)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  butter - (2 sticks) -- divided
     1/3           cup  dry white wine

Add cream, tomato, and paprika; cook over medium heat until mixture is reduced and slightly thickened.  Add remaining butter; stir until melted.  Remove from heat and cover to keep warm.

Remove prawns from marinade; discard marinade.

Place prawns on cooking grate.  Grill 6 to 8 minutes or until prawns turn pink and are opaque in thickest part (cut to test), turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve with warm sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Succulent, garlicky prawns swimming in a velvety cream sauce make a dinner so special, you should go ahead and pour the champagne.

                      Ginger And Port Lamb Rib Chops

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     lamb rib chops, 1" thick -- trimmed
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  chicken broth
     1/3           cup  tomato paste
     1/3           cup  catsup
     1/4           cup  finely-diced onion
     1/4           cup  finely-diced celery
     1/4           cup  port wine
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  grated fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  steak sauce
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2    tablespoon  chili powder
     1/2    tablespoon  dry mustard
     1/2    tablespoon  brown sugar - (packed)

In a saucepan combine all sauce ingredients.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 1 hour or until sauce is slightly thickened, stirring occasionally.  Process in a blender or food processor until smooth.  Chill in refrigerator until ready to use or up to 3 weeks.

Brush each rib chop on both sides with about 1 tablespoon sauce.  Place chops in center of cooking grate.  Grill 7 to 9 minutes for rare (140 degrees), 10 to 13 minutes for medium (160 degrees), or 14 to 17 minutes for well-done (170 degrees), turning and brushing with more sauce halfway through grilling time.  Serve with heated remaining sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A medium-bodied red from Pauillac, France, will form a fast alliance with the seductively seasoned lamb.

Beer Recommendation:  For a chop made with a fortified wine, a winelike ale; a cherry Lambic from Belgium.  You'll be oh so pleasantly surprised.

Comments:  Use either dark or light port wine for this delicious recipe.  Serve with grilled green onions and a wild rice pilaf for an elegant meal.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Granny Smith apples -- unpeeled, halved,
                        and cored
  1                     celery rib -- diced
  1              small  onion -- diced
  1              small  carrot -- diced
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick)
  1              quart  apple cider
  1                can  pumpkin - (15 oz)
  1              quart  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground allspice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place apple halves cut-side down on cooking grate.  Grill about 10 to 15 minutes until browned and skins pop slightly off and are easily removed, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Let cool, remove skins, and chop into large pieces.

In a large saucepan, sautÈ celery, onions, and carrots in butter for 10 minutes or until onion is translucent.  Add apples and cider.  Simmer 5 to 10 minutes, until vegetables are soft.  Stir in pumpkin and cream.  Return to a simmer.  Stir in nutmeg and allspice.

Using a hand blender, purÈe until smooth (or strain solids, place in a blender, purÈe, and add back to liquid).  Heat through.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Wine Recommendtion:  The obvious choice may not be so obvious; an apple wine.  German gourmands have known this secret for years -- shouldnít you?

Beer Recommendation:  A special soup deserves a special beer; try a heather ale from Scotland.  The sweet, floral scent is a natural match for the appleís perfume.

Comments:  This hot, velvety bisque makes a wonderfully warming welcome in cold weather.

  2                     shallots -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- roughly chopped
  2             pounds  frozen chopped spinach -- well drained
  1               pint  heavy cream
  1               pint  sour cream
  1                cup  grated Parmesan cheese -- plus
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese -- divided
                        === PITA WEDGES ===

To make the Pita Wedges:  Brush pita rounds with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill briefly over Direct heat to warm, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Cut into wedges.

Garnish the dip with sour cream and chopped fresh tomato, if desired.  Serve with the pita wedges.

                Grilled Artichokes With Garlic Mayonnaise

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             medium  artichokes
                        === GARLIC MAYONNAISE ===
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2        tablespoons  orange juice - (to 3)
  1              pinch  salt
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon
                        Juice of 2 lemons
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

To make the Garlic Mayonnaise:  In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, garlic, orange juice, and salt.  Refrigerate until needed.

To make the Marinade:  In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, tarragon, lemon juice, and salt.  Set aside.

Trim bottom outer leaves from artichokes and cut off any spiny leaf tips with kitchen sheers.  Peel stems.  Cut artichokes in half and with a small, sharp knife, scoop out and discard the hairy chokes.  Add artichoke halves to the large bowl and toss with the olive oil mixture to prevent discoloration.  Marinate in olive oil mixture at room temperature for 1 hour.  Remove from bowl; reserve marinade.

Place artichoke halves in center of cooking grate.  Grill until tender, about 20 to 25 minutes, basting frequently with reserved olive oil marinade.

Serve grilled artichokes with any remaining marinade and garlic mayonnaise.

This recipe yields 5 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  While artichokes take to the grill, theyíre no friend of the grape because a chemical in them makes wine taste bitter or flat.  Enjoy your wine with the next course instead!

Beer Recommendation:  Try a light, clean, uncomplicated Pilsener to cleanse and refresh the palate.  Treat yourself to the real deal from the Bohemian city of Pilsn, or check out some of the new Pilseners made in America.

Comments:  Grilled artichokes are wonderful -- and especially tasty snuggled in this garlicky sauce.  Select artichokes that are deep green, relatively heavy, and with tightly closed leaves.

                          Grilled Asparagus Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Soups/Stews
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  asparagus spears -- tough ends removed
  6                     green onions - (to 8) -- root ends trimmed
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4               cups  chicken broth
  2               cups  baby spinach leaves - (tighly packed)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh tarragon
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

Place the asparagus and green onions in a large bowl and coat with the olive oil.  Grill the asparagus and green onions over Direct Medium heat until they are marked by the grill but not dark, 4 to 6 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Transfer them to a cutting board and cut them into 2-inch lengths and place them in a medium saucepan.

Add the chicken broth, spinach, and pepper to the saucepan.  Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then simmer for 4 to 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables to a food processor and puree them.  Return the pureed vegetables to the saucepan and mix well.  Whisk in the cream and tarragon.  Simmer the soup for 3 to 5 minutes, but do not let it boil.  Season with salt to taste.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Many Sauvignon Blancs from Napa Valley have captivating, herbaceous flavors, making them a superb match for this vegetable puree.

Beer Recommendation:  A clean-tasting pilsner with the subtle aroma of hops is another excellent choice.

Comments:  Here a touch of smokiness from the grill creates an intriguing backdrop for the asparagus' brilliant, deep flavor.  This soup, finished with a touch of cream and a showering of fresh tarragon, makes an elegant first course from one of our favorite springtime vegetables.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CURRY SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2          teaspoons  minced lemongrass
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  curry powder
  1                can  coconut milk - (14 oz)
  1         tablespoon  ground coriander
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  fish sauce
  1           teaspoon  lime juice
  1           teaspoon  tamarind paste
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2                     whole cloves
                        === FOR THE SHRIMP ===
  20                    colossal shrimp - (abt 2 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing shrimp
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped basil
                        Cilantro sprigs

To make Curry Sauce:  Heat oil in medium saucepan over high heat.  Add shallots, lemongrass, and garlic; sautÈ for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add curry powder and sautÈ for 2 minutes longer.  Add coconut milk, coriander, sugar, fish sauce, lime juice, tamarind paste, salt, and cloves.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes or until thickened.  Reserve.

Season shrimp with salt and pepper.  Lightly brush shrimp with oil and place in center of cooking grate.  Grill 4 to 8 minutes until shrimp turn pink and opaque in thickest part, turning once halfway through grilling time.

To serve, spoon some sauce on serving platter.  Arrange shrimp on sauce and sprinkle with the basil and cilantro.  Serve with remaining sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  You don't find many grapevines where curry is prevalent, so you'll need a really round and flexible white here; try a Pinot Blanc with mature fruit and full body.

Beer Recommendation:  This sweet and spicy kaleidoscope of flavors is best supported by a clean, light Pilsener.

Comments:  Shrimp swimming in sweet coconut milk spiked with curry?  Better not get between this dish and your dinner guests!

                       Grilled Cumin-Scallop Salad

                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1 1/2    tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground cumin seeds
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  sea scallops
  4                     green onions -- trimmed, chopped
  1              large  tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1               head  Bibb lettuce - (abt 1/4 lb)

In a medium bowl combine 6 tablespoons of the oil, vinegar, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste.  Cover and store in refrigerator until chilled.

Thread scallops on skewers; brush with remaining 2 tablespoons oil.  Place skewers in center of cooking grate.  Grill 6 to 8 minutes or until scallops are opaque, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Remove scallops from skewers; allow to cool.  Add scallops, green onions, and tomato to chilled dressing; toss well.  Serve on a bed of Bibb lettuce on individual plates.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A light and refreshing seafood salad to revive you after a long day in the sun -- or better yet, prepare this seaside on a portable grill.

Note:  If using wooden skewers, soak in water thirty minutes before using so ends won't burn during grilling time.

                    Grilled Lamb Kabobs - {Schaschlik}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  green bell peppers -- cut 1" pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless lamb leg -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  1             medium  onion -- cut 1" pieces
  4             slices  bacon -- each cut 4 pieces
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  lemon juice
                        = (juice of 1 large lemon)
  2        tablespoons  cognac
  1           teaspoon  catsup
  1                     garlic clove
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1              pinch  ground cayenne pepper
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing kabobs

In a medium saucepan place peppers in boiling water.  Return water to a boil.  Remove peppers from water; drain.

Sprinkle salt and pepper on lamb cubes.  On eight 10-inch skewers alternately thread meat, pepper, and onion pieces.  Thread bacon pieces on both ends of each skewer.  Set aside.

In a blender or food processor purÈe oil, onion, lemon juice, cognac, catsup, garlic, mustard, oregano, thyme, and cayenne pepper until smooth.

Lightly oil kabobs and place in center of cooking grate.  Grill 7 to 9 minutes for rare (140 degrees), 10 to 13 minutes for medium (160 degrees), or 14 to 17 minutes for medium-well (170 degrees), turning once halfway through grilling time.  Brush kabobs with purÈe occasionally during last half of grilling time.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon bursting with ripe plum and currant flavors will do these kabobs justice.

Beer Recommendation:  A good chance to try a rare smoked beer -- or you'd also be happy with a malty copper-colored ale.

Comments:  Serve hot on a bed of Spaetzle (thick egg noodles), with hard rolls and a green tossed salad.

If using wooden skewers, soak in water thirty minutes before using so ends won't burn during grilling time.

                           Grilled Pizza Bread

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Breads/Rolls
                Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SEASONED OIL===
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  ground Mediterranean oregano
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  finely ground red pepper flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        === BREAD ===
                        Flour -- for dusting
  3                     one-pound balls of pizza dough
                        Chopped tomatoes -- (optional)
                        Chopped onions -- (optional)
                        Chopped fresh basil -- (optional)

To make the Seasoning:  In a small saucepan combine all the seasoning ingredients.  Whisk over low heat just until warm and oil becomes fragrant.  Remove from heat and let rest for 2 hours at room temperature.

Lightly flour the back of a 15- by 10-inch baking sheet and one of the pizza dough balls.  Stretch out the dough to the size of the baking sheet.  Place the stretched dough on the back of the baking sheet.

Stir the Seasoned Oil and liberally brush the surface of the dough.

Turn the baking sheet (like a big spatula!) with the dough directly onto the cooking grate.  Remove the baking sheet and liberally brush the top side of the dough with the seasoned oil.  Grill over Direct Medium heat until the underside of the dough is marked, 1 to 3 minutes.  Don't worry if the crust bubbles; it will deflate when turned over.  Slide the dough onto the baking sheet and flip the ungrilled side onto the grill.  Brush the top with more oil and continue to grill for 3 to 4 minutes.

Remove from grill and cool slightly on a cooling rack.  Top with chopped tomatoes, chopped onions, and fresh basil, if desired.  Cut into individual pieces.  Repeat grilling procedure for 2 remaining balls of dough.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 12 to 15 servings.

Comments:  Frozen dough works well for this recipe, or ask your favorite pizzeria for dough.  If youíre not in a hurry, you can even make your own dough.  Stretching it instead of rolling it makes it nicely uneven, creating crispy and chewy textures.

Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  plain low-fat yogurt
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  ground anise
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     eight-rib lamb roasts - (2 1/2 to 3 lbs ea
                        Mint jelly -- (optional)

Combine yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, anise, and pepper to make marinade.  Reserve 1/4 cup marinade; cover and refrigerate.  Trim fat from roast to expose 1 to 1 1/2 inches of bones (or ask your butcher to trim the fat).  Place lamb in a shallow non-metal dish.  Coat lamb with remaining marinade.  Cover and marinate 4 hours or overnight in refrigerator.

Drain lamb, discarding marinade.  With meaty sides out, tilt roasts and cross ribs so they interlock.  Place lamb in center of cooking grate.  Cook 50 to 60 minutes for medium rare (150 degrees), 60 to 70 minutes for medium (160 degrees).  Brush with reserved marinade during the last 10 to 15 minutes of cooking time.  Serve with mint jelly, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Yogurt is the tenderizing secret to this succulent version of classic grilled fare.

Cut the bread on the bias into 1/3-inch slices.  Lightly brush or spray both sides of the slices with olive oil.  Grill the slices over Direct Medium heat until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Spoon the topping on the toasted slices of bread, along with sliced tomatoes and lettuce, if desired.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 15 to 20 pieces.

Wine Recommendation:  A rosÈ of MourvËdre or Grenache is always good with tuna.

Beer Recommendation:  Look for a lager with a clean, light style.

Comments:  Albacore tuna has a firm, even texture that couldn't be simpler to grill.  Its pale pink color is lighter than the dark red flesh of yellowfin tuna, and the flavor is lighter, too, which makes it just right for this chopped seafood salad served on slices of grilled bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  fresh oyster mushrooms
  8             ounces  fresh portabello mushrooms -- stems removed
  8             ounces  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5             ounces  fresh spinach leaves
  1                cup  heavy cream
  5                     sheets phyllo dough
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- melted

Brush mushrooms clean with a damp paper towel.  Brush with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Place the mushrooms over Direct Medium heat and grill 10 to 15 minutes or until tender.  Let cool; discard base of oyster mushrooms just where stems attach to each other.  Chop mushrooms roughly.  Place in a strainer and allow any excess moisture to drain away.

In skillet, sautÈ spinach in olive oil until wilted.  Add cream and simmer until reduced by half, about 12 minutes.  Stir in mushrooms.

On waxed paper lay one sheet of phyllo dough.  Brush phyllo with butter and cover with second sheet.  Brush second sheet with butter.  Continue layering and brushing sheets until all five are buttered.

Place mushroom mixture on the long edge of the phyllo dough and roll toward the other edge.  Fold over edges to seal.  Place on an insulated baking sheet, seam-side down.  Place in center of cooking grate and cook over Indirect Medium heat 15 to 20 minutes or until nicely browned on top.  Cut into 2-inch pieces.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A California Pinot Noir will caress the creamy mushrooms.  Splurge on a special reserve.

Beer Recommendation:  An India Pale Ale will be hoppy enough to do homage to the earthy mushrooms and dry enough to cut the richness of the butter.

Comments:  Tantalize your dinner guests with this flaky, buttery appetizer chock full of earthy mushrooms and healthy spinach.

         Herbed Lamb Kabobs With Toasted Couscous And Vegetables

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh mint
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === VEGETABLES ===
  1                     red or yellow bell pepper -- quartered, cored,
                        and seeded
     1/2         pound  baby zucchini -- trimmed, and
                        halved lengthwise
  1              pound  asparagus
                        === LAMB ===
  1                     boneless leg of lamb - (abt 2 lbs)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        === COUSCOUS ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  couscous
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  toasted pine nuts

To make the Marinade:  In a small bowl whisk together the marinade ingredients along with pepper to taste.

Arrange the vegetables on a plate and brush all sides with some of the marinade.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to grill.

Trim the leg of lamb of any excess fat and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces.  Place the lamb pieces in a large, resealable plastic bag and pour in the remaining marinade.  Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly.  Turn the bag several times to distribute the marinade, place the bag in a bowl, and refrigerate for 2 to 8 hours, turning occasionally.

To make the Couscous:  In a medium saucepan over low heat warm the oil and cook the garlic until it sizzles.  Stir in the couscous.  Cook, stirring over low heat until the couscous begins to turn golden, about 5 minutes.  Add 1 3/4 cup of water and the salt and heat to boiling.  Stir once.  Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, 10 minutes or until all the liquid is absorbed.  Sprinkle with the pine nuts.

Remove the lamb pieces from the bag and discard the marinade.  Thread the lamb pieces on skewers.  Grill the skewers and vegetables over Direct Medium heat until the meat is medium-rare and the vegetables are cooked through, about 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve the lamb kabobs warm with the toasted couscous and vegetables.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A bold red wine from the RhÙne Valley -- a Condrieu, for example -- is a smashing success here.

Beer Recommendation:  Grilled lamb loves a nutty, smooth pale ale.

Comments:  By cutting a relatively tender cut of meat such as a leg of lamb into small pieces, you can quickly grill it to medium rare or whatever temperature you like.  Leave a little space between the pieces so that the heat can get to all sides.

                   Hot, Sweet, And Sticky Chicken Wings

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Chicken
                Grilling                        Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  4          teaspoons  granulated garlic
  4          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  3          teaspoons  Tabasco sauce
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  paprika
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
                        === THE WINGS ===
  20                    chicken wings -- wing tips removed
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed

To make the Marinade:  In a medium bowl whisk together the marinade ingredients.

Rinse the chicken wings under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Place in a large, resealable plastic bag and pour in the marinade.  Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly.  Turn the bag to distribute the marinade, place in a bowl, and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours, turning occasionally.

Remove the wings from the bag and discard the marinade.  Lightly brush or spray the wings with olive oil.  Sear over Direct Medium heat until well marked, 4 to 6 minutes, turning once halfway through searing time.  Continue grilling over Indirect Medium heat until the meat is no longer pink at the bone, 8 to 10 minutes.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  This fun dish incorporates the spirit of backyard grilling -- simple finger foods whose flavors are kicked up by searing heat, sweetness, and spice -- so it needs an elegant counterpoint.  Refresh that spirit and cleanse your palate with the bubbles of a sparkling Cava from Spain.

Beer Recommendation:  India Pale Ale, with its hoppy bitterness, is just the contrast you need to both cleanse the palate and unify the complex and competing flavors of this dish.  Cheers!

Comments:  The perfect snack to whet that picnic appetite, this one covers all the taste bud zones.

                 Lamb Sandwiches With Middle Eastern Slaw

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/3           cup  tahini
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh mint
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground paprika
                        === SLAW AND LAMB ===
  3               cups  thinly-sliced or coarsely-shredded
                        green cabbage
  1                cup  coarsely-grated carrots
  3                     lamb blade chops, 3/4" thk - (abt 8 oz ea) -- trimmed of fat
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     pita pockets -- for serving

To make the Dressing:  In a medium bowl whisk together the dressing ingredients along with 1/4 cup of water to make a smooth dressing.

In a large bowl, mix together the cabbage and carrots, and pour the dressing over the top.  Mix well.  Set aside for 20 to 30 minutes.

Lightly brush or spray both sides of the lamb chops with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Grill the lamb chops over Direct Medium heat until medium-rare, 10 to 12 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Transfer the lamb chops to a cutting board.  Cut the meat off the bones, and chop or shred it into small pieces.  Add the lamb to the slaw.

Open the pita pockets and fill them with the lamb mixture.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A spicy American Zinfandel stands up well to this casual meal.

Beer Recommendation:  Sip on a cold pale ale for good refreshment.

Comments:  The idea here is to chop or shred the grilled lamb into pieces small enough that they blend into the cabbage-and-carrot slaw.  Then flavor the slaw with a luscious tahini dressing made with lemon juice, garlic, and exotic seasonings before piling it into pita pockets.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                can  apricot halves - (15 oz)
  2        tablespoons  oil
  4                     green onions -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  flour
  4          teaspoons  Madras curry powder
     1/2           cup  oyster liquor
                        = (natural oyster juices)
     1/2           cup  water
     1/3           cup  light cream
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped dry-roasted cashews
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === KABOBS ===
  12                    thin slices bacon -- cut in half
  24                    shucked oysters

To make sauce, strain apricot halves, reserving syrup.  Finely cube apricots; set aside.

Heat oil in saucepan; add green onions and sautÈ 2 minutes.  Add flour and curry powder; cook 2 minutes.  Add reserved apricot syrup, oyster liquor, water, and light cream.  Simmer 18 minutes.  Add cubed apricots and cashews; simmer 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.  Stir in salt and pepper.

In large skillet partially cook halved bacon slices for 2 minutes.  Drain and cool.  Wrap each oyster with one half-slice of bacon.  Place wrapped oysters on six 12-inch skewers.  Place skewers in center of cooking grate.  Grill 6 to 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Serve kabobs with sauce for dipping.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Spare yourself some work and buy fresh shucked oysters the day you make this dish.  Be sure to reserve the natural juices (oyster liquor) for the sauce.

Madras curry powder is a sweeter blend than standard curry powder, sometimes available in the spice section of the grocery store.  If you canít find Madras curry powder at your local grocerís, add a pinch of sugar with the regular curry powder.

If using wooden skewers, soak in water thirty minutes before using so ends wonít burn during grilling time.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Madras curry powder is a sweeter blend than standard curry powder, sometimes available in the spice section of the grocery store.  If you canít find Madras curry powder at your local grocerís, add a pinch of sugar with the regular curry powder.

If using wooden skewers, soak in water thirty minutes before using so ends wonít burn during grilling time.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CORIANDER VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3                     shallots -- finely diced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  6        tablespoons  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2          teaspoons  ground coriander seeds
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === KABOBS ===
  1              small  eggplant - (abt 6 oz) -- cut 1" cubes
                        Salt -- for eggplant
  1              pound  lamb (from the leg) -- cut 2" cubes
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-crushed pink peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-crushed black peppercorns
  4             slices  lean bacon - (to 5) -- halved crosswise
  3                     tomatillos -- seeded, quartered
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     wooden skewers - (12" long) -- soaked in water
                        for 30 minutes
                        Oil -- for brushing skewers

To make the Vinaigrette:  In a medium sautÈ pan, heat oil.  SautÈ shallots and garlic in oil for 1 minute.  Add chicken broth, balsamic vinegar, coriander, parsley, thyme, and rosemary.  Mix well.  Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste and set aside for 1 hour to blend flavors.

To make the Kabobs:  Lightly salt cubed eggplant and place in a colander set over a plate.  Set aside for 1 hour to draw out the bitter juices.  Rinse well and place on paper towels to dry.

In a medium bowl, toss cubed lamb with crushed peppercorns.  Wrap each bacon strip around one or two cubes of eggplant until all the eggplant and bacon is used.  Skewer kabobs by alternating crusted lamb, eggplant with bacon, then tomatillos.

Brush skewers lightly with oil and place in center of cooking grate.  Grill for 6 minutes or until bacon is fully cooked, turning every 1 1/2 minutes during cooking time.

Meanwhile, warm vinaigrette over low heat.  Place kabobs on a platter, drizzle with warm vinaigrette, and serve with rice pilaf.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Say "OlÈ!" to a young red from Spain's Ribera del Duero region, made from 100% Tempranillo grapes.

Beer Recommendation:  An English Brown Ale is the ticket to peppery happiness with these kabobs.

Comments:  An invigorating spectrum of flavors tantalize all the senses in this special kabob recipe.  A warm coriander vinaigrette pulls it all together deliciously.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STUFFING ===
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
     1/2      teaspoon  dried marjoram
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  cider vinegar
  8             ounces  ground pork
                        === MUSHROOMS ===
  12                    portobella mushroom caps - (abt 2" dia ea) -- stemmed
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly- ground black pepper
                        Olive oil -- for brushing
                        mushrooms

To make the Stuffing:  In a medium sautÈ pan over medium heat, cook the onion in the olive oil for 3 to 4 minutes or until the onions are tender.  Remove from stove and chill completely.

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the bread crumbs and the chicken broth.  Add the chilled onions, marjoram, cayenne, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder, vinegar, and ground pork.  Mix well.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

To make the Mushrooms:  Use a spoon to scrape the black gills out of each mushroom.  Season the mushrooms with the salt and pepper.  Lightly brush the outside of the mushrooms with olive oil.

Divide the pork mixture into 12 equal portions and press one portion into each mushroom.  Place mushrooms stuffing-side up directly over low heat and grill for 15 to 17 minutes.  Serve with fresh tomato sauce or corn relish.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  This play on the New Orleans PoíBoy creates a fine balance of earthy, meaty flavors with a bit of sassy spice.  Try a Dolcetto díAlba, a charming medium-bodied, fruity red from Italyís Piemonte region to bring out the flavors and put out the fire.

Beer Recommendation:  To bring out the smoky goodness of this dish, go for a Smoked Beer, which is going to elevate the portobella from the earth to the smoke-filled heavens.  And give that spicy pork a cigar!

Comments:  A charming appetizer with kick.  This recipe can be doubled to feed a bigger crowd.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  24             large  shrimp - (abt 1 lb) -- peeled, deveined
  1           teaspoon  instant minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  dill weed

                        Nonstick cooking spray -- as needed

In a medium bowl place shrimp, garlic, dill, and tarragon; toss to coat.  Cut prosciutto slices in half lengthwise.  Wrap each shrimp in a half-slice of prosciutto.

Thread wrapped shrimp on skewers, leaving a little space between each piece.  Spray lightly with cooking spray.

Place skewers on center of cooking grate and grill for 5 to 6 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A brut rosÈ sparkling wine from Napa with a hint of strawberries would make the perfect counterpoint.

Comments:  Use Parma prosciutto for this dish -- itís less salty than domestic brands.

If using wooden skewers, soak in water 30 minutes before using so ends wonít burn during grilling.

     1/2           cup  fresh parsley - (lightly packed)
     1/2           cup  fresh rosemary - (lightly packed)
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === WHITE BEANS ===
  2               cans  cannelloni beans - (19 oz ea)
  1                cup  half-inch-diced tomatoes
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced black or green olives
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar

To make the Marinade: In a food processor combine the marinade ingredients. Process until pureed and then pour into a large bowl.

Add the lamb to the marinade, turn to coat, cover, and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours.

Remove the lamb from the bowl and reserve the marinade.  Pour the marinade into a small saucepan, bring to a boil, and boil for one full minute.  Remove from heat and reserve.

Roll and tie the leg of lamb.  Skewer the leg of lamb lengthwise and then center on the spit.  Set the spit on the rotisserie and let the lamb rotate over Indirect Medium heat until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees for medium-rare, about 1 1/2 hours, basting the lamb with the reserved marinade every 20 minutes.  Turn off the rotisserie.

Wearing barbecue mitts, carefully remove the spit from the rotisserie and transfer it to a cutting board.  Remove the spit and let the lamb rest for 20 minutes before slicing.

Meanwhile, make the White Beans:  Drain the beans and transfer them to a medium saucepan.  Warm the beans over medium heat until heated through.  Add the remaining white bean ingredients and mix well.  Taste for seasonings.  Serve the white bean salad at room temperature with the sliced lamb.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Hearty Syrahs from France and California are made for meals like this.

Beer Recommendation:  A good American pale ale has enough vigor and earthiness to stand with the lamb.

Comments:  For the sake of even cooking, roll and tie the lamb in as symmetrical a cylinder as possible.  The ends will always be a little more cooked than the center, but then guests can choose the doneness they prefer.

                           Roasted Pumpkin Soup

Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pumpkin - (abt 3 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2           cup  minced onions
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Nutmeg -- (optional)

Cut top off pumpkin.  With a large metal spoon, scrape seeds and stringy fibers from interior.  Replace top and place in center of cooking grate.  Grill until pumpkin flesh is very soft, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Remove from grill and allow to cool.  Scoop out the pulp with a spoon and reserve.

In a medium stockpot, melt the butter over low heat.  Sweat the onions in the butter for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the wine and simmer until completely reduced.  Add the pumpkin pulp and the chicken broth; stir well.  Bring to a simmer and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Stir in the salt and heavy cream and return to a simmer.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with nutmeg, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  The ideal match for this seasonal soup is a Riesling Sp‰tlese from Germanyís Mosel-Saar-Ruwer region.  Its delicate sweetness will bring out the pumpkin and its cleansing acidity will cut through the creaminess.

Beer Recommendation:  Try a domestic or imported pumpkin-infused lager, ale, or lambic.  Weíre partial to Ichabod Craneís Legendary Sleepy Hollow Ale from Woodstock Brewing in New York.

Comments:  This easy-to-make soup adds bright color and delicious fall flavor to any autumn or holiday feast.

                           Skewered Leg Of Lamb

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                jar  Dijon-style mustard - (8 oz)
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  dry red wine
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  dried rosemary -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  dried basil -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme -- crushed
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
  1                     boneless leg of lamb - (abt 4 lbs) -- butterflied

In a medium bowl, combine mustard, oil, wine, garlic, rosemary, basil, oregano, thyme, and pepper.

Remove fell (paper-thin, pinkish-red layer) from outer surface of meat.  Trim fat.  Place lamb in a shallow dish.  Spread lamb with mustard mixture.  Cover and marinate 4 hours or overnight in the refrigerator.

Remove lamb from marinade, reserving marinade.  Thread two 12-inch skewers through meat, criss-crossing diagonally.  Place lamb in center of cooking grate.  Grill 45 to 55 minutes for rare (or until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of meat registers 140 degrees), 55 to 65 minutes for medium (160 degrees), or 1 to 1 1/4 hours for medium-well (170 degrees).  Brush with reserved marinade during the last 10 minutes of grilling time.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  This flavorful and tenderizing marinade makes an ordinary leg of lamb melt-in-your-mouth perfect.

This juicy lamb makes extraordinary sandwiches for a crowd.  Split three one-pound loaves of French or sourdough bread lengthwise and spread softened butter on cut surfaces.  Place bread, cut-side down, on the outside edge of the grill for 1 to 2 minutes or just until lightly toasted.  Slice lamb and place on bottom halves of bread.  Replace tops and cut each loaf into 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  peppercorns
  3                     ripe plum tomatoes
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/2        medium  onion -- cut in half
     1/2           cup  fresh lime juice
  3        tablespoons  fresh orange juice
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2                     canned chipotle chiles - (to 4)
  1           teaspoon  chipotle can juices
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt
                        = (kosher or sea)

Heat the comal or dry skillet over medium heat.  Add the cumin and peppercorns and toast until fragrant, 2 minutes.  Transfer the spices to a blender or spice mill and grind to fine powder.  Leave the spices in the blender.

Place tomatoes, garlic, and onion on the comal and cook until nicely browned on all sides, turning with tongs.  This will take 4 to 6 minutes for the garlic, and 10 to 12 minutes for the tomatoes and onion.  Transfer the vegetables to the blender with the spices.

Add the lime and orange juice, the vinegar, chipotle chiles and can juices, the oregano, and salt.  Run the blender in bursts to reduce the ingredients to a thick puree.

Transfer to a jar, cover, and refrigerate.  The marinade will keep for several weeks.

This recipe yields 2 cups, enough to marinate 3 to 4 pounds of meat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BLINI ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  buckwheat flour
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  2 1/2           cups  warm milk -- (105 to 115 deg)
  3                     eggs -- separated
  3        tablespoons  melted butter
  3        tablespoons  sour cream
     1/2    tablespoon  salt
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing griddle
                        === SALMON BURGERS ===
  1 1/2         pounds  skinless salmon
     1/2         pound  skinless smoked salmon
  4        tablespoons  snipped chives
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  salt
                        Nonstick cooking spray -- for spraying patties
                        Dill mustard -- for serving

To make the Blini:  In a large bowl combine flours, yeast, and sugar.  Add milk and beat until batter is smooth.  Cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until double in size.

Add egg yolks, butter, sour cream, and salt; mix thoroughly.  In a small bowl beat egg whites until medium peaks form; fold into batter.

Heat lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.  Spoon 1 tablespoon batter onto hot griddle, making several blini at a time.  Cook until tops are bubbly and bubbles burst; turn and cook second side until golden.  Keep warm.

To make the Salmon Burgers:  Cut the fresh and smoked salmon into very small pieces.  In a blender or food processor, pulse together, in batches, about 10 to 15 seconds each, until blended.  Combine ground salmon, chives, lemon juice, olive oil, pepper, and salt; mix lightly.

Line a tray with waxed paper and spray lightly with cooking spray.  Shape salmon mixture into 32 two-inch diameter patties and place on waxed paper.  Spray tops of burgers with cooking spray.  Cover with waxed paper and place in refrigerator for 5 minutes.

Use a spatula to transfer and arrange patties carefully on cooking grate.  Grill 4 to 5 minutes for medium (160 degrees), turning once two-thirds through grilling time.

To make the appetizers, top each blini with a smoked salmon burger and a dollop of dill mustard.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Donít hold back; try a brut sparkling wine from Napa.  Youíll love what the golden bubbles do for the salmon.

Comments:  These unbelievably delicious appetizers are worth the extra effort.

For a quick additional appetizer, you can top any extra blini with sour cream and caviar or sour cream and fruit preserves.

           Smoked Tomato Sandwiches With Goat Cheese And Basil

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling
                Sandwiches                      Smoking


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  tomatoes -- peeled
  4             slices  Italian bread, 1/2" thick
                        Olive oil spray -- for spraying bread
  3        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  8              large  basil leaves -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8             slices  goat cheese, 1/4" thick

Prepare charcoal or gas grill or traditional smoker for Indirect smoking on Low Heat (follow instructions in ownerís manual).  Use one layer charcoal for smoker and place food on top grate.  For best results for this recipe, use hickory or mesquite wood chips or chunks.

Place tomatoes on cooking grate of fully smoking grill or smoker.  Smoke 1 1/2 hours over charcoal or 10 to 12 minutes over gas; remove.  Chill tomatoes in refrigerator.

Meanwhile, spray bread with olive oil.  Place bread oil-side down on cooking grate.  Grill Directly 2 to 3 minutes or until toasted; remove.

Spread toasted side of each bread slice with mayonnaise; sprinkle with equal amounts of basil.  Cut each tomato into 4 slices; place 2 tomato slices over basil on each bread slice.  Sprinkle tomatoes with salt and pepper.  Top each sandwich with 2 slices of goat cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Smoked tomatoes and California Zinfandel.  Enough said!

Beer Recommendation:  A smoked porter will bring out the fruitiness of the tomatoes while keeping the wonderful smoked flavor company.

Comments:  Take time to savor every bite of this extra-delicious sandwich made special with smoky overtones.

                        Spicy Popcorn On The Grill

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling
                Snacks

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unpopped popcorn
  2        tablespoons  oil
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  garlic salt
  3                     disposable foil pans - (8" by 5 1/4")
  1                     strip aluminum foil - (20" long) -- folded lengthwise
                        until 3" wide

Combine popcorn, oil, chili powder, and garlic salt in one disposable pan; mix well.  Place pan inside another pan to double thickness.  Invert third disposable pan over popcorn to close.  Wrap foil strip crosswise around pan; fold over to secure pans together and to form a handle.

Place pan in center of cooking grate.  Grill for 8 to 10 minutes or until popping stops.

This recipe yields 5 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Impress your friends with this wild way to pop corn.

To serve a crowd, multiple pans of popcorn can be popped at once on grill.  Also note that chili powder tends to darken with heat, which may give your popcorn an overcooked appearance but wonít affect taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SWEET NUT CRUNCH ===
  1                cup  raw unshelled pumpkin seeds
  1                cup  whole almonds
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        === SPICY NUTS ===
  1                cup  raw unshelled pumpkin seeds
  1                cup  whole almonds
  1                cup  roasted Spanish peanuts
  2          teaspoons  hot chili oil
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne

To make the Sweet Nut Crunch:  Spread the pumpkin seeds and almonds evenly in a 9- by 9-inch heavy-gauge foil pan.  Grill over Indirect Low heat, stirring occasionally, until the nuts are fragrant and lightly toasted, about 15 minutes.  Remove the pan from the grill.

In a small bowl combine the remaining sweet nut crunch ingredients and mix well.  Drizzle the mixture over the nuts and toss to coat evenly.  Return the pan to the grill and grill over Indirect Low heat for 20 to 25 minutes more, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the grill.  Allow the nuts to cool in the pan for 1 hour.  Break into bite-sized pieces.  If not serving immediately, store in an airtight container.

To make the Spicy Nuts:  Spread the pumpkin seeds and almonds evenly in a 9- by 13-inch foil pan.  Grill over Indirect Low heat, stirring occasionally, until the nuts are fragrant and lightly toasted, about 15 minutes.  Remove the pan from the grill and add the peanuts.

In a small bowl whisk together the remaining spicy nut ingredients.  Drizzle the mixture over the nuts and toss to coat evenly.  Return the pan to the grill and grill over Indirect Low heat for 5 to 7 minutes more, stirring once or twice.  Remove from the grill and spoon nuts onto paper towels.  Allow to cool.  If not serving immediately, store in an airtight container.  Serve the nut mixtures in separate bowls.

This recipe yields 20 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Where thereís heat, think of wines with more fruit and less alcohol.  A brut-style Prosecco, the engaging sparkler from Italyís Veneto region, is a real thirst quencher and perfect palate cleanser for these hot and zippy snacks!

Beer Recommendation:  With these addictive snacks, try a beer designed to be quaffed in large quantities!  Mild English Ale delivers full body and only 3% alcohol -- refreshingly perfect for knocking back another handful of heat, sweet, and spice!

Comments:  Tired of dips and chips?  These creative munchies make a dynamic duo.  Nibblers never had it so good.
