                               Baked Alaska

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Courtney Weiner
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         quarts  sherbet or ice cream -- frozen in a
                        melon-shaped mold about 12" long
  1                     round store-bought genoise or
                        sponge cake - (8" by 1 1/2")
                        Ovenproof serving platter or
                        tray - (16" to 18" long)
  10                    egg whites - (1 1/3 cups) -- at room temperature,
                        and in an egg-beating bowl for step 2
  2            pinches  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1 1/2           cups  superfine sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar in fine-meshed sieve
  1                     sparkler

Slice the cake into half-inch layers; cut the cake layers in such a way that you can form a large oval 1/2-inch thick and 1-inch larger all around than your ice cream mold.  Arrange the oval on the platter, cover airtight with plastic wrap, and set aside.  Be sure oven is preheated to 450 degrees in time for step 2.

Beating the meringue:  Start beating the egg whites at moderate speed until they are foaming, beat in the salt and cream of tartar, then gradually increase speed to fast until egg whites form soft peaks.  Gradually beat in the sugar, sprinkling in 1/4 cup at a time, beating half a minute between additions.  After all has gone in, add vanilla, and continue beating for several minutes at high speed until eggs form stiff, shiny peaks.

Set ice-cream mold in a basin of tepid water, run a knife around edge, and unmold the sherbet or ice cream upon the cake in the platter.  Immediately spread the meringue over it with a spatula, starting at bottom of cake and bringing it up to a peak at the top of the dessert.  Meringue should be about 1-inch thick over the sherbet or ice cream, in order to insulate it from the heat of the oven.  Sieve confectioners' sugar all over surface of meringue, making a layer about 1/16-inch thick.

Browning:  Set in upper-middle level of preheated 450 degree oven for 3 to 4 minutes, to brown meringue lightly.  Just before serving, place a sparkler on top of the baked Alaska and light.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Slice the cake into half-inch layers; cut the cake layers in such a way that you can form a large oval 1/2-inch thick and 1-inch larger all around than your ice cream mold.  Arrange the oval on the platter, cover airtight with plastic wrap, and set aside.  Be sure oven is preheated to 450 degrees in time for step 2.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beating the meringue:  Start beating the egg whites at moderate speed until they are foaming, beat in the salt and cream of tartar, then gradually increase speed to fast until egg whites form soft peaks.  Gradually beat in the sugar, sprinkling in 1/4 cup at a time, beating half a minute between additions.  After all has gone in, add vanilla, and continue beating for several minutes at high speed until eggs form stiff, shiny peaks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Set ice-cream mold in a basin of tepid water, run a knife around edge, and unmold the sherbet or ice cream upon the cake in the platter.  Immediately spread the meringue over it with a spatula, starting at bottom of cake and bringing it up to a peak at the top of the dessert.  Meringue should be about 1-inch thick over the sherbet or ice cream, in order to insulate it from the heat of the oven.  Sieve confectioners&apos; sugar all over surface of meringue, making a layer about 1/16-inch thick.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Browning:  Set in upper-middle level of preheated 450 degree oven for 3 to 4 minutes, to brown meringue lightly.  Just before serving, place a sparkler on top of the baked Alaska and light.

     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  Korean red pepper paste (kochujang)
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
  1               head  green leaf lettuce

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beans                           Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dried navy or pea beans -- picked over
     3/4         pound  salt pork
     1/2           cup  molasses
     1/2      teaspoon  English-style dry mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  grated onion
  1         tablespoon  sugar

In a bowl combine the beans with 4 cups cold water, let them soak overnight, and drain them, reserving any remaining liquid.  Transfer the beans to a small heavy kettle, add fresh water to cover (about 3 1/2 cups), and simmer the beans, covered, for 1 hour.  Drain the beans in a colander, reserving the cooking water and combining it with the reserved soaking liquid, and reserve the liquid.

To the kettle add a 1/4 pound piece of the pork and the beans and bury the remaining piece of pork, well scored, in the center of the beans.  In a small bowl stir together the molasses, sugar, 1/2 cup of the reserved bean water, the mustard, the paprika, and the onion, pour the mixture over the beans, lifting the beans with a spoon to allow the seasoning to concentrate to the bottom of the kettle.

Bake the beans, covered, in the middle of a preheated 300 degree oven, adding some of the reserved bean water at hourly intervals to keep the mixture covered and lifting the beans to allow the liquid to penetrate to the bottom of the kettle, for 6 hours.  (The surface of the liquid in the pot should just cover the beans.)  Remove the lid for the last hour of cooking.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     leg of lamb - (8 to 9 lbs) -- butterflied
  2             medium  onions  --1 coarsely chopped,
                        and 1 for garnishing
  1              piece  fresh ginger, 3" long and 1" wide -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  5                     garlic cloves - (to 7) -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
     2/3           cup  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  cumin
  1           teaspoon  garam masala
  1           teaspoon  ground ground turmeric
     1/4      teaspoon  ground mace
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1                cup  olive oil
  2 1/2                 teapoon salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper - (to 1 tspn) -- (optional)
     1/2      teaspoon  orange food coloring - (to 1 tspn) or Amer

Put the chopped onion, ginger, garlic, and 4 tablespoons of the lemon juice in the container of the electric blender, and blend at high speed to get a smooth paste (about 1 minute).

In a bowl or pot with nonmetallic lining large enough to hold the meat, put the paste from the blender and all the other ingredients except the meats and the onion that is to be used for garnishing later.  Mix well.  Carefully cut off all fat and tissue from the meat, and with the point of a knife make lots of gashes in it.  Cut into 2 pieces, if there is not room.  Make a few more jabs with the knife, and be sure the paste gets rubbed into the meat and goes way inside the gashes.  Cover the container and leave refrigerated for 24 hours.  Turn the meat over at least 3 or 4 times during this period.

The meat is now ready for grilling.  But before you start, get your garnishes ready.  Peel the second onion and slice it into very fine rounds (paper thin if possible).  Separate the rounds into rings and put them into a bowl of ice water, cover, and refrigerate.  Cut off the stems, leaves, and tips from the radishes and then cut them into flowers.  (Starting from the tip end, start cutting into halves, but stop short as you reach the stem end.  Next, cut into quarters and eights the same way.)  Put into a small bowl of ice water, cover and refrigerate.  It will look prettier if you use unblemished radishes of approximately the same size for this.

Get fire started.  When hot, place the metal grill at the lowest notch.  Lift meat from bowl leaving marinade and place on grill.  Sear 5 to 8 minutes on either side.  Then raise grill to its topmost notch and cook about 20 minutes on each side.  Brush frequently with the marinade until it is all used up.  If you don't have a grill that moves up and down, just remember that the meat needs to cook about 50 minutes and it should be very dark on the outside and pinkish inside.

To serve: warm a large platter.  Meanwhile place the meat on a carving board and slice it as you would a London broil-into thin diagonal pieces.  Drain off water from the radishes and onion rings.  Arrange radishes around meat and lay raw onion rings on top of meat.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

If you don&apos;t have a grill that moves up and down, just remember that the meat needs to cook about 50 minutes and it should be very dark on the outside and pinkish inside.

<DirT>
To serve: warm a large platter.  Meanwhile place the meat on a carving board and slice it as you would a London broil-into thin diagonal pieces.  Drain off water from the radishes and onion rings.  Arrange radishes around meat and lay raw onion rings on top of meat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PUFF PASTRY CRESCENTS ===
  1                     sheet puff pastry dough
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten
                        === FOR THE STUFFED CHICKEN ===
  4              whole  chicken breasts - (1 lb ea) -- boned, skinned
  3        tablespoons  crushed ice
     1/3           cup  well-chilled heavy cream
     1/2           cup  cooked, squeezed, and chopped
                        spinach - (firmly packed) -- abt 1 lb fresh
  1 1/2       teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed fennel seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated lemon rind
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1                cup  chicken stock -- or more
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  2 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  chicken stock -- boiling
  2        tablespoons  truffle butter -- softened
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Lemon juice -- to taste

Make the puff pastry crescents:  Lay out the puff pastry dough.  Cut out 16 crescent shapes from the dough.  Brush with egg whites and bake in a 375 degree preheated oven for 15 minutes, until golden.

Make the stuffed chicken:  Arrange the chicken breasts on a cutting board and cut them in half.  Remove the fillet strip from each breast, discard the white tendon, and in a food processor grind the fillets.  Add the ice, blend the mixture until the ice is absorbed, and with the motor running add the cream.  Add the spinach, the salt, the fennel seeds, the rind, the nutmeg, and the pepper and blend the filling well, scraping down the sides.

Cut a slit in each breast of chicken for the filling.  Spoon about 3 tablespoons of the spinach filling into each pocket.  Close with toothpicks.  The chicken may be prepared up to this point 24 hours in advance and kept covered and chilled.

Place chicken in a baking pan.  Add the white wine and enough chicken stock to barely cover the chicken.  Add salt and pepper.  Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven, covered, for 45 minutes until the chicken is cooked through.

Make the sauce:  In a saucepan, melt the butter.  Blend in 3 tablespoons flour and let cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Remove the mixture from the heat.  Whisk in the boiling chicken stock.  Bring the sauce to a boil for 1 minute, stirring, until the sauce thickens.  Place back on heat and let simmer.  Beat in the cream by the spoonfuls.  Add 2 tablespoons softened truffle butter by 1/2 tablespoons, salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste.

Remove chicken from the poaching liquid.  Serve with the sauce and the puff pastry crescents.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  6                     boneless skinless chicken breasts
  3 1/2         ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- stems discarded,
                        and large caps halved or quartered
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  red or white wine -- (optional)
  1                can  Italian plum tomatoes - (28 oz) -- with juices
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh Italian plum tomatoes -- with juices
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh Italian (flat leaf) parsley
  1              small  garlic clove -- minced or crushed
                        through a press
  1                     fresh orange zest strip - (1/2" by 2") -- remove with
                        a vegetable peeler
  2        tablespoons  torn or cut up fresh basil -- (optional)
                        === PARMESAN ORZO ===
  1 1/2           cups  orzo
                        Salt -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  Parmigianno-Reggiano -- or more to taste
  1         tablespoon  finely- chopped parsley

Heat oil a deep-sided heavy skillet or saute pan with a lid, preferably with a non-stick coating, over medium heat.  Add the chicken smooth-side down.  Saute, turning each piece with tongs or a plastic spatula until lightly browned, about 5 minutes per side.  Half way through cooking add the shiitakes; lightly brown on both sides.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper; remove chicken and shiitake to a side dish.

Add the wine to the hot skillet and boil over high heat until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, parsley, garlic and orange zest.  Heat to boiling; stirring to combine ingredients.  Return the chicken, shiitake and any juices on plate to the skillet.  Cover and cook, over medium heat, 10 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.  Transfer the chicken to a heated platter; cover with foil.

Turn the heat to high and boil the tomato mixture until slightly reduced and thickened, about 5 minutes.  Add basil, if using.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Garnish with basil and serve with the Parmesan Orzo.

For the Parmesan Orzo:  Cook orzo in boiling, salted water, partially covered, stirring frequently to prevent sticking.  When the water returns to a boil, uncover and boil until tender, about 15 minutes.  Toss with the cheese and parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Strain into a bowl or pitcher.  Add the pisco little by little, while stirring with a wooden spoon.  Store in glass bottles and refrigerate.  Traditionally, cola de mono is prepared the day before it is to be served.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  unsalted macadamia nuts
  6             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter
  2              whole  eggs
  1                     egg white
     2/3           cup  sugar
     2/3           cup  dark corn syrup
  1           teaspoon  rum
                        Unsweetened whipped cream -- for garnish
                        === CHOCOLATE PASTRY SHELL ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa
  1 1/2         sticks  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces,
                        and softened to room temperature
     1/3           cup  sugar
  2                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Chocolate Pastry Shell:  On a work surface, mix the flour and cocoa until well blended; form into a mound.  Make a well in the center and add the remaining ingredients.  Using your hands, slowly blend the ingredients in the well until partially mixed, then incorporate the flour and cocoa until completely combined and a soft dough forms.  Pat the dough into a disk, wrap well and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.  (This is a cookie-like crust.  The dough softens quickly once out of the refrigerator and is a bit difficult to transfer to the tart pan, but scraps can be used to repair any cracks.)

Between 2 sheets of waxed paper, roll out dough into a 13-inch round.  Refrigerate for 10 minutes.  Remove the waxed paper and transfer the dough to an 11-inch tart pan with removable bottom.  Fit the dough evenly into the pan and trim any overhanging pastry.  Refrigerate for at least 10 minutes more.  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Line the chilled shell with aluminum foil and weigh down with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake for 10 minutes.  Then remove the weights and foil and bake for 5 minutes longer until set but slightly soft.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Place macadamia nuts in a medium skillet and toast over low heat, stirring often until golden brown all over, about 8 minutes.  Do not burn.  Set aside to cool completely.

In a double boiler, combine the chocolate and butter and melt, stirring over moderate heat.  Set aside to cool slightly.

In a large bowl, whisk the whole eggs, egg white, sugar and corn syrup until combined.  Stir in the rum, the cooled chocolate mixture and the nuts until blended.  Pour the filling into the partially baked chocolate pastry shell and bake for about 45 minutes, until the center is set and does not wiggle.  Set aside to cool on a rack.

Serve at room temperature or chilled, garnish with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     cinnamon sticks
  3 3/4           cups  water
  2               cups  long-grain rice
  2 1/2      teaspoons  safflower or corn oil
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced leeks
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  good-quality curry powder
  3                     carrots - (to 4) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" dice (abt 1 1/2 cups)
  3                     turnips - (to 4) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" dice (abt 1/12 cups)
  3 1/2    tablespoons  rice wine or sake
     1/2           cup  water
  1 1/2           cups  cooked peas -- (if using frozen,
                        thaw to room temperature)
                        === SAUCE ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  rice wine or sake
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a small bowl, mix sauce ingredients together.

Put the cinnamon sticks and the water in a pot and bring to a boil.  Cook about 5 minutes over medium heat.  Under cold running water, rinse the rice in a saucepan until the water runs clear.  Drain and add the rice to the cinnamon water.  Bring the water to a boil again, reduce the heat to low, and cover.  Simmer covered for 17 minutes, or until craters appear in the surface of the rice and the water has been absorbed.  Remove from the heat and fluff the cooked grains with a fork.  Cover and let sit for 15 minutes, then uncover and spread the rice out on a cookie sheet with a fork to cool completely.  Discard the cinnamon sticks.  (The rice should be cold or at least room temperature before stir-frying.)

Heat a wok or large skillet.  Add the oil and heat until hot.  Add the leeks and garlic, and stir-fry over medium heat until slightly softened and translucent.  Add the curry powder and stir-fry for 10 seconds, until fragrant.  Add the carrots, turnips, rice wine, and water, and partially cover.  Cook about 5 to 8 minutes, until tender, then add the cooked rice, breaking it up with a spatula.  Add the peas and the sauce.  Toss lightly to coat the ingredients and spoon into a serving dish.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  8             slices  lean bacon
  1              whole  skinless boneless chicken breast -- (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  12            slices  brioche bread -- cut from large
                        round or rectangular loaves, toasted light

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  parsnips -- unpeeled, and
                        poached for 15 minutes
  1                     sweet potato -- cut into 8 wedges
  1         tablespoon  grapeseed oil -- plus more for
                        squeeze bottle
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     boneless skinless duck breasts -- (5 to 7 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  toasted coriander seeds -- crushed
  4             sprigs  baby pea shoots -- for garnish
                        === SWEET POTATO SAUCE BASE ===
  9               cups  sweet potato juice - (approximately 12
                        to 16 sweet potatoes)
  4        tablespoons  fresh ginger
  2                     Thai chile peppers -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-squeezed lemon juice -- to taste

Split each poached parsnip in half lengthwise and rub with a small amount of grapeseed oil.  Rub the 8 sweet potato wedges with grapeseed oil.  Season the parsnip and potato with salt and pepper.  Bake on a sheet tray in a pre-heated 400 degree oven until browned and cooked through (approximately 15 minutes).

Heat a large, nonstick saute pan over medium heat.  Season each duck breast with salt and pepper.  Press one side of the duck breast into the coriander seeds.  Use a squeeze bottle to drizzle a thin line of grapeseed oil over the coriander on each duck breast.  Add the duck breasts, seed-side down to the hot saute pan.  Saute until the coriander browns.  Turn the duck breasts over and set the pan off the flame for 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove the breasts and allow them to rest 2 to 4 minutes.

To plate, set a piece of parsnip and wedge of sweet potato on each plate.  Slice each duck breast into 1/4-inch slices and arrange against the vegetables.  Spoon Sweet Potato Sauce Base onto each plate and garnish with pea shoots.

Sweet Potato Sauce Base:  Juice sweet potatoes and allow the juice to stand for 4 hours.  This will allow much of the potato starch in the juice to settle.  Pour the juice through a fine mesh strainer being careful to leave the settled starch behind.  Place over a medium flame and reduce to approximately 1 1/2 to 2 cups, or until the sauce naturally thickens.  Remove from the fire and stir in the ginger and Thai chile pepper.  Stir until the sauce tastes spicy enough and strain immediately.  Season to taste with salt, pepper, and lemon juice.  (Makes 1 1/2 to 2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1             medium  mango -- diced
  2        tablespoons  rum
                        === PINAPPLE CHUTNEY DIPPING SAUCE ===

Place oatmeal in food processor and pulse until finely chopped.  Remove to a bowl and set aside.  Place macadamia nuts in food processor and pulse until finely chopped but not stuck together.  Add nuts to oatmeal and mix well.  Add flour, thyme, and Parmesan to mixture, mix until combined.  Season with salt and pepper.

Dip chicken breasts in butter, then dredge breasts in oatmeal mixture until breasts are well-coated.  In large skillet heat canola oil over medium-high heat.

Add the lemongrass, rice and salt, stir well.  Add broth, stir, cover and cook for 12 to 16 minutes over medium heat until rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.  Remove and discard the lemongrass.

Saute garlic and ginger in remaining olive oil about 4 to 5 minutes, until softened.  Add red bell pepper, water chestnuts, and fruits and saute lightly for 2 minutes until heated through.  Add rum and flambe to remove alcohol.  Toss with rice and serve warm with chicken.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Madhur Jaffrey
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  eggplant
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
     1/4           cup  peanut or canola oil
  1             medium  onion -- very finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        very finely chopped
  8                     canned plum tomatoes -- finely chopped,
                        plus 1/4 cup of the can liquid
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint leaves
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt
                        Peanut or canola oil -- for deep-frying
                        Mint sprigs or leaves -- for garnishing

Trim the very ends of the eggplant and cut it crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices.  Put the slices in a single layer in a large platter or lasagna-type dish.  Sprinkle the salt over both sides, rubbing it in well.  Set aside for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce.  Put the oil in a large, nonstick frying pan set over medium-high heat.  When hot, add onion.  Stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the onion pieces begin to brown at the edges.  Put in the garlic.  Stir for a few seconds.  Then put in the tomatoes and their liquid as well as all the remaining ingredients for the tomato sauce.  Stir to mix.  Cover, turn the heat to low, and cook gently for 10 minutes.  Set aside in a warm place.

Yogurt sauce:  Put the yogurt in a small bowl and beat lightly with a fork.

Just before you eat, put oil to a depth of 2 to 3 inches for deep-frying in a wok or deep-fryer and set over medium heat.  Take the eggplant slices from the platter and dry them off well with paper towels.  When the oil is hot, drop in as many slices as the utensil will hold easily and fry, turning now and then, for 6 to 7 minutes, or until both sides are a medium-brown color.  Drain well on paper towels.

To serve, arrange the eggplant slices in a single layer on a large platter.  Top each slice with a dollop of the tomato sauce and then with a tablespoon of the yogurt.  Garnish with the mint sprigs or leaves.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     English muffins -- split, toasted,
                        and buttered
  4                     thick slices ham or Canadian bacon -- warmed
  4                     Poached Eggs -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  Hollandaise Sauce -- (see below)
                        === HOLLANDAISE SAUCE ===
  3              large  egg yolks
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cold water
     1/2           cup  warm clarified butter
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice - (to 3 tspns)
  1               dash  hot red pepper sauce -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Place egg yolks and cold water in the top of a double boiler or in a large stainless-steel bowl set up as a double boiler.  Off the heat, whisk the egg mixture until it becomes light and frothy.  Place the top of the double boiler or the bowl over, not in, barely simmering water and continue to whisk until the eggs are thickened, 2 to 4 minutes, being careful not to let the eggs get too hot.

Remove the pan or bowl from over the water and whisk to slightly cool the mixture.  Whisking constantly, very slowly add butter, then whisk in lemon juice, pepper sauce and salt and pepper.  If the sauce is too thick, whisk in a few drops of warm water.  Serve immediately or keep the sauce warm for up to 30 minutes by placing the bowl in water (not hot) water.

To assemble:  Arrange English muffin half on each of four serving plates, top with bacon and egg and nap with sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Remove the pan or bowl from over the water and whisk to slightly cool the mixture.  Whisking constantly, very slowly add butter, then whisk in lemon juice, pepper sauce and salt and pepper.  If the sauce is too thick, whisk in a few drops of warm water.  Serve immediately or keep the sauce warm for up to 30 minutes by placing the bowl in water (not hot) water.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     garlic cloves -- or to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  5        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2    tablespoon  toasted and ground cumin seed
  1                     fresh jalapeÒo pepper - (to 2) -- minced
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2 1/2         pounds  skirt steak
  2              large  red bell peppers -- cut into strips
  2              large  green bell peppers -- cut into strips
  2              large  yellow bell peppers -- cut into strips
  1              large  red onion -- halved lengthwise,
                        and cut into strips
     1/8           cup  minced fresh cilantro leaves
  16                    store-bought flour tortillas -- warm
                        Tomato salsa -- as accompaniment
                        Chunky guacamole -- as accompaniment

With a mortar and pestle mash 3 of the garlic cloves and the salt to a paste.  In a glass baking dish combine the paste, lime juice, 3 tablespoons of the oil, cumin seed, jalapeÒos, and pepper.  Add the steak and let marinate at room temperature, turning twice, for 2 hours.  The steak can be marinated and kept refrigerated, covered, overnight.

In a large skillet cook the bell peppers and onions with salt and pepper to taste in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until tender.  Add the remaining garlic clove, minced, and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the coriander.  Toss to combine and keep warm on a platter.

Drain the steak and pat dry.  Cook on a preheated grill pan for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat.  Transfer it to a cutting board and let it stand for 3 minutes.  Cut diagonally into pieces and transfer with any accumulated juices to the platter.  Wrap the steak and vegetable mixture in the tortillas and serve with salsa and guacamole.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  flank steak, London broil, or
                        boneless sirloin -- trimmed of fat
                        and gristle
  5 1/2    tablespoons  canola or corn oil
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
     3/4           cup  very finely shredded fresh ginger
  4              whole  scallions -- ends trimmed,
                        cut into very fine shreds
  5               cups  bean sprouts -- rinsed lightly
                        and drained
  2 1/2    tablespoons  rice wine or sake
                        === MARINADE ===
  3 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  rice wine or sake
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
                        === SAUCE ===
  6        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame oil

Cut the beef across the grain into thin slices about 1/8-inch thick; cut those slices into 1-inch squares.  Put the beef in a bowl, add the marinade, and toss lightly to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap, and let the beef marinate for 1 hour at room temperature, or longer if possible in the refrigerator.

Heat a wok or large skillet, add 3 1/2 tablespoons of the oil, and heat until near smoking.  Add the beef and stir-fry over high heat until it loses its raw color and the slices separate.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain.  Clean out the pan.

Mix the ingredients for sauce together.

Reheat the pan, add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, heat about 20 seconds, and add the garlic, ginger, and scallions.  Cook for 20 seconds, until fragrant, then add the bean sprouts and toss lightly over high heat.  Add the rice wine, and stir-fry for 1 1/2 minutes, then add the sauce and the cooked meat.  Cook until the meat is heated through and everything is coated evenly with the sauce.

Scoop the beef onto a serving platter and serve with rice and a vegetable, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cut the beef across the grain into thin slices about 1/8-inch thick; cut those slices into 1-inch squares.  Put the beef in a bowl, add the marinade, and toss lightly to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap, and let the beef marinate for 1 hour at room temperature, or longer if possible in the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a wok or large skillet, add 3 1/2 tablespoons of the oil, and heat until near smoking.  Add the beef and stir-fry over high heat until it loses its raw color and the slices separate.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain.  Clean out the pan.

<DirT>
Mix the ingredients for sauce together.

<DirT>
Reheat the pan, add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, heat about 20 seconds, and add the garlic, ginger, and scallions.  Cook for 20 seconds, until fragrant, then add the bean sprouts and toss lightly over high heat.  Add the rice wine, and stir-fry for 1 1/2 minutes, then add the sauce and the cooked meat.  Cook until the meat is heated through and everything is coated evenly with the sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  butter - (2 sticks)
     3/4           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  2          teaspoons  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  molasses
  5 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  cold water
                        === ROYAL ICING ===
  2               cups  powdered sugar, 10X
  1           teaspoon  cream of tartar
  2                     egg whites
                        === CANDY SUPPLIES ===
  10                    Necco Wafer rolls -- possibly more
                        depending on number of houses
  2             pounds  chocolate covered raisins
  1              pound  hard candies in assorted colors
  1              pound  cinnamon red hots
  2                     bags mini-malted milkballs, coated assorte
                        Assorted Christmas candies, your choice

In a mixing bowl, on medium speed, cream together the butter, brown sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and salt.  Add the molasses, mixing until incorporated.  Add the flour, 1 cup at a time, and mix each cup until just combined.  With the mixer running, slowly add the water.  Spread the dough out on a sheet pan, cover it tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate it until youíre ready to roll it out (ideally overnight, three hours minimum).

Keep gingerbread cool while working with it.  Dust with flour to avoid sticking.  Brush away excess flour after cutting.

Roll out dough to 1/4-inch thickness.  Apply even pressure on rolling pin to avoid variance in thickness.  Cut out house pieces using your cardboard templates.  A dough wheel works best.  Use a paring knife for corners.

Bake pieces in a preheated 350 degree oven for approximately 20 minutes or until dough is set well.  Crisp gingerbread is a must for a lasting structure.  Allow pieces to cool completely before assembly -- overnight is ideal.  If pans are not level transfer warm pieces carefully onto the counter surface so they set completely flat.

For the Royal Icing:  In the bowl of a mixer, blend the above ingredients together and mix on medium-high speed for 3 minutes.  Keep covered with a damp towel to prevent a crust from forming on the icing.

Assembly Of Gingerbread Houses:  Windows should be decorated before assembly.  Colored flow icing, crushed candies, melted leaf gelatin, marzipan, etc.

Mix royal icing and keep covered with a damp towel.  Assemble house on a 12-inch round base of your choice.  Start with a front piece and a side piece using royal icing liberally on the inside.  The 2 pieces should stand without assistance.  Assemble remaining pieces in the same fashion.  Roof pieces may need support to counteract gravity, sugar boxes, soda cans work well.

Time to decorate your house.  Necco wafers make excellent roof shingles.  Chocolate covered raisins will build a chimney.  Red hots, jelly beans, chocolate chips, gummi bears -- use your imagination in the candy aisle.

Finish with royal icing and dust with snow -- donut sugar looks best.

This recipe yields ?? houses.

In a mixing bowl, on medium speed, cream together the butter, brown sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and salt.  Add the molasses, mixing until incorporated.  Add the flour, 1 cup at a time, and mix each cup until just combined.  With the mixer running, slowly add the water.  Spread the dough out on a sheet pan, cover it tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate it until youíre ready to roll it out (ideally overnight, three hours minimum).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Keep gingerbread cool while working with it.  Dust with flour to avoid sticking.  Brush away excess flour after cutting.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out dough to 1/4-inch thickness.  Apply even pressure on rolling pin to avoid variance in thickness.  Cut out house pieces using your cardboard templates.  A dough wheel works best.  Use a paring knife for corners.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake pieces in a preheated 350 degree oven for approximately 20 minutes or until dough is set well.  Crisp gingerbread is a must for a lasting structure.  Allow pieces to cool completely before assembly -- overnight is ideal.  If pans are not level transfer warm pieces carefully onto the counter surface so they set completely flat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Royal Icing:  In the bowl of a mixer, blend the above ingredients together and mix on medium-high speed for 3 minutes.  Keep covered with a damp towel to prevent a crust from forming on the icing.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Assembly Of Gingerbread Houses:  Windows should be decorated before assembly.  Colored flow icing, crushed candies, melted leaf gelatin, marzipan, etc.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mix royal icing and keep covered with a damp towel.  Assemble house on a 12-inch round base of your choice.  Start with a front piece and a side piece using royal icing liberally on the inside.  The 2 pieces should stand without assistance.  Assemble remaining pieces in the same fashion.  Roof pieces may need support to counteract gravity, sugar boxes, soda cans work well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Time to decorate your house.  Necco wafers make excellent roof shingles.  Chocolate covered raisins will build a chimney.  Red hots, jelly beans, chocolate chips, gummi bears -- use your imagination in the candy aisle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Finish with royal icing and dust with snow -- donut sugar looks best.

                     Glazed Tofu With Cucumber Salad

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Michel Nischan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  high-quality tamari
  1         tablespoon  raw cane sugar
  1            package  silken tofu -- cut into 8 slices
     1/4           cup  miso sauce
  1              large  cucumber -- julienned
  2        tablespoons  julienned pickled ginger
  1           teaspoon  yuzu or lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  mirin
                        === MISO SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  light miso
     1/3           cup  high-grade tamari
  1         tablespoon  mirin
  1         tablespoon  sake

Place 2 1/2 cups of the tamari and the raw sugar in the insert of a non-reactive double boiler.  Reserve the remaining 1/2 cup of tamari.  Fill the bottom of the boiler with 3-inches of water.  Assemble the boiler and place over a medium-low flame.  Cook the tamari mixture until it reduces to make a light syrup.  This should take 60 to 90 minutes and yield 1/4 cup of tamari syrup.

Meanwhile, trim the tofu slices to make each a perfect rectangle.  Pour 1/4 cup of the reserved tamari onto a plate.  Place the tofu slices over the tamari, then pour the remaining 1/4-cup of tamari over the tofu.  Be careful to pour the tamari so each slice is completely covered with tamari.  Marinate 1 hour.

Place the tofu slices onto a cookie sheet or baking pan and baste with a thin coating of the tamari syrup.  Place under a preheated broiler 4-inches from the heat and broil 2 to 4 minutes, or until the tofu jiggles like hot custard.  Use the leftover tamari marinade to baste the tofu as it cooks so the tofu doesnít dry out.

Toss the cucumber and pickled ginger in a small mixing bowl with the yuzu and mirin.  Arrange 2 tofu slices per plate and place the cucumber salad against the tofu slices.  Sauce the tofu with the Miso Sauce and any remaining tamari syrup.

Miso Sauce:  Combine ingredients in the cup of an immersion blender and blend until smooth.  Thin with water if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Custards                        Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  water
     1/3           cup  long-grain rice
  2               cups  milk
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  2              large  whole eggs
  3              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  honey
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
                        Orange sections -- as an accompaniment

In a small saucepan bring the water to a boil, add the rice with a pinch of salt, and simmer it gently, covered, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.  Transfer the rice to a small bowl and let it cool.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees and butter a 9-inch (1-quart capacity) flameproof shallow baking dish.  In the pan bring the milk and the cream just to a boil with the vanilla bean and remove the pan from the heat.  Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the milk mixture and discard the pod (or reserve it for another use).

In a bowl whisk together the whole eggs, the egg yolks, the honey, the cinnamon and the salt and combine well.  Add the milk mixture in a stream, whisking, and pour the custard into the baking dish.  Transfer the baking dish to a baking pan, add enough hot water to the pan to reach halfway up the side of the dish, and bake the custard in the middle of the oven for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until it is set completely.  Transfer the custard to a rack, let it cool, and chill it, covered, for at least 6 hours or overnight.

Just before serving, preheat the broiler, blot the top of the custard dry with a paper towel, and force the brown sugar through a coarse sieve onto the top of it, covering it evenly.  Put the baking dish in a baking pan filled with ice and broil the custard about 2 inches from the heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the brown sugar is melted and crisp (be careful not to let the brown sugar burn).  Let the crËme brulee cool in the pan of ice for 3 minutes and serve it, cut into wedges, with the orange sections.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  hazelnuts - (1 1/2 oz)
     1/2           cup  whole unblanched almonds - (2 1/2 oz)
     1/2           cup  plus 2 tbspns granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  ground cinnamon
  2               cups  plus 4 tbspns unbleached pastry flour or
                        unbleached all-purpose flour
  4                     extra-large eggs -- hard-boiled
  8             ounces  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- frozen, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped lemon zest -- abt 1/2 lemon
  1           teaspoon  pure almond extract
                        Powdered sugar -- for dusting
  1                cup  raspberry jam
                        === SPECIAL ITEMS ===
                        Cutters or punch cutters, 2 1/2" round,
                        heart, square, diamond, star-shaped
                        Cutter, 1" round or 1" heart cutter -- for cutting out
                        the center of the cookies

Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Spread the hazelnuts and almonds on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until lightly browned, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Shake the pan halfway through baking to ensure that the nuts toast evenly.  Allow the nuts to cool.  Gather the hazelnuts into a kitchen towel and rub them together to remove the skins.

In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the hazelnuts and almonds with 1/4 cup of the sugar and the cinnamon, and process until itís the consistency of a fine meal.  Add the flour and pulse a few times to combine.

Separate and discard the whites of the eggs.  Push the egg yolks through a fine-mesh sieve, scraping the yolks off the bottom of the sieve and into the flour mixture.  Pulse on and off a few times to combine.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and lemon zest on low 2 to 3 minutes, until softened.  Add the remaining sugar and mix on medium, 3 to 4 minutes, until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.  Add the almond extract and mix to combine.  Turn the mixer off, add the nut mixture, and mix on low until just incorporated.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and flatten into a rectangle, about 1-inch thick.  Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, 1 to 2 hours or overnight.

Divide the dough in half and return one half to the refrigerator.  On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thickness, flouring the surface of the dough as necessary.  Using the shaped cutter, cutting as closely together as possible, cut out the cookies.  Place them 1-inch apart on 1 to 2 parchment-lined baking sheets to chill until firm, 30 to 45 minutes.  Set the scraps aside.

Roll and cut out the remaining dough in the same manner.  Gather all the scraps together, chill, roll, and cut to make the tops.  Using the small cutter, cut out the centers of 1/2 of the cookies and chill until firm, 30 to 45 minutes.

Adjust the oven racks to the upper and lower positions and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until firm to the touch and lightly browned, rotating the baking sheets halfway through to ensure even baking.  The cookies with the holes may bake more quickly than the others.  Allow to cool and dust the perforated cookies with powdered sugar.

Flip over the cookies without holes, placing the darker side of the cookie underneath.  Spoon about 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of the raspberry jam into the center.  Place the perforated cookies, powdered sugar-side up, on top of the jam, matching up the edges and pressing gently to spread the jam.

This recipe yields about 4 dozen 2-inch cookies, depending on the size of your cutters.

             Maya-Mediterranean Chocolate Rice Pudding - ...

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Maricel Presilla
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Puddings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ACHIOTE INFUSION ===
  1                cup  achiote seeds
  2             quarts  water
                        === FOR THE RICE ===
  1                cup  short-grain rice
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        Spice bag, containing
  4                     star anise pods -- with
  12                    allspice berries -- and with
  4                     cinnamon sticks - (3" long) -- and also with
                        Canela or cassia -- tied in cheesecloth
                        === TO FINISH ===
  3               cups  fresh whole milk
  1                can  sweetened condensed milk - (14 oz)
  3             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  2                     plump vanilla beans
                        Ground cinnamon -- to taste

Place the achiote in a medium-sized saucepan, cover with 2 quarts water, and bring to a gentle boil.  Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes.  Strain through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl; reserve the liquid.  You can save the achiote seeds and grind them to use in a seasoning mix, or steep them in the liquid for another recipe.

Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear.  Place in a heavy-bottomed 4-quart saucepan with the reserved achiote infusion, salt, and the spice bag.  Bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, uncovered, until the rice is soft, about 20 to 25 minutes.

To Finish:  Stir in the whole milk and condensed milk.  Reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 minutes.  Stir in the chocolate and mix to melt evenly.  Cook for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until creamy but still fluid.

Half way through the cooking, split the vanilla bean lengthwise with a small sharp knife and scrape the seeds into the mixture.  Add the vanilla bean and stir to incorporate.

When the pudding is done but still loose-textured, remove the spice bag and vanilla bean.  Pour into a serving dish and sprinkle with ground cinnamon.  Serve with cinnamon or cacao cookies.

This recipe yields 8 to 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === THE BEANS ===
     1/2         pound  black beans
  12              cups  water
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- peeled
  1             medium  green pepper -- cored, seeded
  6                     cachucha peppers (available in Hispanic ma
                        === THE RICE AND BEANS ===
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  slab bacon -- finely diced
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- finely chopped
  1             medium  green bell pepper -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  cumin powder
  1           teaspoon  oregano
  1                     bay leaf
  2               cups  long grain rice, Uncle Benís works best
  4               cups  reserved liquid
  1         tablespoon  vinegar
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry
  2          teaspoons  salt -- or to taste

Cooking The Beans:  Wash the beans and cook in a large kettle with the peeled whole onion, the cachucha peppers, and the cored and seeded green pepper.  Cook over moderate heat until the beans are tender, about 2 hours.  Make sure the beans retain their shape; do not overcook.

Drain and reserve 4 cups of the cooking liquid and 2 cups of cooked beans.

Wash the rice in cold water until the water runs clear, drain, and set aside.

Cooking The Rice And Beans:  In a heavy-bottomed 4-quart pot, heat the oil over medium heat and saute the diced bacon until golden brown.  Add the onion, green pepper, cumin, oregano and bay leaf.  Saute, stirring for 1 minute.  Add the rice and stir until all the grains are coated with oil and bacon grease.

Add the reserved 2 cups of beans and the 4 cups cooking liquid, then add vinegar, sherry, and salt.  Mix well, taste, and correct seasonings.  Cook uncovered until all the liquid evaporates -- you will see small air bubbles forming on the surface of the rice.  Fluff the rice slightly with a kitchen fork.  Cover and cook over low heat for 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let stand, uncovered, at least 2 to 3 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  round loaf Italian or French bread -- (8" to 9" dia)
  1                cup  finely-chopped pitted brine-cured green
                        olives, such as Picholine
  1                cup  finely-chopped pitted brine-cured black
                        olives, such as Kalamata
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh oregano
                        = (or scant 3/4 tspn dried oregano)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                     red bell pepper -- roasted, peeled,
                        seeded, and finely chopped
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon -- or to taste
  2               cups  shredded lettuce, arugula, or
                        other salad greens
  4             ounces  mortadella or soft salami
  4             ounces  thinly-sliced sopressata or
                        other hard salami
  4             ounces  thinly-sliced provolone, fontina, or
                        fresh mozzarella cheese
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped fresh tomatoes

                        tomatoes in oil)

In a bowl small combine olives, olive oil, parsley oregano, garlic, red bell pepper and lemon juice.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.

Split bread horizontally in half, and remove most of the soft inner bread, creating a cavity inside each half.  Drain the olive mixture, reserving the marinade.  Brush the insides of both halves of the loaf generously with the marinade, then spread half of the olive mixture in the bottom half.  Add in layers lettuce, arugula, mortadella or other soft salami, sliced sopressata, cheese and tomatoes.  Top with remaining olive salad, cover with the top half of the loaf, and wrap tightly in plastic.

Place on a large plate, cover with another plate, and weight with several pounds of canned goods.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 6 hours.  To serve, unwrap the loaf and cut into wedges.

This recipe yields 6 sandwiches.

  2                     eggs -- separated into white
                        and yolks, then beaten
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil

Make the pancakes:  In a bowl, combine the flour, egg whites, water, and salt and stir until the batter is smooth.  To a heated non-stick pan, add the oil.  Drop in tablespoons of batter to form thin pancakes about 3-inches in diameter.  Fry lightly on both sides.  Transfer to a plate.  Using a 3-inch ring mold or cup, cut the pancakes into a perfect circle.

Make the fillings:  In a bowl, combine the beef, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, scallion, honey, and black pepper.  Saute the mixture in a pan until the beef is cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Set aside.

Poach the shrimp in salted water, about 3 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, julienne the shrimp.  Set aside.

Poach the chicken in salted water until cooked through, about 10 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, shred the chicken.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside.

Blanch the spinach for about 1 minute and then quickly transfer to an ice bath.  Squeeze excess water from the spinach and julienne.  In a bowl, combine the spinach with 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil, salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside.

Squeeze excess water from the shiitake mushrooms, remove the stems and discard, and julienne the mushroom caps.  To a heated pan, add 1 tablespoon sesame oil.  Add mushrooms, salt and pepper to taste and saute until mushrooms are soft, about 1 minute.  Set aside.

Add another tablespoon sesame oil to the pan with the carrots, salt and pepper to taste.  Saute until the carrots are slightly cooked but not completely soft, about 1 minute.  Set aside.

Add a pinch of salt and pepper to the whites and yolks and stir to combine.  To a heated non-stick pan on moderately-low heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil.  Pour the egg whites into the pan and swirl the pan around to form a thin layer with the egg whites.  Once the eggs have cooked through, turn them out onto a plate.  Repeat the process with the yolks.  Let cool, then julienne the whites and yolks.  Set aside.

When ready to serve, place each filling into a compartment of the kujolpan dish, with the pancakes in the center compartment.  Alternatively, pile the pancakes in the center of a large platter and arrange the 8 fillings around the pancakes.  To eat, take a pancake and fill it with any combination of fillings to taste.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                 Onion Custards On A Bed Of Salad Greens

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Marie Simmons
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  large sweet onions -- peeled, trimmed
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus more
                        for the custard cups
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1           teaspoon  Kosher salt
                        Generous grindings black pepper
  1                cup  milk - (to 1 1/2 cups)
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
  12             small  fresh thyme sprigs

Halve onions from top to bottom.  Resting on the cut side slice thinly into half circles.  Measure out 6 cups.

Melt the butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat; when foam subsides add the onions.  Cover and cook, over medium-low heat, until wilted, about 15 minutes.  Uncover and continue cooking over medium heat, stirring often and adjusting heat so that onions brown slowly, until the onions are a dark golden brown and very tender, about 20 minutes.  Stir in the chopped thyme, salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Select 6 (5-ounce) custard cups; brush generously with softened butter.  Arrange in a 13- by 9-inch baking pan.  Set a kettle of water on to boil.

Combine the milk and cream in a saucepan and heat until small bubbles appear around the edges.  In a large bowl whisk the eggs and egg yolks until blended.  Slowly add the hot milk, whisking gently until blended.  Place a strainer over a large measuring cup with a pouring spout and strain the custard.  Using a tongs distribute distribute the sauteed onions evenly among the 6 custard cups (they should be about 1/4 filled).  Add the custard, distributing evenly.  Run a knife through the custards so that the custard will seep through the layer of onion.

Place the baking pan in the oven and carefully pour hot water into the pan until it is 1-inch up sides of the cups.  Bake until custards are lightly browned and set, about 25 minutes.  Remove the pan from the oven and using a spatula and protecting your hand with a pot-holder remove the custard cups from the water to a wire rack.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  Can be made ahead and reheated in the microwave or wrapped in foil and reheated in the oven.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  whole unblanched almonds - (6 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  whole unblanched hazelnuts - (6 oz)
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     3/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  unsweetened cocoa powder -- plus extra
                        for dusting
  1 1/4         pounds  dried fruits, preferably organic -- any combination of
                        black currants, white or black raisins,
                        black mission figs, white figs, sour
                        cherries, plums, prunes, pears, peaches,
                        nectarines, or cranberries and apricots
                        and candied ginger
     2/3           cup  mild-flavored honey, such as clover
  1                cup  granulated sugar
                        === SPECIAL ITEMS ===
  1                     candy thermometer
  1                     nine-inch cake ring or flan ring -- see * Note
  1                     sheet rice paper

* Note:  Or several 4-inch flan rings placed on parchment-lined baking sheet, generously coated with melted butter and dusted with unsweetened cocoa powder

Place the ring or mold over the sheet of rice paper on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Spread the nuts on a baking sheet in 2 separate piles, and toast in the oven until lightly browned, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Shake the pans halfway through to ensure that the nuts toast evenly.  Allow to cool a few minutes.  Gather the hazelnuts into a kitchen towel and rub them together to remove the skins.  Turn the oven down to 300 degrees.

In a large bowl combine the nuts with the cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, pepper, flour, and cocoa powder.  Cut the fruit into 1/2-inch pieces and toss with the nut mixture.

In a small saucepan, stir together the honey and sugar.  Over high heat, bring to a boil without stirring.  Using a pastry brush dipped in water, brush the sides of the pan to remove any undissolved sugar granules.  Cook until the sugar reaches 224 to 240 degrees (soft ball stage) on a candy thermometer.  Remove from the heat and pour into the fruit mixture.  Stir to combine as well as possible.  The mixture will be very thick and sticky.

Dip your hands in water and press the fruit mixture evenly into the pan.  Bake for 1 hour, until the top is slightly puffed and the surface is matte.  Remove from the oven and cool completely in the pan.  Trim the rice paper around the edge of the mold.  Store at room temperature, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, for several weeks.

This recipe yields 12 to 20 slices.

<DirT>
Place the ring or mold over the sheet of rice paper on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the nuts on a baking sheet in 2 separate piles, and toast in the oven until lightly browned, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Shake the pans halfway through to ensure that the nuts toast evenly.  Allow to cool a few minutes.  Gather the hazelnuts into a kitchen towel and rub them together to remove the skins.  Turn the oven down to 300 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl combine the nuts with the cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, pepper, flour, and cocoa powder.  Cut the fruit into 1/2-inch pieces and toss with the nut mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small saucepan, stir together the honey and sugar.  Over high heat, bring to a boil without stirring.  Using a pastry brush dipped in water, brush the sides of the pan to remove any undissolved sugar granules.  Cook until the sugar reaches 224 to 240 degrees (soft ball stage) on a candy thermometer.  Remove from the heat and pour into the fruit mixture.  Stir to combine as well as possible.  The mixture will be very thick and sticky.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dip your hands in water and press the fruit mixture evenly into the pan.  Bake for 1 hour, until the top is slightly puffed and the surface is matte.  Remove from the oven and cool completely in the pan.  Trim the rice paper around the edge of the mold.  Store at room temperature, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, for several weeks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 12 to 20 slices.

Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  basmati rice -- washed, drained
     1/4           cup  peanut or canola oil
  2                     shallots - (to 3) -- finely chopped
  2               cups  green beans in 1" lengths
  1           teaspoon  tomato paste
  3                     plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely chopped
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     3/4                salt
  1           teaspoon  ground dried lime
                        = (or 1 tbspn fresh lime juice)
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1              pinch  ground turmeric
  1              large  boiling potato

Soak the rice for 30 minutes in lukewarm water that covers it generously.  Drain.

While the rice is soaking, put the oil in a medium pan and set over medium-high heat.  When it is hot, add the shallots.  Stir and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the shallots are lightly browned.  Put in the green beans and stir them around for 3 minutes.  Now add the tomato paste and tomatoes as well as 3 tablespoons of water (or liquid from the can of tomatoes), 1/4 teaspoon of the 3/4 teaspoon salt.  Stir and bring to a simmer.  Cover, turn the heat down to low, and simmer gently for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the beans are tender.  Add the lime and stir to mix.  Set aside.

Put 10 cups of water into a large pot and bring to a rolling boil.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons salt and mix in.  Scatter the rice into the boiling water and bring to a boil again.  Boil rapidly for 5 1/2 minutes, or until the rice is almost done but still has a very slim hard core in its very center.  Drain the rice immediately and leave in a sieve or colander.

Put the butter in a nonstick pan and set it over low heat.  Add 2 tablespoons of water and turmeric.  Peel the potato and cut it crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick rounds.  Lay a round in the center of the pan.  Surround it with the other rounds until you have no more space left.  You can cut some of the rounds if needed to almost cover the bottom.  A few blank spaces are fine.

As soon as all the butter has melted, divide the rice into 3 parts and spread 1 part over the potatoes.  Top this rice with half of the green beans, spreading them out evenly.  Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon over them.  Cover the beans with the final layer of rice.  Cover the pot and turn the heat to medium-high.  After 4 minutes, turn the heat down to medium-low.  After another 4 minutes, lift the cover and quickly drape a dish towel over its underside and then put it back on the pan.  (The towel will be between the pan and the lid.)  Flip the ends of the towel on top of the lid so they do not burn.  Turn the heat down to very low and cook 30 minutes.

To serve:  Have a large, warm serving plate ready.  Remove the cover and slide a knife along the inside of the pan to loosen the rice.  Put the serving plate on top of the rice.  Now upturn it and invert its contents, rice and crust, onto your serving plate.  The "cake" will crumble a little, spreading out at the bottom, but this is as it should be.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  russet or Yukon Gold potatoes
  1             medium  onion
     1/2           cup  chopped scallions including green part
  1              large  egg beaten
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

Peel the potatoes and put in cold water.  Using a grater or a food processor coarsely grate the potatoes and onions.  Place together in a fine-mesh strainer or tea towel and squeeze all the water over a bowl.  The potato starch will settle to the bottom; reserve that after you have carefully poured off the water.

Mix the potato and onion with the potato starch.  Add the scallions, egg, and salt and pepper.

Heat a griddle or non-stick pan and coat with a thin film of vegetable oil.  Take about 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture in the palm of your hand and flatten as best you can.  Place the potato mixture on the griddle, flatten with a spatula, and fry for a few minutes until golden.  Flip the pancake over and brown the other side.  Remove to paper towels to drain.

Serve immediately.  You can also freeze the potato pancakes and crisp them in a 350 degree oven at a later time.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5 1/2         pounds  duckling
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     onion -- sliced
  1                cup  red currant jelly
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice

Season both the outside and inside of the duckling with salt and pepper.  Place the onion inside the duck.  Truss the bird and prick the skin.  Dry thoroughly.

Place the duck breast-side up in a roasting pan and place in the center rack of a 425 degree preheated oven for 15 minutes to brown lightly.  Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and roast for 1 additional hour to 1 hour and 25 minutes.  Remove accumulated fat occasionally with a bulb baster.

The duck is done to medium-rare if the juices from the fattest part of the thigh or drumstick run faintly rosy when the duck is pricked, and when the duck is lifted and drained, the last drops of juice from the vent are pale rose.  The duck is well done when the juices run pale yellow.

Remove the duck from the oven, discard trussing strings, and place on a serving platter.  Let sit for 10 minutes before carving.

In a saucepan, combine the red currant jelly and the lemon juice.  Bring to a boil, strain, and serve with the duck.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

        Roast Fillet Of Beef, Red Pepper, And Mustard-Chive Sauces

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3 1/2         pounds  fillet of beef -- at room temperature
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CHIPOTLE-RED PEPPER SAUCE ===
  3               cups  thinly-sliced red bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     canned chipotle chili in adobo -- unseeded
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
                        === MUSTARD-CHIVE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  dry mustard
  3        tablespoons  distilled white vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  3        tablespoons  water
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut into bits,
                        and softened
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh chives

Roast fillet of beef:  In a heavy flameproof roasting pan heat the oil over moderately-high heat until it is hot but smoking, add the beef, patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper, and brown it, turning it every 2 minutes, for 10 minutes.  Roast the beef in a preheated 500 degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until a meat thermometer registers 130 degrees.  The narrow end of the beef will be medium-rare; the wide end will be rare.  Serve the beef with the sauces.

Chipotle-Red Pepper Sauce:  In a heavy skillet cook the bell peppers in the oil, covered, over moderately-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they are soft.  In a blender puree the mixture with the chipotle, the Worcestershire sauce, and salt to taste.  The sauce may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled.  Transfer the sauce to a sauceboat and serve it warm or at room temperature.

Mustard-Chive Sauce:  In a small bowl stir together the mustard, the vinegar, the sugar, the salt, and 3 tablespoons water, making a smooth paste, and let the mixture stand, covered, for 10 minutes.  Transfer the mixture to the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water and whisk in the butter until it is just melted and incorporated thoroughly.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the chives.  Transfer the sauce to a sauceboat and serve it warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

         Roast Pheasant With Heather And Whiskey Raspberry Gravy

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Ann Willan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     heather sprigs - (to 4)
  2        tablespoons  Scotch whisky
  2                     pheasants
  1               pint  raspberries
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     thin slices bacon
  1         tablespoon  flour
  1                cup  well-reduced veal or chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  red currant jelly

Heat the oven to 400 degrees.  Set aside 4 small sprigs of heather for decoration and pound the rest with a rolling pin to bruise and release flavors.  Pour the whisky over the heather on a plate and leave to soak.

Crush the raspberries and put them inside the pheasants.  Spread the birds with softened butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Wrap them in bacon, securing the whisky-soaked heather inside.  Tie the birds with string and set them in a small roasting pan.  Pour over any whisky from the heather.

Roast the birds in the oven, basting them often and turning them from time to time so they brown evenly, 35 to 45 minutes.  When done they should be well browned and the legs will wiggle when pulled.  Tip raspberries from the birds into the pan, transfer them to a carving board and cover them with foil to keep warm.

For gravy: stir flour into the pan juices and cook, stirring, 1 to 2 minutes until browned.  Add stock and bring the gravy to a boil, stirring to dissolve pan juices.  Simmer it 2 minutes or until concentrated, then strain into a small pan.  Whisk in red currant jelly and heat until melted.  Stir in remaining raspberries and cook 1 to 2 minutes until just soft.  Taste gravy and adjust the seasoning.

Using poultry shears, discard string from the pheasants and cut them in half, discarding backbone.  Arrange them overlapping on a serving dish or on individual plates.  Spoon over the raspberries with a little gravy, serving the rest separately.  Decorate the pheasants with heather sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                cup  orange juice
     1/4           cup  sweet sherry or port wine -- for deglazing
                        === PORK ===
  1                     leg of pork -  (8 to 9 lbs)
  1           teaspoon  salt

For The Marinade:  Place all the ingredients except the juice in a large mortar and pound to a paste with a pestle.  Stir in the bitter orange juice.  If desired puree these ingredients in a blender or food processor.  Set aside.

For The Pork:  Trim the skin only from the back of the leg.  Wipe the leg of pork clean.  Make several deep incisions all around the leg, except for the skin.  Rub with salt.  Allow to rest for a few minutes.  Rub pork all over with the marinade, pushing it in the deep gashes made all over the leg.  Cover with plastic film and refrigerate, preferably overnight or for a couple of hours.  Wipe the marinade from the skin with a clean cloth.

Cooking The Pork:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place the leg on a roasting pan.  Bake uncovered with the skin-side up for about 4 hours.  Check the roast often and add some orange juice and water if the pan juices dry out.  Cook until the skin is like a crackling and the juices run clear when the meat is pierced on the thickest part of the leg (about 160 degrees on a meat thermometer), about 3 1/2 hours

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     spring chicken  - (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
                        === MARINADE ===

  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === STUFFING ===
     1/4           cup  dried chestnuts
  3                     dried black mushrooms
  1         tablespoon  cooking oil
  2                     Chinese sausage - (2 oz ea) -- diced
  2             medium  shallots -- thinly sliced
  2                     green onion stalks -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro
  2        tablespoons  oyster-flavored sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1                cup  cooked glutinous rice (sweet rice)

Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add sausage; stir-fry until sausage is slightly crisp, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Add shallots, green onions, chestnuts, mushrooms and cilantro.  Cook for 1 minute.  Stir in oyster-flavored sauce, and sesame oil.  Remove pan from heat and add rice; mix well.  Let stuffing cool.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Just before roasting, place stuffing inside chicken; enclose with skewers.  Place chicken, breast-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan.  Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of thigh meat, without touching bone.  Bake until thermometer registers 180 to 185 degrees, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  During the last half of roasting time, baste chicken occasionally with pan juices.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  large shrimp with heads
                        === SHRIMP-HEAD BROTH ===
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2           cups  chopped tomatoes
  1 1/2         quarts  chicken broth, fish broth or water
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine
                        === BISQUE ===
     1/2           cup  short-grain rice such as Arborio,
                        Carnaroli or Vialone Nano
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter or shrimp butter
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  minced chervil or parsley

Twist off heads and peel the shrimp.  Reserve the heads and shells and chop them for 30 seconds in a food processor.  Devein the shrimp if necessary and refrigerate until needed.

Cook the onion in butter in a 4-quart pot over medium heat until it turns transulent, about 10 minutes.  Add the chopped shrimp heads and shells, the tomatoes, wine and the broth.  Cover the pot and simmer gently for 30 minutes.  Strain the shrimp broth, discard the solids that donít go through the strainer, and reserve the broth.

Combine 2 cups of the shrimp broth with the rice in a small saucepan.  Cover the pot and simmer the mixture gently, for about 30 minutes, until the rice is completely cooked -- in fact overcooked and mushy.  Puree the rice mixture, butter and remaining shrimp in a blender or food processor for 2 minutes.

Combine the mixture with the rest of the shrimp broth.  Bring the shrimp broth/rice mixture to a simmer, whisk in the cream, and strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean pot.  Bring the soup back to a simmer, add the shrimp cubes, and season with salt and cayenne to taste.  If the soup seems too thick, you may have to dilute it slightly with a small amount of broth or water.  Serve in hot bowls and sprinkle with chervil an parsley.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

          Spicy Chicken Wings With Gorgonzola Cilantro Dressing

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  chicken wings
     1/2        gallon  peanut or vegetable oil
  1                     large bottle red pepper sauce
                        === GORGONZOLA CILANTRO DRESSING ===
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  1                cup  sour cream
  6             ounces  Gorgonzola cheese - (to 8 oz) -- cut and crumbled
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh cilantro - (to 2 tbsp
  6                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut for dipping
  6                     celery stalks -- cleaned, and
                        cut for dipping

Cut chicken wings at the joint, discarding the outermost bony portion of the wing.  Rinse the wings, let dry and set aside.  Place oil in a large stockpot and place on stovetop over a medium-high heat.  Be very careful when deep frying in the kitchen, and pay careful attention to how the oil looks.  If the oil is smoking when there is nothing in the pot then the oil has gotten too hot, turn off the heat immediately and cover the pot if you can.  Let the oil cool and start over again.  Never place anything in heated oil that is dripping wet unless it is a batter.

Place dried chicken wings in heated oil in batches so that the oil temperature stays constant.  Cook the wings until they are golden brown and the meat starts to pull away from the bones.  Remove the wings from the hot oil with a slotted spoon into a mixing bowl.  Add enough red pepper sauce to evenly coat the wings, and place wings in broiler pan.  Crisp wings under broiler quickly and serve with Gorgonzola Cilantro Dressing.

Gorgonzola Cilantro Dressing:  In a mixing bowl place mayonnaise, sour cream, Gorgonzola cheese, salt and cilantro.  Let sit for at least 1 hour before serving so that the flavors meld together.  Serve with carrots and celery along with the spicy chicken wings.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  firm ripe tomatoes
                        Salt -- to taste
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried thyme)
  1         tablespoon  oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  dry white bread crumbs

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Cut the tomatoes in half, crosswise.  With your index finger poke out the seeds from the cavities.  Sprinkle the halves lightly with salt and put the tomato upside down on a rack to drain for 20 minutes or more.

Blend all of the remaining ingredients in a mixing bowl.  Correct the seasoning.  Sprinkle the insides of each tomato half with black pepper, then fill with 1 or 2 spoonfuls of the stuffing.  Sprinkle with a few drops of olive oil.  Arrange the tomatoes in an oiled baking dish.  They can be prepared up to this point several hours ahead.

Place the baking dish in the upper third of the preheated oven and bake the tomatoes until tender but still holding their shape, 10 to 15 minutes.  The bread crumb filling should be lightly browned.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  small pearl tapioca -- (if unavailable,
                        use large pearl tapioca)
  4               cups  soy milk
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     3/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  3                     egg whites -- at room temperature
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar

Soak the tapioca in warm water to cover for 1 hour.  Drain and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly butter a 12-inch oval or gratin baking dish and place it in a large brownie pan.

Mix the tapioca, soy milk, sugar, and salt in a heavy non-aluminum saucepan.  Bring the soy milk to a boil over medium heat while whisking.  Lower the heat and let the mixture simmer 10 minutes, whisking occasionally.  Remove from the heat and quickly whisk in the egg yolks, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

In another bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until just stiff.  Whisk 1/2 a cupful into the tapioca, then fold the remaining in.  Pour the tapioca mixture into the prepared baking dish.

Place the baking dish and brownie pan in the middle shelf of the oven and pour several inches of boiling water around the outside.  Bake about 35 minutes, until the top is puffed and golden.  The inside will still be a little soft.  Remove, cool slightly, and serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     tart apple
                        Zest and juice of l/2 lemon
  6             ounces  seedless grapes -- halved
     1/2           cup  dark raisins
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
     1/3           cup  light brown sugar
     1/4           cup  slivered almonds
  1         tablespoon  chopped candied orange peel
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  dark rum
  1              quart  vanilla ice cream

Peel, core and dice the apple and mix it in a large bowl with the grated lemon rind and juice so the apple does not discolor.  Stir in the grapes, dark and golden raisins, sugar, almonds, candied orange peel, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves until evenly mixed.

Scoop the ice cream into individual bowls.  Melt the butter in a large frying pan and add the mincemeat.  Fry it, stirring constantly, until very hot and the juice runs from the fruit, 3 to 5 minutes.

Pull the fruit to one side of the pan and add the rum in the other.  Heat it until almost boiling, then flame it.  Stir it into the hot fruit so the whole pan flames.  Let the flames die, then spoon the mincemeat over the ice cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Peel, core and dice the apple and mix it in a large bowl with the grated lemon rind and juice so the apple does not discolor.  Stir in the grapes, dark and golden raisins, sugar, almonds, candied orange peel, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves until evenly mixed.

Scoop the ice cream into individual bowls.  Melt the butter in a large frying pan and add the mincemeat.  Fry it, stirring constantly, until very hot and the juice runs from the fruit, 3 to 5 minutes.

Pull the fruit to one side of the pan and add the rum in the other.  Heat it until almost boiling, then flame it.  Stir it into the hot fruit so the whole pan flames.  Let the flames die, then spoon the mincemeat over the ice cream.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  canola or corn oil
  2             medium  tomatoes -- cored, and
                        cut into 1/4" dice
     1/2           cup  minced scallions, white part only
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
     3/4           cup  rice wine or sake
  5               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
     1/2         pound  snow peas -- ends snapped,
                        and veiny strings removed
  2 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch -- mixed with
  6        tablespoons  water
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten with
  2        tablespoons  water

Heat a heavy soup pot over high heat, add the oil, and heat until hot, about 20 seconds.  Add the tomatoes and scallions, and stir-fry until fragrant, about 15 seconds.  Add the soy sauce and rice wine or sake, and stir-fry over high heat for 20 seconds.  Add the water and salt, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 2 minutes, skimming the surface to remove any impurities.  Add the snow peas and stir.

Slowly add the cornstarch mixture and bring the liquid to a boil, stirring to prevent lumps from forming.  Once slightly thickened, remove from the heat and slowly add the beaten eggs, pouring them in a thin stream around the edge of the pot.  Carefully stir once or twice so that the eggs form thin streamers.  Taste for seasoning and ladle into serving bowls.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE DOUGH ===
  2               cups  White Lily flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
  6             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  4        tablespoons  whole milk - (to 5 tbspns) -- cold
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4              large  yellow onions -- halved through the r
                        and sliced into 1/8"-thick slices
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry - (to 4 tbspns) -- (optional)
  3                     anchovies packed in salt -- rinsed in cool water
                        and broken into 1/4" pieces
  25                    pitted black olives - (to 30) -- such as Saracene,
                        Kalamata, or Nicoise
  8                     whole thyme sprigs - (to 10)
                        === SPECIAL ITEMS ===
                        Fluted ring, 12" dia, with removable
                        bottom, or a 12" flan ring
                        Baking stone -- (optional)

To prepare the dough:  In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade or in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour and salt and pulse or mix on low to incorporate.  Add the butter and pulse a few times or mix on low, until it's the consistency of a fine meal.  Add the milk and pulse or mix on low until the dough barely comes together.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface.  Dip the heel of your hand in flour and, working with small sections, smear the dough away from you to blend it together.  When the dough has been all smeared out, using a metal scraper or spatula, scrape and gather it together and knead a few times to gather into a ball.  Flatten into a disc, and wrap in plastic to chill until firm, about 1 to 2 hours or overnight.

In a large saucepan, over low heat, combine the olive oil, onions, salt and pepper.  Add 1/2 of the sherry and cook slowly for about 45 minutes to an hour until caramelized, stirring occasionally.  Stir in another tablespoon of sherry, to taste, and set aside to cool.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to a circle, 1/8-thick, flouring the surface of the dough as necessary.  Line the tart ring with the dough and chill until firm, about 30 minutes.

Remove the oven rack from the oven and place the baking stone directly on the floor of the oven.  If you donít have a baking stone, youíll still need to remove the rack and place the tart on a baking sheet directly on the floor of the oven.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees at least one hour before baking to warm up the baking stone.

Evenly distribute the onions over the dough.  Cover the tart loosely with foil, taking care that the foil doesnít touch the tomatoes.

Bake for 1 1/2 hours.  About 30 minutes before the tart is done, remove it from the oven and lift off the foil.  Evenly distribute the olives, anchovies and thyme sprigs on top, and return the tart to the oven to finish baking.

This recipe yields 1 (12-inch) tart.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees at least one hour before baking to warm up the baking stone.

Evenly distribute the onions over the dough.  Cover the tart loosely with foil, taking care that the foil doesnít touch the tomatoes.

Bake for 1 1/2 hours.  About 30 minutes before the tart is done, remove it from the oven and lift off the foil.  Evenly distribute the olives, anchovies and thyme sprigs on top, and return the tart to the oven to finish baking.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pounds  fresh or frozen whole yuca -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3" sections, see * Note
  1         tablespoon  salt -- or to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              small  Spanish onions -- sliced thin rings
  12                    garlic cloves -- finely minced, or
                        mashed to a paste with mortar and pestle
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/3           cup  bitter orange juice or a mixture of
                        lime juice and orange juice -- (reduce amount if
                        a less tart taste is desired)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  About 5 pounds trimmed weight or 5 pounds frozen chunks, preferably Costa Rican yuca from La Fe brand.

Place the yuca in a large 6-quart pot.  Cover with 5 quarts cold water.  Add the salt and bring to boil over high heat.  Lower heat to medium and cook covered until it feels tender when pierced with a fork but still keeps its shape, about 30 minutes.  Be careful not to overcook because yuca can turn into a gooey paste.  Turn the heat to low and leave the yuca in the hot water until ready to serve.

For The Mojo Sauce:  While the yuca cooks, prepare the mojo sauce.  Heat the olive oil until fragrant in a medium frying pan over medium-high heat.  Saute the onion rings until lightly golden.  Add the garlic and the cumin and saute, stirring for a few seconds, until golden.  Pour in the bitter orange juice.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Very quickly, drain the yuca in a large colander and transfer to a decorative serving platter.  Cover with the mojo sauce and serve piping hot.  In Cuba and the Hispanic Caribbean, yuca con mojo is served alongside rice and beans and roast pork.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.
