Recipe By     :Benard Tamburello, Bernie's Grill, Chelsea, MA
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     snapper filet - (6 to 8 oz)
     1/2           cup  cracker meal -- for breading
     1/2           cup  yellow meal -- for breading
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/2                vegetable oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  blacking mix
  5                     button mushrooms -- quartered
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- cut in half
  1                     lemon
     1/4           cup  white wine
  1                cup  heavy cream (40% fat)
     1/2           cup  shrimp - (90/110 per lb)
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1              bunch  parsley -- chopped
  1              bunch  scallions -- chopped

Put oil in pan and heat to 350 degrees.  Mix cracker meal, yellow meal and flour.  Dredge fish through breading.  Put fish in pan and brown on both sides.  Do not burn fish, if too thick.  Turn oven on to 350 degrees and finish cooking in oven.  Fish is done if a toothpick goes through it easily.

For Sauce:  Heat pan to high heat.  Add blacking mix.  Don't burn it!  Add room temperature butter.  To keep from burning, shake pan or remove from heat.  Add mushrooms and brown.  The mushrooms will soak up all of the butter, so shake pan.  Once mushrooms are brown, add wine to deglaze.  Once wine separates, squeeze lemon and add cream.  Reduce cream until thick.

Add shrimp, parsley, and scallions.  When shrimp is pink and cooked, add garlic and butter.  Take off stove, mix, and pour over fish.  Enjoy!

This recipe yields 1 serving.

                        Olive oil -- as needed
  4                     thin chicken breast cutlets
  2             ounces  low-salt bacon -- cut in 1/4" pieces

  1           teaspoon  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper

Comments:  Take your chips for a dip in this top secret take on the cheesy Chili's Chili Queso.  Combine a bottle of Cheez Whiz with ground beef and spices, heat it all up, then bust out the tortilla chips and commence dipping.

                    Claim Jumper's Garlic Cheese Bread

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPREAD ===
     1/2           cup  butter
     3/4           cup  shredded cheddar cheese
  2        tablespoons  grated parmesan cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
  1               dash  paprika
                        === BREAD ===
  12            slices  Texas toast
                        = (or 1 large French bread loaf,
                        sliced through the middle)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Combine all ingredients for the Spread in a small bowl.

Smear spread generously on one side of each slice of Texas toast or on the face of each half of French bread loaf.

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until cheese begins to brown and bubble.

This recipe yields about 12 slices toast or two large halves of French bread.

Comments:  Claim Jumper restaurants may only be located in the west, but the chain can claim national recognition for its delicious garlic cheese bread and toast that's served on the side with your meal.  That's because you can often find the tasty stuff in the frozen food section of your local supermarket.  But if you've got a little time to make some of your own, it won't take much work.  Just whip up a spread from these basic ingredients, then apply generously to thick sliced "Texas toast" bread, or onto the face a fresh French loaf.  Crank up the oven and prepare yourself for a trip to taste bud heaven.

  2                     corn tortillas
                        Oil -- for frying
  1              large  romaine lettuce head -- rinsed, spun dry

     1/2           cup  grated cotija cheese -- see * Note
  1                     red pepper -- roasted, and
                        cut into julienne strips
     1/2           cup  roasted pumpkin seeds (pepitas)
                        === CILANTRO-PEPITA DRESSING ===
  1             medium  Anaheim chile -- roasted, peeled
                        and seeded
  3        tablespoons  roasted pumpkin seeds (pepitas)
  1              large  garlic clove
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

     3/4           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  water

* Note:  If cotija cheese is unavailable, use any hard grating cheese, such as cacique or even Parmesan.

Cut tortillas into matchstick-size strips.  Heat oil for deep-frying and add tortilla strips.  Cook a few seconds until crisp.  Remove with slotted spoon, drain and set aside.

Tear romaine lettuce into bite-size pieces.  Place greens on six salad plates and ladle Cilantro-Pepita Dressing on each salad.  Sprinkle each dish with cotija cheese and tortilla strips.  Arrange four red pepper strips like spokes on top of each salad and garnish with pepitas.

Cilantro-Pepita Dressing:  Place chile, pepitas, garlic, pepper, salt, oil, vinegar and cotija cheese in blender or food processor.  Blend about 10 seconds, then add cilantro, bit by bit, until smoothly blended.  Place mayonnaise and water in large stainless-steel bowl and whisk until smooth.  Add blended chile mixture and mix thoroughly.  Place in airtight container and refrigerate.  Dressing may be stored up to three days.  (Makes about 2 cups)

Cilantro-Pepita Dressing:  Place chile, pepitas, garlic, pepper, salt, oil, vinegar and cotija cheese in blender or food processor.  Blend about 10 seconds, then add cilantro, bit by bit, until smoothly blended.  Place mayonnaise and water in large stainless-steel bowl and whisk until smooth.  Add blended chile mixture and mix thoroughly.  Place in airtight container and refrigerate.  Dressing may be stored up to three days.  (Makes about 2 cups)

                           Fritos' Hot Bean Dip

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Dips/Spreads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  pinto beans - (15 oz) -- drained
  4                     bottled jalapeÒo slices (nacho slices)
  1         tablespoon  juice from bottled jalapeÒo slices
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/8      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper

Combine drained pinto beans with the other ingredients in a food processor.  Puree ingredients on high speed until smooth.  Cover and chill for at least an hour before serving.

This recipe yields 1 1/4 cups.

Comments:  Recreate the popular bean dip at home in just minutes with a food processor -- just pour all the ingredients in and fire it up.  The best part about this recipe is that we can duplicate the taste of the popular dip without any added fat.  If you check out the label of the real thing you'll see that there's hydrogenated oil in there.  We can avoid this saturated fat without sacrificing flavor with a home clone that's a perfect healthy choice for dipping.

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 9     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  instant coffee
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  Coffee-mate creamer -- plus
  1         tablespoon  Coffee-mate creamer
     1/8      teaspoon  cinnamon

Grind the instant coffee into powder using a coffee grinder.

Mix all ingredients together in a small bowl. Store in a sealed container.

To make coffee, measure 2 tablespoons of the powdered mix into a coffee cup. Add 8 ounces (1 cup) of boiling water and stir.

This recipe yields 9 servings.

Comments:  With just a few simple ingredients you can recreate the European-style coffees that come in rectangular tins at a fraction of the cost.  Since these famous instant coffee blends are created by Maxwell House, itís best to use Maxwell House instant coffee, although Iíve tried them with Folgers and Tasterís Choice, and the recipes still work out fine.  Youíll also need a coffee bean grinder to grind the instant coffee into powder.  When youíre finished making the mix, you can store it for as long as you like in a sealed container, until youíre ready for a hot coffee drink.  At that point, simply measure some of the mix into a cup with boiling water.  Stir it all up and enjoy while watching shows about Europe on the Travel Channel to enhance the experience.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
     1/2      teaspoon  dried parsley flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  fresgly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  MSG
                        = (Accent brand is good)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/8      teaspoon  onion powder
  1              pinch  dried thyme

Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and whisk until smooth.  Cover and chill for several hours before using.

This recipe yields 1 cup.

Comments:  Indeed, ranch dressing was invented at Hidden Valley Ranch near Santa Barbara, California, by a real salad-wranglin' rancher.  In the '50s and '60s Steve Henson and his wife, Gayle, shared their 120-acre dude ranch with University of California at Santa Barbara students and other festive partiers for rousing weekend shindigs.  The dozens of guests were serve meals of steaks and salads topped with Steve's special blend of herbs, spices, mayonnaise and buttermilk.  As word got out about the fabulous dressing more guests were showing up at the ranch and walking home with complimentary take-home jars filled with the stuff.  Eventually Steve figured he could make a little cash on the side by packaging the dressing as a dry mix and selling it through the mail.  At first he was filling envelopes himself, but within a few months Steve had to hire 12 more people to help with the packaging.  Soon Steve had a multi-million dollar business on his hands, from a product that for 10 years he had been giving away for free.

                      Jimmy Dean's Breakfast Sausage

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pork                            Sausage


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAGE ===
  16            ounces  ground pork
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  rubbed sage
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  MSG
                        = (such as Accent flavor enhancer)
                        === HOT ===
  16            ounces  ground pork
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  rubbed sage
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  MSG (such as Accent)
                        === MAPLE ===
  16            ounces  ground pork
  3        tablespoons  maple flavored syrup
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  MSG (such as Accent)
     1/4      teaspoon  coriander

Combine all ingredients for the flavor of your choice in a medium bowl.  Form the sausage into patties and cook in a skillet over medium heat until brown.

This recipe yields 1 pound of either sausage.

Comments:  Before he became America's sausage king, Jimmy Dean was known for crooning the country hit "Big Bad John."  That song came out in 1962 and sold over 8 million copies.  His singing success launched a television career on ABC with "The Jimmy Dean Show" where Roy Clark, Patsy Cline and Roger Miller got their big breaks.  The TV exposure led to acting roles for Jimmy, as a regular on "Daniel Boone" and in feature films including his debut in the James Bond flick "Diamonds are Forever."

Knowing that a show business career is an unpredictable one, Jimmy socked his money away in hog-farming investments.  In 1968, the Jimmy Dean Meat Company developed a special recipe to transform those piggies into the sausage that is now a household name.  Today the company is part of the Sara Lee Corporation, but Jimmy is still chairman of the board of his division, and he still appears on TV in commercials for the brand, even at the age of 70.

This clone recipe recreates three varieties of the famous roll sausage that you form into patties and cook in a skillet.  Use ground pork found at the supermarket (make it lean pork, if you like), or grind some up yourself if you have a meat grinder laying around for some good old-fashioned fun.

Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer according to the manufactor's instructions.  Or, if you're using a skillet pour in about an inch of oil and heat over medium-high heat to 370 degrees.

Cut up chicken wings into three parts, discard wing tip.  Add the chicken wings and cook them until golden brown and crip on both sides, about 8 minutes in all.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the wings to paper towels to drain off any excess oil.

Combine all of the ingredients for the sauce in a large saucepan and stir over medium-high heat until the sauce begins to simmer.  Reduce the heat to low and add the chicken wings.  Simmer the dish until it's hot throughout, about 10 minutes.

To make the Bleu Cheese Dipping Sauce:  Stir the mayonnaise and the bleu cheese together.  Use right away or chill until serving time.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
  2               cups  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === CABBAGE MIX ===

  1               head  green cabbage - (abt 2 lbs) -- shredded

Make dressing first so it's ready to toss on vegetables as soon as they are shredded.  In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, garlic, pepper and salt.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, toss the carrots and cabbage.  Immediately pour dressing over cabbage mix and toss until all vegetables are well-coated.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Sponge Cake Layer -- (see below)
  32            ounces  cream cheese -- room temperature
                        = (the regular variety, not light,
                        Neufchatel cream cheese)
  1 2/3           cups  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  pure vanilla extract
  2                     extra-large eggs
     3/4           cup  heavy whipping cream
                        === THIN SPONGE CAKE LAYER ===
     1/2           cup  sifted cake flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1              pinch  salt
  3                     extra-large eggs -- separated
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  3              drops  pure lemon extract
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and generously butter a 9-inch springform pan.

Make the batter for the Thin Sponge Cake Layer as the recipe directs.  Evenly spread the batter on the bottom of the pan, and bake just until set and golden, about 10 minutes.  Place the cake on a wire rack to cool (do not remove it from the pan).

While the cake cools, make the cream cheese filling:  Place one 8-ounce package of the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the cornstarch in a large bowl.  Beat with an electric mixer on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, then beat in the remaining 3 packages of cream cheese.

Increase the mixer speed to high and beat in the remaining 1 1/3 cups of the sugar, then beat in the vanilla.  Blend in the eggs, one at a time, beating the batter well after adding each one.  Blend in the heavy cream.  At this point, mix the filling only until completely blended (just like they do at Junior's).  Be careful not to over mix the batter.

Gently spoon the cheese filling on top of the baked sponge cake layer.  Place the springform pan in a large shallow pan containing hot water that comes about 1-inch up the sides of the pan.  Bake the cheesecake until the center barely jiggles when you shake the pan, about 1 hour.

Cool the cake on a wire rack for 1 hour.  Then cover the cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate until it's completely cold, at least 4 hours or overnight.  Remove the sides of the springform pan.  Slide the cake off of the bottom of the pan onto a serving plate.  Or if you wish, simply leave the cake on the removable bottom of the pan and place it on a serving plate.  If any cake is left over, cover it with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator.

Thin Sponge Cake Layer:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and generously butter a 9-inch springform pan.  Sift the cake flour, baking powder and salt together in a medium-size bowl and set aside.

Beat the egg yolks together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high for 3 minutes.  Then, with the mixer still running, gradually add the 1/3 cup of sugar and continue beating until thick light-yellow ribbons form in the bowl, about 5 minutes more.  Beat in the vanilla and lemon extracts.

Sift the flour mixture over the batter and stir it in by hand until no more white flecks appear.  Then blend in the butter.

In a clean bowl, using clean dry beaters, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar together on high until frothy.  Gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form (the whites should stand up in stiff peaks, but not be dry).  Stir about 1/3 cup of the whites into the batter, then gently fold in the remaining whites (don't worry if a few white specks remain).

Gently spoon the batter into the pan.  Bake the cake just until the center of the cake springs back when lightly touched, only about 10 minutes (watch carefully!).  Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack while you continue making the cheesecake filling.  Do not remove the cake from the pan.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

           Junior's Fresh Brisket Of Beef With Delicious Gravy

Recipe By     :Junior's Restaurant, Brooklyn, NY
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fresh first-cut beef brisket - (abt 5 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2               cups  chopped carrots
  6              large  garlic cloves -- minced
                        === DELICIOUS GRAVY ===
  3        tablespoons  fat skimmed from drippings
                        = (or 3 tbspns unsalted butter)
  6               cups  strained pan drippings
                        = (save the vegetables -- if you wish)
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Rub the brisket with the salt and pepper and place it, fat-side-up, in a roasting pan.  Pour in enough water to come about two-thirds up the sides of the brisket.  Sprinkle the carrots and garlic into the water around the roast.

Roast the brisket, without covering it, until it is browned and tender, about 3 hours, spooning the pan drippings frequently over the meat.  If necessary, add a little extra water during the cooking to keep the liquid at least halfway up the sides of the brisket.  Transfer the brisket to a serving platter.

To make the Delicious Gravy:  Skim off any fat from the drippings into large skillet.  You need 3 tablespoons of fat; if necessary, just add a little butter to equal this amount.  Strain the drippings into a large heatproof measuring cup, reserving the vegetables for the gravy, if you wish.

Heat the fat in the skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and cook until it begins to soften.  Whisk in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour mixture bubbles all over, about 2 minutes.  Gradually pour in the straining drippings and continue cooking and whisking until the gravy thickens.  Remove the gravy from the heat and stir in the reserved vegetables, if you wish.  (Makes 4 cups Delicious Gravy)

To serve:  Slice the brisket on the diagonal, about 1/2-inch thick.  Serve it up hot with a generous helping of gravy ladled over the top.  This goes great with mashed potatoes.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 generous servings.

Comments:  Every morning, one of the oversized ovens in the Junior's downstairs kitchen is busy roasting a giant-sized brisket of beef.  And for good reason; this is one of Junior's blue-ribbon specialties.  It's just one more taste of that home-style cooking that Junior's is famous for -- served up in style with its own gravy, made straight from the pan drippings (what else?).

The best part of this dish: It roasts in the oven for three hours, asking for very little attention from you.  But the flavors are so delicious that it tasted like you've worked all day.

The Junior's Way -- Most brisket recipes ask you to boil the meat in a pot of water.  Junior's does it differently: The chef roasts the brisket in an open pan.  He starts the roasting with enough water in the pan to come about two-thirds up the sides of the beef.  As the drippings begin simmering, he bastes the meat with the drippings several times during cooking.  The brisket comes out very tender, but with a roasted flavor. "Always slice the meat on the diagonal -- it's guaranteed to be tender and juicy."

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Rub the brisket with the salt and pepper and place it, fat-side-up, in a roasting pan.  Pour in enough water to come about two-thirds up the sides of the brisket.  Sprinkle the carrots and garlic into the water around the roast.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast the brisket, without covering it, until it is browned and tender, about 3 hours, spooning the pan drippings frequently over the meat.  If necessary, add a little extra water during the cooking to keep the liquid at least halfway up the sides of the brisket.  Transfer the brisket to a serving platter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Delicious Gravy:  Skim off any fat from the drippings into large skillet.  You need 3 tablespoons of fat; if necessary, just add a little butter to equal this amount.  Strain the drippings into a large heatproof measuring cup, reserving the vegetables for the gravy, if you wish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the fat in the skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and cook until it begins to soften.  Whisk in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour mixture bubbles all over, about 2 minutes.  Gradually pour in the straining drippings and continue cooking and whisking until the gravy thickens.  Remove the gravy from the heat and stir in the reserved vegetables, if you wish.  (Makes 4 cups Delicious Gravy)
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve:  Slice the brisket on the diagonal, about 1/2-inch thick.  Serve it up hot with a generous helping of gravy ladled over the top.  This goes great with mashed potatoes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 generous servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Every morning, one of the oversized ovens in the Junior&apos;s downstairs kitchen is busy roasting a giant-sized brisket of beef.  And for good reason; this is one of Junior&apos;s blue-ribbon specialties.  It&apos;s just one more taste of that home-style cooking that Junior&apos;s is famous for -- served up in style with its own gravy, made straight from the pan drippings (what else?).
</DirT>
<DirT>
The best part of this dish: It roasts in the oven for three hours, asking for very little attention from you.  But the flavors are so delicious that it tasted like you&apos;ve worked all day.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The Junior&apos;s Way -- Most brisket recipes ask you to boil the meat in a pot of water.  Junior&apos;s does it differently: The chef roasts the brisket in an open pan.  He starts the roasting with enough water in the pan to come about two-thirds up the sides of the beef.  As the drippings begin simmering, he bastes the meat with the drippings several times during cooking.  The brisket comes out very tender, but with a roasted flavor. &quot;Always slice the meat on the diagonal -- it&apos;s guaranteed to be tender and juicy.&quot;

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  2                     eggs
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract

Preheat the griddle.  If you do not have a griddle, preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  As you cook the cakes be sure that the skillet does not get too hot.

In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together, then set aside.

Using an electric mixer set on high, beat the milk and eggs until light yellow, then beat in the butter 1 tablespoon of oil, and add the vanilla.  Turn off the mixer and add in the flour mixture, and beat on low just until blended and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes (do not overbeat at this stage or the pancakes can be tough).

To cook the griddle cakes:  Brush the preheated griddle or skillet with enough vegetable oil to coat it well.  For each cake pour a scant 1/4 cup of the batter onto the hot griddle making 4-inch cakes, about 1 inch apart.  Let the cakes cook until the tops are covered with bubbles and edges look done, about 3 minutes.  Quickly flip over the cakes and cook on the opposite sides until golden, about 2 minutes more.

Serve immedately with hot melted butter, warm syrup, and warm apple and raisin preserves.

This recipe yields 12 (4-inch) pancakes.

Recipe By     :Junior's Restaurant, Brooklyn, NY
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CREPES ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  4                     extra-large eggs
  1                cup  water
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, plus
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (to 3) -- for baking the
                        crepes and filled blintzes
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
                        === CHEESE FILLING ===
  1              pound  cream cheese
  1                cup  large-curd cottage cheese (pot style)
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Applesauce -- (optional)
                        Sour cream -- (optional)

Mix the flour, sugar and cornstarch together in a small bowl and set aside.

Using an electric mixer set on high, beat the eggs, water, butter and oil together until light yellow.  Reduce the speed to low and blend in the flour mixture all at once, just until the white disappears.  Do not overbeat as this can make the crepes tough.

Pre-heat a crepe pan over medium-high until a droplet of water sprinkled on the pan sizzles.  Brush the hot pan with butter, coating it well.

For each crepe, pour about 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and immediately tilt the pan so the batter, completely but lightly, coats the bottom (some batter may move up the pan sides a little).  Cook about 30 seconds until the bottom of the crepe is golden brown (lift an edge to check).  Shake pan to loosen crepe, then gently turn it over with a spatula, being careful not to tear it.  Cook crepe on the underside about 15 seconds, just until it's set.  Turn the crepes, light underside-up, onto a cooling rack.  Refrigerate crepes for up to 2 days or freeze up to 1 month.

Make the filling:  Stir filling ingredients in a bowl until blended.  To fill each crepe, spoon 3 tablespoons of filling in the center on the underside of the crepe, then fold the edges over like an envelope: first the top edge, then the left side, the right side and finally the bottom edge.  Be sure the filling is tightly enclosed.

To fry the blintzes, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Place the filled blintzes in the skillet, folded ends down.  Fry blintzes until golden on both sides, turning once, about 5 minutes total.  Serve hot with applesauce or sour cream.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  At Junior's, they use a French crepe pan to make the thin pancake that encloses the cheese filling.  If you don't have a 6-inch crepe pan, a slope-sided small skillet will work.

                         Junior's Onion Rye Rolls

Recipe By     :Junior's Restaurant, Brooklyn, NY
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  rye flour
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  malted milk powder
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  caraway seeds
  1                cup  water -- (105 to 115 degrees)
  2           packages  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz ea)
  1                     extra-large egg
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped yellow onions
                        === FOR GLAZING ROLLS ===
  1                     extra-large egg
     1/2      teaspoon  vegetable oil

Mix together both flours, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, the malted milk powder, salt, and caraway seeds in a medium-size bowl.  Set aside.

Make the yeast sponge:  Stir the water, yeast, and the remaining tablespoon of sugar in a small bowl until dissolved.  Let the mixture stand until it is foamy and light, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, using an electric mixer equipped with a dough hook or a paddle, beat the egg and 1/3 cup oil in a large bowl on high until light yellow.  Reduce the speed to low and beat in the yeast mixture, then the flour mixture, then 1 cup of the onions.

Knead the flour mixture by beating the dough on high for 15 minutes (the dough will be smooth and elastic).

Transfer the dough to a well-buttered bowl and turn over the dough once to coat it well with the butter (the dough will be sticky).  Cover the dough and let it stand at room temperature until it's double its size (this will probably take about 1 hour).

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and butter 2 baking sheets.  Punch the dough down with your fist to deflate it.  Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface.  Flour your hands and lightly knead the dough until it's no longer sticky, about 2 minutes.

To make dinner-size 4-inch rolls:  Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces, then each piece into 3 more equal pieces, using kitchen shears.  You will have 12 little mounds of dough.  (For small twin rolls, divide the dough into 24 equal pieces.)  Flour your hands well.  Pick up each piece of dough in the palm of your hand and shape it into a rounded roll with a smooth top.  Place the rolls about 2 inches apart on the baking sheets.

Whisk the egg with the 1/2 teaspoon oil and brush this glaze on top of each roll.  Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup onions.  Cover the rolls and let them rise until light and doubled in size, about 30 minutes more.

Bake the rolls until they are golden and set, about 10 to 12 minutes for the twin rolls, 13 to 15 minutes for the buns.

Serve them warm or at room temperature or use for overstuffed sandwiches.  These are outstanding when filled with layers of freshly sliced warm corned beef on the bottom and sliced pastrami on top.

This recipe yields 12 (4" rolls) or 24 (3" rolls).

Comments:  Almost every time the giant ovens are baking away in the bake shoppe, I see at least a dozen pans of these rolls on the revolving shelves, with thirty-five rolls on each pan.  That's at least 420 of these rolls, rising and baking almost any time of day.  Each one of these rolls is the size of an oversized hamburger bun, unless the bakers are baking the smaller twin onion rye rolls, as they often do, which are only three inches in diameter instead of four.

There's good reason for making so many of these rolls.  They are the most asked-for roll that Junior's makes and are used in its most popular sandwich: Corned Beef and Pastrami on Onion Rye Rolls.

The Junior's Way -- Place the rolls about two inches apart, not touching, on the baking sheet.  As they rise and bake, the rolls are far enough apart to give rising room, and not close enough to touch their neighboring rolls in the oven.  Before placing each pan of rolls in the oven, generously sprinkle the tops of the rolls with coarsely chopped onions.

<DirS>
<DirT>
Mix together both flours, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, the malted milk powder, salt, and caraway seeds in a medium-size bowl.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the yeast sponge:  Stir the water, yeast, and the remaining tablespoon of sugar in a small bowl until dissolved.  Let the mixture stand until it is foamy and light, about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, using an electric mixer equipped with a dough hook or a paddle, beat the egg and 1/3 cup oil in a large bowl on high until light yellow.  Reduce the speed to low and beat in the yeast mixture, then the flour mixture, then 1 cup of the onions.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Knead the flour mixture by beating the dough on high for 15 minutes (the dough will be smooth and elastic).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the dough to a well-buttered bowl and turn over the dough once to coat it well with the butter (the dough will be sticky).  Cover the dough and let it stand at room temperature until it&apos;s double its size (this will probably take about 1 hour).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and butter 2 baking sheets.  Punch the dough down with your fist to deflate it.  Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface.  Flour your hands and lightly knead the dough until it&apos;s no longer sticky, about 2 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make dinner-size 4-inch rolls:  Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces, then each piece into 3 more equal pieces, using kitchen shears.  You will have 12 little mounds of dough.  (For small twin rolls, divide the dough into 24 equal pieces.)  Flour your hands well.  Pick up each piece of dough in the palm of your hand and shape it into a rounded roll with a smooth top.  Place the rolls about 2 inches apart on the baking sheets.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk the egg with the 1/2 teaspoon oil and brush this glaze on top of each roll.  Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup onions.  Cover the rolls and let them rise until light and doubled in size, about 30 minutes more.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the rolls until they are golden and set, about 10 to 12 minutes for the twin rolls, 13 to 15 minutes for the buns.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve them warm or at room temperature or use for overstuffed sandwiches.  These are outstanding when filled with layers of freshly sliced warm corned beef on the bottom and sliced pastrami on top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 12 (4&quot; rolls) or 24 (3&quot; rolls).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Almost every time the giant ovens are baking away in the bake shoppe, I see at least a dozen pans of these rolls on the revolving shelves, with thirty-five rolls on each pan.  That&apos;s at least 420 of these rolls, rising and baking almost any time of day.  Each one of these rolls is the size of an oversized hamburger bun, unless the bakers are baking the smaller twin onion rye rolls, as they often do, which are only three inches in diameter instead of four.
</DirT>
<DirT>
There&apos;s good reason for making so many of these rolls.  They are the most asked-for roll that Junior&apos;s makes and are used in its most popular sandwich: Corned Beef and Pastrami on Onion Rye Rolls.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The Junior&apos;s Way -- Place the rolls about two inches apart, not touching, on the baking sheet.  As they rise and bake, the rolls are far enough apart to give rising room, and not close enough to touch their neighboring rolls in the oven.  Before placing each pan of rolls in the oven, generously sprinkle the tops of the rolls with coarsely chopped onions.

                   Junior's Toasted Coconut Custard Pie

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Pies


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Pastry for single-crust pie
  4                     extra-large eggs
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/3            cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  pure vanilla extract
  1 1/2            cup  flaked coconut
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and butter a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate.

Mix and chill the pastry.  Roll it out 1/8-inch thick on a lightly floured surface and trim to a 15-inch circle.  Transfer the pastry to the pie plate, leaving a 1 1/2-inch overhang.  Fold under the edge to stand up 1 inch high and flute.  Prick it all over with the tines of a fork.  Place the unbaked shell in the freezer for 15 minutes.

To partially bake the shell before filling it, place a piece of foil in the center and weigh it down with pie weights, uncooked beans, or rice.  Blind-bake the crust just until it begins to set, about 8 minutes; remove the foil and pie weights and return the shell to the oven until it starts to brown, about 4 minutes more.  Transfer the crust from the oven to a cooling rack, then reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees.

While the crust is baking, make the coconut custard filling.  Using an electric mixer set on high, beat the eggs in a large bowl until thick and light yellow, about 5 minutes.  Mix the sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a small bowl and beat this mixture into the eggs until thoroughly mixed.  Reduce the speed of the mixer to medium.  Add the cream, milk, and vanilla and beat the filling until light and frothy, about 3 minutes more.  Stir in 1 1/4 cups of the coconut.  Pour the filling into the partially baked crust, dot with the butter, and sprinkle with the nutmeg.

Bake the pie for 30 minutes, sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup of coconut, and continue baking the pie until the filling is golden, the coconut is toasty, and the filling jiggles only slightly in the center, about 20 to 30 minutes more.  The pie is ready to come out of the oven when a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool the pie on a wire rack for 1 hour.  Serve the pie at room temperature or refrigerate until it's cold.  Store any leftover pie in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields one 9-inch deep-dish pie.

Comments:  If you like a creamy custard pie and you love coconut, you're in for a real treat.

Junior's has been baking coconut custard pies for over forty years -- and each one always comes out perfectly set and creamy, with chunks of coconut in every bite.  Look closely -- the top of the pie has been generously showered with coconut, which toasts and gives the pie a delicious golden glow when it comes out of the oven.

The Junior's Way -- Be sure to save 1/4 cup of the coconut to sprinkle on the top.  It bakes up golden and toasty, giving a little crunch in every bite.

Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MUSHROOM DUMPLINGS ===
  2        tablespoons  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  2                     eggs -- separated
  1           teaspoon  minced parsley
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped mushrooms
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === SOUP ===
  1                     chicken - (3 lbs) -- cut up
  2                     onions -- diced
  6                     carrots -- diced
  4                     celery stalks with tops -- sliced
  1                     parsnip -- diced
  5             sprigs  parsley -- cut into fourths
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  10               cup  water

For the Mushroom Dumplings:  Combine the flour and baking powder.  Beat the egg yolks on high speed until light, 3 minutes.  Add the parsley, mushrooms, flour mixture, salt and pepper.  Mix on medium speed for 1 minute.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites on high speed until they're stiff but not dry, 2 minutes.  Fold them into the yolk-mushroom mixture.  Set the batter aside while you make the soup.

For the Soup:  Place the chicken, onions, carrots, celery, parsnip, parsley and salt and pepper to taste in a Dutch oven or large saucepan.  Add enough water to cover the ingredients, about 10 cups, and bring to a boil over high heat.  After 15 minutes, skim off the foam, reduce the heat and simmer 1 hour, skimming the soup occasionally as it simmers.

Remove the chicken pieces and, when they're cool enough to handle, separate the meat from the bones and cut it into small pieces.  Return the chicken to the pot and bring the soup back to a simmer.

Drop the Mushroom Dumpling batter by the tablespoon into the soup.  Cover the pot and simmer the soup until the dumplings rise to the surface, 10 minutes more.

Serve the soup in warm bowls with a dumpling or two floating on top of each serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7        tablespoons  butter -- softened
  7        tablespoons  margarine -- softened
  2 2/3           cups  sugar
  3                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  1 1/2           cups  sour cream
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  6               cups  sifted cake flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  6               cups  Cinnamon Crunch -- (see below)
                        === CINNAMON CRUNCH ===
  13       tablespoons  butter -- softened
  2               cups  brown sugar
  3 1/3           cups  chopped pecans
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  3 1/4    tablespoons  ground cinnamon

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, cream the butter and margarine together.  Add the sugar and cream until fluffy; blend in the eggs.

In a separate, smaller bowl, combine the sour cream and baking soda and set aside.

In medium mixing bowl, sift the flour, salt, baking powder and nutmeg together.  Add the flour mixture and sour cream mixture alternately to the sugar mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture.  Do not overmix.  Fold 2 3/4 cups of the Cinnamon Crunch mixture into the batter.

Spoon the batter into paper-lined muffin tins, filling them a little over half full.  Sprinkle the tops of the muffins with the remaining Cinnamon Crunch.  Bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown.

Cinnamon Crunch:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and blend well with a pastry blender or process lightly in a food processor.  Spread mixture on a large cookie sheet and bake for 5 to 8 minutes or until lightly browned.  Let stand until cool and break into chunks.  Store in an airtight container.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  For more that a century, the Marshall Fieldís store has been a landmark in downtown Chicago, and has served as a traditional meeting place for several generations of shoppers.  This muffin is a favorite with the lunch crowd, at the Walnut Room, inside Marshal Fieldís store.

              Marshall Field's Individual Fallen Mocha Cakes

Recipe By     :Chef Elizabeth Brown, Marshall Field's
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus extra for
                        the ramekins
  8             ounces  Coffee Frango chocolates -- coarsely chopped
  4              large  eggs -- plus
  1              large  yolk -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour -- plus extra for
                        the ramekins

Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 400 degrees.  Generously butter and flour eight 6-ounce ramekins.  Tap out excess flour and position ramekins on a shallow roasting pan, or baking sheet.

Meanwhile melt 8 tablespoons butter and chocolates in a medium heatproof bowl set over a pan of almost simmering water, stirring once or twice until smooth; remove from heat.

Beat eggs, yolk, vanilla, salt, and sugar at highest speed in a bowl of a standing mixer with the whisk attachment until volume almost triples, color is very light, and mixture drops from beaters in a smooth, thick stream, about 5 minutes.  (Alternatively beat for 10 minutes using a handheld electric mixer and a large mixing bowl.)

Scrape egg mixture over melted chocolate and butter; sprinkle flour over egg mixture.  Gently fold egg and flour into chocolate until mixture is uniformly colored.  Ladle or pour batter into prepared ramekins.  (Can be covered lightly with plastic wrap and refrigerated up to 8 hours, return to room temperature before baking).

Bake until the cakes have puffed about 1/2 inch above rims of ramekins, have a thin crust on top, and jiggle slightly at center when ramekins are shaken very gently; 12 to 13 minutes.  Run a paring knife around inside edges of ramekins to loosen cakes and invert onto serving plates.

Cool for 1 minute and lift off ramekins.  Serve sprinkled with powdered sugar, whipped cream or ice cream if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Scrape egg mixture over melted chocolate and butter; sprinkle flour over egg mixture.  Gently fold egg and flour into chocolate until mixture is uniformly colored.  Ladle or pour batter into prepared ramekins.  (Can be covered lightly with plastic wrap and refrigerated up to 8 hours, return to room temperature before baking).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake until the cakes have puffed about 1/2 inch above rims of ramekins, have a thin crust on top, and jiggle slightly at center when ramekins are shaken very gently; 12 to 13 minutes.  Run a paring knife around inside edges of ramekins to loosen cakes and invert onto serving plates.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cool for 1 minute and lift off ramekins.  Serve sprinkled with powdered sugar, whipped cream or ice cream if desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     loaf French bread -- cut 1" cubes
     1/2           cup  raisins
  1              quart  half and half
  4                     eggs -- beaten
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1              pinch  nutmeg
     1/4         pound  butter -- melted

Soak the raisins for 30 minutes in warm water, then drain well.

Fill a 9-inch square baking pan with the bread cubes and sprinkle the raisins on top.  (Use enough bread to come to the top of the pan.  The whole loaf may not be required.)

Whisk the remaining ingredients together to make a batter, pour over bread, and stir lightly.  Allow the bread to soak 1/2 hour.  (The pan will be very full.  If you have too much batter, discard the excess.  If there's not enough, add a little more milk to the pan.)

Bake at 325 degrees for about 40 minutes, until the pudding is golden brown and puffed up around the edges.  The center should be set but still a little soft.  You can make this ahead of time, and heat it in the microwave oven later.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Muffins

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MUFFIN BATTER ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine
  3                     eggs
  2 1/2           cups  flour
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     3/4           cup  buttermilk -- plus
  1         tablespoon  buttermilk
                        === NUT TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                cup  walnuts -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a mixing bowl, cream the sugar and butter together with an electric mixer.  When thoroughly mixed, add eggs and beat one more minute.

Sift the flour into a separate bowl together with the baking soda, nutmeg and cinnamon.

Add flour and buttermilk to the first mixture.  Mix at low speed until smooth.  To avoid lumps in the batter, add the wet and dry ingredients alternately, in small amounts.

For the Nut Topping:  Mix all ingredients together in a small bowl.  The nuts should be finely chopped.

Grease muffin tins with additional butter or margarine.  You can also use paper baking cups.  Fill each cup 3/4 full of batter.  Add a full rounded tablespoon of nut topping on top of the batter in each cup.  Bake immediately or the topping will sink to the bottom of the muffin.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown.  A wooden pick inserted in the middle of the muffin should come out dry.

This recipe yields 12 standard-size muffins, or six jumbo muffins.

Comments:  If using jumbo muffin pans, reduce the oven temperature by 25 degrees and increase the baking time 5 to 10 minutes.

        Outback Steakhouse's Aussie Chips And Aussie Cheese Fries

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === AUSSIE CHIPS ===
  2             medium  russet potatoes
  6               cups  vegetable oil or shortening - (to 8)
                        === SEASONING ===
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/8      teaspoon  ground thyme
                        === ON THE SIDE ===
                        Ranch dressing
                        === AUSSIE CHEESE FRIES ===
                        A plate of cloned Aussie Chips -- (from above recipe)
  1                cup  shredded monterey jack cheese
  1                cup  shredded cheddar cheese
  1                     bacon slice -- cooked
                        === ON THE SIDE ===
                        Ranch dressing

For the Aussie Chips:  Preheat oil to 375 degrees in a deep fryer.

Cut potatoes into french fry slices using a vegetable slicer or mandolin.  It's important to use a gadget for the slicing so that the fries will all be the same thickness, and will cook evenly.  Submerge all of the sliced potatoes in a large bowl fill with cold water for 30 minutes.

Combine all of the seasoning ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.

Remove potato slices from the water and onto a clean towel.  Blot dry.

Fry potato slices for 8 to 12 minutes in hot oil until light brown.  Drain fries on a rack or paper towels and sprinkle with some of the seasoning.  Pile the fries on a plate and serve with ranch dressing on the side, if desired.

For the Aussie Cheese Fries:  Prepare the clone for the Aussie Chips and arrange the seasoned fries on an oven-safe plate.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Mix the cheeses together and sprinkle the blend over the fries.  Crumble the bacon and sprinkle it over the cheese.  Bake the plate for 4 to 5 minutes in the hot oven, until cheese is melted.  Serve with ranch dressing on the side.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings of either selection.

Comments:  These french fries are easy to make with a couple sliced russet potatoes -- the frying is real basic stuff.  But the big secret is found in the special seasoning that's sprinkled over the top.  That's what makes these fries unique and tasty.  Make a home version of this dish as a clone of Outback's Aussie Chips or as the gooier cheese-topped version that falls right in behind the Bloomin' Onion on the menu's cool lineup of appetizer offerings.

<DirT>
For the Aussie Chips:  Preheat oil to 375 degrees in a deep fryer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut potatoes into french fry slices using a vegetable slicer or mandolin.  It&apos;s important to use a gadget for the slicing so that the fries will all be the same thickness, and will cook evenly.  Submerge all of the sliced potatoes in a large bowl fill with cold water for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine all of the seasoning ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove potato slices from the water and onto a clean towel.  Blot dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fry potato slices for 8 to 12 minutes in hot oil until light brown.  Drain fries on a rack or paper towels and sprinkle with some of the seasoning.  Pile the fries on a plate and serve with ranch dressing on the side, if desired.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Aussie Cheese Fries:  Prepare the clone for the Aussie Chips and arrange the seasoned fries on an oven-safe plate.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mix the cheeses together and sprinkle the blend over the fries.  Crumble the bacon and sprinkle it over the cheese.  Bake the plate for 4 to 5 minutes in the hot oven, until cheese is melted.  Serve with ranch dressing on the side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings of either selection.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  These french fries are easy to make with a couple sliced russet potatoes -- the frying is real basic stuff.  But the big secret is found in the special seasoning that&apos;s sprinkled over the top.  That&apos;s what makes these fries unique and tasty.  Make a home version of this dish as a clone of Outback&apos;s Aussie Chips or as the gooier cheese-topped version that falls right in behind the Bloomin&apos; Onion on the menu&apos;s cool lineup of appetizer offerings.

              Outback Steakhouse's Tangy Tomato Dressing  II

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  ketchup -- plus
  1         tablespoon  ketchup
     1/3           cup  water
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  white vinegar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  onion powder
  1              pinch  thyme

Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Bring to a boil, whisking often, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes.  Cover the dressing until cool, then refrigerate it until well chilled.

This recipe yields 1 cup.

Comments:  I'd have to say we get more cloning requests for this salad dressing than for any other chain restaurant dressing out there.  So, last week I suited up in protective gear, donned some safety goggles and set out to tackle the tangy beast.  Now, fresh out of the underground laboratory, comes this simple formula for recreating Outback's popular salad topper in your own cozy kitchen.  Mix it up, heat it up, cool it down, and store it in the fridge until salad time.

                      P. F. Chang's Chocolate Torte

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter
  3               cups  semi-sweet chocolate chips - (18 oz)
  4                     eggs
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
                        === VANILLA SAUCE ===
  2               cups  cream
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  4                     egg yolks
                        === RASPBERRY SAUCE ===
  1                     bag frozen raspberries - (12 oz) -- thawed
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  water - (to 4)
  2        tablespoons  raspberry liqueur

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Melt butter in a medium saucepan over low heat.  Add chocolate chips and stir occasionally until chocolate is completely melted.  Be very careful not to overcook chocolate or it may burn and taste funny.  Not funny ha-ha -- funny strange.  Remove chocolate from heat.

Beat 4 eggs until fluffy in a large bowl, then add sugar and vanilla and mix well until sugar is dissolved.

Temper the egg mixture by mixing in just a few tablespoons of the warm chocolate.  This keeps the eggs from cooking.  Add the rest of the chocolate and mix until well combined.

Pour the batter into a 9-inch springform pan that has been lined on the bottom and sides with parchment paper (butter the pan before you add the parchment paper -- the butter will make the paper stick).  Bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until middle of the cake begins to firm up.  Remove, cool, cover and chill the cake until you are ready to serve it.

As the torte bakes, prepare vanilla sauce by combining cream with 1/4 cup sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Use a knife to scrape the seeds from inside the vanilla bean, then add the seeds and the bean pod to the pan.  Heat mixture, stirring often, just until boiling then turn off heat.  Watch the cream closely so that it does not boil over.

In a medium bowl whisk together remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and egg yolks until smooth.  Temper the egg yolks by adding a few tablespoons of the hot cream mixture.  Pour the entire mixture back into the saucepan and heat it up again, stirring often until it begins to boil.  Immediately pour the sauce into a medium bowl that has been set in a larger bowl filled with ice.  This ice bath will help to quickly cool the sauce so that it doesn't curdle.  Cover and chill the sauce until you are ready for it.

Make the raspberry sauce by pureeing the thawed raspberries in a blender.  Add 2 to 4 tablespoons of water to thin the pureed berries a bit -- if your berries have a lot of juice add 2 tablespoons of water; if they have just a little juice, add 4 tablespoons of water.  Pour pureed berries into a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add 3 tablespoons granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons of raspberry liqueur to the pan.  Heat until boiling then remove raspberry sauce from heat.  Cover and chill it.

When you are ready to serve your torte, first spoon some raspberry sauce and vanilla sauce onto a plate.  Carefully place the slice of torte on the sauces, but turn it over so that the top, cooked side of the torte is on the bottom.  This is how a flourless chocolate cake is served -- topside down.  The restaurant zaps the cake for 30 seconds or so in the microwave before serving, so that it is slightly warm.  However, I prefer mine cold.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  P. F. Chang's contracts with local bakeries to produce these delicious flourless chocolate cakes for the 70-unit chain of upscale Chinese bistros.  The restaurants aren't built for baking, and this way the chain can ensure a fresh product every time.  Now you can whip up an even fresher version of the cake right at home with just a few basic ingredients and a springform pan.  As for the tasty sauces that go with the cake, each P. F. Chang's handles those in the restaurant.  Get yourself a bag of frozen raspberries and some raspberry liqueur for the raspberry sauce, and a vanilla bean (actually you'll need just a quarter of one) and some cream for the vanilla sauce.  These sauce recipes will give you two amazing sauces that go great with the cake, with leftovers that can be frozen to dazzle with a drizzle on many other deserving desserts.

  1         tablespoon  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1 1/2    tablespoons  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  boiling water
                        === MALT FROSTING ===
  1            package  semi-sweet chocolate chips - (12 oz)
  1               pint  whipping cream
  1 1/4           cups  malted milk powder
     1/3           cup  sugar
  4             ounces  softened cream cheese
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Make Malt Frosting before the cake so that it can chill for at least 2 hours.  Melt semi-sweet chocolate chips in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly.  Set aside to cool.

Beat whipping cream and malted milk powder in electric mixture on high until stiff but not dry, about 2 minutes; refrigerate about 30 minutes.

Whip sugar, softened cream cheese and vanilla extract in a separate bowl until creamy, about 2 minutes, scraping bowl often.  Add melted chocolate chips and beat 1 more minute.  Add half of malt-cream mixture and beat until uniform in color.  Fold in remaining malt-cream mixture by hand until frosting is uniform in color.  Refrigerate at least 2 hours before icing cake.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Prepare 3 round 9-inch cake pans with butter and flour and line with parchment or wax paper.  Set aside.

Beat oil, milk, yogurt, eggs and vanilla with electric mixer until well blended, about 2 minutes.  Sift together sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt in separate bowl.  Slowly add 1/3 of dry ingredients to milk mixture and beat until well blended.  Beat in 1/3 of boiling water.  Add another 1/3 of dry ingredients and beat until well mixed; then beat in another 1/3 of water.  Add remaining dry ingredients, beating well, then add remaining water and beat until well mixed.  Scrape mixing bowl often.

Pour equal amounts of batter into prepared pans.  Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes.  Do not open oven while cake is baking.  Cool pans on rack for 15 minutes, the remove from pan, take off paper, and continue to cool completely.

Frost top of one layer with Malt Frosting, then place second layer on top and frost; top with third layer and frost top and sides.  Refrigerate 2 hours before cutting.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

  1              quart  milk
     1/4           cup  finely-diced onion
  1              small  garlic clove -- minced
     1/2           cup  finely-diced green bell pepper
  6        tablespoons  diced peeled seeded fresh tomatoes
  6        tablespoons  diced fresh or canned pineapple
     1/8      teaspoon  grated or ground ginger root
  2          teaspoons  curry powder - (to 1 tbspn)
  1           teaspoon  brown sugar
  6        tablespoons  flour - (to 8)
  2               cups  diced or pieced boned chicken

Let coconut stand in warm milk; strain through cheesecloth, using 1 cup of milk each time or until coconut is well drained of essence.  Blender method: Put 1/2 cup warm milk into blender and then add coconut and blend; drain and add more warm milk.  Repeat until you feel you have removed all the essence from the coconut.

SautÈ onion, garlic and green pepper in butter.  Add remaining ingredients to onion mixture.  Slowly add coconut milk.  Simmer slowly until thickened.  Add chicken last.  Do not add salt until this is all put together -- otherwise the mixture will curdle.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SEA BASS NAPOLEON ===
  1                     sea bass fillet - (6 oz) -- cut 2 thin slices
  2        tablespoons  Guajillo Chile Marinade -- (see below)
     1/4           cup  Coconut Lemon Grass Reduction Sauce -- (see below)
  10                    scallops - (to 20)
  1           teaspoon  blackened seasoning galangal powder blend
                        Neutral oil
     1/3           cup  stemmed currant
                        = (or yellow and red pear tomatoes)
     1/2         ounce  fresh baby spinach
  1              ounce  enoki mushrooms
  1              ounce  thinly-sliced smoked salmon
  1              sprig  rosemary - (4" long)
     1/4      teaspoon  orange tobiko (Japanese flying fish roe)
                        === COCONUT MILK LEMON GRASS SAUCE ===
  1              quart  coconut milk
  3 1/2         stalks  lemon grass -- trimmed, cleaned,
                        and bruised
  1              ounce  chipotle puree
  4             ounces  sugar
  1                cup  lime juice
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
                        Heavy cream -- as needed
                        if sauce breaks
                        === GUAJILLO CHILI MARINADE ===
  1 1/4         pounds  dry Guajillo chiles -- cleaned
  1              quart  rice vinegar - (to 2)
  1                cup  brown sugar
  12            ounces  shiracca chili paste (Thai chili paste)
  1               pint  Ginger Oil -- (see below)
                        === GINGER OIL ===
  8             ounces  ginger -- bruised
  1                cup  olive oil

Baste raw bass pieces with Guajillo chile marinade and set aside.  Heat coconut reduction sauce and set aside; keep warm.

Brush scallops with blackened galangal powder blend and sear quickly, set aside and keep warm.

Heat sautÈ pan with little oil at medium-low heat.  When oil is hot, add bass, careful not to burn fish.  Chile marinade contains a lot of sugar so watch your temperature, keep it low.

Blacken tomatoes in 1 tablespoon of neutral oil.  Add spinach and enoki mushrooms.  Cook down until spinach has wilted and sauce is hot.  Check on bass and turn when ready.

Plate the dish when fish is done.  Place coconut reduction sauce on large plate to cover completely.  Place spinach mushroom mixture in center of plate.  Place largest piece of bass on top of spinach.  Place scallops on top of bass.  Cover scallops with smoked salmon slices (salmon is chilled or at room temperature, do not cook).  Cover salmon with second piece of bass and use rosemary sprig to hold it all in one place.  Add avocado around the outside of fish and garnish with tobiko.

Coconut Milk and Lemon Grass Reduction Sauce:  Place coconut milk and lemon grass in large pan and bring to simmer, do not boil.  Reduce heat by 65 to 70 percent and cool.  Add remaining ingredients working in slowly and tasting so as not to over-season.  Chill and hold.  Use heavy cream if sauce breaks.

For Guajillo Chili Marinade:  Place dry chiles in large stockpot and cover with rice vinegar.  Place sugar on top and bring to simmer, allow to cook until chiles are tender.  Place chiles in blender and puree.  Use liquid as needed for puree.  Add ginger oil to 2 quarts of the puree and mix well.

For Ginger Oil:  Mix and bring to a boil, then leave at room temperature for 2 hours.  Strain.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

                        Tony Chacheres Creole Seasoning -- to taste

Dust chicken with Tony's and place in gallon zip lock baggie with marinade and Tabasco Pepper Sauce.  Be sure all surfaces are coated.

Trim asparagus spears to a uniform length of 5 or 6 inches.  You want them to be slightly longer than the width of the chicken thighs.  Break onion rings so they are the same lengths as the asparagus.  Lightly dust the vegetables (jalapenos, onions and asparagus) with the Tony's and place in a separate gallon zip lock baggie with soy sauce.  You can prepare the chicken and vegetables a day ahead so everything marinades a day before you cook.

Assemble the Rollups by placing a piece of marinated chicken on a flat surface.  Place 4 asparagus spears, 2 or 3 pieces of each color onion and a quarter of jalapeÒo pepper on the chicken.  Roll up and wrap with a slice of bacon and secure with a wooden toothpick.  Dispose of used marinade.

Preheat a 12-inch Dutch Oven with 8 to 10 charcoal briquettes under the oven and 16 to 18 on top.  Heat the other 4 slices of bacon for the grease and add the Rollups.  Turn chicken and rotate oven 1/4 turn on the coals and the lid on the oven every 15 or 20 minutes until done, about an hour.

Arrange rollups in center of oven and cover with cheese.  Return lid and let stand for 5 more minutes.  Serve while hot.

                  Zinfandel Restaurant's Barbequed Ribs

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     slabs pork spareribs
     1/2           cup  Zinfandel's Rib Rub -- (see recipe)
  2               cups  Zinfandel's Barbecue Sauce -- (see recipe)

The night before grilling (or at least several hours before), rub the Rib Rub into the spareribs, covering both sides.  You may or may not need to use all of the rub.

About 3 hours before serving, build a charcoal fire, using about 2 quarts of good quality hardwood charcoal.  When coals are covered with gray ash, but are still burning fiercely, spread them out and push them against two sides of the grill.  You want to cook over indirect heat, not directly over the coals.

Place marinated ribs, bone-side down, on the cooking rack and position the rack over the coals so that the ribs are in the middle of the grill, not directly over the coals.  Cover the grill, adjust the top vents to open and walk away for 30 minutes.

After a half hour, lift the cover and take a peek.  The ribs should browning nicely, and your neighbors should start wandering over to see what you are doing.  Flip the ribs over to cook meat-side down, replace the cover and wait another 30 minutes.

After an hour, the ribs should be dark brown, crispy and pulling away from the bone.  At this point, pull them off the grill, cut between the bones and enjoy with warm Zinfandel Barbecue sauce.

The ribs can also be chilled quickly, then reheated on the grill to serve at a later time.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  yellow cornmeal (preferably stone-ground)
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse salt
  2              large  eggs
  1 3/4           cups  well-shaken buttermilk
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter -- softened
                        === BUCKWHEAT-HONEY BUTTER ===
  1              stick  softened unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  buckwheat honey
                        = (or use pure maple syrup)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Put a dry, well-seasoned 9- to 9 1/2-inch cast-iron skillet in middle of oven to heat.

Stir together cornmeal, baking soda, and salt, crushing any small bits of baking soda.  Whisk eggs in another bowl until blended and whisk in buttermilk.

Remove hot skillet from oven carefully and add butter, swirling gently to coat bottom and sides of skillet.  (If butter begins to sizzle and brown around edges, so much the better.)

Whisk hot butter into buttermilk mixture and return skillet to oven.  Stir cornmeal into buttermilk mixture just until moistened.  (The batter does not have to be smooth -- a few small lumps are good.)

Scrape batter into hot skillet and bake until golden, 20 to 25 minutes.  Invert skillet over a platter and cool bread at least 3 minutes.  Serve with Buckwheat-Honey Butter.

For the Buckwheat-Honey Butter:  Combine both ingredients.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The secret is in using a cast-iron skillet.  Nonstick pans produce anemic, soft corn bread.  This recipe also works well with corn-stick or muffin molds, as long as theyíre well-seasoned cast iron.  If your pan is hot enough, the batter will immediately rise and start to cook around the edges.  (The restaurantís skillets rarely leave the oven.)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Put a dry, well-seasoned 9- to 9 1/2-inch cast-iron skillet in middle of oven to heat.

<DirT>
Stir together cornmeal, baking soda, and salt, crushing any small bits of baking soda.  Whisk eggs in another bowl until blended and whisk in buttermilk.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove hot skillet from oven carefully and add butter, swirling gently to coat bottom and sides of skillet.  (If butter begins to sizzle and brown around edges, so much the better.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk hot butter into buttermilk mixture and return skillet to oven.  Stir cornmeal into buttermilk mixture just until moistened.  (The batter does not have to be smooth -- a few small lumps are good.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Scrape batter into hot skillet and bake until golden, 20 to 25 minutes.  Invert skillet over a platter and cool bread at least 3 minutes.  Serve with Buckwheat-Honey Butter.

<DirT>
For the Buckwheat-Honey Butter:  Combine both ingredients.

Comments:  The secret is in using a cast-iron skillet.  Nonstick pans produce anemic, soft corn bread.  This recipe also works well with corn-stick or muffin molds, as long as theyíre well-seasoned cast iron.  If your pan is hot enough, the batter will immediately rise and start to cook around the edges.  (The restaurantís skillets rarely leave the oven.)
