--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  butter -- (4 ounces)
     1/4           cup  diced celery
     1/4           cup  diced onion
  1                cup  fresh breadcrumbs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Clam juice -- for moistening
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Old Bay Seasoning
  12                    jumbo shrimp - (U16) -- deveined, and

Comments:  This is a swift and simple supper dish, delicious with spicy wild rice and snow peas.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  cubed fully-cooked ham
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
  10                    flour tortillas - (8" dia)
  2               cups  shredded cheddar cheese -- divided

  6                     eggs beaten
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Combine ham and onions, place about 1/3 cup down the center of each tortilla (at this point, I top with about 2 to 3 tablespoons cooked hash browns).  Top with 2 tablespoons cheese.  Roll up and place seam-side down in greased 9- by 13-inch pan.

In a bowl, combine flour, cream, eggs and salt until smooth.  Pour over tortillas.  Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.  Remove from fridge 30 minutes before baking.

Cover and bake 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  Uncover, bake for 10 minutes.  Sprinkle with remaining cheese, bake 3 minutes longer or until cheese melts.  Let stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 10 enchiladas.

Recipe By     :Submitted by Manor on Golden Pond, Holderness, NH
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CARPACCIO ===
  12            ounces  American lamb loin
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  whole-grain mustard
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  6        tablespoons  lamb infused veal stock
  1         tablespoon  wine vinegar
                        === ARTICHOKE SALAD ===
  6             ounces  artichoke bottoms sliced
  16                    asparagus tips
  4                     shittake mushrooms sliced
  4             ounces  Marinade -- (listed above)
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Basil oil
                        Parmesan curls
                        Cracked black pepper

For the Marinade:  Brown 18 lamb bones in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add 2 quarts of veal stock and simmer over medium heat for 20 minutes.  Strain out the bones and chill.  Blend 6 tablespoons of infused veal stock with remaining ingredients.  Reserve

For the Artichoke Salad:  Blanch the asparagus tips in boiling salted water for 2 or 3 minutes.  Shock cold in ice water.  Mix with remaining ingredients and refrigerate for at least 6 hours.

For the Carpaccio:  Sear the boneless American lamb loin on all sides in a very hot sautÈ pan over very high heat.  You want to brown all the edges while keeping the inside raw.  Slice the lamb into 1/8-inch thick slices.  Place each slice between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound very flat with a mallet or flat side of a large knife.  Set in the freezer for 15 minutes before removing from the plastic.

For Presentation:  Place 3 ounces of artichoke salad on a large white plate.  Brush the marinade on four slices of carpaccio and arrange in a fan pattern on the artichoke salad.  Garnish with basil infused olive oil, Parmesan curls, and cracked peppercorns.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Submitted by The Washington Grass Inn, Greensboro, GA
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  carrots
                        = (California carrots if possible/
                        they're better)
     1/2           cup  melted butter or margarine
  3                     eggs
  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  vanilla

Cook carrots until very soft.  (Pressure cooker is great for this!  It doesn't take nearly as long and flavor is retained.)  Drain and place cooked carrots in food processor and blend until mushy.  Add remaining ingredients and blend well.

Pour into greased baking dish and bake at 350 degrees for about 1 hour or until done in center.  Knife will come out clean when inserted in the middle.

This recipe yields ?? servings.  You can increase proportionally for more servings.  I have even increased it 5 times and it does fine.

Comments:  You can decrease the amount of sugar if you wish.  Add it slowly and taste as you add it.  The less sugar you add, the more carrot flavor comes through.

You can prepare ahead of time and freeze in baking dish.  Thaw out thoroughly and bake when ready.

Granny Lemon's Hint!  Place the filled baking dish in a pan with 1 to 2 inches of water (water bath) to bake.  It will prevent sticking to sides of baking dish.  Also, if you place 1 teaspoon of cream of tartar in the water, it will prevent the pan, if itπs aluminum, from darkening or staining.

                           Crab Cakes Benedict

Recipe By     :Submitted by Sault Falls Inn, Braman-Equinunk, PA
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     pre-made crab cakes
                        = (prepare according to package's
                        instructions)
  4                     fresh eggs
                        === HOLLANDAISE SAUCE ===
  3                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  cold water
  16       tablespoons  chilled butter -- finely diced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice

Prepare Hollandaise Sauce:  In the bottom of a double boiler, bring water to a boil and then reduce the heat to keep it just below the simmering point.  In the top of the double boiler, add egg yolks and 1 tablespoon cold water.  With a whisk, beat the egg yolks and combine them with water.  Continue to whisk until they are creamy.

Add a handful of chilled butter cubes to the pan and whisk until the butter is absorbed into the egg mixture.  Add remaining cubes, a few at a time until all the butter is absorbed into the mixture.  Continue whisking the sauce until the sauce is thick and creamy, about 10 minutes.

Season to taste with white pepper, pinch of cayenne and salt.  Finish off the sauce with a few drops of fresh lemon juice.  Keep warm over double boiled until ready to use.

Poach Eggs:  In a shallow saute pan, bring 2 to 3 inches of lightly salted water to a boil.  Turn off the heat and add the eggs at once (break the eggs directly into the water to minimize spreading.)  Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid in order to retain heat.  Allow the eggs to cook undisturbed for about threee minutes.  Then lift off the lid.

When the whites are opaque and the yolks are covered with a thin translucent layer of white, the eggs are ready.  Lift out of water onto a damp kitchen towel and trim ragged edges.

To Assemble:  Place one heated, cooked, crab cake on plate.  Place one poached egg on top.  Spoon Hollandaise Sauce over top and sprinkle with fresh or dried tarragon.  Serve immediately!

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  At Sault Falls Inn, we like to serve this on cold winter mornings.  Something about the rich and filling nature leaves one full and satisfied.  An old favorite with a new twist!

<DirT>
Prepare Hollandaise Sauce:  In the bottom of a double boiler, bring water to a boil and then reduce the heat to keep it just below the simmering point.  In the top of the double boiler, add egg yolks and 1 tablespoon cold water.  With a whisk, beat the egg yolks and combine them with water.  Continue to whisk until they are creamy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add a handful of chilled butter cubes to the pan and whisk until the butter is absorbed into the egg mixture.  Add remaining cubes, a few at a time until all the butter is absorbed into the mixture.  Continue whisking the sauce until the sauce is thick and creamy, about 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season to taste with white pepper, pinch of cayenne and salt.  Finish off the sauce with a few drops of fresh lemon juice.  Keep warm over double boiled until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Poach Eggs:  In a shallow saute pan, bring 2 to 3 inches of lightly salted water to a boil.  Turn off the heat and add the eggs at once (break the eggs directly into the water to minimize spreading.)  Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid in order to retain heat.  Allow the eggs to cook undisturbed for about threee minutes.  Then lift off the lid.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the whites are opaque and the yolks are covered with a thin translucent layer of white, the eggs are ready.  Lift out of water onto a damp kitchen towel and trim ragged edges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To Assemble:  Place one heated, cooked, crab cake on plate.  Place one poached egg on top.  Spoon Hollandaise Sauce over top and sprinkle with fresh or dried tarragon.  Serve immediately!
</DirT>

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  At Sault Falls Inn, we like to serve this on cold winter mornings.  Something about the rich and filling nature leaves one full and satisfied.  An old favorite with a new twist!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  crab meat - (6 oz)
  1                jar  Kraft Old English cheese spread - (5 oz)
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine -- softened
  2           teaspoon  mayonnaise
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic salt
     1/2      teaspoon  seasoned salt
  1            package  English muffins

Combine all ingredients; mix well.  Split muffins into halves and spread mixture equally onto each half.  Cut halves into bite size (usually into eighths).  Place under broiler until cheese melts.

(I usually place the bite-sized muffin pieces on a cookie sheet and put them into the freezer.  Once frozen I transfer the Puffs to zip lock baggies.  They keep well in the freezer for several weeks.

This recipe yields 96 puffs.

Comments:  A yummy combination of crab and Old English cheese.  This easy to make appetizer is a crunchy bite that is sure to bring raves from guests.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  shallots -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1              pound  fresh mushrooms -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  butter
  2               cans  beef consomme
  2               cans  cream of mushroom soup
     1/4           cup  Kentucky bourbon

Melt butter in saucepan and saute shallots, garlic and mushrooms over low to medium heat until shallots are translucent.

In a bowl, whisk mushroom soup, consomme and bourbon together until well blended.  Add soup mixture to saucepan and simmer for 45 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  We've experimented with all kinds of mushroom soups, and none is better or simpler or faster than this.  If you can find some of the more exotic mushrooms...like shitake and cremini...you'll get a much richer flavor.

Comments:  We&apos;ve experimented with all kinds of mushroom soups, and none is better or simpler or faster than this.  If you can find some of the more exotic mushrooms...like shitake and cremini...you&apos;ll get a much richer flavor.

                          Fresh Strawberry Soup

Recipe By     :Submitted by Honeycomb Suites, Gladewater, TX
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  washed cleaned hulled strawberries
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  Amaretto
                        = (or 1/2 tspn almond extract)
  1                cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon

Put cleaned berries in blender.  Puree for 1 minute.  Add remaining ingredients.  Whirl until mixture looks like buttermilk, then pulse a few times more to be sure all ingredients are well blended.

Store in refrigerator overnight or in freezer for up to one month.  Allow to thaw overnight before serving.

This recipe yields 10 half-cup servings.

Comments:  This is a great use for those berries that are just a little past their prime.  In fact, don't use perfectly fresh, firm berries in this soup.  It is much more flavorful if made with overripe fruit.  Make this a day or two ahead of time and freeze.  Then put in refrigerator the night before serving at a special breakfast.

Comments:  This is a famous family recipe, which has been the choice for a host of church fundraisers, food booth fundraisers at our County Fair, and was chosen to be included in the "Treasure from the Melting Pot" Cookbook in 1997.  The fact that it is simple to make is deceiving.  How can it be that good?  It is.  People often tell me "This is the best chili I have ever tasted!"

Comments:  This is a famous family recipe, which has been the choice for a host of church fundraisers, food booth fundraisers at our County Fair, and was chosen to be included in the &quot;Treasure from the Melting Pot&quot; Cookbook in 1997.  The fact that it is simple to make is deceiving.  How can it be that good?  It is.  People often tell me &quot;This is the best chili I have ever tasted!&quot;

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  quick grits -- preferably yellow
  2               cups  water
  2               cups  milk
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  medium pink shrimp
                        = (or equivalent)
  1                     scallion or 4 spring onions -- diced
  5             medium  mushrooms - (to 6) -- sliced thin
  1                     hot pepper -- diced
     1/2           cup  baby spinach leaves -- washed
     1/4         pound  cheddar cheese -- sliced thin
                        Juice of one lime or key lime
  1              pinch  saffron -- (optional)
  2                     garlic cloves -- diced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Red pepper -- to taste

On medium heat, melt butter with saffron and garlic in a skillet.  Peel and de-vein shrimp and cut laterally into halves.  Place shrimp on a plate and cover with lime juice.  Sautee 30 seconds per side, remove and set aside.

Place all other ingredients, except spinach,into skillet, stirring occasionally.  While cooking, place spinach leaves on one damp paper towel and cover with another.  Microwave on highest setting for 30 seconds.

While the other ingredients are sautÈing, place butter and salt into water and milk and bring to a rolling boil in a large saucepan.  Slowly stir in grits.  After about 3 minutes on medium heat add shrimp to sautÈed ingredients for at least a minute and then gently fold remaining sautÈ mixture into the grits.

Tear wilted spinach into inch-size pieces, discarding stems.  Place cheese slices and spinach on top of grits, turn off heat, and cover for 3 or 4 minutes.  Fold in now-melted cheese and spinach.  If grits are too stiff, stir in a little milk.  Serve hot.  A crock-pot on low works well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPICE MIX ===
  2 1/2    tablespoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  cumin
     1/2    tablespoon  ground mustard
     1/4    tablespoon  cayenne pepper
  1 1/2    tablespoons  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  ground thyme
  1 1/2    tablespoons  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2    tablespoon  allspice
     1/2    tablespoon  paprika
     1/4    tablespoon  ground clove
  1         tablespoon  ground oregano
                        === BEEF ===
  6                     steaks - (8 oz ea)
  2             ounces  oil
                        === FOR THE RISOTTO ====
     1/4         pound  butter
  1 1/2           cups  minced onion
  2               cups  risotto
  2        tablespoons  salt
     1/2           cup  minced fresh herbs
  2 1/2    tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  minced celery
  2               cups  chicken stock
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  grated smoked gouda
  1                cup  finely-chopped cooked  sweet Italian
                        sausage

Mix the Spice Mix ingredients very well.  Keep covered and refrigerated when not in use.  (Makes 12 tablespoons; use 1 tablespoon per serving)

Season steaks with one tablespoon each of the spice mix.  The longer the spice mix is on the meat, the deeper the flavors will penetrate.

Heat oil in a sautÈ pan.  Sear steak for 2 minutes per side.  Transfer the steak to a wire rack in a 325 degree oven and cook for 12 to 15 minutes (or to your desired doneness).  Cooking time may vary with size and cut of meat.

Remove from oven and let steak sit in a warm area for about 5 minutes.

For the Risotto:  In the butter, sautÈ the minced garlic, onions, and celery over medium heat for 7 to 10 minutes.

Add in 2 cups of risotto and reduce the heat to low.  Add in chicken stock a little at a time stirring completely until liquid is almost complete absorbed.  Continue to add the stock until the rice is of a soft consistency.

Turn off the heat and add the salt, pepper, herbs, gouda, and sausage.  Incorporate well until the cheese is melted.  (Makes 2 quarts)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  pinto or pink beans -- cooked
  4               cups  beans broth
  2        tablespoons  finely-grated strong salty cheese
                        Toasted tortillas or totopos -- for serving
  1                     Spanish chorizo
  6                     strips bacon
  3        tablespoons  lard or bacon fat
  20             small  pitted green olives -- chopped
  2                     chiles jalapeÒos en escabeche -- seeded, chopped

Skin and crumble the chorizo, and chop the bacon.  Cook over a slow flame, covered, until most of the fat has rendered out.

Add the lard to the pan and let it melt.  Add the beans and broth and cook them over a high flame, mashing them.  If they start to dry out and stick to the pan, add a little more fat.

When the beans have mashed to a coarse puree and are almost dry, add about two-thirds of the olives and chilies.  Roll the beans, then turn onto the serving dish and garnish with the remaining olives and chilies.  Sprinkle the roll with the cheese and serve with the toasted tortillas or totopos.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Since ancient times, the inhabitants of West Mexico were known for their exquisite taste for food.  Living in one of the most nature favored regions of the World, Puerto Vallarta and Bahia de Banderas are famous for its rich produce: an enormous selection of seafood and a wide variety of tasty fruits and vegetables make up a healthy and rich gastronomy.  As part of a "mestizo" country, in Puerto Vallarta and the BahÌa de Banderas Area you will find the best of the indigenous and European world, unique recipes that blend in native products with the best of international cuisine.  In Villa Bella we are very proud of our Mexican Heritage and would like to share with you few of our favorite breakfast, or "almuerzo" (the Mexican usage of a rich breakfast-lunch meal), recipes.

                        === LAMB ===
  2                     racks lamb - (8 to 9 ribs) -- bones frenched,
                        and fat trimmed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        === SAUCE ===
  2             medium  shallots -- minced
  1                cup  dry red wine
  2 1/2      teaspoons  minced rosemary leaves
  1                cup  low sodium chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  butter

Season lamb with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in skillet over high heat.  Place lamb in skillet meat-side down with ribs facing outward.  Cook until well browned and a crust has formed on the surface, probably about 4 to 5 minutes.  Use tongs to stand ribs up against each other to brown bottoms.

For the Sauce:  Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the skillet where you browned the lamb.  Saute shallots over medium heat until soft.  Add red wine and rosemary, increase heat to medium high, and simmer until dark and syrupy.  Add chicken broth and reduce until about 3/4 cup.  Remove from heat, add butter to blend.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Recipe By     :Submitted by John Rutledge House Inn B & B, Charleston, SC
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish                       Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped celery
     2/3      teaspoon  mace
     1/4      teaspoon  white pepper
  3 1/2           cups  milk
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
  5        tablespoons  all purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
  2               cups  crab meat -- (see comments)
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  worcestershire sauce
  3        tablespoons  sherry
  2                     hard-boiled egg yolks
                        Paprika -- to taste

Heat the butter in a large saucepan.  Add the celery, mace, and white pepper and cook over low heat until the celery is almost transparent.

While the celery is cooking, heat the milk and chicken stock in a small pan just enough to make the milk hot.  Do not boil.

When the celery is done, add the flour to make a roux.  Do not brown, but heat enough to bubble for several minutes.  Slowly add the milk and chicken stock to the roux.  Add salt to taste.

Add the crabmeat, heavy cream, worcestershire sauce and sherry.  Simmer for 30 minutes or until thickened to the appropriate consistency.

Grate the yolks.  Sprinkle over the top of soup with paprika.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  "She-crab" is a real delicacy because they have more flavor than the male crabs.  The orange hued eggs of the female crab give the soup extra flavor and color.  "She-crabs" are difficult to find in many parts of the country, so white crab meat can be substituted.  Hard boiled egg yolks can be crumbled in the soup to imitate crab eggs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  cooked fresh salmon -- bones and skin
                        removed
                        = (reserve 3 to 4 tbspns poaching liquid
                        or if unavailable use 1-lb can salmon
                        with liquid)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced onion
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh lemon thyme
                        = (if available - can be tarragon or dill)
  1 1/2           cups  soft bread crumbs
  2                     eggs -- slightly beaten
     3/4          cups  milk -- plus
  1         tablespoon  milk
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Turn salmon and liquid into mixing bowl.  Add seasonings, onion and bread crumbs and mix thoroughly.

In separate bowl, whisk together egg and milk.  Then combine with salmon mixture.  Stir in lemon juice.

Place in buttered glass loaf pan.  Bake until delicately brown, approximately 40 to 45 minutes.

Comments: 
     ï Eggs can be reduced to only 1, if milk is increased to 1 cup. 
     ï We use a 9-inch loaf pan, so the slices are not as high.  Each guest's plate gets two slices of salmon loaf, which are topped with 4 slices of hard boiled eggs and an herb (same herb as in loaf) Bernaise Sauce.
