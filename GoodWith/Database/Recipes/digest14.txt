          'Grilled' Lamb Chops And Tomatoes With A Garlic Crust

Recipe By     :Margaret Johnson
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
                        more for sprinkling
  2                     loin lamb chops
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             slices  Mills Inn Brown Soda Bread -- (see recipe)
                        = (or store-bought brown soda bread)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh minced parsley
     3/4      teaspoon  chopped fresh chives
     1/8      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
                        Grated zest and juice of half an orange
  2              large  tomatoes -- halved crosswise

Preheat the broiler, placing the rack 4 to 5 inches from the heat source.  Spray a small baking sheet with olive oil cooking spray.

Using 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, brush both sides of each chop with oil and season with salt and pepper.  Place the chops on the prepared pan and broil on one side for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a blender or food processor, process the brown bread, herbs, garlic, orange zest, and salt and pepper to the consistency of fine bread crumbs.  Transfer to a small bowl, add the orange juice and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, and blend thoroughly.

Turn the chops over and spread 1 tablespoon of the crumb topping over each.  Place the tomatoes on the baking sheet with the lamb chops and spoon the remaining topping over the tomato halves.  Sprinkle a few drops of olive oil over the topping.  Set rack at the position farthest from the heat, and broil the chops and tomatoes until the crust is crispy, 7 to 8 minutes.

Serve immediately with new potatoes.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  When the Irish say "pop something under the grill," they generally mean to cook it under the broiler.  While the meat is cooking, boil a few new potatoes.  If you wish to serve two chops per person, double the ingredients for the topping.

                           Acorn Squash Supreme

Recipe By     :Barbara Ciletti
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     acorn squash -- halved lengthwise,
                        and seeded
  2                     Rome apples -- cored, and
                        chopped with skins
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped leeks
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  pecan pieces
  1 1/2      teaspoons  crushed fennel seeds
     1/4           cup  orange juice
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
  1         tablespoon  shredded orange zest
     1/2      teaspoon  ginger

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Place the squash cut-side up in an ovenproof glass baking dish and add 1/4 inch water.

In a large bowl, combine the apples, leeks, brown sugar, pecans, fennel seeds, orange juice, butter, orange zest, and ginger until well blended.  Spoon the mixture evenly into the squash halves and cover loosely with aluminum foil.

Bake 35 to 45 minutes, or until the squash is easily perforated with the tip of a fork and the apple mixture is tender.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Squash and apples blend together easily and enhance turkey, chicken, lean pork, or bratwurst.

The stuffing ingredients yield about 1 1/4 cups.  You may have extra stuffing, depending upon the size of the squash and appies used.  Bake the extra stuffing in the bottom of the pan along with the squash.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  sliced blanched almonds
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  finely-grated lemon zest - (7 lemons)
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
  1                cup  superfine sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  superfine sugar
  6              large  organic eggs -- separated
  1 1/4           cups  fresh ricotta cheese - (10 oz)
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon Juice

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Butter a 10-inch springform round cake pan, and line with waxed paper.

Coarsely chop the almonds in a food processor.  Combine with the flour and lemon zest.  Beat the butter and sugar together in a mixer until pale and light.  Add the egg yolks one by one, then add the almond mixture.

Put the ricotta in a bowl and lightly beat with a fork.  Add the lemon juice.  In another bowl, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks.  Fold the egg whites into the almond mixture and finally stir in the ricotta.

Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan and bake in the preheated oven for about 40 minutes until lightly browned.  Test by inserting a skewer in the center, which should come out clean.  Cool for 10 minutes.  Carefully invert onto a plate, remove waxed paper.  Turn right side up, and cool on a wire rack.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  Dijon-style mustard
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley

Layer warm potato cubes in a medium bowl.  Sprinkle with vinegar, seasoning with salt and pepper as you go.

Mix in remaining ingredients.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.  Adjust seasoning and serve chilled.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  In a blind tasting of seven different mayonnaises -- Hellmann's, Hellmann's Liqht, Hellmann's Reduced Fat, Kraft, Kraft Light, Kraft Free and homemade -- the potato salad dressed with Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise was the unanimous number one choice.

                      Artichoke And Wild Thyme Soup

Recipe By     :Roger Verge
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  artichokes or 5 small violet artichokes
     1/2                baguette
  1              large  white onion
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 3/4         ounces  short-grain rice
  1              bunch  flat-leaf parsley -- tied with string
  1              bunch  farigoule* or common thyme -- tied with string
  1                cup  heavy cream -- very cold
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Shopping:  Farigoule or farigoulette is wild thyme.  If unavailable, use the freshest common thyme available.

Several hours in advance:  Cook the artichokes in boiling salted water, 1 tablespoon coarse salt per quart for approximately 45 minutes, just until the leaves can be easily pulled off.  Begin to check for doneness after 30 minutes.

During this time, cut the baguette into thin slices and toast them.

Finely dice the onion.  Heat the oil in a large saucepan.  Add the onion and cook until tender over low heat.  Do not let the onion brown.  When tender, add 1 quart salted water.  Turn the heat up to high.  At the first boll, add the rice, parsley, and all but 6 thyme sprigs (to be used for decoration).  Lower the heat and cook over low heat for about 30 minutes, until the rice is tender.

As soon as the artichokes are cooked, drain them and remove the leaves.  Scrape off the flesh from the largest leaves with a spoon.  Take advantage of this time to serenely suck on the smallest leaves (they are so good) while removing the choke and trimming it off the bottoms.  Place the bottoms and the flesh into the cooked soup.  Bring the soup to a boil, then remove the parsley and thyme.  Pur√àe the soup, either with a food processor or immersion blender, to obtain a velout√à -- a creamy, smooth consistency.

Put the heavy cream in a large chilled bowl and whip it either with an electric beater or a hand whisk.  Stop as soon as the cream begins to take on very soft peaks.  (If you prepare this soup in advance, store the soup and whipped cream separately in the refrigerator.)

Just before serving:  Bring the soup to a boil.  Season with a pinch of salt and grind of pepper.  Pour the soup into a soup tureen.  Dollop the whipped cream on top.  Serve immediately.  (Only very lightly blend the soup with a ladle at the table just before serving.)  Serve the toasted baguette slices on the side.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Wine suggestion:  With soup, it is possible to forego the wine.  If you wish to fill your guests' glasses, a white cassis, chilled to 46 to 50 degrees, will offer a good marriage of fragrances.

            Asparagus A La Parilla With Parsley And Ham Sauce

Categories    : * Spanish                       Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1              ounce  serrano ham or prosciutto -- diced 1/8" cubes
  2        tablespoons  stock or water
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice - (to 2)
  12                    medium-thick asparagus spears - (to 18)
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse salt

In a small pan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil, add the garlic and the ham, and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Add the stock and parsley and cook another minute or two.  Season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste and set aside.

Sparingly trim the stalk end of each asparagus.  Lightly brush each spear with the remaining oil.

Heat a well-seasoned griddle or nonstick pan and when hot sprinkle the griddle with the coarse salt.  Add the asparagus, cover, and cook until lightly charred on one side.  Turn and cook them, uncovered, until they are limp.  Divide and arrange on serving dishes.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  The flat iron grill plate that the Spanish call a parilla is used for searing fish, shellfish, poultry, and wild mushrooms, producing a pure, clean, slightly metallic taste, ideal for many tapes.

In The Flavours of Andalucia, Elisabeth Luard describes a method of grilling asparagus that doesn't require blanching, calling the application of sizzling dry heat to fresh green asparagus "a stroke of genius."  She goes on to say, "You will never want to cook it any other way; the flavor is incomparable.

The thick green asparagus are brushed lightly with oil and set on a hot griddle.  The spears are then cooked until spotted black on all sides, then embellished with a sauce of chopped cured ham, garlic, lemon juice, and oil.

Recipe By     :Marian Burros and Lois Levine
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  Neufch‚Äötel or regular cream cheese -- softened
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmiglano-Reggiano
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2                     eggs
  3                     egg whites
     1/2         pound  zucchini -- coarsely shredded,
                        and squeezed dry in a towel
     1/2         pound  cooked asparagus -- cut 1/2" lengths
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- or more

In a large bowl, beat together the cream cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, flour, chives, thyme, eggs, and egg whites.  Mix in the zucchini and asparagus.  Season with salt and pepper.

Heat a large nonstick skillet until it is very hot.  Film with a little of the oil.  Drop heaping tablespoonsful of batter into the skillet and cook over medium-high heat until the pancakes are brown.  Turn and brown on the second side.  Repeat the process, filming with a little oil, if necessary.  Be sure to stir the batter before making each batch.  Refrigerate.

To serve, let the pancakes return to room temperature and reheat in a skillet that has been filmed with a little oil, by cooking on both sides.  Or reheat in a 400 degree oven on cookie sheets for 5 to 10 minutes.  Serve the pancakes with sour cream, cr√ãme fraiche, or yogurt.

This recipe yields about twenty 3-inch pancakes, 4 servings as main course.

Comments:  This is one of those vegetarian dishes that can also be served as a first course for a dinmer party instead of as a main course for vegetarians.

               Baked Pumpkins Stuffed With Sausage And Sage

Recipe By     :Georgeanne Brennan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : First Course                    Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     mini pumpkins - (2 1/2" to 3" dia)
  12            ounces  bulk pork sausage
  1                     egg
  1                cup  coarse Italian-style seasoned bread crumbs
                        = (homemade or purchased)
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh sage
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Salt -- to taste

With a sharp knife, slice off the upper one-fourth of the pumpkins and set the tops aside.  Scoop out the seeds, and if necessary, enough flesh to leave a shell about 1/2 inch thick.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a medium bowl, combine the sausage, egg, bread crumbs, sage, parsley, pepper, and salt, and mix well.  Fill each pumpkin with some of the stuffing, mounding it 1/2 inch above the rim.  Place the pumpkins on a baking sheet with their tops alongside, stem up.  Bake 35 to 45 minutes, until the filling is firm and has begun to pull away just slightly from the sides and the pumpkin shells are easily pierced with a knife.

Replace the tops and serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 first course or side dish servings.

Comments: The savory juices of the herbed stuffing permeate and flavor the pumpkins as they bake, making a decorative and tasty presentation for a fall meal.

  1                cup  oat bran or wheat germ
  2               cups  nonfat dry milk
  2               cups  granulated sugar

                          Beans And Greens Soup

Recipe By     :Ashley Miller
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              piece  pepperoni - (abt 2" long) -- cut 1/4" cubes
  1             medium  onion - (to large) -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  4               cups  chopped greens - (lightly packed)
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped
  1             medium  carrot -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh basil -- plus
                        extra for garnish
                        = (or 1 tspn dried basil)
  6               cups  stock
                        = (or stock and tomato juice)
  1                cup  chopped tomatoes -- drained
  1                cup  cooked beans
     1/2           cup  uncooked rice
  8                     kalamata olives - (to 12) -- sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- for garnish

In a soup pot, heat the oil over low heat.  When hot, add the pepperoni and saut√à 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the onions and garlic and saut√à until the onions are translucent.  Add the greens, celery, and carrots and saut√à, stirring, until the greens have wilted.

Stir in the basil, stock, tomatoes, beans, rice, and olives.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer gently 45 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Ladle into soup bowls and top with the Parmesan cheese and extra fresh basil.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  When the thermometer takes a serious dip as fall and winter approach, this soup becomes the soup of the season.  You can use Swiss chard, kale, and fresh spinach in this soup.  The choice of beans is likewise at your discretion -- limas, chickpeas, or any in the common-bean clan are fine.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  double-acting baking powder
  8             ounces  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  5              large  egg yolks -- lightly beaten

Sift the flour and baking powder together and set aside for the moment.  Working in a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter until it is soft and smooth.  Add the sugar in a slow, steady stream, followed by the salt, and continue to beat, scraping the bowl as needed, for about 3 minutes, or until the mixture is light, pale, and fluffy.  Add the yolks and beat to incorporate.  At this point, the mixture should be light, creamy, and satiny.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and, working with a large rubber spatula, fold in the sifted dry ingredients, taking special care not to overwork the dough.

Divide the dough in half and, working on a smooth surface, such as marble, mold each half into a log with a diameter of about 1 1/2 inches and a length about 8 inches.  The dough is going to be baked inside muffin tins, so you might have to adjust the thickness of the logs to the size of the tins; the logs should be about 1/4- to 1/2- inch slimmer than the muffin cups.  (The thickness of the log is more important than its length -- get the diameter right and the length will come along for the roll.)  Wrap each log in a double thickness of plastic wrap and chill for at least 4 hours.  (The dough can be made ahead and kept refrigerated for 2 days or frozen for up to a month.)

Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Set out one or two muffin tins.

Unwrap one log and, using a sturdy chefs knife, slice the log into 1/3-to 1/2-inch-thick cookies.  Put one slice of dough in each cup of the muffin tins.  Bake the cookies for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are just firm.  (Frozen cookies may take a minute or two longer.)  These cookies are meant to be pale -- don't let them brown; it's okay if the bottoms are lightly browned, but the tops should remain uncolored.  Transfer the cookies to a rack to cool.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

The dough can be made ahead, wrapped airtight, and kept refrigerated for 2 days or frozen for a month.  The baked cookies can be packed in an airtight tin and kept for 3 to 4 days at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 32 cookies.

Comments:  These belong to a family of French cookies called sable, for their appealingly sandy texture (sable means sandy).  They are made like icebox cookies (shaped into logs, sliced, and baked), but they most closely resemble shortbread.  You may be surprised to find these not only sandy, but slightly salty -- that's the way they're supposed to be.

Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, cardamom, and salt in the large bowl of an electric mixer.  Blend in eggs at low speed.  Add cream; beat at high speed, scraping bowl, until batter is texture of softly whipped cream.

Turn batter into a buttered and floured 9-inch tube pan.  Bake until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes.  Cool 5 minutes in pan.  Invert onto wire rack; cool completely.  Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Per Serving:  315 calories;  5g protein;  15g fat;  41g carbohydrates;  105mg cholesterol;  155mg sodium.

Comments:  Pound cakes flavored with cardamom are popular in Scandinavia.  It's best to grind your own cardamom, because the kind that is sold ground quickly loses its flavor.  This cake is adapted from a recipe in Scandinavian Feasts by Beatrice Ojakangas.

           Chicken Breasts With Garlic, Orange, And Kiwifruits

Recipe By     :Elaine Corn

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     kiwifruits -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" pieces
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  6                     boneless chicken breasts -- skin on
  1         tablespoon  minced garlIc
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Juice of 1 large orange - (1/2 cup)

Heat a serving platter in a 150 degree oven.

In a bowl, combine the kiwifruits and sugar, toss gently, and set aside.

Rinse the chicken breasts and pat dry with paper towels.  Smear the garlic over the side with skin.  Sprinkle the same side with salt and pepper.

Heat the butter in a wide, heavy saut√à pan over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken breasts, garlic-side down, and saut√à about 4 minutes on each side, turning once, shaking the pan occasionally, and taking care not to burn the garlic, until nicely browned.

Raise the heat to high and pour the orange juice over the chicken breasts.  Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 4 to 5 minutes, until the chicken breasts are cooked through.  Remove the chicken breasts to the warmed serving platter and keep warm.

Raise the heat to high, bring to a boil, and boil the sauce for about 30 seconds.  Add the kiwifruits and cook 45 to 60 seconds longer, until just heated through.

Pour over the chicken breasts and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Oranges and kiwifruits are the quintessential winter combination.  Put them together, and it feels a little tike summer.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely diced
                        = (or 1 pint small cherry tomatoes,
                        halved)
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     boneless skinless chicken breasts
  1                cup  chicken stock or low-sodium canned broth
                        A large pinch of saffron threads
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/4           cups  sour cream -- room temperature

Place the diced tomato in a colander and drain for 30 minutes.  Mix with the parsley and salt and pepper to taste.

Place the chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound gently until very thin.  Season with salt and pepper.

Bring the chicken broth to a boil.  Add the saffron; stir to dissolve.  Reserve.

In a large saut√à pan, heat the butter and olive oil over medium heat.  Place 3 chicken breasts in the pan and saut√à, turning once, until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to a warm platter and keep warm while you saut√à the remaining 3 chicken breasts.

Add the chicken stock to the saut√à pan and bring to a boil, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom.  Cook until reduced to 1/2 cup, 3 to 5 minutes.  Gently stir about half of the reduced broth into the sour cream, Stir the diluted sour cream into the remaining reduced broth.  Heat gently just until warmed through.  Do not boil.  Stir in about 1/3 cup of the diced tomato.  Taste for seasoning, adding. more salt and pepper if necessary.

To serve, spoon the sauce over the chicken breasts and sprinkle with the remaining tomato confetti.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Paillard is the French term for a skinned, boned, and pounded-thin chicken breast.  The refreshing tomato "confetti" offers a softly acidic counterpoint to the pungent saffron sauce and the red and yellow color is brilliantly appealing.  All told, it's a very special dish.

                           Chilled Avocado Soup

Recipe By     :Michele Anna Jordan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              small  yellow or white onion -- minced
  3                     serrano chiles -- minced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3                     ripe Hass avocados
  3 1/2           cups  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  3        tablespoons  minced cilantro leaves
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Black pepper in a mill

Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat, add the onions, and saut√à them until they are limp and fragrant, about 10 minutes.  Add the serranos, saut√à 5 minutes, then add the garlic and saut√à 2 minutes more.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

Cut the avocados in half and remove the pits.  Scoop out the flesh and place it in a blender or food processor.  Add hail of the stock and the onion mixture, and pur√àe.  Transfer to a large container, stir in the remaining stock, and refrigerate until the soup is well chilled, at least 3 hours.

To serve, stir in the lime juice and half of the cilantro, season with salt and pepper, and ladle into chilled soup bowls.  Sprinkle the remaining cilantro over each portion and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  There are many versions of avocado soup in California, some served chilled, some hot.  Some include cream, which can eclipse the flavor of the avocado.  To some palates, this creamy but creamless version, bright, tangy, and mildly spicy, with that edge of sweetness that avocados have, is the best.

Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat, add the onions, and saut√à them until they are limp and fragrant, about 10 minutes.  Add the serranos, saut√à 5 minutes, then add the garlic and saut√à 2 minutes more.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

<DirT>
Cut the avocados in half and remove the pits.  Scoop out the flesh and place it in a blender or food processor.  Add hail of the stock and the onion mixture, and pur√àe.  Transfer to a large container, stir in the remaining stock, and refrigerate until the soup is well chilled, at least 3 hours.

To serve, stir in the lime juice and half of the cilantro, season with salt and pepper, and ladle into chilled soup bowls.  Sprinkle the remaining cilantro over each portion and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  There are many versions of avocado soup in California, some served chilled, some hot.  Some include cream, which can eclipse the flavor of the avocado.  To some palates, this creamy but creamless version, bright, tangy, and mildly spicy, with that edge of sweetness that avocados have, is the best.

                 Chinese Latkes With Tangy Dipping Sauce

Recipe By     :Ashley Miller
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  potatoes
  3                     scallions, green and white parts -- finely chopped
  1                     egg
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        Chinese Dipping Sauce -- (see recipe)

With a fine grater, grate the potatoes into a medium bowl.  Add the scallions.  In another bowl, beat the egg with the cornstarch and salt, then add to the potato mixture, stirring well.

In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat.  When hot, drop a tablespoon of the potato mixture into the pan and flatten slightly with the back of the spoon.  Continue making pancakes in this way until the pan is filled.  Cook the pancakes 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until lightly browned.  Drain on paper towels.  Add the remaining oil and cook the rest of the potato mixture in the same manner.  Serve hot with the Chinese Dipping Sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 12 to 15 small pancakes; 4 servings.

Note:  The recipe for the dipping sauce makes an ample amount, so even if you double the amount of pancakes, it should still be enough.

Comments:  Chinese latkes?  Why not, in this era of fusion cooking?  If Molly Goldberg had spent time in Peking, these are the potato pancakes that she would have cooked.  The tangy Chinese Dipping Sauce replaces sour cream as a garnish and more than makes up for its absence.  Make a lot of these latkes -- they disappear quickly.

  1              pound  mashing potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  1             medium  onion -- cut into 1/4" dice

                        deribbed, and cut into 1/4" dice
  1              large  red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        deribbed, and cut into 1/4" dice
                        Kernels from 4 ears corn
  4             medium  scallions -- trimmed, and
                        thinly sliced across
  2             medium  celery ribs -- peeled, and

  1                     bag cranberries - (12 oz) -- picked over, rinsed
  1              large  apple, such as mutsu or Golden Delicious -- peeled, halved,
                        cored, and cut into 1/8" slices
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  ground allspice
     3/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  maple syrup
                        === PANCAKES ===
  2               cups  yellow cornmeal, preferably stone-ground
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1              large  egg

In a heavy medium nonreactive saucepan, combine all the ingredients for the compote and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 8 minutes, or until the cranberries pop and the apple slices soften.  Set aside.

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.

In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  In a medium bowl, beat the buttermilk, water, oil, and egg with a fork until blended.  Add to the cornmeal mixture and mix with a wooden spoon until a smooth batter forms.

Lightly oil a griddle and heat over medium heat.  For each pancake, pour a scant 1/4 cup of the batter onto the griddle.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until nicely browned on the bottom.  Turn the pancakes and cook for about 2 minutes longer, or until browned on the second side.  Transfer the pancakes to an ovenproof platter and keep warm in the oven while you cook the remaining pancakes.

To serve, transfer the cranberry compote to a bowl and serve alongside the pancakes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A special brunch entr√àe, these beautiful pancakes are topped with a delectable, not-too-sweet maple-scented compote -- a lovely alternative to plain maple syrup.  The compote can be made up to one week ahead and rewarmed before serving, or it can be frozen for up to several months.  Spoon any leftover compote over ice cream, or slather it over slices of toasted pound cake or coffee cake for a special breakfast treat.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  chicken thighs
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  buffer
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (28 oz) -- with juice
     1/2           cup  slivered blanched almonds
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  ground thyme

Position a rack in the lower third of oven.  Preheat to 350 degrees.

Rinse the chicken thighs and pat dry with paper towels.

Heat the oil in a large, heavy saut√à pan over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken, skin-side down, and saut√à about 5 minutes on each side, turning once, until well browned.  Remove to an ovenproof Dutch oven.

Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the saut√à pan.  Add the butter and place over medium heat.  When melted, add the onion and saut√à about 5 minutes, until softened.  Add the tomatoes and cook until broken up, about 10 minutes longer.

Meanwhile, in a small skillet, stir and toss the almonds over medium-high heat until toasted.  Add to the saut√à pan along with the raisins, salt, white pepper, curry powder, paisley, and thyme.  Stir to mix well and cook for 5 minutes to blend the flavors.

Pour the sauce over the chicken pieces, cover tightly, and bake 35 to 45 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and very tender.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  To modern tastes, the chicken over-cooks in a sauce that defies ethnic origin.  Curry from India with a western predilection to ground thyme?  The dish was a favorite of Roosevelt's and of his era.  Pro-FDR hosts liked to serve it to unsuspecting Republicans only to inform them of the dish's legacy after the usual round of compliments.

Jim Spaulding is a wine maker in the Napa Valley town of Calistoga, and his tastes run to fine wine and Country Captain.  His version is dark meat only and he changed the raisins to golden raisins.  Special for his wife, Martha Casselman, he leaves out the garlic and bell pepper.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              piece  ginger - (abt 1 1/2") -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  2                     green serrano chiles - (to 3)
     1/2           cup  fresh cilantro leaves
  24             large  shrimp -- cleaned and deveined
  2          teaspoons  turmeric
  1           teaspoon  salt - (scant)
  1                cup  Cream of Rice
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  6                     lemon wedges - (to 8)

Place the ginger, chiles, and cilantro in the bowl of a food processor and process them until they are finely minced, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.  Put the mixture in a small work bowl and add the shrimp, stirring and tossing to coat well.

Add the turmeric and again coat well.  (Although you can use a spoon, coating works best if you use your fingers.  However, the turmeric will stain them, so it is a good idea to wear food gloves, if you have them.)  Allow to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours.

When ready to cook, remove the shrimp from the refrigerator.  Sprinkle on the salt and allow to stand for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, put 1/4 cup of the Cream of Rice in a medium-sized plastic bag to have ready for the next step.  (Do not use more than 1/4 cup at a lime; otherwise, the marinade will make the Cream of Rice too moist to coat evenly.)

In a small, deep saucepan, pour enough oil to completely cover the shrimp.  Put 6 shrimp into the plastic bag, close it, and toss them to coat with the Cream of Rice.  Place all the shrimp on a large slotted spoon and ease them into the hot oil.  They will immediately sizzle.  Turn over after 1 minute and fry for another minute, or until evenly golden.  Remove and set aside on paper towels to absorb excess oil; repeat the process with another 6 shrimp.  Using the rest of the Cream of Rice, repeat with the remaining shrimp, 6 at a time.

Serve garnished with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 24 shrimp.

Comments:  With a crisp, melt-in-your-mouth texture similar to Japanese tempura, these incredible shrimp explode with lively Indian flavors.  The marinade gives them punch, while the Cream of Rice in the batter gives therm an especially light, crunchy coating.

Place the ginger, chiles, and cilantro in the bowl of a food processor and process them until they are finely minced, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.  Put the mixture in a small work bowl and add the shrimp, stirring and tossing to coat well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the turmeric and again coat well.  (Although you can use a spoon, coating works best if you use your fingers.  However, the turmeric will stain them, so it is a good idea to wear food gloves, if you have them.)  Allow to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to cook, remove the shrimp from the refrigerator.  Sprinkle on the salt and allow to stand for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, put 1/4 cup of the Cream of Rice in a medium-sized plastic bag to have ready for the next step.  (Do not use more than 1/4 cup at a lime; otherwise, the marinade will make the Cream of Rice too moist to coat evenly.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small, deep saucepan, pour enough oil to completely cover the shrimp.  Put 6 shrimp into the plastic bag, close it, and toss them to coat with the Cream of Rice.  Place all the shrimp on a large slotted spoon and ease them into the hot oil.  They will immediately sizzle.  Turn over after 1 minute and fry for another minute, or until evenly golden.  Remove and set aside on paper towels to absorb excess oil; repeat the process with another 6 shrimp.  Using the rest of the Cream of Rice, repeat with the remaining shrimp, 6 at a time.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve garnished with lemon wedges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 24 shrimp.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  With a crisp, melt-in-your-mouth texture similar to Japanese tempura, these incredible shrimp explode with lively Indian flavors.  The marinade gives them punch, while the Cream of Rice in the batter gives therm an especially light, crunchy coating.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE DOUGH ===
  4 1/2           cups  flour
  1              ounce  fresh yeast
                        = (or 2 tspns dry yeast)
  1                cup  milk -- more or less
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Grated peel of 1/2 lemon
  2                     eggs
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  1                cup  milk
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
  4          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2                     egg yolks
  1 3/4           cups  Quark or Ricotta cheese -- strained by
                        pressing through a strainer with a
                        flexible spatula
     2/3           cup  raisins -- soaked in
  4          teaspoons  rum
  7        tablespoons  butter -- for greasing dish
                        Confectioners' sugar

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Sift the flour into a bowl, make a well in the center, and crumble in the yeast.  Pour in the milk, work the yeast until dissolved, and cover with flour.  Cover the bowl with a cloth and leave to rest in a warm spot, until the flour has cracks in it (15 to 20 minutes).

Melt the butter and stir with the sugar, salt, lemon peel, and eggs until creamy.  Add to the bowl and work into a smooth, dry dough that leaves the sides of the bowl.  If necessary, add a little milk.  Cover and leave to rise for 15 minutes.

To make the filling, bring the milk and sugar to a boil.  Dissolve the cornstarch in a little milk, add to the rest of the milk, and cook through, stirring.  Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract and the egg yolks one at a time.  Add the Quark and fold in the raisins.

Divide the dough into 9 equal pieces and quarter each of these.

Form the small pieces of dough into balls by rolling them with a circular motion against the work surface, hand cupped.

With a rolling pin, roll out the balls of dough into small, 3- to 4-inch circles of even thickness.

Use a spoon to divide the filling among the circles of dough.  Place the filling in the exact center of each, so that the rolls can be sealed more easily.

Holding the dough in your cupped hand, pull the edges upwards.  Carefully pinch the dough closed over the filling and roll again into a ball.  Turn the buchteln in the melted butter and place right up against each other.  Bake for 15 minutes, then at 425 degrees for 25 minutes, until golden brown.

This recipe yields 36 rolls.

Comments:  Called buchteln, these rolls are an example of typical Austrian baking.  Serve them still slightly warm.

Recipe By     :Lou Seibert Pappas
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7                     eggs -- separated
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        = (or 1 tbspn Cointreau or
                        framboise liqueur)
  6             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped, melted,
                        and cooled
                        Whipped cream -- sweetened to taste,
                        = (or vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt)

Butter a 6-cup souffl√à dish, a 10-inch round baking dish, or 8 individual souffl√à dishes, about 8 ounces each.  Dust the bottom and sides of the dishes with sugar.

In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy.  Add the salt and cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks form.  Gradually add 1/4 cup of the sugar, beating until stiff, glossy peaks form.

In a medium bowl, beat the yolks until thick and pale in color.  Beat in the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and the vanilla or liqueur.  Stir in the melted chocolate.  Fold one-fourth of the beaten egg whites into the chocolate mixture.  Fold this mixture into the remaining whites.

Spoon the souffl√à mixture into the prepared dishes.  If making in advance, cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for up to 1 hour, or refrigerate for up to 24 hours.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees for the large souffl√à or 400 degrees for individual souffl√às.  Bake the large souffl√à for 30 to 35 minutes or the individual souffl√às for 10 to 12 minutes, or until set.  Add a few minutes to the baking time if refrigerated.  Serve with whipped cream, ice cream, or frozen yogurt.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This delectable souffl√à is particularly easy to assemble, and it can be made as many as 24 hours in advance and baked just before serving.

Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  flour
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  dill seeds
  1           teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut 1/4" pieces
  1                cup  heavy cream

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, dill seeds, and salt.  Cut or rub in the butter until the mixture is the texture of coarse meal with a few pea-size pieces remaining.  Stir in the cream with a fork just until the dough comes together.

On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough gently just until smooth, about 5 times.  Roll the dough 3/4-inch thick.  Using a 2-inch round cutter, stamp out circles of the dough.  Put them, about 1/2 inch apart, on an ungreased baking sheet.  Roll out the scraps in the same way.  Stamp out more circles and put them on the baking sheet.

Bake the biscuits in the middle of the oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 16 biscuits.

Comments:  Dill seeds add a pleasant and unusual flavor to these flaky biscuits, which get their richness from both butter and heavy cream.  Quick to make and to bake, the biscuits are best served warm with butter.

  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  sour cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook fettuccine for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender but firm; drain well.

Meanwhile, in a heavy saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.  Add shallots; cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes or until softened.  Stir in stock and bring to boil; simmer for 5 minutes or until reduced slightly.  Whisk in cream; cook for 30 seconds.  Remove from heat.  Add cooked noodles and sour cream; toss to combine well.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Transfer to shallow pasta bowl or deep platter.  Scatter chives over top; sprinkle with cheese.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

         Fresh Strawberries And Cream-Filled Hazelnut Cornucopias

Recipe By     :Julia Child
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  beautiful fresh ripe strawberries
  2                     egg whites
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
     1/2          pint  heavy cream -- chilled
  2               cups  confectioners' sugar -- sifted
                        Pure vanilla extract -- to taste
                        = (or dark Jamaican rum, or kirsch)
  6                     Hazelnut Cornucopias -- (see recipe), plus
                        more if you wish to pass with the berries
  2        tablespoons  chopped toasted hazelnuts

Equipment:  A clean dry bowl for whipping egg whites, and a large wire whip or portable beater; a second bowl, of metal, for whipping cream, set into a larger bowl with a tray of ice cubes and water to cover them

The strawberries:  If strawberries are sandy, drop them into a bowl of cold water, swish them gently, then lift out immediately and drain on a rack.  Pick them over to be sure each is perfect, but do not stem them.

Whipped cream lightened with egg whites:  Shortly before serving, beat the egg whites until they start foaming, then beat in the salt and cream of tartar, and continue beating until egg whites form stiff peaks.  Set egg whites aside and immediately start whipping the cream, using the same beater -- circulate it all around the bowl, incorporating as much air as possible, and whip until cream holds its shape nicely but is not too stiff.  Fold in enough of the egg whites by dollops to lighten the cream, but it should hold its shape sufficiently to be spooned into the cornucopias.  Fold in confectioners' sugar to taste -- 2 to 3 tablespoons, and 1 teaspoon or so of vanilla, rum, or kirsch.

Strawberries may be prepared and left on their rack an hour or so in advance -- refrigerate them on a hot day.  If the cream is made somewhat ahead, turn it into a sieve lined with washed cheesecloth and set over a bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate -- it will exude a little milky liquid.

Serving:  The moment before serving, arrange the berries in a bowl or on plates.  Fill the cornucopias with the cream, using a teaspoon or a pastry bag, and sprinkle a pinch of chopped nuts over the top of the cream; arrange the cornucopias in a bowl.  Serve at once, passing separately bowls of confectioners' sugar and the remaining cream plus, if you wish, additional cornucopias.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The reason for rolling the hazelnut wafers into cornucopias is so that you can fill them with a tight whipped cream and serve them with strawberries.  You dip the berries by their stems into confectioners' sugar, and then into the cream -- lovely finger food for all ages.

Recipe By     :Gerald Hirigoyen with Cameron Hirigoyen
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             quarts  water
  2               cups  dried white navy beans -- soaked in water
                        for 8 to 10 hours
  1                     bouquet garni
  1              pound  ham shank
  2             medium  carrots -- coarsely chopped
  1             medium  celery root -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1             medium  onion -- coarsely chopped
  2             medium  turnips -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1              pound  butternut squash -- unpeeled, seeded,
                        and chopped into 1" cubes
  1              small  cabbage -- cored, and
                        sliced into 1"-thick strips
  3                     leeks -- trimmed, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  10            ounces  haricot verts (green beans) -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  1                cup  cooked peeled fava beans

Place 4 quarts water, the white beans, the bouquet garni, and the ham shank in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over high heat.  Cover and bring to a boil.  Simmer for 15 minutes, then add the carrots, celery root, onion, turnips, squash, cabbage, leeks, garlic, salt, and pepper.  Return to a boil, lower the heat, and sumner, covered, for 30 minutes.

Add the haricots verts and cook until just cooked through, about 10 minutes.

Add the fava beans and cook until they are just warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes.

Remove the bouquet garni and the ham shank.  Discard the bouquet garni and reserve the ham shank.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Garbure, a vegetable soup, is such a popular dish in Anglet, a town next door to Biarritz, that it hosts an annual festival in the soup's honor.  The event is sponsored by the local Confr√ãrie de la Garbure (Brotherhood of Vegetable Soup).  The members promote the traditions of true garbure to ensure they are carried on by successive generations.  A hotly contested cook-off climaxes the festival.  Garbure is made in every season, changing its character with whatever produce is available.  The fall and winter version features root vegetables.  When fava beans arrive in spring, they, too, are added.  And in summer the soup contains green beans, tomatoes, and new potatoes.  What should remain constant are the ham, white beans, and cabbage.

                     German Bacon And Potato Omelette

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Omelets

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     unpeeled Yukon Gold potatoes
  4                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  sour cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             slices  bacon -- diced
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh chives

Cook the potatoes in salted boiling water about 15 minutes, until barely tender.  Drain, peel, and slice about 1/4 inch thick.

Preheat the broiler.  Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, beat the eggs just until blended.  Mix in the sour cream, salt, and pepper.

In a 10-inch skillet, saut√à the bacon over medium heat until crisp and transfer to paper towels to drain.  Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the drippings and saut√à the onion and potatoes until glazed.

Pour the eggs over the potato mixture and sprinkle with the bacon.  Reduce the heat to low and cook until the eggs are set, shaking the pan to prevent them from sticking.  Place under the broiler to heat through.  Sprinkle with the parsley and chives.  Slide onto a warm platter and cut into wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

If you have leftover boiled potatoes, incorporate them in this hearty German omelette for a tasty entr√àe for brunch, lunch, or supper.  Black rye bread and coleslaw are good accompaniments.

Cook the potatoes in salted boiling water about 15 minutes, until barely tender.  Drain, peel, and slice about 1/4 inch thick.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the broiler.  Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, beat the eggs just until blended.  Mix in the sour cream, salt, and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 10-inch skillet, saut√à the bacon over medium heat until crisp and transfer to paper towels to drain.  Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the drippings and saut√à the onion and potatoes until glazed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the eggs over the potato mixture and sprinkle with the bacon.  Reduce the heat to low and cook until the eggs are set, shaking the pan to prevent them from sticking.  Place under the broiler to heat through.  Sprinkle with the parsley and chives.  Slide onto a warm platter and cut into wedges.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you have leftover boiled potatoes, incorporate them in this hearty German omelette for a tasty entr√àe for brunch, lunch, or supper.  Black rye bread and coleslaw are good accompaniments.

Recipe By     :John Shields
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  Chesapeake seasoning
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1               dash  Tabasco sauce
  1              pound  backfin crabmeat -- picked over
     1/3           cup  saltine cracker crumbs
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying,
                        (optional)
                        Clarified butter* and/or olive oil -- for saut√àing,
                        (optional)
                        Tartar sauce -- for accompaniment
                        Lemon wedges -- for accompaniment

* Note:  To clarify butter, place solid unsalted butter into a heavy-bottomed pot and slowly melt over low heat.  When the butter is completely melted, remove from the heat.  There wifi be three distinct parts of the butter remaining: a foam on the top; a clear, golden-colored liquid in the center; and a milky liquid on the bottom.  The trick is to separate the golden liquid from the foam and milky solids.

Mix the egg, mayonnaise, mustard, pepper, Chesapeake seasoning, Worcestershire, and Tabasco together in a blender or mixing bowl until frothy.  Place the crab-meat in a bowl and sprinkle on the cracker crumbs.  Pour the egg mixture over the top.  Gently toss or fold the Ingredients together, taking care not to break up the lumps of crabmeat.

Form the cakes by hand or with an ice cream scoop into 8 mounds about 3 inches in diameter and 3/4-inch thick.  Do not pack the mixture too firmly.  The cakes should be as loose as possible, yet still hold their shape.  Place the cakes on a tray or platter lined with wax paper, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before cooking.

Pour oil into a heavy skillet to a depth of about 1 1/2 inches.  Heat the oil and fry the crab cakes, a few at a time, until golden brown, about 4 minutes on each side.  Remove with a slotted utensil to paper towels to drain.  Or broil the cakes: Slip them under a preheated broiler until nicely browned, turning to cook evenly, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side.  Or saut√à the cakes: Heat a small amount of clarified butter or olive oil, or a combination, in a skillet and saut√à the cakes, turning several times, until golden brown, about 8 minutes total cooking time.

Serve at once, with tartar sauce and lemon wedges on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe is in the most traditional style of Bay crab cakes.  It uses a slightly spiced mixture of mayonnaise and egg, and is lightly bound together with cracker crumbs.

                           Ginger-Scallop Soup

Recipe By     :Barbara Kafka
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  ginger -- unpeeled, and
                        thinly sliced across
  1                     leek, green part only -- washed well,
                        and cut into hair-thin strips -- (optional)
  1              pound  bay scallops
  8        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" pieces
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt -- or to taste
     1/4           cup  cooked long-grain white rice -- (optional)

In a small saucepan, bring 5 cups water and the ginger to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced to 3 cups.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve.  Reserve the liquid and discard the ginger.

Meanwhile, if using the leek, bring a small saucepan of salted water to a boil.  Stir in the leek.  Lower heat and simmer for 15 minutes.  Drain and reserve.

In a medium saucepan, return the ginger liquid to a gentle simmer.  Stir in the scallops.  Simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, or until they become opaque.  Do not overcook, or they will become rubbery.

With a slotted spoon, remove the scallops and set aside.  Over low heat, whisk the butter into the liquid, a few pieces at a time.  While whisking, add the cayenne, lemon juice, and salt to taste.  Remove from the heat and stir in the scallops and, if using, the leek.  For a slightly heartier soup, add the rice along with the scallops.

This recipe yields 5 cups; 4 first-course servings.

Comments:  Pale and sensational, flecked with green if the leeks are used, this soup can start the most festive of meals.  The recipe can be doubled.  The broth can be made ahead and the leeks blanched; but you'll have to excuse yourself from the table for about five minutes to cook the scallops and whisk in the butter -- much like making a beurre blanc.

          Greek-Style Rice With Spinach, Feta, And Black Olives

Recipe By     :Paula Wolfert
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh spinach -- washed, and
                        tough stems removed
                        Coarse sea salt -- as needed
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped onions or leeks
     1/2           cup  fresh tomato pur√àe -- reduced by
                        boiling to 3 tbspns
     1/2           cup  long-grain rice
     1/4           cup  chopped dill
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Oily black olives -- for garnish
                        Chunks of feta cheese -- for garnish
                        = (or spoonfuls of thick yogurt)

Wash the spinach and tender stems until the water runs clean; drain.  If leaves are large and crinkly, sprinkle lightly with salt and mix well. Let stand in a colander 15 minutes; rinse and squeeze out excess moisture.  Shred the spinach to make about 3 cups.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 10-inch straight-sided skillet.  Add the green onions, onions, a pinch of salt, and 1/4 cup water and cook, covered, over medium-low heat for 10 minutes.  When the water evaporates, slowly let the onions turn golden, stirring occasionally.  Add 1 cup water, the reduced tomato pur√àe, and rice.  Cover and cook for 10 minutes.

Spread the spinach and dill over the rice, cover, and cook 10 minutes longer.  Remove from heat, mix, then place a double thickness of paper toweling over the rice, cover again, and let stand until cool.  Adjust the seasoning with black pepper and salt and drizzle with the remaining tablespoon olive oil.  Serve at room temperature garnished with black olives and feta cheese or yogurt.

This recipe serves 4 as a side dish or supper with crusty bread.

Comments:  This dish of spinachy rice with feta and black olives is extremely simple√ñand therein lies its elegance.

Wash the spinach and tender stems until the water runs clean; drain.  If leaves are large and crinkly, sprinkle lightly with salt and mix well. Let stand in a colander 15 minutes; rinse and squeeze out excess moisture.  Shred the spinach to make about 3 cups.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 10-inch straight-sided skillet.  Add the green onions, onions, a pinch of salt, and 1/4 cup water and cook, covered, over medium-low heat for 10 minutes.  When the water evaporates, slowly let the onions turn golden, stirring occasionally.  Add 1 cup water, the reduced tomato pur√àe, and rice.  Cover and cook for 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the spinach and dill over the rice, cover, and cook 10 minutes longer.  Remove from heat, mix, then place a double thickness of paper toweling over the rice, cover again, and let stand until cool.  Adjust the seasoning with black pepper and salt and drizzle with the remaining tablespoon olive oil.  Serve at room temperature garnished with black olives and feta cheese or yogurt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe serves 4 as a side dish or supper with crusty bread.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This dish of spinachy rice with feta and black olives is extremely simple√ñand therein lies its elegance.

                    Green Beans With Onions And Tomato

Recipe By     :Neela Paniz
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cumin seeds
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1              piece  ginger - (1" long) -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  2                     green serrano chiles -- finely chopped
  2             medium  tomatoes -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1 1/2    tablespoons  ground coriander
  1 1/4         pounds  green beans -- ends trimmed,
                        and chopped into 1/4" pieces
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
                        Fresh cilantro -- for garnish

Heat a wok over medium-high heat and add oil.  Add cumin seeds, onions, ginger, and chiles and saut√à about 3 to 4 minutes, until onions brown slightly on their edges.

Mix in the tomatoes, cayenne, and coriander and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes.

Add the green beans, stir-frying for another 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the salt and reduce the heat to low.  Cover and simmer about 20 minutes, or until the beans are firm but tender.

Serve immediately, garnished with cilantro.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  The green beans common in India resemble Blue Lake beans and they are almost always chopped into small pieces before cooking so that they can be scooped up with bread at a meal.  In Indian cooking, vegetables are always cooked until quite tender; this way, they absorb the flavors of the spices in which they simmer.

                   Grilled Halibut With Pineapple Salsa

Recipe By     :Dee Hobsbawn-Smith

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2                pineapple -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
  1                     Granny Smith apple -- cored and grated
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
     1/2                lemon -- juice and zest
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Hot chill flakes -- to taste
  4                     halibut steaks - (5 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  1         tablespoon  grated fresh ginger
     1/2                lemon -- zest only
                        Hot chili flakes -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme or chives

Combine the pineapple, apple, 1 teaspoon ginger, lemon juice and zest, salt, and hot chili flakes.  Stir well, cover, and let stand to allow the flavors to blend.

Lightly oil the fish.  Sprinkle it with the 1 tablespoon ginger, lemon zest, hot chili flakes, and thyme or chives.

Heat the grill to high and grill the fish, turning once.  Serve with the pineapple compote on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Many fruits do not work well with fish, but pineapple is a natural partner.  This salsa is good with any ham- or pork-based dish, or with grilled swordfish, sea bass, salmon, or Arctic char.  Basmati rice and grilled zucchini complete the plate.

                     Ham And Sour Cream Baked Noodles

Recipe By     :Marion Cunningham
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             quarts  water - (12 cups)
  1         tablespoon  salt -- pIus
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                     wide egg noodles -- (12 ounces)
  6        tablespoons  butter
  1                     green bell pepper
  3                     celery stalks
  1              small  onion
  2                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  cottage cheese
  1 1/2           cups  sour cream
     1/2         pound  cooked ham
                        = (to make 2 cups chopped)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === Special equipment ===
                        Eight-cup ovenproof casserole

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Put the water in a large pot, add 1 tablespoon salt, and set over high heat.  When the water boils, add the noodles, stir with a fork, and turn the heat down to medium-high.  Cook the noodles for 7 to 9 minutes.  Use a fork to fish a noodle out of the water, run it under cold water, and taste.  If it is tender, the noodles are done; if a little firm, let cook 2 more minutes and taste again.

When tender, dump the noodles into a colander set in the sink and let the water drain away.  Put the hot noodles in the casserole.  Add the butter in chunks to the casserole and stir to melt the butter in the hot noodles.  Stir well, so the noodles are coated by butter; this will keep them from sticking together while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

Finely chop enough of the pepper to make 1/2 cup.  Wrap any leftover pepper in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for later use.

Trim the ends off the celery stalks, discard them, and finely chop the stalks.

Peel and finely chop the onion.  Measure 1/4 cup; wrap and store unused onion in the refrigerator.

Beat the eggs slightly with a fork or small whisk in a small bowl.

Dump the cottage cheese, sour cream, chopped ham, the eggs, the 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the vegetables into the casserole.  Mix well with a large spoon.

Bake for 40 minutes, or until bubbling and set.  The top should look crisp and browned in spots.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is a good version of the classic macaroni-and-cheese dish.  Serve it with a fresh fruit salad and rye crackers.  It's a good dish to take to a potluck dinner, or to a friend in bed with a cold.

To reheat the noodles, put leftovers in a skillet, add just enough milk to moisten -- not so much that they're swimming in milk -- and heat, stirring, for a few minutes.  Taste to see if it is hot.  Keep cooking and stirring until hot enough to serve.

     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

In a medium stockpot, bring 2 quarts water to a boil.  Trim all but 2 inches of stalk from the beets, then drop the beets into the water.  Simmer over medium-high heat 30 to 45 minutes, or until tender.

Remove the beets from the pot and allow them to cool.  Remove the skins from the beets, cut off the remaining stalks, and cut the beets into 3/4-inch cubes.

Place the beets, onions, chives, garlic, parsley, and lemon mint in a medium bowl and toss.  Add the salt, pepper, vinegar, and oil, then toss again until all of the ingredients are coated.

Cover and refrigerate 2 hours.  Remove the salad from the refrigerator, and allow it to sit uncovered 15 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 5 cups; 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Beets that blush with hues of red and orange combine to resemble an afternoon sunset in August.  However, the colors can continue to offer beauty to the table throughout the fall and into winter, since beets do store well under proper conditions.  Although this recipe calls for chilling the salad before serving, you can also enjoy it when the beets are still slightly warm.

                               Harvest Soup

Recipe By     :Barbara Ciletti
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  3                     scallions, green and white parts -- diced
  1                can  pumpkin - (16 oz)
  1                     yellow belt pepper -- seeded, chopped
  1                     orange bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
  4               cups  chicken broth
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  curry powder
                        A large pinch of grated nutmeg
                        A large pinch of ground ginger
  1                     bay leaf
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Chopped chives -- for garnish

In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Saut√à the onions and scallions 7 minutes, or until slightly golden.  Add the pumpkin, peppers, broth, and spices.  Bring the soup to a boll, reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, 15 minutes.

Take out the bay leaf, and pur√àe all but 1 cup of the soup in a blender or food processor.  Return the pur√àe to the saucepan.  Over medium heat, add the cream, stirring until the soup thickens.  Transfer to individual serving bowls, and garnish with chives.

This recipe yields 7 1/2 to 8 cups; 6 servings.

Comments:  The nutmeg, ginger, and bay leaf add a medley of flavor and spice to the mellow peppers and pumpkin.  This soup needs little accompaniment, so serve it with spice muffins and a plate of sliced apples.  This meal truly celebrates the senses as well as the harvest.

                          Hazelnut Cornucopiias

Recipe By     :Julia Child
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  shelled hazelnuts
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  egg whites - (abt 2 whites)
  4        tablespoons  all-purpose flour - (level) -- in a sifter
  1         tablespoon  dark Jamaican rum
                        A little soft butter

Toasting and grinding the hazelnuts:  (The hazelnuts are toasted to give additional flavor and also to loosen the outside skins; taste several to be sure they are not rancid.)  Place them in a roasting pan and toast for 10 to 15 minutes in a preheated 350 degree oven, stirring 2 or 3 times, until lightly browned.  Rub by small handfuls in a towel to remove as much of their brown skins as you easily can.  When cool, grind 1/3 of them roughly in a blender or food processor and set aside in a small bowl.  Grind the rest of them with the sugar, and reserve for the following cookie mixture.

The cookie mixture:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees, and set rack in middle level.  Cream the butter in a mixing bowl.  (If chilled, cut into pieces and beat with a wooden spoon in a metal bowl over warm water; if it softens too much, then beat over cold water until a creamy mass.)  Blend in the sugar and hazelnut mixture, the salt, and the cream.  Add the egg whites, stirring only enough to blend.  Sift and fold in the flour by thirds, then fold in the rum.  Mixture should look like a heavy batter.  Batter should be used promptly.

Forming, baking, and rolling the cookies:  Before forming the cookies, be sure the oven is preheated, have your spatula and your metal or paper molds ready, and have your kitchen timer handy.  Drop a 2-tablespoon blob of cookie mixture on a buttered cookie sheet, and spread it out into a 4 1/2-inch circle with the back of a tablespoon, making sure that the edges are the same thickness as the rest of the shape, or about 1/16 inch.  Form 1 or 2 more cookie shapes, leaving a good inch between them.  Sprinkle a pinch of chopped hazelnuts over each.  Place in oven and set timer for 4 minutes, meanwhile forming another sheet of cookies.

Cookies are done when about 1/4 inch around edges is lightly browned.  (If they seem to be cooking too fast, lower oven thermostat slightly).  Set cookie sheet on open oven door and let cool a few seconds.  One at a time gently slither spatula or pancake turner under a cookie all around to loosen it, lift it off, turn it upside down on your work surface, and roll it around the metal or paper horn.  Rapidly repeat with the other cookies -- leaving them on the oven door keeps them pliable until you are ready to roll them.

Close oven door and wait for oven to come up to temperature again, then bake the other sheet, and form another batch.  Meanwhile, in less than a minute, the rolled cookies will have crisped and you can gently dislodge the molds.  Let cookies cool on a rack.

These cookies are fragile, and soften rapidly in damp weather.  Bake them shortly before serving, or store in a warming oven at around 100 degrees, or freeze them.

This recipe yields about 16 cookies 4 1/2 inches in diameter.

Variations:  You can roll the cookies into other shapes, such as cylinders, using the end of a wooden spoon or a cylindrical cookie form.  You can press the limp cookie over the outside of a small bowl or inside a teacup to make cookie cups.  You can make the classic tile or tuile shape, when you drape the limp cookie over a rolling pin to crisp.  Or, of course, you can serve them perfectly plain or flat -- which makes them easier to store, and nice with tea or sherbets.

Comments:  This is the type of cookie that is soft and pliable when it has just come from the oven, giving you several seconds to roll or form it into a shape before it crisps.  The formula makes a nicely delicate wafer, and the flavor of toasted hazelnuts is particularly delicious.  If you cannot find fine fresh hazelnuts, however, substitute walnuts -- which can be ground without toasting.  (Note: All shelled or ground nuts keep freshest in the freezer.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     turkey - (abt 14 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === APPLE-PEAR STUFFING ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  4                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
  2               cups  chopped onions
  3                     celery stalks with leaves -- chopped
  6                     dried pear halves -- chopped
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
     1/2           cup  dried sour cherries
  36            slices  firm white bread - (abt 2 lbs) -- cut 3/4" squares
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  2          teaspoons  fresh thyme leaves
                        = (or 3/4 tspn dried thyme)
     1/2      teaspoon  shredded fresh sage leaves
                        = (or 1/4 tspn dried sage, crumbled)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  turkey or chicken broth

Rinse the turkey inside and out and pat dry with paper towels.  Season all over with salt and pepper.  Place the turkey, breast-side up, on a rack in a large roasting pan.  Refrigerate.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the apples, onions, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8 minutes, or until softened.  Transfer to a large bowl.

Add the dried pears, raisins, dried cherries, bread, parsley, thyme, and sage to the apple mixture and season with salt and pepper.  Pour the broth over and toss until evenly moistened.

Spoon the stuffing loosely into the neck and body cavities.  Place the remaining stuffing in a small buttered baking dish; refrigerate.  Tuck the turkey skin at the neck end under, fold the wings under, and tie the legs together.  Cover with a foil tent.

Roast the turkey for 2 3/4 hours, basting every 30 minutes with the pan juices.  Remove the foil and continue roasting for about 45 minutes longer, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, away from the bone, registers 180 degrees.  Let the turkey stand loosely covered with foil for about 20 minutes before carving.

Meanwhile, about 45 minutes before the turkey is done, put the reserved stuffing into the oven, and bake for 1 hour.

Carve the turkey, spoon the stuffing into a bowl, and serve.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  Perfectly roasted turkey always makes a dramatic centerpiece for a holiday meal.  The apple-pear stuffing, a rich, ftavorful blend of traditional and new ingredients, such as sour cherries and dried pears, sets this recipe apart.  Prepare it one day ahead, but stuff the turkey just before it goes into the oven.

Rinse the turkey inside and out and pat dry with paper towels.  Season all over with salt and pepper.  Place the turkey, breast-side up, on a rack in a large roasting pan.  Refrigerate.

<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Roast the turkey for 2 3/4 hours, basting every 30 minutes with the pan juices.

                            Indian Home Fries

Recipe By     :Ashley Miller
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  boiling potatoes
  4        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  grated fresh ginger
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  turmeric
  1              pinch  ground red pepper
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds - (heaping)

In a large pot, cover the potatoes with water and bring to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer, covered, 30 to 35 minutes, or until tender.  Drain, cool slightly, and peel.  Cut the potatoes into 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch cubes.

In a blender, process the water, ginger, garlic, salt, turmeric, and red pepper until a paste is formed.

In a large, preferably nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  When hot, add the fennel and cook 30 seconds.  Remove from the heat, stir in the spice paste, then cook 2 minutes.  Add the potatoes and stir with a spatula to evenly coat them with the spice paste.  Fry 10 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the potatoes have a golden brown crust.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This dish uses an Indian cooking technique that results in mouth-watering spicy potatoes fried to a crisp golden brown.  Like American home fries, the potatoes are first cooked until tender before they are saut√àed.  However, before that final step, they are tossed with a tantalizing paste of garlic, fresh ginger, a bit of turmeric, and ground red pepper, and then fried with whole fennel seed.  This dish is marvelous with roast chicken.

Recipe By     :Michele Anna Jordan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -
  1                     yellow onion -- diced
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  ground beet -- preferably ground
                        for chili
  4                     eggs -- beaten
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Black pepper in a mill
  1           teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
                        = (or other hot-pepper sauce)
  1              pound  fresh spinach -- stems trimmed,
                        and leaves torn into pieces
  3             ounces  grated or sliced jack, cheddar, or
                        fresh asiago cheese -- (optional)

Heat the olive oil in a medium-size heavy skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion, and saut√à it until it is soft and fragrant, about 8 minutes.  Add the garlic, and saut√à for 2 minutes more.  Add the ground beef, and cook it until it has lost most of its color, using a fork to break it up as it cooks; do not overcook.

Season the eggs with salt, pepper, and Tabasco, and pour them over the meat.  Cook, stirring gently all the while, until the eggs are almost but not quite set, then top the mixture with the spinach, cover the pan, and cook until the spinach wilts, about 2 minutes.  Gently fold the wilted spinach into the egg mixture, top with the cheese, if you like, and season with salt and pepper.

Transfer to a serving bowl or individual plates.  Serve immediately, perhaps with toasted sourdough bread on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In California one hears of many Joes who have taken credit over the years for in venting this dish.  Scores of San Francisco restaurants have served one version or another of the classic for decades, and it remains popular.  To make an authentic version at home, ask your butcher for beef ground for chili, which is a coarser grind than regular ground beef.  If you can't get it, use the regular variety.  Restaurant versions typically omit cheese; you can include it, if you like.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  2               cups  sugar
  3 1/2           cups  cake flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  almond or vanilla extract

  6                     egg whites
                        Lady Baltimore Filling And Frosting -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.

Beat together the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl until pale and creamy.  In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.  Add the almond extract to the milk.  Add a little of the dry ingredients to the butter-sugar mixture and mix in.  Then stir in a little of the milk.  Alternately add the remaining dry and wet ingredients in small amounts until both are completely incorporated.  Beat until a smooth batter is formed.  Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry.  Fold the whites into the batter, a third at a time.  Pour into the prepared cake pans.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in middle of cake comes out clean.  Let cool for 5 minutes in the pans, then turn out onto a rack and cool completely.

Prepare the filling and frosting while the cake layers are cooling, then fill and frost.

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  cream of tartar
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  chopped raisins
     3/4           cup  chopped walnuts or pecans
  8                     figs -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  Cognac

Combine the egg whites, sugar, salt, cream of tartar, and 2/3 cup water in the top pan of a double boiler.  Beat with an electric beater over simmering water until soft peaks form, about 7 minutes.  Remove from the water and beat in the vanilla.  Continue beating until the frosting is stiff.  Put aside half of the frosting.

Beat the raisins, nuts, figs, and Cognac into the remaining half of the frosting.  Use this mixture as a filling between the two layers of the cake.  Ice the entire cake with the reserved frosting.

This recipe yields enough for one 9-inch cake.

                            Leek Harvest Soup

Recipe By     :Barbara Ciletti
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     red bell pepper -- for garnish
  3             quarts  rich chicken broth
  2              large  baking potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  3              large  leeks, white parts -- cleaned, chopped
  1                cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh dill
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Place the pepper on a baking sheet and roast uncovered 30 to 40 minutes, or until the skin begins to char and blister.  Place the pepper in a paper bag, tie the bag at the top, and set aside to cool 20 minutes.  Remove the stem, skin, and seeds from the pepper, then chop it, place in a small dish, cover, and set aside.

In a medium stockpot, bring the broth to a boll over medium-high heat.  Add the potatoes and cook over medium heat 10 to 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are somewhat tender.  Remove from the stove, then using a potato masher, break the potatoes to look like a thick, chunky pudding.  Add the leeks, and return the pot to the stove.  Cook 15 minutes over medium heat, then add the parsley, chives, garlic, dill, salt, white pepper and oil, Lower heat and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the mixture from sticking to the pot.

Transfer to individual serving bowls, garnish with the peppers, and serve immediately.  (Note: This soup can be stored in the freezer without the roasted peppers 3 months.  Add the peppers when ready to serve.)

This recipe yields 8 cups; 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Fresh dill and parsley transform this leek and potato combination.  Once parsley and dill reach their full flavor in the garden, make plenty of this soup for the colder months.  It's delicious any time of year and provides a refreshing flavor even in warmer weather.  It's full of vitamins, iron, and potassium, certainly enough to revive the body and rejuvenate the spirit.  Make it a day in advance of serving for the best flavor.

                        Lily Broth With Fava Beans

Recipe By     :Donata Maggipinto
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh or frozen fava beans -- shelled
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             ounces  pancetta or slab bacon -- diced
  4              large  yellow onions -- thinly sliced
  2                     shallots -- thinly sliced
  2                     leeks, white part plus 2" of green -- thinly sliced
  4                     green onions, green and white parts -- chopped
  2                     green garlic shoots, green and white parts -- diced (optional)
                        = (available at farmers' markets or
                        specialty stores
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  6               cups  chicken stock or low-sodium canned broth
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped chives and chive flowers -- for garnish
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

If using fresh fava beans, bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add the fava beans and blanch for 30 seconds.  Rinse under cold water.  Slit the seams of the beans along their edges and pop the beans out of their skins.  Reserve the beans and discard the skins.

In a large pot, warm the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the pancetta, onions, shallots, leeks, green onions, and green garlic, if using.  Saut√à until the onions are soft and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the wine and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the chicken stock, cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 25 minutes.  Add the fava beans and cook for 5 minutes more.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

To serve, ladle the soup into warmed soup bowls and garnish with the chives and chive flowers.  Pass the Parmesan cheese at the table.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This light, aromatic broth heralds spring.  The lily family includes all varieties of onions and garlic including leeks and chives.  The soft color and texture of fava beans mirror the delicate characteristics of this broth.  If you can't find favas, substitute baby lima beans.

                Linguine With Chevre, Herbs, And Tomatoes

Recipe By     :Michele Anna Jordan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  dried linguine
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves
  3               cups  cherry tomatoes -- cut in half
                        = (or 4 medium slicing tomatoes, cut into
                        wedges)
     1/2           cup  chicken stock -- preferably homemade
  4             ounces  young (not aged) ch√ãvre -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  minced herbs
                        = (such as basil, thyme, oregano,
                        Italian parsley, summer savory, or a
                        combination)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Black pepper in a mill

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Cook the linguine until it is al dente.

While the linguine cooks, make the sauce:  Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat.  Add the garlic, and saut√à it until it just begins to color.  Remove the garlic and discard it.  Add the tomatoes, and saut√à them for 4 minutes, shaking the pan several times so that they cook evenly.  (If you are using slicing tomatoes, turn the wedges once.)  Transfer the tomatoes to a serving bowl.  Add the stock to the skillet, increase the heat to high, swirl the skillet to loosen any pan juices, and reduce the liquid by one third.

Drain the pasta and put it in the bowl on top of the tomatoes.  Scatter the ch√ãvre and the herbs over the pasta, and pour the sauce over all.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, toss gently, season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.  If you like, serve with some additional olive oil at the table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This simple pasta is quick to make and offers a hearty but not heavy meal, ideal when summer nights turn cool, as they often do throughout much of California.

                      Linguine With Pistachio Pesto

Recipe By     :Donata Maggipinto
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  basil leaves - (loosely packed)
     1/3           cup  shelled unsalted pistachios -- plus
                        more for garnish
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, crushed
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon zest -- plus
                        more for garnish
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
  1 1/2         pounds  linguine

Put the basil, pistachios, garlic, and lemon zest in the bowl of a food processor and pulse briefly to cornbine.  With the machine running, add the olive oil through the feed tube in a steady stream.  Process until smooth.  Transfer to a medium bowl and stir in the Parmesan cheese.

Bring a large pot of water to a boll.  Add 2 generous pinches of salt and when the water returns to a boil, add the linguine and cook until al dente.  Drain, reserving a few tablespoons of the water.

Put the pasta in a large warm bowl.  Thin 1 cup of the pesto with some of the pasta water.  Spoon over the pasta and toss gently to mix, adding more pesto if desired.  Serve immediately, garnished with chopped pistachios and lemon zest.

If you have extra pesto, transfer it to a small bowl and top it with a thin layer of olive oil.  Wrapped tightly and refrigerated, it will last 2 to 3 weeks.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Pistachios take the place of pine nuts in this vibrant pesto.  It's an exuberant pasta that makes a delightful sauce for pasta.  Incidentally, this pesto is also great as a dip for vegetables, thinned a bit, if you wish, with olive oil.  This recipe was created for a spring issue of the Williams-Sonoma catalog when there was a windfall of pistachios and a hankering for pasta.

                        Midwinter Soup With Wehani

Recipe By     :Jeffrey Alford & Naomi Duguid
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dried porcini mushrooms -- washed
  2               cups  boiling water
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4               cups  water or mild stock
  1                cup  Wehani rice
                        = (or Black Japonica rice)
  1 1/2           cups  diced carrots - (abt 1/2 lb)
  3               cups  diced potatoes - (abt 1 lb)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        === OPTIONAL ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or
                        Pecorino cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Place the porcini in a medium bowl and pour the boiling water over.  Let soak until softened, 20 to 30 minutes.  Drain, reserving the soaking water.  Coarsely chop the mushrooms and set aside.

In a large heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and stir briefly, then add the bay leaves, pepper, the reserved mushroom soaking water, the water or stock, and rice.  Raise the heat and bring to a boil.  Partially cover, lower the heat to medium-low, and simmer for 10 minutes.

Add the carrots and potatoes and bring back to a boil, then simmer, partially covered, over medium-low heat for 30 minutes, or until tender. If the liquid looks low, add 1/2 to 1 cup hot water.  Add the salt and let simmer for another few minutes.

Serve topped, if you wish, with a little grated cheese and/or fresh parsley, and place extra accompaniments on the table so guests can garnish their soup as they wish.

This recipe yields 6 soup course or 3 to 4 main course servings.

Comments:  You can also use leftover cooked Wehani or black Thai sticky rice or any of the parboiled rices, Black .Japonica, or brown rice in this soup; use 2 to 3 cups cooked rice.  Follow the instructions above (omitting the raw rice), and once the carrots and potatoes are cooked, stir in the rice and heat through.  Soup made with leftover rice will be a little less thick.

Comments:  This is an easy soup to make, thick and satisfying, great on a cold winter night.  You can serve it as a soup course or make it the centerpiece of a meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  coarse whole-wheat flour
                        = (or 1 cup each wheat bran and
                        old-fashioned oats)
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/4           cup  sugar
  4        tablespoons  cold butter
  2               cups  buttermilk

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly grease a 9-inch round cake pan.

In a large bowl, stir the flours or wheat bran and oats, salt, baking soda, cream of tartar, and sugar together.  With a pastry cutter, 2 knives, or your fingers, cut or work the butter into the dry ingredients to the texture of coarse crumbs.  Make a well in the center and add the buttermilk.  With a wooden spoon, mix until a soft dough is formed.

Turn the dough out onto a floured board and knead lightly, just enough to form a large ball.  (Flour your hands if necessary for easier handling.)  Flatten slightly.  With a sharp knife, make a cross on the top.  Place the dough in the prepared pan and bake until the bread is lightly browned and sounds hollow when tapped, 35 to 40 minutes.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

Turn the dough out onto a floured board and knead lightly, just enough to form a large ball.  (Flour your hands if necessary for easier handling.)  Flatten slightly.  With a sharp knife, make a cross on the top.  Place the dough in the prepared pan and bake until the bread is lightly browned and sounds hollow when tapped, 35 to 40 minutes.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Meatballs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  pork sausage meat - (4 oz)
  2               cups  lean ground beef - (16 oz)
  1                     egg
     2/3           cup  fresh nonsweet white bread crumbs -- soaked in
  5        tablespoons  dry white French vermouth
  2                     garlic cloves -- pur√àed
  8              drops  hot-pepper sauce
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  salt
  8                     grinds black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano or thyme
                        Flour -- for dredging
                        === SERVING SAUCE ===
  1                cup  beef stock or bouillon
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  Dijon-type strong prepared mustard -- beaten to blend with
     1/2           cup  dry white French vermouth
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Oregano or thyme -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  tomato pur√àe or sauce -- (optional)

Beat meat, egg, crumbs, and seasonings together, using a food processor if you want a very smooth mixture.  Roll gobs into balls 1 inch in diameter; roll lightly in flour, and arrange in one layer in a lightly oiled baking dish or jelly-roll pan.

Bake in a preheated 450 degree oven in upper middle level, 7 to 8 minutes, turning once or twice, to brown nicely and just to stiffen.  Drain in a sieve or a colander.

Boil down the ingredients for the sauce until lightly thickened, carefully correct seasoning, and fold in the mini meatballs.

At serving time, reheat and place in a casserole on an electric warming device, or in an electric flying pan on lowest heat.  Have a jar of toothpicks close by.

This recipe yields 40 to 50 mini meatballs.

                         Mougins-Style Olive Tart

Recipe By     :Roger Verge
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  flour
     3/4           cup  olive oil
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2         pound  onions
  1              pound  Swiss chard, spinach, or chicory*
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme flowers
  6 1/2         ounces  small black olives
  2                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
                        Pepper -- to taste

* Shopping:  For the green leafy vegetables, the weight given here is based on cleaned leaves weighed after removing the white ribs from the Swiss chard and the chicory and the stems from the spinach.

Everything can be prepared the day before:  Put the flour, 1/2 cup of the olive oil, 10 tablespoons tepid water, and salt in a bowl.  Knead until the dough no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl and your hands.  Slightly flatten the dough and refrigerate it for 30 minutes.

Chop the onions and sweat them in the remaining olive oil in a saut√à pan over low heat.  Stir occasionally and cook until tender and very lightly golden brown.

Meanwhile, wash, drain, and chop the leafy greens.  Add them to the cooked onions along with the garlic and thyme flowers.  Cook uncovered until all the cooking liquid has evaporated.

Pit the olives; ii they are large, cut them in quarters.

In a large bowl, beat the eggs with the heavy cream.  Off the heat, pour the cream-egg mixture into the pan with the vegetables.  Blend well and give a few turns with the pepper mill.  (The olives are salty enough that no additional salt should be necessary.)

Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.  With your hands, pull the dough over a baking sheet into a disk 12 inches in diameter.  Roll the edge of dough over and lift it up to form a 1/2-inch-high border.  Spread the vegetables evenly over the dough with a fork.  Scatter the olives on top and bake for 25 to 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  boneless skinless chicken breasts
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh herbs
                        = (tarragon, chives, thyme, parsley,
                        chervil)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped hazelnuts, cashews, or almonds
  1                     lemon or lime -- juice only
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  cold-pressed nut oil -- (optional)

Cut the chicken breasts in half and dredge with the chopped herbs.  Pan-steam the chicken in the oil over low heat in a nonstick pan.  Use a lid that fits snugly over the meat inside the pan.  Turn frequently and reduce the heat if the meat sizzles or browns.  After 5 to 7 minutes, remove the chicken to a plate and cover it loosely.

Return the pan to high heat.  Add the nuts; cook and stir until the nuts color and smell toasty.  Scatter the cooked nuts over the chicken, sprinkle with lemon or lime juice, and season with salt and pepper.  Drizzle a little nut oil over top and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  If you do not have nut oil in your fridge, just use a good olive oil, and leave out the final drizzle.  Use raw nuts, stored in the freezer with all your other perishables, and taste them before using to ensure they're fresh.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     chicken breast halves - (to 6) -- excess fat removed,
                        meat pounded to an even thickness
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour - (to 1/2)
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish

Place the chicken, mustard, and garlic in a large mixing bowl; cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Remove the chicken from the bowl and pat dry with paper towels.  (This is a very important step, or the coating will not stick to the chicken.)

Place the flour, salt, and pepper on a large plate.  Place the eggs in a shallow bowl and the bread crumbs on another large plate.

Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture, then in the eggs, and then in the bread crumbs.

Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and, when it is hot, add the oil.  Add the chicken breasts and cook until crispy and golden-brown, about 5 minutes per side.

Serve immediately with lots of lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

               Poached Salmon With Cucumber And Caper Sauce

Recipe By     :Marion Cunningham
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CUCUMBER AND CAPER SAUCE ===
  1                     cucumber
  4             sprigs  parsley
  3         tablespoon  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  capers
                        === THE FISH ===
  4                     salmon steaks, 1 1/4" thk - (abt 8 oz ea)
                        Water -- for poaching
                        Salt -- to taste

Making The Sauce:  Peel the cucumber.  Cut it half lengthwise; then, with a spoon, scrape out the seeds and discard them. Cut each half into 3 or 4 lengthwise slices, then cut those long pieces crosswise into dice.

Rinse the parsley, pat dry, and remove and discard the stems.  Finely chop the leaves.  You should have about 2 teaspoons.  Set aside.

Melt the butter over low heat in a small pot.  Add the diced cucumber and salt lightly.  Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add the 3 tablespoons of water and the capers and stir to blend.  Taste, and add more salt if needed.  Cucumbers sometimes need a good dose of salt to bring out the flavor.  Stir in the chopped parsley, and remove the sauce from the heat.

Preparing The Salmon:  Rinse the salmon steaks with cold water and pat dry.

Four salmon steaks should fit into an 11-inch saut√à pan, or any straight-sided pan about 2 to 3 inches deep, with a capacity of 2 to 3 quarts.  Put about 1 1/2 inches of water in the pan, add salt, and stir.  Set the pan on a burner turned to high and bring to a boil.

When the water boils, turn the heat down to low, so the water is at a low simmer, or what some like to call a lazy bubble.  You want just that bare bit of motion to cook the fish gently.

Put the salmon steaks in the pan, and simmer for about 4 minutes after the water resumes its gentle bubbling.  Stand at the stove and spoon the simmering water over the top of the fish so the pieces cook on top as well.  The salmon is done when the meat turns from a deep to a pale pink.  Use a fork or the point of a knife to poke into the center of a steak; the middle, too, should be that paler pink.

Remove the pan from the heat as soon as the steaks are done.  Place on servings plates and spoon the Cucumber and Caper Sauce over the steaks, or serve the sauce separately to be passed at the table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Poaching -- that is, cooking in gently boiling water -- is a foolproof method for any firm piece of fish cut like a steak and leaves the fish delicate and moist.  But you do need a firm fish cut like a steak; a thin fillet would dissolve.

                  Pork Tenderloin With Mustard And Thyme

Recipe By     :Marian Burros and Lois Levine
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  pork tenderloins
     1/2           cup  whole-grain mustard
  4              large  garlic cloves -- crushed
  2        tablespoons  dried thyme
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/4           cup  dry red wine
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

Remove the fat from the tenderloins and wash and dry them.  Cut off each tip and reserve.  Cut the remaining tenderloins into 1-inch-thick slices.

Combine the mustard, garlic, thyme, pepper, vinegar, red wine, and oil in a bowl large enough to hold the tenderloins and tips and mix thoroughly, coating the pork slices and the tips well.  Marinate overnight or at least 1 hour in the refrigerator, turning occasionally.

To serve, allow the meat to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Remove from the marinade.  Prepare a stove-top grill or preheat the broiler.  Broil or grill the pork tenderloin pieces on both sides for 5 to 7 minutes total, until just slightly pink inside, brushing with marinade.  This can also be done over a charcoal grill.  Watch carefully.  It goes from pink to dry in a flash.  If there is leftover marinade, boil it and brush the cooked pork with it before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A quick main dish.

Serving Size  : 18    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  Yukon Gold or russet potatoes - (12 oz ea)
  2               cups  butter - (4 sticks) -- melted
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  baking powder
     1/2    tablespoon  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     2/3           cup  buttermilk
  4                     scallions -- sliced thinly

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Grease a cookie sheet.  Scrub the potatoes clean and place on the prepared cookie sheet.  Bake in the skins about 45 minutes until very soft.  Peel and mash with the butter while still warm.

Turn the oven up to 400 degrees.  Sift together the dry ingredients and mix into the potatoes.  Add the buttermilk and scallions and combine.  Don't overmix.  The dough will be quite sticky.  Pat the dough down to 1/2 inch on a floured board and cut out with a floured biscuit cutter.  Place 1 inch apart on the cookie sheet.  Alternately, you may drop dough by the tablespoonful onto the cookie sheet.  Bake for 20 minutes until well browned.  Serve warm with marmalade and country ham.

This recipe yields about 18 biscuits.

Comments:  These are very moist and savory.  Serve them with any chutney or marmalade.

         Pumpkin Pasta With Baby Box Choy, Prosciutto, And Pecans

Recipe By     :Georgeanne Brennan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTA DOUGH ===
     1/4           cup  homemade or canned pumpkin pur√àe
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     baby bok choy -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1/2"-thick slices
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped pecans
  4             ounces  thinly-sliced prosciutto or Virginia ham -- cut into silvers

To make the pasta dough:  In a food processor, combine all the ingredients and process until a ball forms, about 1 minute.  To make by hand, mix all the ingredients in a bowl with a wooden spoon.  On a lightly floured board, knead the dough until smooth, about 5 minutes.

By hand or using a pasta machine, roll the dough into sheets about 1/8-inch thick.  Cut into strips about 1/4-inch wide.

In a large pot of salted water, cook the pasta 3 to 4 minutes, or until tender.  Drain and transfer to a heated serving platter.  Add 1 tablespoon of the butter and the black pepper and toss.  Set aside and keep warm.

In a skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat and saut√à the bok choy until wilted, about 3 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bok choy to the pasta.  In the same pan, saut√à the pecans and prosciutto or ham for about 30 seconds.  Add more butter if necessary.  Stir the bok choy and half the pecan mixture into the pasta.  Garnish with the remaining pecan mixture and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Pumpkin contributes color and flavor to homemade pasta, a beautiful background for the assertive toppings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  cleaned red snapper - (abt 3 lbs) -- filleted, gills
                        removed, and head and  frame reserved
                        === FOR THE FISH BROTH ===
  4             quarts  water
  2                     celery stalks -- cut 4" lengths
  1             medium  carrot -- sliced
  2                     fresh or dried bay leaves
                        === FOR THE SOUP ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3              large  baking (Idaho) potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/3" cubes
  2                     young leeks, light green and white parts -- well washed,
                        and finely chopped
  4                     scallions, green and white parts -- finely chopped
                        = (or 2 spring onions)
  4                     fresh or dried bay leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  peperoncino (crushed red pepper)
  2               cups  diced (1/4") peeled seeded ripe tomatoes
     1/2           cup  long-grain rice
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley - (lightly p

In a large pot, combine the fish head and frame with the water, celery, carrot, and bay leaves.  Bring to a boll over high heat, then adjust the level of the heat to a simmer.  Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour, skimming the surface often.  While the broth is simmering, cut the fillets into 1/2-inch pieces and refrigerate.

Strain the broth through a fine sieve lined with cheesecloth.  You should have about 3 quarts of broth; if not, add water as necessary.

In a deep, heavy 4- to 5-quart pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Most likely, the potatoes will stick, but that is fine; adjust the level of heat to prevent the bits of potato that stick from getting too dark.

Stir in the leeks, scallions, and bay leaves.  Season them lightly with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until the leeks are wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the fish stock and peperoncino and bring to a boil, scraping up the bits of potato from the bottom.  Adjust the level of heat to a simmer and season again lightly with salt and pepper if needed.  Simmer, uncovered, until the potatoes begin to fall apart, about 40 minutes.  (The soup can be prepared to this point up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated.  Bring the soup to a simmer before continuing.)

Stir the diced tomatoes and rice into the soup and cook, stirring occasionally, for 7 minutes.  Add the pieces of red snapper fillets and continue simmering until the rice is tender, about another 5 minutes.  Remove the bay leaves.  Stir the parsley into the soup, check the final seasoning, and serve in warm soup bowls.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  If you cannot buy a whole red snapper, you can substitute about 1 pound red snapper fillets or other flaky firm fish fillets cut into 1/2-inch cubes.  Skip the that step of the recipe, omitting the ingredients for the fish broth, and substitute 3 quarts vegetable broth for the fish broth.

<DirT>
In a large pot, combine the fish head and frame with the water, celery, carrot, and bay leaves.  Bring to a boll over high heat, then adjust the level of the heat to a simmer.  Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour, skimming the surface often.  While the broth is simmering, cut the fillets into 1/2-inch pieces and refrigerate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Strain the broth through a fine sieve lined with cheesecloth.  You should have about 3 quarts of broth; if not, add water as necessary.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a deep, heavy 4- to 5-quart pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Most likely, the potatoes will stick, but that is fine; adjust the level of heat to prevent the bits of potato that stick from getting too dark.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir in the leeks, scallions, and bay leaves.  Season them lightly with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until the leeks are wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the fish stock and peperoncino and bring to a boil, scraping up the bits of potato from the bottom.  Adjust the level of heat to a simmer and season again lightly with salt and pepper if needed.  Simmer, uncovered, until the potatoes begin to fall apart, about 40 minutes.  (The soup can be prepared to this point up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated.  Bring the soup to a simmer before continuing.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir the diced tomatoes and rice into the soup and cook, stirring occasionally, for 7 minutes.  Add the pieces of red snapper fillets and continue simmering until the rice is tender, about another 5 minutes.  Remove the bay leaves.  Stir the parsley into the soup, check the final seasoning, and serve in warm soup bowls.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  If you cannot buy a whole red snapper, you can substitute about 1 pound red snapper fillets or other flaky firm fish fillets cut into 1/2-inch cubes.  Skip the that step of the recipe, omitting the ingredients for the fish broth, and substitute 3 quarts vegetable broth for the fish broth.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     garlic bulbs -- tops removed
  1                     onion -- cut in eighths
  8              large  rosemary sprigs
  1                     chicken - (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon Juice
  2                     Idaho potatoes -- peeled, grated
  2        tablespoons  minced onion
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2           cup  clarified butter

To Prepare The Chicken:  Soak a clay pot in water for at least 15 minutes.  Place 1 of the garlic bulbs, half of the onion, and 2 of the rosemary sprigs in the cavity of the chicken.  Truss the chicken and season liberally with salt and pepper.  Place the chicken in the clay pot and add the remaining garlic, onion, 2 of the rosemary sprigs, and the bay leaves to the pot.  Place the pot in a cold oven and turn on the heat to 450 degrees.  Cook for 1 hour, or until the chicken is completely cooked.  Remove from the oven and cut the chicken in half.

To Prepare The Potato Pancakes:  Place the lemon juice in a saucepan of water and bring to a boil.  Blanch the potatoes for 2 minutes, transfer to paper towels, and dry completely.  Combine the minced onion, potatoes, egg, flour, and baking powder in a small bowl.  Form the mixture into 6 pancakes.

Heat the clarified butter in a large saut√à pan and cook the pancakes for 3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.  Remove to paper towels to drain and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Place half of a chicken in the center of each plate.  Arrange 3 potato pancakes next to the chicken and spoon some of the pan juices around the chicken.  Place 2 sprigs of rosemary standing upright on the chicken on each plate.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Roasting in a clay pot helps keep the chicken moist and juicy.

          Roasted Sweet Potato Bisque With Ham And Leek Ravioli

Recipe By     :Patrick Clark
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  sweet potatoes
  6        tablespoons  butter
  1                     leek, white part only -- sliced
  2                     onions -- sliced
  3             quarts  chicken stock
  1              sprig  thyme
  1                     stem parsley
  1                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Smithfield Ham And Leek Ravioli -- (see recipe)
  2          teaspoons  chopped chives

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Bake the sweet potatoes for 45 minutes, or until just tender.  Remove the potatoes from the oven and cool to room temperature.  Peel the sweet potatoes, discarding the skins, and cut the flesh into large chunks.

Heat 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large saucepan and add the leek and onions.  Cook over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, or until translucent.  Add the sweet potatoes and 2 quarts of the stock and bring to a boll over medium-high heat.  Tie the thyme, parsley stem, bay leaf, and peppercorns in a piece of cheesecloth and add it to the pan.  Lower the heat to medium, and simmer for 30 minutes.  Remove and discard the spice bag and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Pur√àe the soup in a blender for 2 minutes, or until smooth, and pass through a fine-mesh sieve.  Return the soup to the pan and slowly bring to a boil.  Thin to the desired consistency with the remaining stock and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter.

Ladle some of the soup into each bowl and place 3 warm ravioli in the center.  Sprinkle the chopped chives around the bowls.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The bisque can be prepared up to a day in advance and reheated just prior to serving.

             Romaine Lettuce, Apples, Hazelnuts, And Cheddar

Recipe By     :Marcel Desaulniers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHERRY WINE DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  whole hazelnuts
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sherry wine vinegar
     3/4           cup  sunflower oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SALAD GREENS AND GARNISH ===
     1/2           cup  whole hazelnuts
     1/2    tablespoon  fresh lemon Juice
  2                     Granny Smith apples -- unpeeled
  1 1/2         pounds  romaine lettuce -- cored, cut
                        into 1/2"-wide pieces, washed, dried
     1/2         pound  New York State sharp cheddar cheese -- cut into sticks
                        that are 2 3/4" long and 1/4" thick

Make the Sherry Wine Dressing:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Toast the hazelnuts on a baking sheet with sides in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove them from the oven and immediately cover with a damp towel.  Invert another baking sheet over the first one to hold in the steam (this makes the nuts easier to skin).  After 5 minutes, remove the skins from the nuts by placing small quantities inside a folded dry towel and rubbing vigorously between your hands.  Cool the nuts thoroughly before processing in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade for 30 seconds, until finely ground.

Transfer the ground hazelnuts to a 3-quart stainless steel bowl.  Add the sherry wine vinegar and whisk to combine.  Add the safflower oil and whisk until blended.  Season with salt and pepper.  Use a handheld immersion blender or a food processor to blend the dressing until fairly smooth and emulsified.  Cover with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature until needed.

Finish and assemble the salad:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Toast and skin the hazelnuts as previously described for the dressing.  Cool the nuts to room temperature before cutting each in half.  Set aside until needed.

In a 3-quart stainless steel bowl, add the lemon juice to 2 cups of cold water.  Core and quarter the apples, then slice each quarter lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices and immediately place in the acidulated water to prevent oxidation (brown discoloration).

Divide and arrange the romaine pieces on four 10- to 12-inch room-temperature plates.  Drain the apples in a colander, rinse under cold running water, and shake dry.  Arrange the apple slices around the lettuce, with the skin side touching or near the edge of the plate.  Whisk the dressing.  Dress the romaine and apples on each plate with 2 tablespoons of dressing.  Sprinkle the cheddar cheese and hazelnuts on the center of each salad.  Drizzle 1 to 2 tablespoons of the dressing over the cheese and hazelnuts.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

            Sauteed Beets With Olive Oil, Garlic, And Parsley

Recipe By     :James Peterson
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     medium-large beets - (6 oz ea) -- boiled or steamed
                        = (or 16 baby beets)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil or butter
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Slice the beets between 1/8-and 1/4-inch thick.  Heat the olive oil in a nonstick or well-seasoned saut√à pan over medium heat.  Spoon in the garlic.  When the garlic begins to sizzle, slide in the beets and toss or gently stir for 5 minutes -- just long enough to heat the beets through.

Sprinkle the parsley and salt over the beets, grind over some fresh pepper, and saut√à for 1 minute more.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This method is one of the easiest ways to serve beets.  The flavor of the garlic keeps up with the flavor of the beets without overpowering them.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
  8                     trout fillets - (abt 2 lbs in all)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/2      teaspoon  dried sage
     1/2           cup  chopped pecans
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.  Cover a baking sheet with paper towels.

In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderate heat.  Sprinkle the fish with the salt. and pepper.  Put half the trout in he pan and cook for 2 minutes.  Turn and cook until browned and just done, 1 to 2 minutes longer.  Transfer the cooked fillets to the prepared baking sheet and keep warm in the oven.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan, cook the rest of the trout fillets, and add them to the baking sheet.

Wipeout the skillet and melt the butter over low heat.  Add the sage and pecans and cook, stirring, until the butter is golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the parsley.  Serve the trout with the butter sauce spooned over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Fish Alternatives:  The combination of pecans and brown butter complements many kinds of fish, such as black bass, lake perch, or walleye.

Comments:  Brown butter is a sublimely simple sauce.  Emphasize the butter's nutty flavor with pecans, throw in a little sage and parsley, and you have an ideal topping for trout.

Practical and easy to prepare, japchae is ideal for potluck parties and outings, or any kind of celebration, because it can easily be shared among a lot of people.  It is tasty cold and does not need to be complemented with other side dishes.  Furthermore, it's easy to transport because it is not soupy.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  1                     shallot -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  butter
  1                cup  champagne
  1 1/3           cups  rich white veal stock
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  beurre mani√à*
  1                     egg yolk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  grated Provolone cheese
                        === FOR THE VEGETABLES ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  9             ounces  spinach leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Grated nutmeg -- to taste
                        === YOU WILL ALSO NEED ===
  4              large  sea scallops -- with shells if
                        possible
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  butter
     1/2           cup  champagne

* Note:  Knead 7 tablespoons of softened butter with 1 cup flour to form a paste, and use as needed.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

To make the sauce, sweat the shallots in the butter without letting them color.  Add the champagne gradually and then the stock.  Reduce by about half.

Meanwhile, reserve 2 tablespoons of the cream, reduce the remainng to two-thirds, and strain into the stock.  Lightly bind the sauce with the beurre mani√à.  Whisk the egg with the 2 tablespoons of cream and blend into the sauce.  Bring just to a boil, season with salt and pepper, and strain.

In a skillet, melt the butter, add the leaf spinach, wilt, and season.  Halve the scallop flesh vertically and season with salt and pepper.  Grease a saucepan with butter, put in the scallops, and cover with champagne.  Carefully simmer the scallops until done, lift out, and drain.  Boil down the poaching stock hard and add to the sauce.

Drain the spinach and divide among the cleaned, warmed scallop shells or ovenproof gratin dishes.  Place two scallops halves on top of each shell, cover with the sauce, and sprinkle with the cheese.  Bake on the top rack of the oven until golden brown.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  5        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2         pounds  sea scallops -- dried well
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
                        Grated zest of 1 lemon
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon

In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil with 1/2 tablespoon of the butter over moderate heat.  Season the scallops with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and the pepper.  Put half the scallops in the pan.  Cook until browned, about 2 minutes.  Turn and cook until browned on the second side and just done, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove.

Heat the remaining I tablespoon oil with 1/2 tablespoon of the butter in the pan and cook the remaining scallops.  Remove.

Wipe out the pan.  Put the pan over moderately-low heat and add the wine.  Boil until reduced to approximately 2 tablespoons, 1 to 2 minutes.  Reduce the heat to the lowest setting.  Whisk the remaining 4 tablespoons butter into the wine.  The butter should not melt completely but just soften to form a smooth sauce.  Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, the lemon zest, and the tarragon.  Pour the sauce over the scallops.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Be careful not to heat the white-wine sauce too much or it may separate.

                     Shrimp, Jicama, And Mango Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2         pounds  large shrimp -- shelled
  1              small  jicama - (abt 1/4 lb) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" dice
  1                     mango -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" dice
     1/2           cup  chopped cilantro or flat-leaf parsley
  6        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  olive oil

In a large skillet, bring the water and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt to a boil.  Add the shrimp, cover, and bring back to a boil.  Cook, covered, over moderate heat for 1 minute.  Stir.  Continue cooking until the shrimp are just done, about 2 minutes longer.  Drain.

When the shrimp are cool enough to handle, cut each one in half lengthwise and then in half crosswise.

Put the shrimp in a large glass or stainless steel bowl and add the jicama, mango, and cilantro.

In a small glass or stainless steel bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, the mustard, the remaining 1 1/4 teaspoons of salt, and the pepper.  Add the oil slowly, whisking.  Just before serving, add this vinaigrette to the shrimp mixture and toss.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The crunchy jicama and the soft, sweet mango provide lively counter-points to the shrimp in both flavor and texture.

Shellfish Alternatives:  Crabmeat, though expensive, is delicious in this salad and is a time-saver, too, since it's usually already cooked.  (For that matter, you can use precooked shrimp instead of boiling uncooked ones.)  If you really want to splurge, try the salad with lobster.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     taco shells
  5 1/2    tablespoons  cooking oil
  2               cups  drained and rinsed kidney beans
                        = (from one 19-oz can)
     1/3           cup  tomato salsa
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  wine vinegar
     3/4      teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro -- (optional)
  1               head  romaine lettuce -- shredded
  2              large  tomatoes -- chopped
  1                     avocado -- cut thin slices
     1/4         pound  cheddar cheese -- grated (abt 1 cup)
  1                     roasted chicken -- bones and skin
                        removed, meat shredded - (abt 1 lb meat)
     1/3           cup  black olives -- halved and pitted
                        = (such as Kalamata)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Put the taco shells on a baking sheet and bake them until crisp, about 8 minutes.  Break each one in half.

In a medium saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderate heat.  Add the beans, salsa, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt.  Cook, mashing with a potato masher, for about 5 minutes.

In a small glass or stainless steel bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, pepper, chili powder, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Add the remaining 4 1/2 tablespoons oil, whisking.  Add the cilantro.

To serve, spread one side of the taco-shell halves with the refried beans and put four on each plate.  Top with layers of the lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, cheese, chicken, and olives.  Pour the dressing over the salads.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This Tex-Mex favorite comes together in minutes.  You'll be surprised by how quick and easy it is to make your own refried beans -- and how much better they taste than the ready-made variety.

                  Spaghetti With Shrimp And Basil Sauce

Recipe By     :Lidia Matticchio Bastianich
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta
                Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             quarts  salted water
  1              pound  medium-size shrimp - (abt 30)
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1                     bottled hot cherry pepper -- seeded, chopped
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  spaghetti
  18                    fresh basil leaves -- washed, dried,
                        and quartered
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh Italian parsley leaves
  4                     fresh mint leaves -- washed, dried,
                        and minced

Bring the salted water to a boil.  Meanwhile, peel the shrimp.  With a small knife, make a shallow cut down the back of each shrimp to remove the dark vein.  Cut the shrimp crosswise in half.

In a large skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil over medium heat.  Stir in the garlic and shallots and cook, stirring, until the shallots are translucent, about 4 minutes.  Add the cherry pepper and shrimp, taking care not to crowd the shrimp, or they will steam in their own juices.  (If necessary, cook the shrimp in two batches.)  Cook, stirring, until the shrimp are bright pink, about 2 minutes.  Add the wine and season with salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil and boil for 1 minute.  Remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon and set aside.

Stir the spaghetti into the boiling water.  Cover the pot and reheat to boiling, stirring once or twice.  When the water returns to a boil, uncover the pot.  Cook the pasta, stirring occasionally, until al dente -- tender but firm -- about 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, the basil, parsley, mint, and 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking liquid to the sauce.  Bring to a vigorous boil and continue to boil until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.  Reduce the heat to a simmer.  Return the shrimp to the pan until heated through, just a few seconds.

Drain the spaghetti and return it to the pot over low heat.  Pour three quarts of the sauce over the spaghetti and toss over low heat, mixing well.

Transfer the pasta to a warm serving platter or individual bowls.  Spoon the remaining sauce over the pasta and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This sauce is so quick to prepare that it can be put together by the time the pasta is cooked.  Although it's quick, it is intensely flavored.  Hot cherry peppers can be found in the Italian section of supermarkets or in specialty food stores.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     flank steak - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
                        === MARINADE ===
  2              large  egg whites
     1/2           cup  reduced-sodium soy sauce
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  12            pieces  dried orange peel
                        = (available at Asian markets)
                        === FOR COOKING ===
  1              pound  broccoli
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded
  1                     green bell pepper -- seeded
  1 1/4           cups  defatted low-sodium chicken broth
  5        tablespoons  rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes - (to 1/2) -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3                     scallions -- minced
  1             medium  garlic clove -- minced
  2          teaspoons  grated gingerroot
  2        tablespoons  water
  1                can  bamboo shoots - (8 oz) -- drained
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil
  6               cups  cooked white rice
                        Chopped cilantro -- for garnish

Freeze flank steak for easier slicing, until almost firm, 1 to 2 hours.  Cut flank steak across grain into thin strips using a sharp slicing knife.

For the marinade, beat egg whites in a large bowl until frothy.  Stir in soy sauce, cornstarch, and wine until smooth.  Stir in orange peel; add sliced flank steak; mix well to coat.  Marinate 10 minutes.

Lightly peel broccoli stalks; slice into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Separate florets into bite-sized pieces.  Put broccoli into a large pot of boiling water; cook 2 minutes.  Drain well.

Cut peppers into bite-sized pieces.  Mix chicken broth, wine, sugar, and red pepper in a small bowl.  Dissolve cornstarch in water in a separate small bowl.

Heat a well-seasoned wok or large skillet until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon oil; heat to very hot.  Add half of the scallions, garlic, and ginger; stir-fry 30 seconds.  Add half of the drained steak and orange peel.  Stir-fry over high heat until no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from wok with a slotted spoon.  Repeat using 1 more tablespoon oil and the remaining scallions, garlic, ginger, and steak.  Remove from wok.

Add peppers and 2 tablespoons water to the wok; cook, stirring over high heat until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.  Stir in broccoli and bamboo shoots; cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Return beef to wok.  Stir in broth mixture; heat to a simmer.  Stir in dissolved cornstarch; cook, stirring, until thickened.  Stir in sesame oil.  Serve over rice; garnish with cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Scaling down restaurant recipes for home kitchens without losing the essential character of a dish is always tricky.  This one, adapted from one served at the former Austin Koo's Restaurant in Chicago's Loop, tenderizes chewy flank steak by slicing it ultrathin.  Freezing the beef slightly beforehand eases the cutting.

        Standing Rib Roast With Jerusalem Artichokes And Potatoes

Recipe By     :Marie Simmons
Serving Size  : 14    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  dried rosemary
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  2                     garlic cloves -- lightly crushed
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt -- plus
                        additional salt to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  ground pepper -- plus
                        additional pepper to taste
  1                     three-rib standing rib roast - -- (abt 8 1/2 lbs)
  10                    Yukon Gold potatoes - (to 12) -- peeled, halved
                        = (or other yellow-fleshed potatoes)
  1              pound  shallots - (abt 24) -- peeled, left whole
  2             pounds  Jerusalem artichokes -- unpeeled
  1                cup  full-bodied red wine
                        = (such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot)
  1                cup  beet broth

In a small bowl, stir together the rosemary, thyme, garlic, 1 teaspoon coarse salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Place the rib roast, rib-side down, in a large roasting pan.  Rub half of the herb mixture on the top and sides of the roast.  Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 475 degrees.

Roast for 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and, using a spoon or bulb baster, transfer most of the rendered fat to a measuring pitcher; set aside.  Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to roast for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, toss together the potatoes, shallots, and about 1/4 cup of the reserved fat.  (Discard the remaining fat.)  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

When the meat has roasted for 50 minutes, arrange the potatoes and shallots around it in the pan and continue to roast for 30 minutes.  Add the Jerusalem artichokes, and sprinkle all the vegetables with the remaining herb mixture.  Continue to roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast away from the bone registers 125 to 130 degrees for medium-rare and the vegetables are tender, 30 to 45 minutes longer.

Transfer the roast to a warmed platter.  Cover with aluminum foil and let stand for 20 minutes.  Transfer the vegetables to a dish and keep warm.

Pour the pan juices into a cup and spoon off most of the fat.  Return the juices to the pan, along with the wine and broth.  Place over medium-high heat, bring to a boil, and deglaze the pan, stirring to dislodge any browned bits from the pan bottom.  Continue to cook until reduced by one-half, about 15 minutes.  Pour through a sieve into a small pitcher.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Carve the meat across the grain into slices.  Pour the juices over the meat.  Pass the vegetables at the table.

This recipe yields 12 to 14 servings.

Per Serving:  950 calories;  47g protein;  70g total fat  (29g saturated fat);  31g carbohydrates;  2g dietary fiber;  174mg cholesterol;  311mg sodium.

Comments:  A standing rib roast is one of the most celebratory of all holiday dishes.  Here, vegetables are roasted alongside in the same pan.  Use a heavy, good-quality roasting pan so that the meat juices will not burn on the pan bottom.

Comments:  A standing rib roast is one of the most celebratory of all holiday dishes.  Here, vegetables are roasted alongside in the same pan.  Use a heavy, good-quality roasting pan so that the meat juices will not burn on the pan bottom.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  boneless skinless chicken breast -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/4" strips
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  snow peas -- stems removed
                        Lemon Sauce -- (listed below)
  3        tablespoons  peanut or vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  1             medium  onion - (to large) -- halved from root to
                        stem end, each half quartered
  1            package  sliced white mushrooms - (8 oz)
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  2        tablespoons  water or chicken broth
                        Steamed rice -- for serving
                        === LEMON SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  lemon zest

Toss chicken pieces with soy sauce and sherry in a small bowl; set aside.

Meanwhile, bring 1 quart water to a boil over high heat in a wok, if using, or in a large saucepan, if you plan to use a skillet.  When water comes to a boil, add salt and snow peas, return to a boil, and simmer until bright green but crunchy, 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain and rinse under cold running water to stop the cooking process; set aside.

Prepare the Lemon Sauce:  Mix sauce ingredients in a small bowl.  Set aside until ready to stir-fry.

Heat wok or large skillet over high heat until it just starts to smoke.  Add 1 tablespoon oil, then half of chicken; stir-fry until seared and just cooked through.  Spoon cooked chicken into a serving dish, add 1 tablespoon oil to cooking vessel, and repeat with remaining chicken, transferring second batch to serving dish.

Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil, garlic, ginger, and onion and stir-fly until crisp, but starting to soften, about 30 seconds.  Add mushrooms and stir-fly until they lose their raw color, about 30 seconds more.  Add snow peas and stir-fry until all vegetables are tender-crisp and hot, about 1 minute.

Return chicken to cooking vessel, then add Lemon Sauce and stir-fry to coat.  Add cornstarch mixture and stir-fry until juices are saucy and glossy, If too thick, stir in 1 tablespoon water or broth.  Serve immediately with steamed rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

           Tiny Black Lentils With Fresh Fennel And Red Peppers

Recipe By     :Ashley Miller
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  tiny black lentils -- rinsed
  3               cups  water
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground fennel seed
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  diced fresh fennel
     3/4           cup  diced red bell peppers
     1/3           cup  diced mild red or white onions
                        Chopped fresh fennel leaves -- for garnish

In a 3-quart saucepan, combine the lentils and water.  Bring to a boil and then lower the heat to a gentle simmer.  Cook about 20 minutes, until tender but not mushy.

While the lentils are cooking, in a small bowl, combine the oil, lemon juice, vinegar, fennel seed, mustard, salt, and pepper.

Drain the lentils and pour them into a serving bowl.  While the lentils are hot, pour the oil mixture over them and stir well to coat evenly.  When the lentils have cooled, mix in the fennel, peppers, and onions.  Garnish with the fennel leaves.  Serve at room temperature or serve warm by reheating briefly.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  These tiny lentils are sometimes labeled French indigo or French green lentils.  Whatever their name, they are characterized by their size, which is half that of ordinary green or brown lentils, and their dark color.  They have a rich flavor, and because of their small size, they cook in less time than their larger relatives.  In this dish, the warm lentils are marinated, and the fresh fennel and red bell peppers are added when the lentils have cooled.

                 Tiny Red Roasted Potatoes With Rosemary

Recipe By     :Marion Cunningham
Serving Size  : 20    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  tiny red potatoes, 1" dia - (abt 60) -- unpeeled
  4        tablespoons  fresh rosemary leaves
                        = (or 2 tbspns crumbled dried rosemary)
                        Rosemary branches -- for garnish
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Rinse the potatoes in a colander and allow to dry, or pat dry with paper towels.

If using fresh rosemary, remove the needlelike leaves from the fresh rosemary branches, and chop them very fine.

Put the potatoes in a roasting pan and add the olive oil, salt, and chopped rosemary or crumbled dried rosemary.  Using your hands, roll the potatoes in the olive oil, salt, and rosemary so they are all well coated, and spread them out in a single layer.

Bake for 30 minutes.  Check to see if the potatoes are done; when a fork easily pierces the center of a potato, they are ready.  If not, bake 5 or 10 minutes longer and test again.

Serve warm or at room temperature on a platter, surrounded by fresh rosemary branches,  if you have them.

This recipe yields 16 to 20 appetizers.

Comments:  This is a terrific small treat to pass at parties with drinks, or to serve with a roast chicken or roast pork for dinner.  As a party food, it is easy for guests standing up to eat them without spilling  The potatoes also make good picnic fare.  If you make them ahead and refrigerate them, bring them up to room temperature before serving.

Kosher salt is a coarse-grain salt.  It is favored by many cooks who like the coarseness and the taste better than the finer-grained table salt.  On these potatoes, it adds a little crunch, which is pleasing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Chinese dried mushrooms
  6              large  Napa cabbage leaves - (abt 12 oz)
  1            package  Chinese fresh egg noodles - (16 oz)
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  thin soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced ginger
  1                cup  julienne carrots
  2                     scallions -- finely shredded
  1         tablespoon  oyster-flavored sauce

In a medium bowl, soak the mushrooms in 1/4 cup cold water for 30 minutes, or until softened.  Drain and squeeze dry, reserving soaking liquid.  Cut off and discard stems and thinly slice the caps.

Wash the cabbage leaves in several changes of cold water and allow to thoroughly drain in a colander until dry to the touch.  Trim 1/4 inch from the stem end of the cabbage leaves and discard.  Stack 2 to 3 cabbage leaves at a time and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide shreds.

In a 4-quart saucepan, bring about 2 quarts water to a boll over high heat.  Add noodles, return to a rolling boil, and boil 2 to 3 minutes.  Rinse under cold water and drain the noodles thoroughly.  Transfer to a medium bowl, add sesame oil and 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and mix well.  Set aside.

Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and ginger, and stir-fry 20 seconds.  Add the carrots, scallions, and mushrooms, and stir-fry 1 minute, or until the vegetables are just limp.  Transfer the vegetables to a plate.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and cabbage, and stir-fry 1 minute, or until cabbage begins to wilt.  Add the cooked carrot mixture, noodles, and reserved mushroom soaking liquid, and stir-fry 2 to 3 minutes, or until noodles are heated through.  Swirl in the remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce and oyster sauce and toss to combine.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 multicourse meal servings.

Comments:  Vegetable Lo Mein is one of the easiest dishes for a beginner to make.  The mastery comes in correctly slicing the vegetables and not overcooking the noodles.  You will find a variety of fresh egg noodles in the refrigerator section of most Chinese food markets.  The best noodles for lo mein are about 1/4 inch thick, and come either uncooked or precooked.  Either noodle can be used and will require one to three minutes of boiling; follow package directions.  Do not use wonton noodles.

                   Winter Stir-Fry With Root Vegetables

Recipe By     :Jeffrey Alford & Naomi Duguid
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  boneless sirloin steak or other lean beef
                        = (or 2 small rectangles Japanese fried
                        tofu [abura-age]*)
     2/3         pound  burdock or carrots -- or a combination
  1         tablespoon  vinegar or fresh lemon juice
                        = (or lime juice if using burdock)
  1         tablespoon  roasted sesame oil
                        = (2 tbspns if using tofu)
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  mirin
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper powder
     1/2      teaspoon  dry-roasted sesame seeds

* Note:  Japanese-style fried tofu comes in firm golden-brown rectangles and is called abura-age or age dofu.  It is sold in Japanese or Korean shops.

If using meat, thinly slice it across the grain, then cut the slices lengthwise in half to make narrow strips.  If using tofu, cut it into very thin strips.  Cut the burdock and/or carrots lengthwise into narrow strips.  (It's easiest to cut them into 4-inch lengths first and then cut into very skinny julienne.)  Immediately place the burdock in about 2 cups water with the vinegar or lime or lemon juice and let stand for 10 minutes, to prevent discoloration.

Heat a large heavy skillet or a wok over medium-high heat.  Add the sesame oil, allow to heat for 20 seconds, and then add the vegetable strips and stir-fry for 2 minutes (1 minute if using only carrots).  Add the meat and stir-fry for 1 minute, then lower the heat to medium, cover, and let cook for 3 minutes longer, or until the vegetables are tender.  Alternatively, if using fried tofu, cook the vegetables for 5 minutes, add the tofu, and cook 1 minute more.

In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce and mirin.  Pour over the stir-fry, stir to coat, and let simmer for less than a minute, then turn out onto a plate and mound.  Sprinkle over the red pepper and/or sesame seeds, if you wish.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Gobo is a great fall and winter vegetable.  It's called burdock in English, and it's available in health food stores that carry produce as well as in Japanese and Korean shops.  Traditionally this country dish was made of burdock, or burdock and carrots, together with thinly cut fried tofit (abura-age or age-dofu), all sprinkled lightly with sesame seeds.  Nowadays many Japanese substitute beef for the tofu, cut into slivers just like the winter vegetables it's cooked with.  Instructions for both the beef and the meatless versions are set out here.

                Yellow Bell Or Sweet Banana Pepper Botanas

Recipe By     :Barbara Ciletti
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    sweet banana peppers
                        = (or 6 very small yellow bell peppers)
  1                     container ricotta cheese - (24 oz) -- thoroughly drained
  2              large  garlic cloves -- crushed
     1/4           cup  crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
  1           teaspoon  crushed tabasco chile
                        = (or 1 tspn red pepper flakes)
  1         tablespoon  orange juice
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped toasted pecans -- for garnish

Wash and split the pepper lengthwise.  Remove all seeds and veins.  Set aside.

Blend the ricotta, garlic, Gorgonzola, tabasco chile, and orange juice in a medium bowl with a fork or whisk.  Season with salt.

Fill the pepper halves with the cheese mixture and garnish with the toasted pecans.  Serve cold.  (Note: This recipe can be made up to 8 hours prior to serving.)

This recipe yields 12 to 24 botanas.

Comments:  In Mexico, botana means appetizer.  The combination of flavors in this yellow pepper version offers a more mellow sweetness than other recipes calling for a mixture of peppers and cheese.  The unique complement of flavors blends well with a platter of chilled marinated shrimp.  Add grilled vegetables, and you have dinner for guests.

  2               cups  walnut halves
