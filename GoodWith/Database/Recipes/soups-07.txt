                             Apple-Brie Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter - (to 3 tbspns)
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     celery stalks with leaves -- chopped
  2                     apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
  2        tablespoons  flour
  3               cups  chicken stock
  8             ounces  brie -- rind removed, and
                        cubed - preferably at room temperature
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Apple peel strips in thin curls
                        Toasted sliced almonds

Melt butter in a large saucepan, stir in the onions, celery, and apple and saute on low heat until soft and golden, about 10 minutes.  Stir in flour and cook on low heat for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly.  Pour in 1 cup of stock, whisking hard until thick and bubbly.  Whisk in remaining stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.  Puree, solids first, and return to saucepan. 
When ready to serve, reheat on low heat, then stir in the cheese cubes.  Let the cheese melt slowly, stirring occasionally.  When the cheese is all melted, whisk hard.  You can puree briefly if the consistency is not completely smooth.  Stir in the heavy cream.  Ladle into bowls and garnish each with apple peel curls and a few toasted almonds. 
Serve hot to four people as a first course.  It's a terrific start to a meal of roast chicken. 
Comments:  This delicate soup recreates in liquid form the wonderful hors d'oeurvre of brie cheese served with apple slices -- and the riper the cheese when you add it, the deeper the flavor of the soup, counterpointed by the sweetness of the apples.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  brown rice -- cooked according
                        to package directions
  5               cups  chicken or vegetable stock
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
     1/2                onion -- chopped
  1                     carrot -- grated
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  fresh asparagus -- sliced 1/2" rounds
                        Chopped scallions -- for garnish

Cook the brown rice in advance.  Combine the stock, cooked rice, celery, onion, carrot, soy sauce, Tabasco, and white pepper in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.  Add the asparagus and cook 15 more minutes. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and sprinkle with chopped scallions. 
Serve hot to 4 people for a filling lunch. 
Comments:  This piquant, chunky, and low-calorie soup looks festive and is nicely filling as a lunch, served with bread and followed by a piece of fruit.  The recipe was contributed by a Floridian I know only as Roz, but who has been a great supporter of this site as well as a brainstormer on soup techniques.  Roz thinks the recipe orginally came from an article about Oprah Winfrey, but she suggests blending the soup for a finer texture.  Thanks, Roz!

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  potatoes
     1/2           cup  butter
  6               cups  milk
                        Concentrated chicken base or bouillon
                        cubes - (enough that would make 2 cups
                        of stock) - that will go straight into
                        the hot milk without diluting
  4                     green onions -- finely chopped,
                        separating the white and the green
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  grated Cheddar cheese - (to 1 cup)
  6             slices  bacon -- fried crisp
     1/2           cup  sour cream -- well stirred

Bake well-scrubbed potatoes in a 400 degree oven until fork tender.  Don't wrap in foil -- and no microwaving, please, as you want a dry environment for the potato and its skin. 
Fry the bacon until very crisp, then drain and reserve until ready to serve the soup.  Grate the cheese, mince the green onion, and stir the sour cream -- keeping them all separate and on hand, just as you would if you were about to go whole hog on a baked potato. 
Heat the milk and butter in a medium saucepan, stirring in the concentrated chicken base or bouillon until dissolved.  Stir in the salt and pepper and simmer over low heat. 
When the potatoes are done, cut in half lengthwise, scoop out the meat, and put the potato shells back into the oven to crisp.  Stir the potato meat into the hot milk mixture -- mashing it as you go.  Then stir in the white part of the green onion and let simmer. 
When ready to serve the soup, heat to a low simmer and stir in the grated cheese.  While it's melting, finely chop the crisp potato peels and stir them in.  Then stir in the bacon and ladle into individual bowls.  Put a dollop of sour cream on top of each serving, give it a swirl, then sprinkle each with a good handful of green onion bits.  Serve immediately. 
Serve hot as a meal to 4 to 6, maybe a salad on the side to cut all the richness. 
Comments:  This hearty soup, specially requested by a reader, is plenty fattening -- but obviously very satisfying and substantial.  It's great for leftover baked potatoes -- in fact, it's practically worth creating those leftover potatoes just to make it.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2             pounds  meaty oxtails
  1                     onion -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4      teaspoon  thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8               cups  water
     1/2           cup  barley
  1                     carrot -- cut paper thin
                        rounds
  1                cup  watercress -- chopped

In a Dutch oven, saute the bones, onion, and garlic on high heat in the sesame oil, until the onions are very brown.  Add the water, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours. 
When the meat is very tender, remove the bones from the broth.  Shred the meat, chop the marrow, then return both to the pot, discarding the bones. 
Add the barley, return to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, until it is very tender. 
When ready to serve, toss in the sliced carrots and chopped watercress and cook on medium heat for 4 to 6 minutes.  The watercress should turn dark, but not olive colored. 
Comments:  Thick and substantial -- one bowl will fill you up for a whole day.  Serve hot to 4 people.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  lean ground beef

  2             pounds  potatoes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  1                     celery root -- peeled, chopped
  1 1/2           cups  chopped celery with leaves
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced
  1                cup  whipping cream
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  prepared horseradish -- squeezed dry
                        (or 1 tspn fine-grated fresh horseradish
                        root)
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped parsley -- for garnish

Put the stock, celery root, celery, onion, and garlic in a medium saucepan, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about an hour.  Remove from heat, then puree the solids in a food processor or blender -- then mix in the stock until smooth.  Return to the saucepan with the cream and salt, then heat through. 
When you're ready to serve it, stir in the horseradish, vinegar, and pepper.  Ladle it into bowls and garnish with parsley. 
If you're serving it as a meal in itself, serve with crusty black bread, strong cheese, and a salad of greens. 
Comments:  It's a hearty first course for a winter meal -- or a meal in itself; serve it hot to 4 to 6 people in front of a blazing fire.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  celery with leaves -- chopped
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  6               cups  light vegetable or chicken stock
  1                     potato -- peeled, grated
  1            handful  parsley -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  whipping cream

Saute celery and onion in 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat, until they take on a little color.  Stir in the stock and bring to a boil.  Grate in the potato, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. 
When ready to puree, throw in the parsley, stir for a minute, then puree in a blender or processor.  Season to taste with salt and white pepper, with more salt if you're going to serve it cold.  Stir in the whipping cream. 
If you're serving the soup hot, ladle it into bowls and top with a celery leaf.  If cold, chill -- then ladle into bowls and top with a little finely chopped celery and leaves -- to give it a little crunch. 
Serve hot or cold to 4 to 6 people as a first course. 
Comments:  Intensely and thickly celery, for you rabbits out there; earthy when hot for winter meals -- but clean and refreshingly cold for the dog days.

                        Chanterelle Hazelnut Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whipping cream
  1 1/2         pounds  chanterelles (good luck!)
                        or other mushrooms, preferably wild
  1                cup  hazelnuts -- toasted, husked,
                        and chopped
  5              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     onion -- chopped
  3               cups  chicken or dark vegetable stock
  1         tablespoon  brandy
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Snipped fresh chives
                        Reserved hazel nuts

Toast the hazelnuts in a 300 degree oven for about 15 minutes.  Husk them, then chop, reserving 6 to 12 for garnish. 
Combine with cream, chopped mushrooms, garlic, and onion in a large saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring, until the liquid is well reduced -- about 15 to 20 minutes.  Puree. 
Bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan, then stir the puree into it.  Season with salt and pepper, then stir in the brandy.  Press the soup hard through a sieve, discarding the solids. 
When ready to serve, heat the soup through, ladle into bowls, then top with the reserved hazel nuts and chives. 
Comments:  A horrible pain to make, but sinfully good; a hot soup, it serves 6 people as a rich first course.

                           Cheddar Cheese Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  chicken or vegetable stock
  2        tablespoons  butter
  4                     green onions -- finely chopped
  1                     celery stalk with leaves -- finely chopped
  2               cups  milk
  2               cups  grated Cheddar cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  2                     green onions -- minced

Whisk the flour into the chicken stock and set aside. 
In a large saucepan, melt the butter, then saute the celery and green onions until soft, about 3 minutes.  Pour in the milk and heat it with the vegetables.  Then pour in the floured stock and whisk until slightly thickened.  Sprinkle in the cheese and stir until it is melted.  Reduce heat to very low, cover, and let simmer for about 10 minutes. 
When ready to serve, whisk the soup well, ladle into bowls and top with the minced green onion. 
Serve hot to 4 people.  It's also rich enough to make a nice lunch with rye bread and a little salad. 
Comments:  Here's a charming and savory soup that's wonderful to start a festive dinner.  Attributed to Iceland, it's smooth and rich with nice bites of flavor and color from the finely chopped celery and scallion -- and very fast and easy to make. 
I recommend using white cheddar, extra sharp, instead of the cheddars dyed orange -- it's much more appetizing and sets off the garnish nicely.

                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- for garnish

* Note:  You can often find pesto in the stores now -- and just freeze it to use as you need it for a wonderfully fresh basil flavor. 
Brown the beef in a large heavy kettle, draining off any fat.  Add all the remaining ingredients except the cabbage, green beans, macaroni, and pesto.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. 
Add the cabbage, green beans, and macaroni.  Bring to a boil, then reduce and simmer until the vegetables are tender -- about 20 minutes. 
When ready to serve, stir in the pesto (or basil), then serve up with a big ladle and point your friends to the bowl of Parmesan as a topping. 
Serve hot to 12 people. 
Comments:  Ritchie Wallace, in Maine, sent this recipe in -- an Italianate beef-vegetable soup, credited to Bonnie Vawter (a pastor's wife) in Missouri, that she found years ago in a magazine.  It's rich and substantial, perfect for an evening meal or a pot luck.  Ritchie -- who lives in the woods of Maine with husband Tim, their great dane Gisburn, and two cats, Hillery and Tawanda -- testifies that it helps "stave off the winter cold"...which got down to 19 below about the time she wrote.

                      Cold Cruel Hearts Of Palm Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2                onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped celery and leaves
  3               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  1                can  hearts of palm - (14 oz) -- chopped,
                        reserving one heart
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1                     avocado
  4                     paper-thin slices of lemon

Melt the butter in a medium saucepan at low heat.  Add celery and onion and cook until the onion is translucent.  Add the stock and the chopped hearts of palm.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and cook over low heat for 30 to 40 minutes. 
Puree the soup, solids first, then press through a sieve -- extracting as much pulp as possible from the solids.  Stir in the cream and the last heart of palm, chopped fine.  Chill until very cold. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls (packed in ice, if possible), and garnish each with one lemon slice and thin slices of avocado. 
Comments:  Wildly decadent -- and so delicate.  Serve cold to 4 people and see if they can identify the key ingredient.

                          Crazy Pepper Soup Duet

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RED SOUP ===
  2                     red peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        seeded, cored, and chopped
  6                     canned tomatoes -- with juice
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1              pinch  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
                        === YELLOW SOUP ===
  3                     yellow peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        seeded, cored, and chopped
  1              small  potato -- cubed
  2               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
     1/2      teaspoon  saffron -- heated in metal
                        spoon over the burner until it's brittle
     1/3      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
                        Milk -- to thin

For the red soup:  Combine red peppers with tomatoes and juice in a medium saucepan.  Add garlic, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. 
Puree until very smooth, return to pan, stir in lemon juice, and keep warm until ready to serve.  (Alternately, chill until very cold in the refrigerator until ready to serve.) 
For the yellow soup:  Combine peppers, potato, stock, crushed saffron, salt, and pepper in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes -- until the potatoes are tender. 
Puree until very smooth, mix in cream, then add milk until the soup is approximately the same consistency as the red soup.  Return to the pan and keep warm until ready to serve.  (Contrariwise, refrigerate until very cold.) 
The Duet:  When ready to serve, adjust seasoning of both soups, depending on how it tastes hot or cold.  Then, in a flat soup bowl, simultaneously pour the soups from different containers on opposite sides of it (about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of each), until they meet in the middle.  Then, with a sharp knife point, slice the red soup a few times into the yellow soup, to make an abstract design that pleases you.  Garnish with a single cilantro or parsley sprig. 
This recipe yields ?? servings. 
Comments:  This is composed of two separate soups, each of which can be served by itself.  The duet of the two soups can be served either hot or cold, depending on the season and the menu.  Together, they make a spectacular presentation -- and set off the most unusual palate explosions.

               Creamy Artichoke Soup With Lemony Mushrooms

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  artichoke bottoms - (13 oz)
  1                     potato -- quartered
  1                     onion -- quartered
  4               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  whipping cream
                        === GARNISH ===
  4                     mushrooms - (to 6) -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice

Bring stock to a boil in a large saucepan -- then add artichokes, potato, onion, and seasonings.  Reduce heat, partially cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.  Puree the soup then press through a sieve, discarding solids. 
Meanwhile, saute mushrooms over high heat in a little butter and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, stirring often.  Cook until dark around the edges and concentrated -- the liquid will have totally evaporated. 
When ready to serve, reheat the puree, stir in the cream, and bring to a simmer.  Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with mushrooms.  This soup can also be served cold. 
Comments:  It's a lovely and interesting first course, hot or cold, and goes well with chops and chicken or strong seafood.  Serve fairly generous portions to 4 people.  The soup looks lovely in flat soup plates, garnished with those savory mushrooms.

                        (more if you're using fresh thyme)
     1/2           cup  tart red cherries -- pitted, drained

Melt the butter in a large saucepan.  Stir in the flour, salt, and cayenne pepper and continue stirring into a roux.  Pour in the stock and whisk until it boils and is slightly thickened.  Stir in the walnuts and bay leaf and simmer, partly covered, for 15 minutes.  Add the cream, sour cream, and rub the thyme into the pot.  Simmer 2 minutes. 
When ready to serve, remove the bay leaf and add the cherries.  Let heat through for a minute or so, then ladle into bowls and serve immediately. 
Serve hot to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  You want unusual?  This is unusual.  Also delicious, light, and beautiful to see in flat soup plates.  An excellent first course to a meal of game, duck, or lamb shanks.

                          Creamy Pistachio Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  bacon -- cut 1/4" pieces
     1/2           cup  chopped celery -- leaves included
  1              small  onion -- minced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                     bay leaf
     3/4           cup  dry sherry
  6               cups  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  rice
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     3/4           cup  shelled pistachio nuts
                        (preferably not dyed red)
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  minced parsley -- for garnish

Saute bacon in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until crisp.  Remove the pieces and drain.  Add the celery, onion, and garlic to the pan, reduce heat, and saute until the onion is translucent -- about 5 minutes.  Spoon the vegetables out onto paper towels and blot away the bacon grease. 
Wipe out the saucepan, then return the vegetables to it, along with the bacon, bay leaf, and sherry.  Bring to a simmer and allow to reduce until all the sherry has evaporated.  Stir in the chicken stock and the rice.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, when the rice is very soft. 
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a small skillet, add the pistachios, and toss until they are lightly browned -- perhaps 2 or so minutes.  Drain on paper towels. 
When the rice is soft, discard the bay leaf and puree the pistachios and soup in a blender, solids first.  When smooth, return to saucepan.  Stir in the cream and reheat.  Season to taste. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and garnish with minced parsley. 
Serve hot as a first course to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  Very rich and very, very good.  This unusual soup is an elegant way to begin a special meal -- certainly will tease the palates of your guests and have them guessing.  An interesting combination of delicate and hearty.  Be sure to check with any local mideastern or Greek markets to see if they sell shelled pistachios -- makes life much easier!

  24                    bay scallops
                        (or 12 sea scallops, halved)
                        Salt -- to taste

  2                     fresh or frozen artichoke hearts -- tender and diced
                        (or 4 canned artichoke bottoms)
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  cognac
  2               cups  fish stock
  2               cups  whipping cream

Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add the onion and saute for about 3 minutes.  Add scallops, diced artichokes, and wine.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove from heat, and strain liquid into another pot.  Sprinkle solids with cognac and set aside. 
Add fish stock to the cooking liquid, then boil until the liquid is reduced to about 1/2 cup.  This will take about 30 minutes.  Stir in the cream and return to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for about one minute.  Pour through a fine sieve into the scallop mixture, then warm until the soup is heated through.  Season to taste and serve small portions immediately. 
Comments:  So rich and delicate -- this first course, served hot in small portions to 4 people, will have them shouting for more.

           Creamy Scallop Soup With Mushroom-Asparagus Duxelles

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2                     shallots -- minced
     1/2         pound  mushrooms - (one reserved) -- minced
  8                     asparagus spears - (tips reserved) -- minced
  2        tablespoons  flour
  4               cups  milk
                        Concentrated fish (or scallop) base -- which would
                        dilute to 4 cups
     1/2         pound  ocean scallops -- cut into
                        mouth-sized pieces
                        Reserved mushroom -- cut 8 thin slices
                        Reserved asparagus tips
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
                        Paprika -- for garnish

In a saucepan, melt butter, add minced shallots, mushrooms, and asparagus, and saute on low heat for 10 minutes, stirring from time to time.  When flavors are concentrated, stir in the flour and cook for a minute or two, then slowly whisk in the milk.  When the soup heats and begins to thicken, whisk in the fish or seafood stockbase and let simmer for a minute or two. 
Add the scallops, asparagus tips, and mushroom slices and simmer for 3 minutes.  Pour in the heavy cream, reheat, and simmer for a few more minutes. 
When ready to serve, pour in the wine, then ladle the soup into soup bowls, evenly dividing the scallops, mushroom slices, and asparagus tips.  Garnish with a pinch of fresh paprika over each bowl and serve immediately. 
Comments:  Not as complicated as it sounds, this meal for 4 is quick to make, rich and satisfying, yet delicate and elegant.  Serve hot to 4 people as a meal the next time you find big fat ocean scallops on sale.  It really is a treat.

In a saucepan, melt butter, add minced shallots, mushrooms, and asparagus, and saute on low heat for 10 minutes, stirring from time to time.  When flavors are concentrated, stir in the flour and cook for a minute or two, then slowly whisk in the milk.  When the soup heats and begins to thicken, whisk in the fish or seafood stockbase and let simmer for a minute or two.

Add the scallops, asparagus tips, and mushroom slices and simmer for 3 minutes.  Pour in the heavy cream, reheat, and simmer for a few more minutes.

When ready to serve, pour in the wine, then ladle the soup into soup bowls, evenly dividing the scallops, mushroom slices, and asparagus tips.  Garnish with a pinch of fresh paprika over each bowl and serve immediately.

Comments:  Not as complicated as it sounds, this meal for 4 is quick to make, rich and satisfying, yet delicate and elegant.  Serve hot to 4 people as a meal the next time you find big fat ocean scallops on sale.  It really is a treat.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and juiced
     1/2                onion -- juiced
     1/2                green pepper -- juiced
  3        tablespoons  frozen concentrated white grape juice
  2               cups  buttermilk
  2               cups  milk
  2                     cucumbers -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely diced
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Green onions -- finely sliced
                        on the diagonal

To juice the apples, onion, and green pepper, put them (onions and peppers first) into your blender, then whirl while pouring in the concentrate from the grape juice, then little bits of the milk.  The point is to liquify the solids with as little liquid as possible to get a fine blend. 
When your satisfied with the blending, pour in the rest of the milk and buttermilk and blend well.  Pour out into a container and stir in the diced cucumbers, minced parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.  Let chill in the refrigerator. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and top each with some sliced green onions. 
Serve cold to 6 to 8 people as a first course. 
Comments:  William Bohannon of Memphis, Tennessee, contributed this crisp and refreshing soup -- and in immense quantities.  His recipe makes 4 gallons.  I've cut it way down and adapted it a bit, but will include his original recipe as well in the event you have the occasion to provide this summer soup for a family reunion...or any large crowd event.  It's a fascinating blend of sweet fruit, savory vegetables, and tart buttermilk -- perfect for the dog days of summer.  William is a chef at Jim's Place, and he recommends stirring in "lobster or crab meat pieces for an extra treat." 
When You're Serving A Crowd! 
15 cucumbers, peeled, seeded, diced
24 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, juiced
11.5 oz can frozen white grape juice concentrate
1 large white onion, chopped
4 large green bell peppers, seeded and chopped
1 gallon sour cream
1 gallon buttermilk
1/4 cup fresh minced parsley
Water as necessary to desired consistency
Salt, to taste
Freshly-ground white pepper, to taste  
Mix all ingredients and keep cold.  Serve as a cold soup.  Yield about 4 gallons.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     green onions -- sliced
                        (reserving 4 tspns of green for garnish)
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  2               cups  vegetable or chicken stock -- heated
  2               cups  milk
     3/4           cup  chopped mushrooms
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  2                     egg yolks

Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Add the green onions and saute until wilted -- about 5 to 7 minutes.  Increase heat to medium, add flour and curry powder, and stir for about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat -- and whisk in the hot stock and milk.  Add mushrooms, salt, and pepper.  Cover partially and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Comments:  This is rich but delicate -- excellent with red meat or roast chicken on a cold night; serve hot to 4 people.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  asparagus
  6               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2    tablespoons  flour
  2                     egg yolks

                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Cut off asparagus tips and reserve.  Snap off woody ends of the asparagus and dice the remaining spears.  Put the dice in a saucepan with the stock, bring to a boil, and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes.  Cool for a minute.  Puree solids first, then with the stock.  Set aside. 
Melt the butter over a low heat in a large saucepan, stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add asparagus tips, simmer for 5 minutes, then remove from heat. 
Bring the pureed soup to a simmer.  Mix the egg yolks, curry, and cream in a small bowl, then whisk into the soup and heat through.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  When ready to serve, ladle into bowls, top with asparagus tips, and serve immediately. 
Comments:  It's an elegant first course; good hot or cold, but especially hot served with lamb to 4 to 6 people.

                          Fat Man's Potato Soup

Recipe By     :Daniel Sanger
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  whole milk
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        chicken or vegetable soup base or
                        bouillion cubes to make 2 cups liquid
                        (hold, to dilute in the milk)
  3              large  white potatoes - (to 4)
  1                big  leek - (to 2) -- chopped fine
  1              stick  butter
  1                cup  grated Muenster cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped chives or green onion
                        Crumbled crisp fried bacon -- (optional)

In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and cream, then stir in the stock base or bouillon until it dissolves.  Peel potatoes and grate directly into the milk.  Keep the temperature of the broth low, as it will boil over easily.  Stir in the leek, whisking to incorporate and thicken. 
Once the mixture is nicely thickened, stir in the butter.  Then, with the temperature still low, add the cheese, stirring until it melts.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Ladle into bowls, top with chives or green onion and/or crisp bacon bits, and serve immediately. 
Comments:  Oh groan.  This incredibly rich and decadent soup was created by Daniel Sanger of Gaithersburg, Maryland, who counsels, "NOTE: call cardiologist and enjoy!"  It is delicious, served hot to 4 as a filling meal, but oh my.

                  Fresh And Creamy Broccoli-Cheese Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  broccoli -- florets cut off
                        and reserved, stems lightly peeled and
                        chopped, woody end discarded
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1                     celery stalk with leaves -- chopped
     1/2                hot pepper - (to 1)
                        (jalapeÒo, cherry, or serrano)
  4               cups  vegetable (or chicken) stock
  1                     potato -- peeled, diced
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley - (to 1/2 cup)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  1                     brick of Cheddar cheese -- for grating

In a large saucepan, saute the onion, broccoli stems, celery, and hot pepper in the olive oil over low heat -- sweating them until the onion is transparent.  Pour in the stock and bring to a boil.  Stir in potato and parsley, then reduce heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.  Puree, solids first, in a blender -- then return to the pot. 
When you're 5 or so minutes away from serving, bring the pureed soup to a boil, stir in the reserved florets, and cook on medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes.  Return the soup and florets to the blender and lightly pulse until the florets are nicely chunked and distributed throughout. 
Ladle into soup bowls or flat soup plates and grate the cheese in long, thick strips over each serving.  Serve immediately. 
Serve hot to 4 people as a first course -- to 2 people as a satisfying meal. 
Comments:  A light, bright, and incredibly fresh-tasting broccoli soup, thick with melting cheddar cheese.  The secret is in the late addition of the tender florets.

                 Game Duck Soup With Plums And Wild Rice

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  duck
  8               cups  water
  2           teaspoon  salt
  1                     onion -- unpeeled, chopped
  1                     leek -- trimmed, washed
  2                     carrots -- scrubbed, chopped
  2                     celery stalks with leaves -- chopped
  6                     parsley sprigs
  1           teaspoon  thyme
  10                    peppercorns
  4                     whole cloves
     1/4           cup  wild rice -- cooked in
                        salted water for 45 minutes and drained
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- trimmed, quartered
  1              large  onion -- cut in chunks
                        the size of the mushroom quarters
  3                     plums -- peeled, cut in
                        chunks the size of mushroom quarters
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Thinly-sliced green onions -- for garnish

Put the whole duck (liver removed from giblets and used for something else *) in a Dutch oven and cover with the water and salt.  Bring to a boil very slowly, skimming.  When it reaches a boil, reduce the heat and add the leek, onion, celery, parsley, thyme, peppercorns, and cloves.  Keep the stock at a simmer for 2 hours. 
After two hours, remove the duck and let cool until you can handle it.  At that point, strip off the skin and discard.  Remove the meat and reserve.  And return the bones back into the stockpot, to let simmer for another 30 minutes or so. 
Cook the wild rice for about 45 minutes, then strain and reserve. 
Strain the stock through cheesecloth or wet paper towels, cool, then refrigerate overnight.  When you're ready to start the soup, you will remove and reserve all the fabulous duck fat that congeals on the top (saving most of it for other decadent meals). 
To make the soup, melt a tablespoon or two of the duck fat in a large saucepan, then toss in the mushroom quarters and onion chunks to saute over medium heat.  When the onion is transparent, add the duck stock (which should be gelatinous); cooked wild rice; and the duck meat, cut into hearty chunks.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 10 minutes. 
When ready to serve, stir in the plums.  Ladle into bowls and garnish each serving with thinly sliced green onions. 
Serve hot to 4 people with excellent, crusty bread, a salad, and a good light wine. 
(* If you wanted to be just horribly decadent, you could saute the liver with finely chopped onions, salt and pepper it, even flame it in brandy, and puree it -- then cool it to room temperature, whip it into 1/4 to 1/2 cup of butter and serve it with the bread.  Heaven!) 
Comments:  There is no whipping this one up quickly -- but it is really something special in the end, perfect for an elegant luncheon or light supper, followed by a rich dessert.  And it's easy -- just time consuming to make the stock...which you should do the day before.

To make the soup, melt a tablespoon or two of the duck fat in a large saucepan, then toss in the mushroom quarters and onion chunks to saute over medium heat.  When the onion is transparent, add the duck stock (which should be gelatinous); cooked wild rice; and the duck meat, cut into hearty chunks.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 10 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, stir in the plums.  Ladle into bowls and garnish each serving with thinly sliced green onions. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve hot to 4 people with excellent, crusty bread, a salad, and a good light wine. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
(* If you wanted to be just horribly decadent, you could saute the liver with finely chopped onions, salt and pepper it, even flame it in brandy, and puree it -- then cool it to room temperature, whip it into 1/4 to 1/2 cup of butter and serve it with the bread.  Heaven!) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  There is no whipping this one up quickly -- but it is really something special in the end, perfect for an elegant luncheon or light supper, followed by a rich dessert.  And it&apos;s easy -- just time consuming to make the stock...which you should do the day before.

                         Gametable Mushroom Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1                     bay leaf
  3          teaspoons  minced parsley
     1/8      teaspoon  thyme -- crumbled
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2             medium  onions -- minced
  1              pound  dark gilled mushrooms (on the old side) -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  rice (or wild rice)
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Fresh chives or green onions -- in long pieces

Simmer the stock, soy sauce, vinegar, parsley, thyme, and bay leaf in a large saucepan for 30 minutes. 
At the same time, melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat.  Add onions and cook until translucent, stirring occasionally -- about 10 minutes.  Turn up the heat to medium, add mushrooms, and stir them around until their liquid is released.  Add flour and stir for 3 minutes. 
Strain the stock, then slowly stir it into the mushroom mixture.  Season with salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, mix in rice, and simmer for 25 minutes.  Soup can be refrigerated at this point until you're ready to serve. 
When ready to serve, reheat the soup, ladle into bowls, and garnish with chives or green onions. 
Comments:  Tasting intensely of the forest, this hot soup is a substantial first course for 4 to 6 people.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  14              cups  water - (3 1/2 quarts)
  4               cups  quartered potatoes
  1 1/2         pounds  salt pork
                        (can also use bacon or country ham)
  2             pounds  cabbage -- roughly chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- pressed or crushed
  2                     onions -- studded with
  2                     whole cloves -- each
  2                     carrots -- peeled, quartered
  2                     turnips -- peeled, quartered
  2               cups  fresh white beans (lima beans are fine)
  6                     parsley sprigs -- tied with
  1                     bay leaf
  8                     crushed peppercorns (or hot chili pepper)
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  marjoram
     1/2         pound  confit d'oie - (to 1 lb)
                        (ok shoot me--I tried it with store-bought
                        potted meat and it wasn't bad)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Sliced bread -- for garnish

For the garnish:  You can place the sliced bread in a tureen and ladle garbure over it; you can sautÈ it in the skimmed fat and place on top; or you can brown it in the oven with confit and serve separately. 
Bring the water, salt pork, and potatoes to a boil in a large soup pot.  Add the cabbage and all the remaining ingredients except the confit and the salt.  Simmer, partially covered, for 2 hours. 
Discard the parsley bundle and remove the cloves from the onions.  Take out the meat and slice it into serving pieces.  (Traditionally this is served on the side, but can be returned to the pot.)  Stir in the confit.  Salt to taste.  Skim off the fat. 
Serve in a tureen or ladle into soup plates -- accompanying with bread as suggested under the recipe garnish. 
Serve hot as a meal to 8 people with lots of dense country bread. 
Comments:  This classic peasant soup from the BÈarn and Gascon regions of France is well storied -- witness Gautier's opening chapter of Capitaine Fracasse.  Indeed, its very name is controversial -- some say it came from the Spanish garbias, for "stew."  Others from the Basque garbe, for "sheaf" or "bunch," since it's essentially a bunch of vegetables. 
Although Garbure was beneath Escoffier's notice (despite cataloging nearly 3000 French recipes), very fancy recipes for it abound in our rich times.  Even so, I prefer Julia Child's simple recipe, which captures the robustness and goodness of the dish -- and I have adapted it above.  Traditionally it should include a chunk of salt pork, or lard rance -- and it should be finished with a chunk of preserved meat, preferably the BÈarn confit d'oie, or potted goose (salted then simmered for hours in its own fat).  It's not a pretty soup, but it's full of flavors and textures, very satisfying.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     garlic heads -- unpeeled, halved
  3               cups  chicken stock
  3               cups  water
  1                     boned whole chicken breast
  2                     eggs
  1                     garlic clove - (to 2) -- reserved from stock,
                        and julienned
     1/4                lemon - (to 1/2) -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  julienned carrots
     1/2           cup  julienned leeks or green onions
                        Minced parsley

Bring stock and water to a boil.  Add garlic, then reduce heat and gently simmer for 30 minutes.  Cool completely.  Cover and refrigerate overnight. 
Reheat stock to a boil, then remove garlic.  Reserve a couple cloves for the soup; otherwise, use the rest for another part of the meal, if you like -- it's quite mellow at this point. 
Reduce heat to a bare simmer, allow a few minutes for the stock to cool a bit, thin slip in the chicken breast and poach for about 15 minutes.  It should be just opaque.  Remove and shred the chicken finely. 
Beat the eggs in a small bowl, then whisk in 1/4 cup hot stock.  Mix this mixture into the pot of simmering stock and stir for a few minutes to disperse the foam and thicken the soup.  Stir in the chicken and julienned reserved garlic. 
Remove from heat, season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice.  When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and garnish with carrot and leek julienne and with minced parsley. 
Comments:  A pleasant, palate-stimulating first course; serve hot to 6 to 8 people.

Bring stock and water to a boil.  Add garlic, then reduce heat and gently simmer for 30 minutes.  Cool completely.  Cover and refrigerate overnight. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reheat stock to a boil, then remove garlic.  Reserve a couple cloves for the soup; otherwise, use the rest for another part of the meal, if you like -- it&apos;s quite mellow at this point. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reduce heat to a bare simmer, allow a few minutes for the stock to cool a bit, thin slip in the chicken breast and poach for about 15 minutes.  It should be just opaque.  Remove and shred the chicken finely. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat the eggs in a small bowl, then whisk in 1/4 cup hot stock.  Mix this mixture into the pot of simmering stock and stir for a few minutes to disperse the foam and thicken the soup.  Stir in the chicken and julienned reserved garlic.

<DirT>
Remove from heat, season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice.  When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and garnish with carrot and leek julienne and with minced parsley.

Comments:  A pleasant, palate-stimulating first course; serve hot to 6 to 8 people.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  cracked green olives, Mideastern or Greek -- soaked in
                        water for an hour, drained, and chopped
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  4        tablespoons  flour
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
  8               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  dry sherry
                        Minced parsley -- for garnish

In a large saucepan, saute the onions, garlic, and 2/3 of the olives in the olive oil until the onions are transparent.  Puree with 1 cup of stock. 
Heat oil in the saucepan and stir in flour and cayenne, cooking into a roux.  Whisk in remaining stock, then pour in the puree.  Bring to a slow boil, let thicken, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.  Stir in cream, pepper, and remaining chopped olives, bring back to a boil, then simmer 5 more minutes. 
When ready to serve, heat to serving temperature, stir in sherry and cook for a minute, then ladle into bowls.  Garnish with generous pinches of minced parsley. 
Serve hot to 6 to 8 people as a first course. 
Comments:  Unusual and delicious...if you're as mad about the unripe fruit of olive trees as me.  The soup is a spectacular introduction to a Mediterranean meal.

                        Gruyere Soup In A Pumpkin

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  firm-textured white bread
  3             pounds  whole pumpkin -- with skin intact
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  3 1/2           cups  half-and-half cream
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  1                cup  freshly-grated Gruyere cheese

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Cut the bread into pieces about 1/2-inch square.  Put the pieces on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven until golden brown, about 7 minutes. 
Meanwhile, wash and dry the pumpkin.  Using a strong, serrated knife, slice about a fourth of the way down from the top to cut off a cap.  Pull out as many of the fibers and seeds as possible, then scrape out the rest of the fibers with a spoon.  Rub the outside of the pumpkin and cap with the oil. 
In a bowl, beat together 2 1/2 cups of the cream and the salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Place the pumpkin on a large, strong pie pan or baking sheet.  Layer into the pumpkin the bread cubes and cheese, finishing with a layer of cheese.  Fill 3/4 of the space in the pumpkin.  Pour in just enough cream to cover the filling, using the remaining cream if necessary.  Place the cap back on the pumpkin. 
Place the pumpkin in the preheated oven and bake for about 2 hours.  Stir from time to time.  Pumpkin is done when the skin turns a rust-orange and the pulp is tender when pierced with a small, sharp knife. 
At the table remove the pumpkin cap and ladle out the thickened, custard soup and the pumpkin pulp into bowls. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  3               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  1                     tart apple -- cored ,and

Comments:  This soup is a beautiful autumn color, with the sweet sun-ripened flavor of a summer harvest...which in fact, it is.  It was contributed by Don Schonnop, a father of four who says "I like to help in the kitchen with our family, and soups happen to be one of my favorites.  Especially on the cold and wet months."  This recipe, served hot, makes a rich and satisfying lunch for 4 to 6 people, especially with half a sandwich on the side.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1              pound  dark-gilled mushrooms, on the
                        old and dry side -- sliced
  4               cups  beef or dark vegetable stock
     1/3           cup  minced parsley
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
                        (or 4 dried tomatoes, slivered)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
                        === GARNISH ===
  4             slices  caraway rye -- toasted until dry
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Swiss cheese
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Stir in the stock, parsley, tomato paste or slivers, garlic, and pepper.  Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce and add wine.  Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. 
When ready to serve, put one slice of rye toast in each bowl, sprinkle with cheeses, then ladle soup over all.  Top with fresh chopped parsley. 
Comments:  As much a savory as a soup, this can serve as lunch or dinner for 4 people -- with lots of salad, lots more crusty rye bread, and the rest of the wine.

                            Iced Arugula Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     scallions
     1/2         pound  arugula leaves -- well washed,
                        blotted, crisped, and roughly chopped
  3               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Fresh thyme
                        Arugula flower blossoms,
                        or minced arugula leaves

Saute the scallions in the olive oil until translucent.  Stir in the arugula leaves and 1 cup of the stock.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cook, covered, just until the leaves wilt, a minute or two.  Remove from heat and puree in a blender until the mixture is very smooth. 
Heat the remaining stock in the saucepan, then pour in the arugula puree.  Simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, and don't allow to boil.  Remove from heat, stir in the cream, season to taste, then chill until icy cold. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and sprinkle with the chopped thyme and either the minced arugula or the arugula blossoms.  Because of the jewel green color, this soup is especially nice in glass bowls. 
Comments:  Don't be put off if you are generally not a fan of this peppery green.  This cold soup is delicately flavored, refreshing, and addictive -- like a cool beginning to an early summer day.  Serve cold in small portions to 4 people -- or be generous with this jewel green soup to yourself and a good friend.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2         pounds  asparagus -- cut into pieces,
                        and reserving the tips
  2               cups  sliced green onion or leeks
  4               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the asparagus and onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and cook for about 10 minutes. 
Puree, solids first, then press through a sieve, discarding the solids.  Refrigerate for several hours or overnight. 
Meanwhile, cook the asparagus spears in boiling water for no more than 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain well and pat dry. 
When ready to serve, whisk the wine, then the cream into the pureed asparagus.  Season with salt and white pepper.  Ladle into bowls and garnish each serving with the asparagus tips and a few circles of the green onion or leek. 
Comments:  A refreshing first course for 4 to 6 people -- excellent with chicken or fish.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  chopped peeled red beets
  2               cups  water
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable or beef stock
  1           envelope  unflavored gelatin -- dissolved in
     1/3           cup  heated water
  1           teaspoon  red wine vinegar
     1/8      teaspoon  celery seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  dried dill weed -- crushed between
                        palms
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Yogurt
                        Fresh chives or dill sprigs
  4                     lemon slivers

Cook the peeled and chopped beets in the water until tender, then remove and reserve them.  Add the stock, vinegar, celery seeds, and dill to the beet broth, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer on low for 10 minutes.  Strain through coffee filters and return to the saucepan. 
Mix the gelatin mixture into the broth and stir to dissolve completely.  Add beets, cover, and chill until syrupy.  Stir well, cover again, and chill until firm. 
When ready to serve, break up the mixture with a spoon, then ladle into small cups.  Spoon yogurt into each cup, sprinkle with the fresh herb, and spear a lemon sliver into the top. 
Serve cold to 4 as a first course. 
Comments:  Possibly the most refreshing and beautiful summer soup you can find, not to mention lo-cal.  It gleams like a jewel, slides down the throat coldly, and yet is robust and robustly flavored -- very savory before roasted or barbequed meats.

                             Jenny Lind Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  diced rutabaga
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  flour
  1                cup  chicken stock
  4             ounces  GruyËre cheese -- grated
     1/4      teaspoon  sage -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- heated
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg -- separated, with
                        the egg white whipped to stiff peaks -- for garnish

Stew the rutabaga in water until completely soft, then mash completely. 
Melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the flour, and cook into a roux for several minutes.  Whisk in the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. 
Whip the egg whites and set aside. 
When about ready to serve, whisk the cheese, rutabaga, and sage into the soup.  Cook over medium heat for a couple minutes, then remove from heat and stir in the heated cream.  Season to taste. 
Last, whisk in the egg yolk and pour into soup plates, topping with a spoonful of the beaten egg whites. 
Serve hot to 4 people as a first course. 
Comments:  I had to make it to believe it.  Not as bad as I thought, but not exactly the "creamy dreamy" that Bloom rhapsodizes.  In fact, decidedly looking like wall paper paste -- and it's just plain odd to have plain whipped egg white on top, nothwithstanding its roots in French cuisine de famille.  Savory, pleasantly thick, a little goes a long way.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  chicken or vegetable stock
  1              pound  asparagus -- 4 thick tips
                        reserved - (cut them 3" long)
  1                     potato -- cut up
     1/2                lemon -- with 6 delicate
                        curls cut from the rind
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten with
                        a little cream or milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring stock to a boil, add the asparagus stalks, potato, and 2 curls of lemon rind, minced fine -- and cook until tender. 
Puree the soup, then strain.  Reheat, then add the thyme by rubbing it to a powder between your hands.  Beat in the egg yolk and cream and heat until thickened; season to taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  green or red or French lentils
  8               cups  water -- (maybe more)
  2               cups  minced onion
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  2          teaspoons  dry mustard
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1                cup  minced dried apricots
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt - (to 2 tspns)
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar - (to 4 tbspns)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISHES ===
                        Dried apricot slivers
                        A swirl of yogurt
                        A sprig of cilantro or parsley

Rinse and pick over the lentils.  Place the lentils and water in a soup pot or Dutch oven and bring to a boil.  Cover, lower the heat to a simmer and cook for about 15 minutes. 
Add the onion, cumin and mustard, and continue to simmer, covered, until the lentils are very soft (about 15 more minutes).  Add small amounts of additional water, if it seems too thick. 
Add the garlic, apricots and salt, cover and let it simmer for another 15 minutes or so.  Stir in the vinegar, black pepper, and cayenne to taste (and correct the salt, too, if necessary).  At this point the soup will keep for several days. 
Serve hot, topped with a few extra slivers of dried apricot, a swirl of yogurt and a sprig of cilantro or parsley, if desired. 
This recipe yields  6 to 8 servings.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Zest of 2 limes -- finely grated
                        Juice of 2 juicy limes
     1/2                jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, chopped
  2                big  cucumbers -- peeled, chopped
  2               cups  seedless green grapes
  4                     green onions -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
     1/2           cup  chopped green or yellow pepper
     1/4           cup  tequila
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Finely-minced cucumber
                        Chopped green of green onions

Puree everything together but the tequila and the garnish, then press through a sieve. 
Chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.  Then, stir in the tequila, ladle into bowls, and sprinkle each with the cucumber and green onion. 
Comments:  It's cold, it's hot; it's sweet, it's sour; it's laced with tequila and served cold to 4 people.  Surprisingly clear and refreshing...but not for the faint of heart.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     mangoes -- peeled, pitted,
                        and chopped
  2               cups  cantaloupe -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh mint
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  confectioners' sugar
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  plain yogurt
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Mint leaves - (small)
                        Edible flowers if you can get them

Puree all ingredients in a blender and chill for a few hours.  Pour into glass bowls, garnish, and serve. 
If you'd like to serve immediately, have the fruit already chilled in the refrigerator...and pop a couple ice cubes into the blender while pureeing. 
Serve cold to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  Cool, refreshing, yet with complex body and taste, this is a wonderful start to a summer luncheon or dinner.  Also brainless and fast to make, which is always nice.

                  Medieval Soup Tredure - {Golden Soup}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  chicken or vegetable stock
  1                cup  stale bread crumbs of crusty bread
  2                     eggs -- beaten
     1/8      teaspoon  cardamom
  1              pinch  saffron
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice

Bring the stock to a boil, then reduce to low.  Beat together the breadcrumbs, eggs, cardomom, saffron, and salt, then pour into the stock, off the heat, and beat. 
Return to a simmer for a few minutes to thicken.  Stir in lemon juice and ladle into bowls. 
Serve hot to 2. 
Comments:  Just the thing for a pale cheeked Troilus or a striving Piers Plowman -- an excellent strengthener for the sick -- for those girding their loins to do battle in the fields of love...or in quest of spiritual fulfillment.  According to one medieval cookbook, one need only "Take brede and grate it; make a lyre of rawe ayren, and do therto safroun and powdour douce, and lye it vp with gode broth, and make it as a cawdel.  And do therto a lytel verious."  It's good -- and good for you.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  finely-chopped onion
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped carrots
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped celery
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
                        (or 1/4 tspn dried, crushed)
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
  4        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  6               cups  chicken stock -- preferably homemade
  8             ounces  smoked Cheddar cheese -- grated

Serve hot, garnishing each portion with a sprinkling of diced red pepper and zucchini.

"Most of the Disney gang are vegetarians," said Minnie Mouse.  "I'm not quite sure why, but I suspect cartoon carnivores just weren't endearing enough for Mr. Disney." 
More than 20 years after his death, Minnie still speaks of her creator with reverence.  She is what he made her in 70 cartoons -- a bashful 36-inch-tall black mouse who invariably met danger with hysterics, often wore short red skirts with white polka dots and almost always played a supporting role to Mickey or Pluto -- except in the kitchen.  "I've been cooking ever since 'The Picnic' in 1930," she said.  Although she gets great pleasure from preparing meals for Mickey and whatever members of the gang that affable and outgoing mouse has invited along for supper, today Minnie is clearly a Thoroughly Modern Mouse.  "Call me Ms. Mouse," she said with a smile.  Laughing at herself is as much a liberation for Minnie as her flirtation with feminism.  For years the bland girlfriend who stood in one corner of the screen and wrung her white-gloved paws waiting for Mickey to rescue her, Ms. Mouse has stopped waiting.  Did she and Mickey ever get married?  Mr. Disney threw a veil of coyness over the private life of his two stars, but one of Minnie's admirers, the British novelist E.M. Forster, wrote about the romance in 1934: 
"Without him, her character shines not." 
"Que sera, sera," Minnie said mysteriously.  Meanwhile, she takes Spanish lessons, attends aerobics classes and has designed herself a new wardrobe.  Last year she starred in her own television special, "Totally Minnie." 
The shops at Disneyland and Disney World are full of such Totally Minnie sportswear as red-and-black sweatsuits. 
In her cuisine, Minnie has moved beyond such Depression-era specialties as toasted cheese sandwiches, Cheddar puff hors d'oeuvres and cubes of Swiss on crackers.  Now it's cheese with a flair.  She is particularly fond of her unusual smoky cheese soup recipe, because it can be prepared ahead of time, and Ms. Mouse is busy these days. 
She recently served the soup at a dinner party to introduce Roger and Jessica Rabbit to the other stars in Disney's stable of characters.  Before the party, she stopped off at the gym to bench-press 50 pounds and do a half hour on the stationary bicycle. 
Ducks, cows, and rabbits can be finicky guests, and Roger did tend to scoop up the pieces of diced carrots first, but Minnie judged the recipe a success when there was not even a spoonful left for Pluto.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
  1              large  onion
  6             medium  potatoes -- peeled, diced
  2                     carrots -- diced
  3               cups  water
  2        tablespoons  chicken soup base
                        (or 2 chicken boullion cubes)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  milk
  1         tablespoon  dried parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme

In a large stock pot melt the butter add the onions and cook over medium heat until the onions are translucent. 
While the onions are cooking, place the diced potatoes, carrots, water and chicken soup base in another stock pot and bring to a boil.  Cook until tender, about 10 minutes.  Do not over cook.  Season with ground black pepper to taste. 
Add the flour to the cooked onions to make a paste.  Gradually add the milk and stir well.  Cook over low heat stirring constantly until warmed through.  Add the potato and carrot mixture.  Stir in the parsley and thyme and heat through.  Serve hot. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  This soup is closest to the soup I remember as child.  I have seen many renditions of it surface in several bistros.  It is easy and the method can be applied to broccoli or cauliflower.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     leftover turkey frame with some meat
                        still on it
  3             medium  carrots - diced
  2              large  celery stalks - diced
  1                     onion -- quartered
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh dill
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, cracked
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  barley - (to 2 tbspns) -- (optional)
  1                cup  cooked any-shape pasta- (to 2 cups) -- (optional)

Use a large stock pot -- about 12 quarts or so.  Trim turkey of fatty parts and residual stuffing.  Cut turkey into sections and place in the pot.  Fill with water just to cover.  Add vegetables, seasonings, herbs, (barley). 
Bring to a boil, then simmer for 1 to 2 hours. 
Strain broth, return it to the pot and put back vegetables.  You may also add fresh vegetables at this point.  Dice or shred pieces of turkey meat.  Adjust seasonings (add pasta). 
This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings. 
Comments:  Waste not, want not.  Dem ol' bones, wonderful seasoned skin and other bits, make for a terrific turkey vegetable soup.  So, don't throw it out, throw it in a stock pot instead.  Works with chicken leftovers as well.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  beef stock
  1             medium  potato -- grated
  3               cups  chopped parsnips
  1         tablespoon  grated orange rind
                        Juice of 1 fresh orange
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Orange flower water -- (optional)
                        Parsnip curls
                        Orange rind curls

Bring the stock to a boil, then add parsnips and orange rind and simmer until just tender -- about 35 minutes.  Grate in the potato and cook another 10 minutes.  Puree the mixture, then pour in the fresh orange juice, reheat, and season to taste. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls, sprinkle with orange flower water (available at many supermarkets and Mideast groceries), and top each with thin curls of parsnip and orange rind.  A little fresh parsley sprinkled on the sides of the bowl is nice too. 
Comments:  This is great with a roaring fire and a roasting joint of meat -- almost an aperitif for some serious meat eating; serve hot as a first course to 6 to 8 people.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  lean ground beef
  2        tablespoons  vegetable or olive oil
  2               cups  diced carrots
  2               cups  diced onion
  2               cups  diced celery
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3               cups  cooked barley
  8               cups  beef broth
  2               cans  Italian-style stewed tomatoes - (14 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley
                        a splash of balsamic vinegar -- (optional)

In a large pot or Dutch oven, cook beef on medium-high heat until browned, breaking it up with a spatula as it cooks.  Remove beef from pan and add oil.  Add carrots, onion, celery and garlic; cook until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
Add beef and all remaining ingredients, except parsley and vinegar.  Bring to boil on high heat; reduce heat to a simmer and cover.  Simmer 20 minutes. 
Stir in parsley and taste.  Adjust seasoning, adding more salt or pepper if needed, or a splash of balsamic vinegar if soup needs a little more zip. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  Pre-Game Beef and Barley Soup is a crowd-pleasing, robust soup that makes a great tailgate entree served with corn muffins and a salad.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  spaghetti - (8 oz)
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  1              pound  ground beef - (93% lean)
  1              large  onion -- chopped (1 cup)
  1              large  green pepper -- chopped (1 1/2 cups)
  2               cans  tomato sauce - (8 oz ea)
  2          teaspoons  bottled minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  allspice
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste (optional)
  1                can  red kidney beans - (15 oz)
     1/4           cup  shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Bring 2 1/2 quarts unsalted water to a boil in a 4 1/2-quart Dutch oven or soup pot.  Add spaghetti and cook until tender, 7 to 9 minutes. 
Meanwhile, heat oil over high heat just until hot.  Using your fingers, crumble ground beef into the skillet.  Immediately wash your hands with soap and hot water.  Peel and coarsely chop onion, adding it to the skillet as you chop.  Stir meat occasionally. 
Rinse and seed green pepper and cut it into 1/4-inch dice.  Add to skillet.  Cook, stirring frequently, until ground beef is finely crumbled and completely browned, about 2 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium. 
Add tomato sauce, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, cumin, cinnamon, allspice and cloves.  Stir to mix well.  Reduce heat to a simmer and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until pasta is done.  Season with cayenne and salt to taste, if desired. 
Meanwhile, rinse and drain the beans and place them in a microwave-safe bowl.  Cover with a paper towel and microwave 1 minute on high power or until heated through. 
To serve, divide the drained spaghetti among 4 serving bowls.  Top each serving with chili, 1/2 cup kidney beans and 1 tablespoon shredded cheese.  Serve at once.  Serve with sliced cucumbers and deli corn muffins. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                         Red Onion Marmalade Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  5             pounds  red onions -- sliced paper thin
                        as possible to make the marmalade
                        almost syrupy
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
     3/4           cup  red wine
  8               cups  beef stock
  4               cups  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     flavoring bundle -- consisting of
  1                     celery stalk -- plus
  1                     bay leaf -- and also
                        Parsley sprigs -- tied together
                        Finely-minced parsley -- for garnish

In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil, then stir in the onions -- and there are LOTS of them.  SautÈ, stirring frequently, until the onions are completely wilted and turning nicely brown, almost like an onion marmalade.  This takes a long time, some 20 minutes or so, and they will cook down a lot. 
Stir in the vinegar, and cook it down until it is mostly evaporated.  This is key -- you don't want to add the wine until the vinegar is really cooked down.  Stir in the wine, and let cook it down quite a bit. 
Finally, stir in the beef stock and chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Add the celery bundle, salt, and pepper, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes or so, to mix flavors. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and top with very finely minced parsley. 
Serve hot to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  Dark and with the rich taste of a demi-glace, this sweet-sour and intensely onion soup lingers on the tongue like a fine wine.  Its flavor is really too assertive for a first course, but it makes an excellent lunch with half a sandwich, or a dinner with crusty bread, salad, and the rest of that red wine.  Many thanks to "Anon." for sending in this superb recipe.

              Roasted Apple-Garlic Soup With Toasted Walnuts

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              whole  garlic heads -- rubbed in
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  4              small  apples
  4              small  potatoes -- diced finely
  5               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  2                     bay leaves
  12                    peppercorns
                        Fresh thyme sprigs
                        (or 1/4 tspn dried thyme)
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Toasted walnuts
                        Finely-minced green onion

Cut off the tops of the garlic bulbs, about 1/4-inch deep, then rub the bulbs lightly with olive oil.  Seal the garlic bulbs and whole apples in tin foil -- then seal them in another layer as well.  Put on a cooking sheet and bake in a 375 degree oven for 45 minutes, until they are soft. 
While the garlic and apples are roasting, bring the stock to a boil and toss in a bouquet garni of thyme, peppercorns, and bay (if you don't have modern technologies, just seal these ingredients in tin foil and poke little holes in the foil before tossing in).  Reduce heat and simmer. 
When the garlic and apples are done, unseal and let cool for a few minutes.  Squeeze the garlic out of their clove packages and discard the skin.  Mince the paste finely, in all directions, then add to the simmering broth.  Do the same with the apples, discarding the core and skin. 
Toss in the finely diced potatoes, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, until the potatoes are soft and the soup well flavored.  Remove and discard the bouquet garni.  Stir in the cream.  Season with salt and pepper.  Let simmer for 5 minutes. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and sprinkle with the mixture of minced green onions and toasted walnuts. 
Serve hot to 6 to 8 people as a first course -- to 4 as a meal with accompaniments. 
Comments:  Talk about a conversation piece -- this rich tasting, complex, many-layered soup is a powerful, strangely sweet start to a meal.  Serve it before roast meat or chicken -- or serve giant servings with lots of bread and salad as a vegetarian meal.  It's pretty easy to make.

                Roasted Corn Chowder With Chipotle Pepper

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     corn ears in their husks
  1                     red bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             medium  sweet onions -- diced
  6                     garlic cloves -- diced
  6               cups  homogenized milk
  1 1/2           cups  cilantro leaves -- finely chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground chipotle pepper - (to 1/2 tspn)

Pull off most of the corn husks, leaving one or two layers intact on the cob. 
Roast corn over a hot grill, turning one quarter rotation every 3 minutes or so, until the husk has blackened and the kernels have begun to brown (aka caramelize).  While you are at it, roast the bell pepper in the same manner until all of the skin has blackened. 
Remove corn from the grill and let cool.  Husk corn, then use a sharp knife to cut kernels from the cob into a large bowl. 
In a saute pan over medium-high heat, saute garlic and onions for approximately 20 minutes, until golden brown. 
Skin and seed the bell pepper, then dice it finely. 
In a food processor, puree half the corn and all of the onions and garlic. 
In a soup pot, combine the pureed mixture, remaining corn, cilantro leaves, bell pepper, milk, salt, pepper and chipotle pepper.  Simmer (do not let it boil) over medium heat for 15 minutes. 
This recipe yields ?? servings. 
Comments:  The more caramelized the corn is, the richer the soup will taste. 
Add some cooked lobster meat or crab meat, just before serving, and call it dinner. 
Ground chipotle chili pepper is a Southwest specialty made from smoked jalapeno peppers.  Its smoky flavor adds another dimension to the chowder.  If you can't track it down in a specialty store, you may substitute cayenne pepper. 
If you don't have the patience to roast the corn, just cut the kernels from the husk, then saute in some butter over medium-high heat until they start to brown.  If you go this way, dice the bell pepper up and saute it with the corn.

     1/2           cup  yellow stone-ground cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  milk -- room temperature
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature

Remove silks from corn, peeling back husks slightly.  Replace husks discarding silks.  Soak in water for 15 minutes; drain.  Cook unhusked corn on grill until husk is black and corn is cooked, about 20 minutes.  Remove husk carefully; cut kernels off cob, reserving cob and kernels. 
Heat oil in medium soup pot.  Add onion, carrot and celery; cook 5 minutes without browning vegetables.  Break corn cobs in half; add to vegetables with thyme, sage, jalapeÒo pepper, salt and black pepper.  Cook 2 minutes.  Add enough water to completely cover vegetables.  Simmer 1 hour on low heat. 
Remove and discard corn cobs.  Add reserved corn kernels; simmer 30 minutes.  Puree mixture in batches in blender until smooth.  Ladle soup into warm bowls.  Garnish with Corn Stick Croutons and red and yellow peppers. 
*Note: Handle hot peppers with care. Avoid touching face and hands. Wash hands with hot soapy water when finished. 
Corn Stick Croutons:  In medium mixing bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt.  Add milk and eggs; mix until smooth.  Bake in well-greased cast-iron corn stick pans at 350 degrees 30 to 35 minutes.  Remove from pans; cut in 1/2 lengthwise.  Place on greased cookie sheets.  Bake 350 degrees 10 minutes or until dry.  Serve with soup.  (Makes 7 corn sticks) 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                       Sassy Nectarine Summer Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fruit                           Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh ripe nectarines -- cut up
                        (abt 6 of them - don't bother peeling)
  1                cup  orange juice
     1/2           cup  dry white wine (vermouth is good)
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
     1/2    tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro
                        === GARNISH ===
  1                     cilantro leaf per serving

Puree the nectarines in a blender with the orange juice, wine, Tabasco, and balsamic vinegar.  Taste for seasoning.  Add cilantro and pulse a few times to chop into a nice texture.  Chill until ready to serve. 
When ready to serve, pour into small bowls -- nested glass bowls with shaved ice would be nice -- top each with a cilantro leaf, and serve. 
Serve small portions cold to 4 people as a first course. 
Comments:  This cold soup is ultimately refreshing -- sweet-tart with a kick, clean but with complex layers of taste.  It's awfully good with a summer barbeque with chicken, potato salad, and corn on the cob.  And did I mention how easy it is to make?

                             Sauerkraut Soup

Recipe By     :Stan Laskos
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  sauerkraut -- drained
  1              pound  pork ribs - (to 2 lbs)
  1              quart  tomatoes -- cut up with juice
                        (a large 28-oz can is fine)
  1             medium  onion -- sliced
  1                     garlic clove - (to 3) -- minced
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- (optional)
                        Water, to your preferred thick/thin
                        consistency - (abt 8 cups)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Paprika -- to taste

Combine all ingredients in a large pot, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer 2 to 3 hours, until the meat readily falls off the bones. 
Pick out the bones, correct seasoning, and serve.  This is excellent with homemade bread.  It is also really good with boiled potatoes on the side. 
Serve hot as a meal to 6 people. 
Comments:  Stan Laskos from Diamond, Ohio, sent this recipe in -- and it's a honey, especially for those of us with fond childhood memories of grandmothers bubbling up sauerkraut on the stove.  Stan tells the story of his Polish grandmother who "in the winter, once in a great while, would make the sauerkraut soup, and never that I remember for large family gatherings.  She would call up...we lived about 1/10 mile away...and I would have the 'fun' job of walking to her house on the snowy country road to carry back a quart of that sauerkraut soup for my parents.  I was probably 9 or 10 years old about then.  I could not stand that sauerkraut soup."  But times and tastes change.  Some 20 years ago, Stan noticed a soup recipe on the back of a package of sauerkraut -- and ultimately adapted it to the one here, which he will make for his family (his kids love it...even ask for it) on a cold winter day. ..."but not too often"!

                     Sedona White Corn Tortilla Soup

Recipe By     :California Pizza Kitchen
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2                 seven-inch corn tortillas -- cut in 1" pieces
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  minced white onions
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced jalapeÒo chili pepper
  16            ounces  white corn kernels
  1 1/2         pounds  tomato -- chopped
     1/3           cup  tomato paste
  2 1/2      teaspoons  cumin
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
  1              quart  chicken stock

Over medium high heat, fry the tortilla squares in olive oil until they begin to crisp and turn a golden yellow.  Add garlic, onion, and jalapeÒo, cook 1 to 2 minutes, until onion is translucent. 
Add half the corn, and the rest of the other ingredients (tomatoes thru chicken stock), reserving half the corn to be added at the end.  Bring the soup to a low, even boil.  Remove soup from heat. 
Use a hand held propeller blade processor, or a food processor, or a blender to puree the soup in batches.  Return the soup to the burner and add the reserved corn.  Bring the soup to a boil once again, being extremely careful to avoid scorching or burning. 
Serve, if desired garnish with tortilla chips, cheddar cheese, and cilantro. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  This is a great Southwestern soup from the California Pizza Kitchen chain.  The restaurant serves it solo or alongside a potato-leek soup.  The many spices keep this soup low in calories, but high on flavor.  If you want to reduce the fat content, you can use less oil for frying the tortillas.

  1           teaspoon  chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  sugar -- (optional)
  4             quarts  cold water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large soup pot, brown the chicken, apples and vegetables in butter over high heat.  Add the flour, curry powder, cloves, mace, parsley and sugar if desired.  Cover with the cold water and stir to blend.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook slowly, covered, until chicken is tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. 
Remove the chicken from the bones and cut the meat into small pieces.  Strain soup and rub vegetables through a sieve.  Add cut-up chicken to strained soup.  Season with salt and pepper, and serve hot with boiled rice. 
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings. 
Comments:  "The New Settlement Cookbook," edited by Charles Pierce and published by Simon & Schuster, is the source for this recipe.  The soup's name comes from the Tamil people of southern India and means "pepper water".

                                Solid Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz)
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1                can  beef consomme - (10 1/2 oz) -- with gelatin added
                        === GARNISH ===
  6        thin slices  stuffed green olives
  6                     tiny parsley sprigs

Blend together the cream cheese, HALF the can of consomme, the curry powder, and the lemon juice.  To get this right, I ended up whipping them together with electric beaters, then pouring that mess into the blender to really emulsify the cream. 
Pour into 6 demitasse cups about 2/3 full.  Refrigerate until set.  This takes longer than you think it should -- and even then the white cream burbles up when you go to pour on the top layer.  I stuck the cups in the freezer for 30 minutes even after the soup had set to prevent ruining the whole presentation. 
Pour the remaining consomme onto the top of each of the 6 cups -- and don't pour it on directly.  Get a spoon that nearly covers the entire cup area, turn it over, and gently pour the consomme over the back of the spoon.  Put back in the refrigerator and chill until firm. 
When ready to serve, decorate each solid soup with a thin slice of stuffed olive and a tiny sprig of parsley.  Put the cups on saucers and serve with a linen napkin and demitasse spoon. 
Comments:  A favorite of socialite Marylou Vanderbilt Whitney, it sounds like it should be easy to make and awful to eat.  In fact, it's the reverse.  Very tasty above and beyond the eyebrow-lifting presentation...but pretty tricky to get right.  Serve cold, obviously, to 6 just as you're ready to signal the end of the cocktail hour, but before sweeping them into the dining room.  The whole point, I think, is a sophisticated conceit: instead of moving into the drawing room after dinner to take demitasse coffee, you begin in the drawing room with what LOOKS like demitasse coffee as a prelude to the dinner.

                        Parmesan cheese
                        Sour cream

Brown the vermicelli (broken into short lengths) in butter over medium heat, stirring constantly -- careful, it browns fast.  Remove pasta, add onion, green pepper, and garlic.  Cook until onion is soft.  Add vermicelli, cumin, and beef bouillon.  Cover and cook over low heat until liquid is absorbed.  Stir in tomato. 
Serve topped with sour cream and Parmesan cheese. 
This recipe yields ?? servings. 
Comments:  Mexican meals are often served with a sopa seca or dry soup.  It is soup in name only, because the broth is almost entirely cooked away.  It can be made with pasta, rice or even pieces of tortilla which have been cooked briefly in hot oil or butter, then added to the liquid.  If meats and/or vegetables are added, a sopa seca can become a delicious main course.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  fish stock
     1/4                lemon wedge
  1              piece  hot chili pepper - (abt 1")
                        (your choice, depending on how
                        hot you like it)
  2                     garlic cloves
  2                     bay leaves
  4                     jumbo shrimp
                        Cornstarch -- for dredging
  3             ounces  cellphane noodles (mung bean thread) -- broad size
                        === GARNISH PER BOWL ===
                        Two long pieces of chives
                        One paper-thin round slice of chili pepper
                        One tiny strip of lemon zest
                        One paper-thin slice of fresh mushroom

Heat the fish stock with the lemon, pepper, garlic, and bay leaves.  Let simmer for 30 minutes, partially covered, then take off the burner and let cool in the pan until you are ready to assemble the soup. 
Prepare shrimp flowers:  Shell and devein the shrimp, leaving the tail attached.  Wash and pat dry.  Slit the back of each shrimp further, opening and pressing it flat.  Cut a little lengthwise slit right in the middle of the opened shrimp and bend the tail up through the slit, fanning the tail to make a flower. 
Salt the shrimp lightly, then dredge in a little cornstarch.  Let them sit for a minute and hold their shape while you're bringing lightly salted water to a boil. 
When the water is at a gentle boil, pop the shrimp in and let them boil for 2 minutes.  Remove, drain on paper towels, and reserve. 
Prepare the noodles:  Bring water to a boil, drop in the noodles, and let boil for 5 minutes.  Drain immediately, rinse with cold water, let drain again and reserve. 
Assembling the soup:  When you're ready to serve the soup, remove all solids from the stock pot and bring the flavored broth to a boil.  Cut the cellophane noodles into the broth in edible-size lengths (they're slippery). 
Get out your best bowls (on the deep side) and ladle the broth and noodles into the bowls.  Plunge a shrimp flower into each one, then arrange the garnish next to it -- a thin slice of mushroom, a round of red chili pepper, a thin strip of lemon zest and a few lengths of fresh chives. 
Serve hot as a tangy first course to 4. 
Comments:  This piquant, highly designed soup drew inspiration from 6 exquisite soup bowls -- a Christmas gift -- and from the artist who made them, my sister Diane.  In my case, since I have these gorgeous bowls, a single shrimp flower floats in a sea of clear noodles, nestled against a seagreen background -- with red earth, incised with white, on the rim and underside.  Your background color will depend on the color of your bowls.  It looks like more trouble than it is -- but I think it's worth the trouble regardless.

Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  5               cans  tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz ea) -- chopped, with
                        their juice - (or 5 lbs fresh tomatoes)
     1/2           cup  shallots
  2        tablespoons  minced lemongrass
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  honey
  3               cups  chicken or vegetable stock
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  lime juice
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
  2        tablespoons  chopped mint
  2          teaspoons  grated lime peel
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  aquavit or vodka
                        Thinly-sliced arugula or minced parsley -- for garnish

Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-low heat.  Add the tomatoes and juice with the shallots, lemongrass, ginger, and garlic.  Cook until the liquid evaporates, about 12 minutes.  Stir in the honey and simmer until the mixture is very thick, stirring frequently, about 8 minutes.  Add the chicken stock and the next 5 ingredients.  Simmer for 30 minutes. 
Work the soup through the food mill (or press through a sieve), discarding the solids.  Season with salt and pepper, then chill at least 8 hours.  Stir in the lemon juice and aquavit. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and top with either the sliced arugula or a strong pinch of finely minced parsley. 
Serve cold to 6 to 8 people as a first course to stimulate appetites when the dog days have got you down. 
Comments:  My friend Judy Irons sent me this recipe, and the first time I made it, I swore would be the last.  Good, but way too labor intensive.  "Huh!"  Judy said, "I didn't think it was so bad."  Plus, it was one of her favorite soups.  So, when she recently was laid up for a short time, I thought about it again...thought about how "easy" it was for her...finally remembered about my old Foley food mill collecting dust in the basement. 
Judy was right -- it's not so bad to make...if you have a food mill -- and it's delicious.  Very very light in consistency (as in, you could even drink it), but very complex and layered in taste.  I recommend you try it for some hot summer night...at least once!

When ready to serve, add more orange juice, if you like, to achieve your preferred consistency.  Stir in the balsamic vinegar, then ladle into small bowls.  Swirl a spoonful of yogurt into each portion as a garnish. 
Serve in small portions to 6 to 8 people. 
Comments:  This is a strongly flavored, sweet-tart appetizer soup -- redolent of warm harvests and autumn weather, a perfect start to a meal of roast pork or duck and roasted vegetables.  The yogurt stirred in at the end creates a wonderful contrast of color and flavor.  This soup is excellent piping hot -- and also chilled.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  strawberries
  1                cup  sugar
  6        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-grated orange zest
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-grated lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  Grand Marnier (or orange juice)
  6               cups  plain yogurt
                        === GARNISH ===
  20                    halved strawberries -- tossed with
     1/2           cup  sugar -- and also
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar

Allow the garnish ingredients to macerate for at least 2 hours at room temperature or in the fridge. 
Puree the strawberries with the sugar, vinegar, zests, and Grand Marnier.  Make sure the sugar has completely dissolved -- and let it sit for a few minutes if it hasn't. 
Whip the yogurt in a bowl, then stir in the puree until smooth.  Chill well, at least two hours. 
When ready to serve, ladle the soup into flat bowls and top with the macerated strawberries.  Drizzle a few teaspoonsful of the strawberry syrup over each bowl in a dashing pattern. 
Serve cold in flat bowls to 6 to 8 as a tantalizing first course. 
Comments:  This marvelous cold fruit soup was contributed by Lisa Gitelson.  She says it best: "give it a try on a hot summer's night, don't tell your guests what's in it, and they will fall in love."  No-fat and low-fat yogurt work beautifully.

                        Suddenly Sweet Potato Soup

Recipe By     :Zach Williams
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  1                     serrano chile pepper (or jalapeÒo) -- more or less,
                        to taste, sliced thinly
  6               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  3              large  sweet potatoes -- peeled, chopped
                        Thyme, ideally fresh branches of it
                        but dried is fine so long as you crush it
                        between your palms adding it to the pot
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Sausage -- (optional)
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  1               thin  curls lemon zest curls -- for garnish

In a large saucepan, sautÈ the onion until golden.  Toss in the sliced hot pepper, then pour in the stock and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Add the sweet potatoes and thyme, reboil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
When the potatoes are cooked, puree -- solids first -- then pour back into the saucepan and season with salt and pepper to taste. 
Hot only:  If you would like a hearty, meat soup, separately sautÈ fresh mild sausage or sautÈ thin rounds of a hard garlicky sausage until crisp. 
When ready to serve, stir in the lemon juice then ladle the soup -- either piping hot or chilled -- into bowls.  Spoon in sausage, if applicable.  Top with lemon curls. 
Serve this hot to 6 to 8 people as a terrific start to a Caribbean or Mexican meal, good both hot and cold. 
Comments:  This soup was born of pure inspiration.  Zach Williams -- musician, chef (self-appointed), and submarine sailor -- got hungry late one night and created it out of refrigerator contents.  It's a doozie; light and smooth with a little bite and lots of savory layers -- with vegetarian and carnivorous options.  Zach lives in Virginia with his lovely wife and daring taste-tester Christina.  Many thanks to him.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  sugar snap peas
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  grated peeled fresh ginger
  1                     Golden Delicious apple -- peeled, chopped
  1              large  red potato -(4 oz) -- peeled, chopped
  4               cups  water
  1                can  vegetable broth - (14 1/2 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  fresh parsley leaves
     1/4           cup  plain lowfat yogurt -- (optional)

String peas and set aside. 
In large pot, melt butter over medium heat.  Add onion and ginger; saute 3 minutes. 
Add reserved peas, the apple, potato, water, broth, and salt; heat to boiling over high heat.  Reduce heat to simmer and cook until vegetables are very tender -- about 30 minutes.  Stir in parsley and set aside to cool at least 10 minutes. 
In blender, in several batches, puree soup mixture.  Strain puree through fine mesh strainer. 
To serve, reheat soup and divide among 4 serving bowls.  If desired, garnish each soup with swirls of yogurt piped from a pastry bag (or use a resealable plastic bag and snip one corner with scissors to create a small hole). 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  fresh tomatoes -- peeled, cut up
                        into a cup of water
                        (or two 28-oz cans peeled tomatoes)
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     fresh basil leaves
     1/2                onion -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        === GARNISH ===
  2                     fresh ripe tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into bite-sized strips
  1                cup  fresh basil leaves -- minced

Cut the tomatoes up in a saucepan with 1 cup of water if using fresh tomatoes, or their juice, if using canned.  Stir in the oregano, fresh basil, about 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and onion; bring to a boil; then reduce heat to medium-high and cook, stirring, for about 25 minutes.  Make sure the tomatoes don't burn on the bottom. 
Puree, then return mixture to pan and stir in 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and more pepper to taste.  Let cool. 
When ready to serve, stir in the cream, the minced basil leaves, and fold in the tomato chunks.  Taste for seasoning.  Ladle into bowls.  If you are going to serve hot, heat just to a simmer and ladle into bowls. 
Comments:  Creamy, chunky, intense and sweet -- tastes like it's straight out of a hot summer garden.  Serve hot or cold in small portions to 4 people.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fully-cooked smoked sausage
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  flour
  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  2             medium  green bell peppers -- chopped
  1                cup  chopped celery
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground red pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano leaves
  5 1/2           cups  chicken broth
  1                     bay leaf
  1              pound  peeled medium shrimp
  6               cups  hot cooked rice

Cook sausage (cut into 1/4-inch slices) in large heavy saucepan over medium-high heat 4 to 5 minutes or until brown.  Remove sausage; set aside.  Drain fat. 
Combine oil and flour in 2-cup glass measure.  Microwave on HIGH 6 to 9 minutes; stirring after 5 minutes with small wire whisk.  Continue to cook at 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval until roux is dark red-brown. 
Pour roux into heavy saucepan; add onions, green peppers, celery, garlic, salt, black pepper, red pepper, thyme and oregano.  Cook, stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, or until vegetables are tender.  Add broth and bay leaf; bring to a boil.  Add reserved sausage; reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes. 
For those watching their fat intake, prepare gumbo and cool.  The fat will rise to the top and may be skimmed off with a spoon. 
Reheat, if necessary.  Add shrimp, simmer 10 minutes.  Remove bay leaf.  Spoon gumbo into serving bowls; top each with 1/2 cup rice. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  This is one of those recipes that taste even better the next day.  If you really want to impress your guests, serve your gumbo in hollowed out bread bowls.  Saves clean-up time too!

                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2    tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley

* Note:  These most commonly are packaged in 10-ounce or 6.5-ounce cans at the supermarket. 
Cook bacon with butter or margarine on medium heat.  When bacon is halfway done, add garlic.  Cook for 2 minutes.  Add chopped onion and celery.  Cook until onions are tender, then add flour.  Cook, stirring, until it begins to turn golden, then add chicken stock and clams, with their juice, and simmer. 
Add potatoes and thyme.  When potatoes are done, add heavy cream, salt, pepper to taste, and parsley.  If you prefer a thicker chowder, stir cornstarch into heavy cream, then slowly add to chowder. 
This recipe yields 15 servings. 
Comments:  Based in San Diego, the Shiloh is one of the most sophisticated anti-aircraft cruisers in the Pacific Fleet.  These days, however, the ship is defending more than its military reputation. 
Twelve decks high with an all-male crew of 400 sailors and 28 officers, the Shiloh holds the title for dishing up the best chow among mid-sized naval ships.  Not only did sailors serve lunch to visiting Chinese admirals in July, they won the 1997 Edward F. Ney Award for the most impressive food service. 
Named for World War II's head supply officer, the Ney Award is the Oscar of sailor food, the Emmy of the cramped galley.  This recipe was introduced to the Shiloh crew by Mess Management Specialist Ron Royales.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  tomatoes - (15 oz) -- chopped, with juice
  2               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  2               cups  chopped fennel -- reserving lacy tops
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     bay leaf
  1              pinch  hot red pepper flakes
     1/8      teaspoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Anisette or pernod
                        Fennel fronds

Mix tomatoes and juice, stock, chopped fennel, wine, onion, garlic, salt, bay leaf, red pepper flakes, and sugar in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 45 minutes.  Add tomato paste and boil hard for a few minutes to concentrate flavors.  Puree, then press through a sieve, discarding solids. 
This soup can be served either hot or cold.  If you're serving it hot, reheat, ladle into bowls, then stir in 1/2 teaspoon of anisette or pernod into each bowl and top with a lacy fennel frond. 
If you're serving the soup cold, season a little more highly, then chill thoroughly in the refrigerator.  When ready to serve, stir in 1/2 teaspoon of anisette or pernod into each bowl and top with a lacy fennel frond.  You might also chop some raw fennel into a fine dice and sprinkle into each serving, to give some crunch to it. 
Comments:  A smooth, heady first course with a whiff of licorice; serve hot or cold to 6 people.

  2                     onions -- quartered
  4             ounces  fresh ginger root -- peeled, chopped
  2             pounds  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped, with their juice
     1/2           cup  butter
  1                cup  vegetable or chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste

  2                     egg yolks
                        Chives in long pieces -- for garnish

Puree or crush onion and ginger.  Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat and add onion puree.  Cook for 4 minutes, blending flavors and stirring frequently. 
Puree tomatoes and add to the saucepan.  Stir in the stock, sugar, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil.  Stirring occasionally, cook over medium heat for about 30 minutes.  Taste for seasoning, adding salt, pepper, and/or sugar as desired. 
Beat the egg yolks in a small bowl and lighten with 1 cup of the soup.  Stir this mixture into the soup and stir until the soup thickens -- about 2 minutes.  Do not bring to a boil. 
Strain through a sieve, rewarm, and serve -- garnished with a few long pieces of chives. 
Comments:  Pow!  Smooth, strong, and elegant -- not your garden variety soup; serve heated to 4 to 6 people as a first course.

                        Velvet Mushroom Stroganov

Recipe By     :Christopher Bruinslot
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              pound  mushrooms -- thickly sliced
                        (use your favorite kind)
     1/2         large  onion -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped fine
     1/4           cup  cream sherry
  4               cups  water
  1              whole  carrot -- scrubbed, unpeeled
  1                     celery stalk
                        (or the leafy center is best)
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  sour cream or sour cream/milk combination
                        Chives pieces -- for garnish

SautÈ the mushrooms, garlic, and onions in oil over high heat until the mushrooms are browned but not soft.  Add sherry and reduce.  Add water to cover the mushrooms.  Add carrot and celery, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. 
Strain the stock, reserving the broth.  Discard the carrot and celery. 
In a separate sauce pan, melt the butter and slowly stir in the flour to make a roux.  Brown the roux lightly.  Add the reserved broth in small increments until it is all incorporated.  Add 1 cup of sour cream.  Bring up to a simmer.  Depending on what consistency you would like, add another cup of sour cream or a combination of milk and sour cream. 
Five minutes before you are ready to serve, add the mushrooms and season to taste.  Simmer for a few minutes, then ladle into bowls.  Top each with chives. 
Serve hot to 4 to 5 people as a substantial first course. 
Comments:  This all-vegetable soup is earthy, rich, and pure velvet -- like you've just stepped out of a Russian birch forest in autumn.  The recipe was contributed by Christopher Bruinslot of Garden Grove, California -- about to become a first-time dad with wife Andie in November...and assigned kitchen duty for the interim.  He's been cooking up a storm of soup, pasta sauce, and chili and freezing them for weekday meals.  He says, "this simple soup is meat free and full of flavor."  He's right.  Also great for lunch with a sandwich.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     Granny Smith apples (or other tart apple) -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
  1              bunch  watercress
  4               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  tarragon
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried tarragon, crumbled)
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        A spoonful of heavy cream dribbled
                        through each serving

Saute the onion and apple in the butter until soft.  Stir in the watercress, stock, and tarragon.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes.  Puree in a blender, solids first.  Season with salt and pepper, then mix in cream. 
If serving cold, chill for at least 3 hours -- and remember to slightly overseason with salt. 
If serving hot, return to saucepan to reheat -- then ladle into bowls when ready to serve. 
Garnish with cream by dribbling a spoonful across the top of each bowl in a design of your choice. 
Serve hot or cold to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  Delicate and unusual as a cold soup -- appetite-stimulant to a fresh autumn meal (roast pork or chicken!) as a hot soup -- this contribution from my good friend Judy Irons (and her friend Nan) is an excellent first course in any season.

  1                     parsnip -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2             pounds  pumpkin - (to 3 lbs) -- peeled, chopped
                        (or winter squash or even sweet potato)
  1                can  tomatoes - (15 oz) -- juice reserved
  4               cups  vegetable or beef stock
     1/4      teaspoon  sage
                        Minced parsley or celery leaves -- for garnish

In a large saucepan, slowly saute the onion, garlic, turnip, parsnip, and pumpkin pieces in the olive oil over medium-low heat -- for about 10 minutes, so the vegetables are golden roasted and concentrated. 
Cut in the tomatoes, turn the heat to medium-high, and cook down for about 10 more minutes, stirring from time to time.  Add the reserved tomato juice and stock, bring to a boil, then turn to a simmer.  Stir in sage and simmer for 15 minutes. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and sprinkle each with minced parsley or celery leaves. 
Comments:  Full of root vegetables and creamy squashes cooked down to goodness, this rich and healthy soup can be served as a course to 4 to 6 people as a prelude to a simple, warming meal.
