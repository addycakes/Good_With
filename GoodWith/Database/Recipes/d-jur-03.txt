--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     baking apples, such as Cortland or Rome
     1/2           cup  raisins
  2               cups  apple cider or juice
  1                cup  water
     1/2                lemon
                        === STUFFING ===
     1/2           cup  whole-wheat pastry flour
     1/2           cup  rolled oats
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  succanat, (type of sugar available in

Serve with the Almond Cream.

                         Baker's Memory Potatoes

Recipe By     :Michel Richard
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Potatoes                        Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ONION FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  2              small  onions - (abt 3/4 lb) -- peeled, diced fine
  1         tablespoon  fresh minced thyme
                        (or 1 tspn dried thyme, crumbled)
  1         tablespoon  Champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === POTATOES ===
  1 1/4         pounds  russet potatoes - (abt 5 med) -- peeled
  2             ounces  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the Onion Filling, place a heavy medium saucepan on medium-low heat and add the oil.  Add the onions and thyme, cover and cook until very tender, for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the vinegar, bring to a boil and stir until absorbed.  Season with salt and pepper.  (This can be prepared ahead, cooled, covered and set aside at room temperature.) 
For the potatoes, carefully cut potatoes into thin, even slices using a knife, a mandoline or a food processor with a slicing blade.  Place in a large bowl of cold water.  (This can be prepared to this point and set aside at room temperature in bowl covered with cold water.  Drain before continuing with the recipe.) 
To cook, preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Dry the drained potatoes well in a lettuce spinner and a clean bath towel.  Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Trace four 5-inch circles on the parchment with dark ink.  Turn the paper over.  If the circles are not visible, redraw them so they are.  Brush the circles lightly with butter.  Overlap the potatoes to cover the bottom of each circle, using the least attractive slices for the center.  Brush lightly with butter.  Season with salt and pepper. 
Divide the onions among the centers of the circles.  Flatten onions to 1/8-inch-thick circles using a spatula.  Overlap 1 layer of potatoes around the rim of each circle, leaving part of the onion center exposed.  Brush the top layer of potatoes lightly with butter.  Season with salt and pepper.  Press down on the top layer, sealing it to the bottom layer.  Bake until brown and crisp, for about 30 minutes.  Press the layers together and neaten edges several times while baking. 
To serve, slide a long narrow spatula under the potatoes to loosen them from the paper.  Switch to a broad spatula and carefully transfer the potatoes to 4 small or main course plates, neatening the edges if necessary.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     eggs
     1/3           cup  milk (any kind will do)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon (no sugar)
                        or nutmeg (but not both)
  4             slices  whole-wheat bread, multigrain bread,
                        or nut bread, sliced to same thickness
                        as conventional white bread
  2                     ripe bananas -- 1 peeled, and
                        sliced into 1/4" slices, the second,

Pour syrup over "sandwich".  Serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  couscous
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Sea salt -- to taste
  1                cup  water
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2         pound  eggplant -- cut 1/4" cubes
  1              small  red pepper -- seeded, cored,
                        and diced
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  2             ounces  goat cheese -- cut 1/4" cubes
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     boneless chicken breasts - (8 oz ea),

                        attached (optional) and with skin left on

Put the remaining stuffing under the skin, pulling and tucking the skin to enclose the breast meat and stuffing.  Brush the breasts with the remaining oil and season with salt and pepper. 
Roast chicken breasts for 25 to 35 minutes until cooked through and nicely browned.  Remove from oven, cover with foil to keep warm and let rest for 2 to 3 minutes before slicing and serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHOCOLATE CAKE ===
  2               cups  hot water
  4             ounces  cocoa powder
  11            ounces  mayonnaise
  14            ounces  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  14            ounces  cake flour
                        === COCONUT GANACHE ===
  1              quart  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  coconut rum - (to 1/3 cup)
  2             pounds  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Mandarin orange sections
                        Grated coconut
                        Shaved chocolate

For the Cake:  Place hot water an cocoa powder in the bowl of a mixer with a paddle.  Mix until blended.  Add mayonnaise.  Blend until creamy.  Add sugar, baking soda, mix well.  Add the flour in three batches, mix only until blended.  Pour into a pan that has been sprayed with cooking spray, bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes. 
For the Ganache:  Bring cream to a boil.  Remove from the flame.  Whisk in coconut rum, and chopped chocolate.  Stir until all the chocolate has melted and set aside to cool. 
To Assemble:  Once the cake has cooled, take a slicing knife and even out the top of the cake.  From this one layer we will make four. 
Spread a thin layer of ganache on the bottom layer, top with a layer of mandarin oranges that have been drained from the juice and patted as dry as possible, a layer of freshly grated coconut and then another thin layer of ganache top.  Repeat the process with the remaining 3 layers.  Coat the top of the cake with a thin layer of ganache and garnish with mandarins and shaved chocolate. 
This recipe yields 1 nine-inch layer cake.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                cup  Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel,
                        or other dry red wine
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1               pint  strawberries -- hulled, and
                        thinly sliced lengthwise
  2             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped

     1/2         pound  butter -- or more

In a heavy sauce pan over low heat, melt desired amount of butter (it's easier with at least 1/4 pound).  When butter is fully melted, remove from heat and let stand for 3 minutes.  The butter should settle into three layers: a frothy top, a clear yellow middle, and a milky solid bottom. 
Begin by skimming or spooning the froth off the top.  Then carefully and slowly pour out the clear middle layer into a bowl while retaining all of the white solids in the pan.  Discard froth and solids.  If necessary, repeat skimming process on remaining contents in bowl. 
Clarified butter, tightly contained and refrigerated, will last almost indefinitely. 
This recipe's yield varies with amount of butter used.

                        Chicken or vegetable bouillon
                        for 9 cups of stock
  2             pounds  fresh carrots -- peeled
  3                     leeks -- halved lengthwise,
                        and thoroughly cleaned
  1                     yam (or sweet potato)
  4                     celery stalks
  1              piece  fresh ginger root - (3") -- peeled, grated
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  black pepper
  1           teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1               pint  heavy cream

In a large pot, bring 9 cups of chicken or vegetable stock to a boil.  Remove 1 cup and reserve.

Add sauteed vegetables to stock, reduce heat, cover with a lid, and simmer for 30 minutes.  Let cool to room temperature and then puree in a blender.  Soup should be thick and smooth. 
After blending two-thirds of the stock and vegetables, check the consistency of the blended soup.  If it is too thin, drain off a cup of the remaining stock.  If it is too thick, add the reserved cup of stock back into the pot.  Continue to blend the remaining vegetables and stock.  Add salt and pepper. 
To serve, add approximately 2 tablespoons of cream per serving and reheat.  Do not let it boil.  Serve in warm bowls.

                        === PUREED YAMS ===
  2             medium  yams -- peeled
  1                cup  orange juice
  3        tablespoons  maple syrup

                        === PUREED FENNEL ===
  2                     fennel bulbs
  1                     leek -- washed and diced
  1                can  chicken stock
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === PUREED BEETS ===
  4             medium  beets
                        === SALMON FILLET ===
  12            ounces  salmon fillet
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the Yams:  Slice yams into 1-inch slices and place in a 8- by 8-inch glass baking dish.  Add juice and syrup.  Cover with tin foil.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. 
Remove tin foil and bake for 30 more minutes.  Check to see that juice has not reduced to nothing and burned.  If necessary, remove early to avoid this.  Mash yams together with juice, until smooth. 
For the Spinach:  Wash spinach thoroughly.  Shake off excess water, but do not dry. 
In a non-aluminum pot, over medium heat, add oil, garlic and leek.  Stir until leeks and garlic become translucent.  Add spinach and cover pot.  Cook for 5 minutes, or until spinach has completely wilted.  Let cool, then puree in a food processor. 
For the Fennel:  Trim artery-like stems that shoot off top of fennel bulb.  Discard.  Then cut fennel in half and cut out the core.  Discard.  Slice remaining fennel into 1-inch slices. 
In a medium-sized pot over high heat, add fennel, leek, stock and salt.  Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer for 30 minutes.  Let cool, then puree in a food processor.  Use cheesecloth or a sieve to drain excess liquid. 
For the Beets:  Slice beets in half and boil for 45 minutes.  Let cool.  Peel off skin and discard.  Then puree beets in a food processor.  Use cheesecloth or a sieve to drain excess liquid. 
For the Salmon Fillet:  Cut salmon into 4 circles, 2 inches each in diameter.  Dribble oil in the center of the shinny side of an 18-inch piece of aluminum foil.  Place salmon in center and lift edges of the foil.  Pour lime juice over top.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Seal foil around salmon.  Bake in a preheated over at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.

Dried Figs Stuffed With Roasted Almonds, Chocolate, And Fennel Apulia Style - (Fichi Mandorlati)

Recipe By     :Julia Della Croce
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Snacks

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  50                    soft, moist, unstrung dried figs,
                        preferably Barese figs
  50             whole  unblanched almonds
                        (or twice that amount if figs are large)
  2        tablespoons  fennel seeds
  6             ounces  semi-sweet chocolate -- broken up
                        into small pieces
  25                    bay leaves - (approximately)

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.  Place the almonds on baking sheet on middle rack.  Roast until browned, about 15 minutes, stirring twice to ensure even roasting.  If almonds are still not roasted, leave them in longer, but check them every few minutes; because of their oily nature, they burn easily.  Remove almonds from oven and allow them to cool.  Keep the oven on while you stuff the figs. 
Make a slit in each fig large enough to allow passage of the almond.  Place a pinch of fennel seeds, one or two almonds, depending on the size of the figs, and a sliver or two of chocolate in the center of each fig; press the opening closed. 
When all of the figs have been stuffed, place the figs on a baking sheet.  Slide the sheet onto the middle rack of the oven and allow the figs to bake until heated through, about 20 minutes.  Remove the figs from the oven and allow them to cool. 
This recipe yields 50 stuffed figs.

                Field Greens With Shrimp, Corn And Ginger

Recipe By     :Michel Richard
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish                       Shrimp


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GINGER DRESSING ===
  3        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  water or orange juice
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              piece  fresh gingerroot - (2") -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced crosswise
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  ear white (or yellow) corn -- husked, and
                        kernels removed
  1         tablespoon  olive oil - (about)
  24             large  uncooked shrimp -- shelled, deveined
  7               cups  bite-sized mixed salad greens - (packed,
                        abt 7 oz)
  2        tablespoons  fresh minced green onions or chives

For the Ginger Dressing, mix the mayonnaise in a small bowl with the vinegar and water or orange juice.  Whisk in the oil in a slow, thin stream.  Press each ginger slice in a garlic press over a small glass, yielding about 2 teaspoons of juice.  Add the ginger juice to the dressing to taste.  Season with salt and pepper.  (This can be prepared ahead, covered and set aside at room temperature for about 2 hours or refrigerated until 1 hour before serving.) 
Cook corn kernels in a pot of simmering water for 5 minutes; drain.  (This can be prepared ahead and set aside at room temperature.) 
Place a heavy small nonstick skillet over medium heat and film it with oil.  Add the shrimp and cook until just pink, for about 2 minutes total, turning with tongs halfway.  (This can be prepared ahead and set aside at cool room temperature for several hours.) 
To serve, mix the corn and salad greens in a large bowl.  Gently toss with enough dressing to coat lightly.  Mound the salad in the center of 4 or 6 large plates.  Mix the shrimp with several tablespoons of the remaining dressing to coat lightly.  Arrange the shrimp around the salad.  Sprinkle the salad with green onions.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                            Grilled Vegetables

Recipe By     :Bob Blumer
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  tamari (preferable) or soy sauce
                        Corn, as is, in its husk
                        Yam, skin on -- sliced 1/2" thick,
                        and steamed for 10 minutes
                        Sweet bell peppers -- whole, or cut in
                        halves or quarters
                        Asparagus spears -- whole
  1         tablespoon  toasted oriental sesame oil -- (optional)

In a bowl or cup, mix olive oil and tamari or soy sauce. 
For all vegetables, except corn, place on grill and baste frequently with oil mixture (use a basting brush if available).  Turn and cook until browned to taste. 
Corn can be cooked by simply placing it in its husk on the grill directly over hot coals and rotating it every couple of minutes for approximately 12 minutes.  (Don't get nervous when the outside husk chars).  This method of cooking tends to slightly caramelize the kernels, giving the corn a sweeter flavor than if it were boiled. 
To avoid the kernels browning slightly (which I find adds to the flavor), soak the corn in water, in its husk, for 20 minutes before grilling.  Serve on warmed plates. 
This recipe's yield varies per amount of ingredients used.

Pancakes:  Divide dough into 8 equal parts.  Roll into a rough circle, 1/4-inch thick.  Paint with sesame oil.  Flavor with scallions, chiles, sesame seed, salt and pepper.  Roll each into a cigar then coil into a rough circle again. 
Roll each pancake now 1/2-inch thick.  Hold, divided by waxed paper, until ready to cook. 
Barbecue Sauce:  Saute ginger and garlic in sesame oil.  Add all other ingredients and simmer until reduced and flavorful.  Season to taste. 
Squid:  Toss squid with sesame oil, chili oil, salt and pepper and grill over a hot fire until fully cooked and well charred or char in a grill pan on your stove top. 
Cut into smaller bite-sized pieces and toss with a little barbecue sauce and hold. 
To Serve:  You will need garnishes of julienned scallion, cilantro sprigs and any number of pickled vegetables that you might make or buy in an Asian market (for example pickled ginger, pickled shallot, pickled daikon, mustard greens or even salted mung bean sprouts). 
Heat oven to 400 degrees. 
Heat a large saute pan and add a little soy or canola oil.  Add pancakes and brown one side, flip and finish in oven. 
Compose plate with triangles of scallion pancake, a pile of barbecued squid, pickles, herbs and a side cup of the barbecue dipping sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CLAMS ===
  28                    littleneck clams - (abt 3 lbs) -- scrubbed
  2 3/4           cups  water
  1 1/4           cups  dry white wine
                        === SOUP ===
  3       medium large  leeks (white, light green parts only) -- halved lengthwise,
                        and thinly sliced crosswise
  3             medium  russet potatoes - (abt 3/4 lb) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/1/2" cubes
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Additional water or cream as necessary
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh minced chives or green onions

To cook the clams, place them in a heavy large skillet.  Cover with the water and wine.  Bring to a boil, cover the skillet, then reduce heat and simmer for 3 minutes, shaking the skillet occasionally.  With tongs, remove the clams that have opened and place them on a tray.  Recover and cook for up to 3 to 4 more minutes.  Discard any clams that have not opened.  Line a fine sieve with a dampened paper towel.  Strain the cooking liquid through the sieve into a heavy large saucepan. 
For the soup, add the leeks and potatoes to the saucepan with cooking liquid.  Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender, for about 15 minutes.  Add the cream.  Coarsely mash the potatoes in the broth to thicken, using a mallet or potato masher.  Season with salt and pepper.  (This can be prepared ahead and cooled.  Cover the clams and soup and set aside at cool room temperature for up to several hours.) 
To serve, remove the clams from their shells and mince.  Pour any liquid from the shells back into the soup through the sieve and discard the shells.  Thin the soup with additional liquid if necessary.  Bring to a boil, stirring over medium-high heat.  Add minced clams.  Ladle into 4 soup bowls.  Sprinkle with chives.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

      Meat Loaf Stuffed With Ham And Parsley Frittata - (Polpettone)

Recipe By     :Julia Della Croce
Serving Size  : 15    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR POLPETTONE MIXTURE ===
     1/2         large  beef bouillon cube, or 1 small one -- dissolved in
  1 1/2           cups  hot water
  4             ounces  shredded stale white bread (crust removed)
  3             pounds  mixed lean ground beef and pork,
                        (or 3 lbs lean ground beef)
  1             medium  onion -- grated
  3             ounces  sun-dried tomatoes -- chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper - (scant)
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  1           teaspoon  fresh marjoram,
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried marjoram)
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  1                     egg
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  1              pinch  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  butter or olive oil
  4             slices  boiled ham, regular thickness
  1         tablespoon  lightly-toasted bread crumbs

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.  Soak the bread in the stock, then squeeze it dry, reserving the bouillon cube liquid for later.  Shred the dampened bread and combine it with the remaining ingredients for the polpettone mixture.  Use your hands to distribute the ingredients well. 
Now make the frittatine.  In a small bowl, beat the egg with the parsley, salt, and pepper.  Heat the oil in a 9-inch omelet pan or frying pan.  Add half of the egg mixture, allowing it to cover the surface of the pan entirely.  When it is set, about 30 seconds, flip it or turn it with a spatula and allow it to set on the reverse side, about 15 seconds.  Transfer it to a plate and make the second frittatine.  Transfer it to the plate also and allow the frittatine to cool for several minutes. 
Meanwhile, scatter the bread crumbs on an approximate 12- by 18-inch work surface.  Spread the meat mixture on the crumb covered surface, use your hands to form a rectangle about 12 inches wide, 18 inches long, and not more than 1/2-inch thick (if it is too thick, it will be difficult to roll up).  Cover the rectangle with the ham slices, then with the frittatine, laying them side-by-side to cover the whole surface of the meat mixture.  Roll it closed lengthwise in jellyroll fashion so that a long, narrow sausage-like loaf is formed. 
Place the polpettone in an ungreased baking dish and add half of the reserved bouillon cube liquid to the pan.  Place it on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 50 minutes, adding the remaining bouillon cube liquid after 15 minutes.  Baste it several times during baking with the pan juices, adding a little more water if the pan juices seem to be drying up -- no more than a tablespoon or two, if any, should be necessary.  There should be sufficient juice in the baking pan to keep the meatloaf moist, and to guarantee pan juices at serving time. 
Fifteen minutes before the meat is cooked, add the wine to the pan.  When done, remove the polpettone from the oven and allow it to settle for 15 minutes before cutting it into slices.  The wine-fortified pan juices can be drizzled over the slices. 
This recipe yields 15 to 18 servings.

  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  sweet paprika
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  water
                        === FOR CONFIT ===
  6               cups  sliced onions
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  6               cups  peeled, 1"-cubed winter squash
  24                    sundried tomatoes
  16                    Kalamata olives - (to 20) -- pits removed
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground fennel
  2        tablespoons  mild-flavored honey
  1                     two-inch strip of orange peel
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  2               cups  water

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Slice the tempeh into 1-inch by 2-inch pieces.  Steam for 8 minutes. 
Meanwhile, combine all of the ingredients for the marinade and whisk until emulsified.  Pour half in the bottom of a baking dish that can hold all of the tempeh in a single layer.  Spread the tempeh on the dish and top with the remaining marinade.  Bake uncovered for 30 minutes or until browned and most of the marinade has been absorbed. 
For the Confit:  In a heavy saucepan combine oil, onions and salt.  Sweat onions covered for 10 minutes.  Stir from time to time to prevent sticking. 
Meanwhile, reconstitute the tomatoes in boiling water for 5 minutes.  Drain, cool and chop.  Add the garlic and cook 2 minutes more.  Add the remaining ingredients and simmer for 1 hour, until thickened.  Remove cinnamon sticks and orange peel.  Adjust seasonings. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  1                cup  cooked chickpeas
     1/2           cup  raisins -- (optional)
  2             ounces  spinach or chard
  1           teaspoon  raz el hanouf, (available at specialty
                        markets)
  1              bunch  cilantro -- 4 sprigs reserved
                        for garnish, the remainder chopped
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon -- (optional)
  2               cups  cooked couscous - (to 3 cups)
  1         tablespoon  chopped mint -- (optional)

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  6             medium  to large onions -- sliced
  3             pounds  beef -- cut into 1/2" cubes
  1 1/2     tablespoon  Hungarian sweet paprika
  1         tablespoon  caraway seeds
     1/2    tablespoon  dried marjoram
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper -- or to taste
                        Zest of 1 lemon -- chopped
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste -- mixed with
  1                cup  water or stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR SERVING ===
                        Steamed potatoes or bread dumplings
                        Sour cream -- (optional)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Heat the oil in a heavy, thick casserole or pot.  Saute the onion rings on a low flame until soft, about 30 minutes. 
Add the cubes of beef to the casserole and brown.  Add the paprika, caraway seeds, marjoram, cayenne pepper, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Stir until spices develop an aroma. 
Add the tomato paste mixed with water or stock.  Use more water or stock if needed to just barely cover all the meat.  Raise the heat under the pot and bring to a boil. 
Tightly cover the top with aluminum foil and then the lid.  Place in preheated 350 degree oven.  Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours in the oven until the meat is fork tender. 
Serve in a bowl with steamed potatoes or bread dumplings.  Add a dollop of sour cream if the gulyas is very spicy.  Enjoy! 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

               Olivi Paradiso - (italian Black Olive Paste)

Recipe By     :Bob Blumer
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Dips/Spreads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  black Calamata olives, (the small,
                        thin Greek ones)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     2/3           cup  Italian parsley -- chopped
  5              large  fresh rosemary sprigs -- stems removed
  3              large  fresh thyme sprigs -- stems removed
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Pit the olives.  Place olive between thumb and forefinger and squish.  This takes a while but you will move quickly along the curve.  Place olives and all other ingredients in a blender or food processor and puree into a coarse mixture. 
If you are using a blender to puree, you may need to add some extra oil to facilitate blending.  After blending, place in a bowl.  Excess oil will rise to the edges of the bowl.  Drain off.  Keep refrigerated. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 appetizer servings. 
Comments: Although no salt is added, the natural composition of Calamata olives makes this appetizer quite salty.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  parsnips -- peeled, and
                        quartered crosswise
  1              large  russet potato - (abt 6 oz) -- peeled, quartered
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             ounces  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- chopped,
                        at room temperature,
  1         tablespoon  minced flat-leaf parsley

Place the parsnips and potato in a medium pot and cover generously with cold salted water.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer until very tender and almost falling apart, for about 20 minutes; drain. 
Set a large holed sieve over the same pot.  Mash the vegetables through the sieve, using a large mallet and up/down motion.  (This can be prepared ahead, covered and set aside at room temperature.) 
To serve, stir the puree over medium-high heat using a wooden spatula until warm.  Add the butter and stir until smooth.  (This can be prepared 1 hour ahead and kept warm in a larger pan of gently simmering water (ban marie).  Stir occasionally. 
Mix in the parsley.  Mound in a vegetable dish or spoon out onto 2 to 4 large plates with an entree.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     pears -- peeled and sliced
                        or chunked to yield 4 cups
     1/2           cup  dried cranberries
  1         tablespoon  Grand Marnier -- (optional)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  arrowroot
  2            pinches  cardamom
  4        tablespoons  butter -- cut into chunks
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
     3/4           cup  rolled oats
     1/4           cup  flour
                        === LIGHT WHIPPED CREAM ===
  2                     egg whites
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar
     1/2           cup  heavy cream

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine pears, dried cranberries, Grand Marnier, sugar, arrowroot and cardamom in a bowl.  Put this mixture into a 4- to 6-cup ovenproof baking dish. 
Put the butter, brown sugar, rolled oats and flour in a food processor.  Pulse to form a crumbly mixture.  Spread this on top of the pears and cranberries. 
Bake for about 30 minutes until the oat topping is brown and crispy and the fruit is soft. 
For the Light Whipped Cream:  Put the egg whites into a medium bowl, add the sugar, and whip by hand or by machine until the whites form firm but not dry peaks.  Whip the cream by hand or by machine until it forms soft peaks.  Fold the cream into the beaten egg whites. 
Scoop some of the crisp into each of four soup plates or bowls.  Add a dollop of light whipped cream and garnish with a sprig of fresh mint.  Or, serve the crisp with ice cream or frozen yogurt. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                      Potato Risotto With Mushrooms

Recipe By     :Michel Richard
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Potatoes                        Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  russet potatoes - (abt 8 med) -- peeled
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/4         pound  shiitake or other fresh mushrooms - (to
                        1/2 lb) -- ends trimmed,
                        and thinly diced
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - (abt 1
                        oz)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To prepare the potatoes, carefully cut potatoes into thin, even slices using a knife or food processor with a slicing blade.  Cut the slices into 1/8-inch-wide strips.  Cut the strips crosswise into very fine dice the size of rice grains.  As the potatoes are cut, place them in a large bowl of cold water.  (This can be prepared ahead to this point and set aside at room temperature in the bowl covered with cold water.) 
To cook, bring 1 cup of the cream to a boil in a heavy large nonstick saucepan over medium-high heat.  Drain the potatoes and add them to the cream.  Simmer gently, adjusting the heat, until the cream is absorbed, stirring occasionally.  Pour in 1/2 of the remaining cream with all of the mushrooms.  Simmer gently until the cream is absorbed, stirring occasionally.  (This can prepared to this point about 1 1/2 hours ahead and set aside at cool room temperature.) 
To serve, bring to a simmer and pour in the remaining cream.  Simmer until thickened and the cream is absorbed (the potatoes will start to meld together), for about 20 minutes. 
Stir in the Parmesan.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mound in a vegetable dish or spoon out onto 4 to 6 large plates with an entree.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

To prepare the potatoes, carefully cut potatoes into thin, even slices using a knife or food processor with a slicing blade.  Cut the slices into 1/8-inch-wide strips.  Cut the strips crosswise into very fine dice the size of rice grains.  As the potatoes are cut, place them in a large bowl of cold water.  (This can be prepared ahead to this point and set aside at room temperature in the bowl covered with cold water.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To cook, bring 1 cup of the cream to a boil in a heavy large nonstick saucepan over medium-high heat.  Drain the potatoes and add them to the cream.  Simmer gently, adjusting the heat, until the cream is absorbed, stirring occasionally.  Pour in 1/2 of the remaining cream with all of the mushrooms.  Simmer gently until the cream is absorbed, stirring occasionally.  (This can prepared to this point about 1 1/2 hours ahead and set aside at cool room temperature.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, bring to a simmer and pour in the remaining cream.  Simmer until thickened and the cream is absorbed (the potatoes will start to meld together), for about 20 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir in the Parmesan.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mound in a vegetable dish or spoon out onto 4 to 6 large plates with an entree.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  russet potatoes - (abt 5 med) -- peeled, quartered
  2          teaspoons  red wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BEETS ===
  4             medium  beets - (abt 1 1/4 lbs)
     1/4           cup  milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             ounces  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- chopped,
                        at room temperature,
  2        tablespoons  fresh minced chives or green onions

For the potatoes, place in a medium pot and cover with cold salted water.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer until very tender and almost falling apart, for about 20 minutes; drain. 
Set a large holed sieve over the same pot.  Mash the potatoes through the sieve, using a large mallet and up/down motion.  Stir in the vinegar.  Season with salt and pepper.  (This can prepared ahead, covered and set aside at room temperature.) 
Meanwhile, cover the beets with cold salted water in medium pot.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer until very tender and easily pierced with a knife, for about 20 minutes; drain. 
Puree the beets with the milk in a blender until smooth, pulsing on/off and stopping to scrape down the sides of the container.  Season with salt and pepper.  Strain the beet puree into the potatoes through a fine sieve, pressing on the beets.  (This can be prepared ahead, covered and set aside at room temperature.) 
To serve, stir the puree over medium-high heat until warm, using a wooden spatula.  Add the butter and stir until smooth.  (This can prepared 1 hour ahead to this point and kept warm in a larger pan of gently simmering water (bain marie).  Stir occasionally. 
Mix in the chives.  Mound in a vegetable dish or spoon out onto 4 to 6 large plates with an entree.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Roasted Chicken With Garlic And Black Olive Stuffing, Potatoes And Carrots

Recipe By     :Nora Pouillon
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  whole free range chicken - (to 3 1/2 lbs)
  1                cup  whole peeled garlic cloves
  1                cup  good-quality black olives,
                        such as Moroccan or Greek
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             pounds  potatoes -- peeled, cut wedges
                        (I like Yellow-finn and Yukon Gold
                        potatoes)
  1 1/2         pounds  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into large chunks
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish
  8             slices  French bread -- toasted
  4             sprigs  Italian parsley -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Combine the garlic cloves and black olives and put them into the cavity of the chicken.  Truss the chicken with string.  Rub the outside with some of the olive oil and season with some salt and pepper. 
Put the chicken in a roasting pan on its right side.  Toss the potatoes and carrots with the remaining olive oil, salt and pepper.  Put the potatoes and carrots around the chicken.  Roast the chicken in a pan on the right side for 20 minutes.  Then turn the chicken onto its left side and roast for another 20 minutes.  Finally, turn the chicken on its back and roast for another 20 minutes.  Each time you turn the chicken, stir the potatoes and carrots in the juices.  This is the key to perfectly roasting a whole chicken. 
Remove the garlic and black olive stuffing from the chicken.  Cut the chicken into 4 to 8 pieces.  Serve a portion of the chicken on each of 4 large plates with some of the roasted potatoes and carrots.  Garnish each plate with a couple of lemon wedges, some of the black olives and garlic cloves and a couple slices of toasted French bread.  I like to smear some of the garlic on the toasted bread.  Garnish each plate with a sprig of parsley. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Put the chicken in a roasting pan on its right side.  Toss the potatoes and carrots with the remaining olive oil, salt and pepper.  Put the potatoes and carrots around the chicken.  Roast the chicken in a pan on the right side for 20 minutes.  Then turn the chicken onto its left side and roast for another 20 minutes.  Finally, turn the chicken on its back and roast for another 20 minutes.  Each time you turn the chicken, stir the potatoes and carrots in the juices.  This is the key to perfectly roasting a whole chicken.

Remove the garlic and black olive stuffing from the chicken.  Cut the chicken into 4 to 8 pieces.  Serve a portion of the chicken on each of 4 large plates with some of the roasted potatoes and carrots.  Garnish each plate with a couple of lemon wedges, some of the black olives and garlic cloves and a couple slices of toasted French bread.  I like to smear some of the garlic on the toasted bread.  Garnish each plate with a sprig of parsley.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Put duck, carrots, potatoes, turnips, beets, celery, shallots, garlic and 3 teaspoons oil into a large bowl.  Season to taste with chopped herbs, salt, and pepper.  Toss to combine. 
Oil a 9- by 14-inch roasting pan with the remaining oil.  Remove duck legs from bowl and place them into the baking dish.  Pour 1/2 cup of stock or wine into the baking dish.  Roast the legs for 30 minutes, turning once so they will brown evenly.  Add the seasoned vegetables and the remaining stock or wine to the roasting pan with the duck legs.  Roast for another 45 minutes or until the legs and vegetables are browned and cooked through. 
Divide the vegetables among four warm dinner plates.  Place a duck leg on each plate.  Pour the accumulated juices over the meat and vegetables.  Garnish with the celery leaves.

              Salmon Grilled Between Romaine Lettuce Leaves

Recipe By     :Bob Blumer
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Salmon                          Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  romaine lettuce leaves
  6          teaspoons  olive oil
  2                     salmon steaks or salmon fillets, 1" thick,
                        about 6 oz ea
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  capers
  4             sprigs  fresh dill
  2                     lemons -- 1 juiced,
                        and 1 sliced thinly
  2             pieces  twine, 3 feet each (or other non flammable
                        natural fiber)

Soak twine in hot water for 15 minutes.  Rinse salmon in cold water and pat dry with towel. 
Repeat the following for each salmon steak:  Rinse romaine leaves in water, do not dry.  Rub 1 teaspoon of the oil over the inside (concave side) of each of the lettuce leaves.  Place salmon steak in center of one leaf (concave-side up). 
Add salt and pepper.  Pour 1 teaspoon oil and the juice of 1/2 lemon over salmon, trapping the drippings with the leaf.  Top with capers, dill, and one lemon slice. 
Place second leaf over salmon, fold ends of bottom leaf up to keep juices trapped, and wrap the string around the leaves to seal.  Tie string in a knot. 
Place fish on grill over hot coals for 5 minutes.  Turn and grill for another 5 minutes.  Cooking time will be slightly less for fillets and will vary according to the exact thickness of the steak. 
Cut string and remove top leaf.  (You may want to leave string on for presentation value).  Serve on warmed plates. 
This recipe yields 2 servings.

                   Salmon With Red Wine Shiitake Sauce

Recipe By     :Michel Richard
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Salmon                          Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RED WINE SHIITAKE SAUCE ===
  1           teaspoon  red wine vinegar
  2             medium  shallots -- peeled, minced
  2               cups  unsalted chicken or veal stock
  1                cup  Pinot Noir, Merlot or other dry,
                        fruity red wine
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, minced
  1              large  fresh thyme sprig
                        (or 2 tbspns dried thyme, crumbled)
  1           teaspoon  peanut oil
  1           teaspoon  Oriental (toasted) sesame oil
     1/4         pound  fresh shiitake or other fresh mushrooms -- ends trimmed,
                        thinly sliced and patted dry
                        === SALMON ===
  4                     salmon steaks, 3/4" thick - (abt 2 lbs
                        total) -- patted dry
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  peanut or vegetable oil - (about)
  2        tablespoons  minced flat-leaf parsley

For the Red Wine Shiitake Sauce, bring the vinegar to a boil with the shallots in a heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the stock, wine, garlic, and thyme.  Boil until thickened to a sauce-like consistency and reduced to about 1 cup.  (This can be prepared 1 day ahead and refrigerated.) 
Heat the peanut and sesame oils in a heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms and saute until golden brown, for about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  (This can be prepared ahead, covered and set aside at room temperature.) 
For the salmon, preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  Pat salmon dry.  Season with salt and pepper.  Place a heavy large ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and film with oil.  Add the salmon and brown both sides lightly for about 1 minute.  Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the salmon is just opaque throughout for about 15 minutes. 
To serve, meanwhile, stir the sauce over medium-high heat to rewarm.  Discard the thyme sprig.  Stir in the mushrooms.  Place each salmon steak in the center of the plate and ladle the sauce over it until completely covered.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHINESE BLACK BEAN SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  peeled, finely-chopped fresh ginger
  1                cup  sherry
  1                can  tomatoes - (28 oz) -- diced
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce or tamtri -- (optional),
                        (available at Asian specialty markets)
     1/2           cup  Chinese fermented black beans -- rinsed,
                        (available at Asian specialty markets)
  3        tablespoons  mixed chopped herbs,
                        such as cilantro, mint and Thai basil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SALMON IN RICE PAPER ===
  4                     salmon filets - (6 oz ea) -- skinned
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     to 6 pieces circular rice paper - (8" or
                        10" dia),
                        (available at Asian specialty markets)
  4             sprigs  fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
                        === STEAMED BABY BOK CHOY AND TAT SOI ===
  4              heads  baby bok choy
     1/2         pound  tat soi or spinach -- washed, stemmed
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the oil in a medium saucepan.  Saute the onions, garlic and ginger for 3 to 5 minutes.  Add the sherry and reduce by one-third.  Add the chopped tomatoes and simmer for 2 minutes.  Add the fish sauce, black beans, and herbs.  Taste for seasonings. 
Sprinkle some salt and pepper on the salmon fillets to season.  Dip the rice paper rounds into a bowl of hot water.  Remove from water and put them on a flat surface and wait 1 to 2 minutes until the sheets absorb the water. 
Move the first sheet of rice paper to the center of the work space.  Put a couple cilantro leaves in the middle of the rice paper.  Put a salmon fillet top-side down in the middle of the rice paper covering the cilantro leaves.  Fold up the four sides of the rice paper sheet to form a packet.  Turn the packet over and store under a barely dampened towel while you do the remaining three fillets. 
Heat the oil in a saute pan.  Sear the top sides of the salmon packets for 2 to 3 minutes until the paper becomes translucent.  Turn the packets over and finish cooking on the stove or in a 350 degree oven for 5 to 8 minutes.  If you like your salmon well done, cook for 2 to 4 minutes longer. 
Blanch the vegetables in boiling water.  Drain and toss with sesame oil, salt and pepper. 
Assembly:  Ladle the Chinese black bean sauce onto each of 4 large dinner plates, tilting the plate so the sauce spreads out evenly.  Put the salmon packet slightly off center.  Add 1 head of baby bok choy and some of the tat soi or spinach. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  organic unbleached white flour
  2             pounds  organic whole-wheat bread flour
  6               cups  cold water
                        === FOR THE STOCK ===
  1              pound  onions -- quartered
  2 1/2                 carrots -- halved lengthwise
  2                     celery stalks, including leaves -- cut in half
  4                     garlic cloves -- cut in half
  8                     ginger coins
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2                     bay leaves
  12                    peppercorns
     3/4           cup  Tamari or natural soy sauce
  1             gallon  water

In a large bowl combine flour and water and form into a ball.  Place dough on a counter and knead about 150 strokes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. 
Put the dough back in the mixing bowl to cover with warm water.  Let the dough rest for 30 minutes while you make the stock. 
In an eighteen-quart stock pot, combine all ingredients for the stock and bring to a boil.  Lower the flame to a simmer, while you make the gluten. 
To make the Gluten:  Place dough in a colander, inside the mixing bowl.  Put the bowl containing the colander and dough into the sink and fill with cold tap water.  Knead the dough for five minutes and drain.  Repeat this procedure two more times. 
Fill bowl with hot water and repeat five minutes more, pulling and kneading the dough until the water becomes almost clear.  Finally, rinse in cold water for an additional two minutes. 
What you are left with is the glutinous part of wheat.  The protein, all of the starch, and 90% of the bran having been washed away. 
Divide the gluten into two equal-sized balls and simmer in the stock for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  Add water from time to time to keep gluten submerged.  Strain the stock and use for soup or sauce.  Seitan is now ready to use.  Refrigerate or freeze.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PURPLE SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  soy sauce
  2         thin coins  fresh gingerroot -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3               cups  shredded red cabbage
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SHRIMP ===
  4               cups  one-inch pieces kataifi or fideos,
                        (thin dried nested pasta)
     1/3           cup  flour
  1                     egg -- at room temperature
  1         tablespoon  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  16             large  shrimp -- shelled, deveined
                        Oil - (abt 4 cups) -- for deep frying

For the purple sauce, place the mayonnaise, lemon juice, vinegar, sugar, soy sauce and ginger in a food processor fitted with chopping blade.  Process until mixed and smooth, pulsing on/off.  With the machine running, pour in oil in a slow, thin stream.  Add the cabbage and process, pulsing on/off and occasionally scraping down the sides of the container, until finely ground and almost smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  (This can be prepared 1 day ahead, transferred to a bowl, covered and refrigerated until 30 minutes before serving.) 
Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Pull the kataifi out of the bag and cut it into 1 inch pieces over a bowl.  Separate the threads with your fingers.  Refrigerate or refreeze the remaining kataifi for another dish. 
Place the kataifi on 1 large plate and the flour on another.  Whisk the egg with water in a soup plate until blended.  Season the egg with salt and pepper.  One at a time, dip the shrimp into the flour until well coated, patting off excess.  Hold the shrimp with tongs and dip it into the egg, coating completely, and then into the kataifi.  Place the shrimp dipped kataifi in the palm of your hand and compress it into a large neat package, about 2 1/2 inches in diameter.  Place on the prepared baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining shrimp.  (This can be prepared ahead and set aside, covered, at cool room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerated until 1 hour before frying.) 
To cook, line a large baking sheet with paper towels.  Heat 1 inch of oil in a wok or a large skillet to 350 degrees, or until bubbles form around a chopstick or a wooden spoon handle immersed in the oil.  Using tongs, gradually dip 1 shrimp into the oil, waiting until the bottom layer of the kataifi sets before immersing the shrimp completely.  Add additional shrimp in the same manner in batches without crowding.  Cook the shrimp until golden brown on both sides, for about 3 minutes total.  Transfer to paper towels with tongs or a slotted spoon.  (This can be cooked several hours ahead.  Reheat on towel lined tray in a preheated 450 degree oven for 2 to 3 minutes.) 
To serve, spoon the Purple Sauce in the center of 4 large plates.  Arrange 4 shrimp on top of the sauce on each plate.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the purple sauce, place the mayonnaise, lemon juice, vinegar, sugar, soy sauce and ginger in a food processor fitted with chopping blade.  Process until mixed and smooth, pulsing on/off.  With the machine running, pour in oil in a slow, thin stream.  Add the cabbage and process, pulsing on/off and occasionally scraping down the sides of the container, until finely ground and almost smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  (This can be prepared 1 day ahead, transferred to a bowl, covered and refrigerated until 30 minutes before serving.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Pull the kataifi out of the bag and cut it into 1 inch pieces over a bowl.  Separate the threads with your fingers.  Refrigerate or refreeze the remaining kataifi for another dish. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the kataifi on 1 large plate and the flour on another.  Whisk the egg with water in a soup plate until blended.  Season the egg with salt and pepper.  One at a time, dip the shrimp into the flour until well coated, patting off excess.  Hold the shrimp with tongs and dip it into the egg, coating completely, and then into the kataifi.  Place the shrimp dipped kataifi in the palm of your hand and compress it into a large neat package, about 2 1/2 inches in diameter.  Place on the prepared baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining shrimp.  (This can be prepared ahead and set aside, covered, at cool room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerated until 1 hour before frying.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To cook, line a large baking sheet with paper towels.  Heat 1 inch of oil in a wok or a large skillet to 350 degrees, or until bubbles form around a chopstick or a wooden spoon handle immersed in the oil.  Using tongs, gradually dip 1 shrimp into the oil, waiting until the bottom layer of the kataifi sets before immersing the shrimp completely.  Add additional shrimp in the same manner in batches without crowding.  Cook the shrimp until golden brown on both sides, for about 3 minutes total.  Transfer to paper towels with tongs or a slotted spoon.  (This can be cooked several hours ahead.  Reheat on towel lined tray in a preheated 450 degree oven for 2 to 3 minutes.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, spoon the Purple Sauce in the center of 4 large plates.  Arrange 4 shrimp on top of the sauce on each plate.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  Old Dominion or other pilsner-type beer
  1           teaspoon  Old Bay seasoning
                        (or a mixture of celery salt, pepper, hot
                        paprika,

  1 1/4         pounds  large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1        small bunch  flat leaf parsley -- for garnish
                        Crusty bread -- for serving

Pour the beer and Old Bay seasoning into a medium saucepan, stir to combine and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add shrimp, stir and bring back to a boil.  Remove saucepan from heat, cover and leave for 3 minutes until the shrimp are opaque and cooked through.  If you won't be serving the shrimp immediately, transfer them from the hot pan into a bowl so they won't continue to cook.  Shrimp become tough when they are overcooked. 
Divide the shrimp among four large, warm soup bowls and pour some broth into each bowl.  Garnish each bowl with a small bunch of parsley.  Serve with bread to mop up the juices. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                   Stuffed Roasted Pepper "Sandwiches"

Recipe By     :Julia Della Croce
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  red or yellow bell peppers
  6        thin slices  prosciutto
  6        thin slices  fontina
                        Olive oil -- for brushing peppers

Arrange the peppers on a grill rack above a charcoal fire, on wire racks positioned over the burners of a gas or electric stove, 2 to 3 inches under a preheated broiler, or in an oven preheated to 400 degrees.  Roast them until they are charred all over and tender inside, turning them frequently to insure they cook evenly, about 25 minutes in the oven, but less time by the other methods.  Remove them from the oven but leave the oven on. 
When the peppers are cool enough to handle, using a sharp knife, cut them in half vertically, like a sandwich.  Care should be taken not to break the skin.  Carefully remove the stem and lift off the skin.  Remove all of the seeds. 
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees. 
Place a slice each of prosciutto and fontina on the inside of one half of each pepper.  Replace the matching half over the filling.  Brush lightly with olive oil and place on a foil-lined baking sheet.  Use two baking sheets if necessary.  Place the peppers in the oven, placing the baking sheet(s) on the middle rack.  Cook until the cheese is melted and the peppers are heated through, about 15 minutes.  Serve hot or warm 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  sweet potatoes or yams - (3" in dia)
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame oil
  1                cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
Place each sweet potato or yam on its side and slice crosswise into 1/2-inch rounds.  Using a 3-inch star-shaped cookie cutter, cut out a star shape from each round; discard the scraps.  If your star cookie cutter is packed away with the Christmas decorations, place a paper star stencil on top of the round and use a paring knife to cut the shape. 
Pour the sesame oil into the bottom of a shallow ovenproof baking dish and spread it so that the whole bottom is greased. 
Place the stars in the baking dish.  Pour the orange juice over the stars and sprinkle the brown sugar and nutmeg on top.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil. 
Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for 15 more minutes. 
Use a spatula to remove the stars from the baking dish.  Top each star with 1 teaspoon of the pan juice. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        (exact number may vary with size)
                        Fresh herbs, 3 large sprigs of rosemary,
                        thyme, and/or dill -- stems removed

  2        tablespoons  minced ginger
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro - (to 3 tbspns)
  2        tablespoons  chopped mint - (to 3 tbspns)
  2        tablespoons  Nuoc Cham - (to 3 tbspns) -- (see above)
  4             ounces  shredded chicken breast
  4             ounces  sliced beef sirloin tip
  4             ounces  coarsely-chopped shrimp
                        === TRADITIONAL GARNISH PLATTER ===
  12                    small lettuce leaves - (to 16)
  10            sprigs  mint - (to 12)
  10            sprigs  cilantro - (to 12)
  1                     cucumber -- cut small spears
     1/2           cup  mung bean sprouts
  1                     carrot -- julienned
  10                    chiles - (to 12), preferably fresh Thai
                        Bird
  10                    lime wedges - (to 12)

Nuoc Cham:  Assemble all ingredients and let stand in a bowl that it may be presented in later. 
Marinade:  Blend all marinade ingredients together.  Set aside. 
Filling:  Cut all vegetables carefully and mix with herbs.  Wait to season with Nuoc Cham until you are ready to roll. 
Brush chicken, beef and shrimp with marinade and cook, preferably on grill.  Cool after grilling. 
Cut chicken, beef and shrimp into desired size and toss with any leftover marinade to season. 
To Assemble and Serve:  Soak the rice papers a few at a time in hot water.  Have a towel ready to work on and to take up some of the extra moisture.  Have your fillings ready and seasoned. 
Roll a variety of salad rolls (some just chicken, just vegetable, some combos, etc.) until all filling and wrappers are used. 
Arrange the garnishes on a platter along with the fresh salad rolls and the Nuoc Cham dipping sauce. 
Tradition has it that the guests using a lettuce leaf as a cup will garnish his or her own salad roll as they choose and dip into Nuoc Cham. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  These are like unfried spring rolls and are quite fresh and delicious.  Nuoc Cham is a tractional South East Asian condiment that is served with the salad rolls.

Salad:  Wash the frisee well, trim the root end but leave it attached, and cut the heads in half. 
Remove the rind from the bacon.  Cut bacon into thick lardons, slowly render the fat, drain and dry lardons on paper toweling. 
Peel the shallots, slice them into 1/4-inch rings, toss them in the mixture of hot balsamic vinegar and grenadine and reserve. 
Clean and trim the mushrooms.  Toss them with olive oil, kosher salt, cracked pepper and fresh thyme then roast them and reserve. 
Cut the ficelle into 16 thick little slices. 
Vinaigrette:  Combine all vinaigrette ingredients. 
To Assemble:  Warm plates in a low oven.  Have all components prepped in advance. 
In a separate pan or lightly-oiled baking dish lay the seasoned bread for croutons in a single layer.  Sprinkle lightly with oil and toast quickly in a 425 degree oven.  Place in the warming oven. 
In a large pan sear seasoned halves of frisee in a scant amount of soy or canola oil.  Transfer them to the warm oven.   In the same pan add the bacon, shallots, roasted mushrooms and half of the vinaigrette.  Heat thoroughly. 
Remove plates and frisee from the warming oven.  Spoon hot mushroom mixture across frisee. 
In that same pan again, lightly wilt spinach with a splash more vinaigrette and plate it in a separate little pile next to the mushroom braise. 
Arrange croutons over the salad.  Garnish with coarsely chopped herb confetti. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  4                     pears
  4                     plums
  8                     Belgian endive heads
  4                     frisee heads
  4                     radicchio heads
  6             ounces  walnuts
  6             ounces  hazelnuts
                        Butter
  12            ounces  Maytag bleu cheese
                        Salt-- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  3             ounces  sherry vinaigrette
  3             ounces  olive oil

Cut endive and frisee in half.  Cut radicchio in quarters. 
Toss nuts with melted butter, salt, and pepper, then lightly roast.  Cool and crush by hand or with a rolling pin. 
In a hot skillet or roasting pan drizzle lightly with olive oil, season the endive, frisee, and radicchio and roast them cut-side down (you do want to color the endive).

Toss roasted endives with the vinaigrette.  Arrange the lettuces and fruits on the plate, and garnish with nuts and cheese.
