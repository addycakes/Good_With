Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === KESRA: MOROCCAN BREAD ===
  1 1/4           cups  warm water - (abt 110 degrees)
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour or
                        bread flour
     1/3           cup  yellow cornmeal -- plus
  1         tablespoon  yellow cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  2          teaspoons  sesame seeds
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Curly lettuce -- for garnish
                        === VEGETABLES ===
  2             medium  eggplants
                        Salt -- as needed
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
                        Paprika -- to taste
                        Cayenne -- to taste
  3                     green tomatoes -- sliced
  4             ounces  butter
                        === HARISSA-STYLE RED PEPPER SPREAD ===
  2                     red peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        and seeded
  3              small  fresh red chiles -- chopped
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled, chopped
  2        tablespoons  fresh chopped cilantro
  2          teaspoons  ground coriander seeds
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed cardamom seeds
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the Kesra:  In a small bowl of 1/4 cup of the warm water, stir in the yeast and sugar.  Stir lightly until yeast begins to dissolve.  Allow mixture to stand until it begins to bubble, about 10 minutes.

In a standing mixer bowl, put flour and 1/3 cup of cornmeal.  Make a well in the center and add yeast mixture, salt, and melted butter.  Knead the bread and gradually add remaining warm water until dough is smooth and elastic.

Sprinkle baking sheet with olive oil and then dust with cornmeal.  Separate the dough into 2 balls of equal size and sprinkle sesame seeds evenly over the loaves and flatten into round circles.  Cover the doughs with a clean towel and let rise in warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Prick the top of each dough with a fork all over.  Bake for 10 minutes.

Lower heat to 375 degrees and bake an additional 15 to 20 minutes or until crusty and golden brown.

For the Vegetables:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Cut the eggplant into 1/4-inch round slices and sprinkle with salt, let sit in colander for 10 minutes until bitter juices are extracted.

Rinse the slices, and toss with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Roast the eggplant slices until they are tender and a little crisp.

Mix flour and cornmeal and season with spices, to your taste.  Coat each tomato slice with mixture and heat butter in heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron).  Add the tomatoes and cook until golden brown on both sides.  Drain on paper towels.

For the Harissa:  Process all the ingredients in a food processor.  Season, to taste, and reserve in a small bowl.

To assemble sandwich, spread 2 slices of Kesra with Harissa spread.  Place a layer of eggplant, then tomatoes on bottom slice.  Curly lettuce is optional.  Top with other slice of bread.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  baby lamb shoulder and leg -- cut 1 1/2" pieces
     1/2                lemon -- for rubbing lamb
     1/2                lemon -- zested and juiced
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2             slices  Parma ham -- shredded
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
     1/8           cup  flour
  1                cup  white wine
  3                     egg yolks
  2             sprigs  marjoram -- leaves removed,
                        and roughly chopped
  2             sprigs  flat-leaf parsley -- leaves removed,
                        and roughly chopped

Pat the lamb pieces dry.  Rub with half a lemon and season with salt and pepper.

In a large pan with a tight-fitting lid, heat the oil and butter over medium heat until foaming, then add the lamb and ham.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the lamb pieces begin to brown, then add the onion, and continue to cook until the lamb is nicely browned all over.

Sprinkle over the flour and stir to coat all the lamb.  Lower the heat and add the wine, then cover, and simmer until the lamb pieces are fork tender, about 30 minutes.

In a small bowl, beat together the yolks, lemon zest and juice, and the marjoram.  When the lamb is ready, slowly add the yolks to the pan, whisking constantly.  The sauce should be thickened and smooth.  Garnish with the parsley and serve right away.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     eggs -- separated
     2/3           cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  butter -- melted
  1                cup  sifted flour
  1              pinch  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dredging
  4                     bananas -- halved, and
                        split lengthwise
                        Peanut or vegetable oil -- for deep frying
                        === CHOCOLATE SAUCE ===
  6             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  4        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  spiced rum
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Mint leaves

In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, milk, and butter.  Add the flour, salt, and the sugar to the egg mixture, combine well, beat until mixture is smooth, and allow to rest in the refrigerator for about 2 hours.

In a dry clean bowl whip the egg whites until stiff, but not dry.  Fold the egg whites into the batter with a rubber spatula.

In a large heavy-bottom saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way, about 3 to 5 inches.

Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees.  Dredge the banana pieces in the confectioners' sugar then dip the pieces into the batter.  Deep-fry the bananas in batches until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes.

Drizzle with Chocolate Sauce.  Garnish with mint leaves.

For the Chocolate Sauce:  In a heavy bottom saucepan, put chocolate and water.  Over low heat, melt the chocolate, while stirring.  Boil the mixture for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and add the rum.  (Makes 1 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     skinless sea bass fillets - (7 oz ea)
                        Cajun Dry Spice Mix -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  8             slices  challah (loaf style, not braided)*
                        Mayonnaise -- as a dressing
                        Ketchup -- as a dressing
                        Grated horseradish in vinegar -- as a dressing

* Cook's Note:  If loaf challah cannot be found individual rolls: aqua bread, Kaiser, potato, or egg-bread rolls are all fine.  Also, cocktail sauce can be used instead of the ketchup and horseradish mixture.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Heat a skillet over high heat.  Dredge fish in spices and saute on both sides.  Finish the cooking in the oven, for about 4 or 5 minutes.

It is also wise to have all your windows open, and all your smoke alarms disconnected, considering the amount of smoke that this wonderful dish produces.

Toast the slices of challah and spread 4 of the slices with mayonnaise.  In a small bowl, mix some ketchup with some grated horseradish.  Spread this mixture on the other 4 slices of bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Deglaze with white wine.  Add chicken stock and heavy cream and the roasted calabaza.  Add the thyme.  Bring to a boil.  Simmer about 20 minutes.  Puree all the ingredients.  Strain the soup and adjust the seasonings.  Garnish with vanilla-flavored whipped cream, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  8             ounces  sweet unsalted butter
  2               cups  sugar
  7                     egg yolks -- beaten
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  heavy cream

  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

  6             ounces  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1                cup  rum
  1               pint  Port
  4               cups  Mixed Marinated Fruit -- (listed below),
                        squeezed, and finely chopped
                        === MIXED MARINATED FRUIT ===
  1              pound  black raisins
  1              pound  golden raisins
  1              pound  prunes -- cut in quarters
                        = (or eighths, depending on size)
  4                     cinnamon sticks
  2                     vanilla beans -- split
                        Jamaican white rum
                        Jamaican spiced rum
                        Port

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Mix in the vanilla, lime juice, and lime zest.  Add the eggs 1 at a time, and incorporate well.  Combine bread crumbs, flour, all the spices, baking powder, and salt.  Combine rum and port.  Add flour mixture alternately with rum/port mixture into the batter.  Fold in the chopped marinated fruit.

Prepare 1 (9-inch) cake pan or 2 spring form pans by lining bottom and sides with parchment paper.  Fill the pan 3/4 of the way and bake until a skewer comes out of the center of the cake clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.

For the Mixed Marinated Fruit:  Put raisins, prunes, cinnamon sticks, and vanilla beans in a glass jar and cover with mixture of equal parts Jamaican white rum, Jamaican spiced rum, and Port.  Cover with a tight fitting lid, label, and date the jar.  Put in a cool, dry cupboard.  From time to time, check the fruits to see if more liquor is needed, as the fruits will plump and soak up the liquid.

Keep the fruit covered in liquor.  It is best to allow the fruit to marinate for at least 1 month for best flavor.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable or olive oil -- for frying
  1                cup  water
  4             ounces  butter
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  3                     eggs
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        === CHOCOLATE DUNKING SAUCE ===
  4             ounces  dark chocolate -- chopped
  2               cups  milk -- divided
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  4        tablespoons  sugar

Prepare to fry the churros by heating 1 to 1 1/2 inches oil in a deep pan to 360 degrees.

To make churro dough, heat water, butter and salt to rolling boil in 3-quart saucepan; stir in flour.  Stir vigorously over low heat until mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute; remove from the heat.  Beat eggs all at once; continue beating until smooth and then add to saucepan while stirring mixture.

Spoon mixture into a piping tube with large star tip.  Squeeze 4-inch strips of dough into hot oil.  Fry 3 or 4 strips at a time until golden brown, turning once, about 2 minutes on each side.  Drain on paper towels.  Mix the sugar and cinnamon.  Roll churros in the cinnamon sugar.  Serve with Chocolate Dunking Sauce.

Chocolate Dunking Sauce:  Place the chocolate and half of the milk in a pan and heat on low.  When the chocolate has melted, dissolve the cornstarch in the remaining milk and whisk into the chocolate with the sugar.  Cook on low heat, whisking constantly, until the chocolate is thickened, about 5 minutes.  Add extra cornstarch if it does not start to thicken after 5 minutes.  Remove and whisk smooth.  Pour and serve in cups for dipping churros.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        === SERVING SUGGESTION ===
                        Whipped cream or ice cream

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Melt the 4 ounces of the butter in a nonstick, ovenproof 9-inch skillet.  Add the brown sugar, juice and spices and stir until sugar dissolves and liquid is bubbly.  Chill mixture, add the cranberries, and set aside.

In a small pan, melt 8 ounces of butter.  Remove from the heat and add the milk and egg.  Set aside.

In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.  Add the milk mixture and whisk until smooth.  Pour this mixture over the cranberries in the skillet.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean.

Let cake cool in pan for about 15 minutes then turn out onto plate (fruit will be on top and juice will be dripping down) and serve slices with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  crema fresca
                        = (or sour cream mixed with a little
                        water)
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  water
  2             pounds  yellow sweet plantains -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3" pieces
  8             ounces  queso blanco
  1 1/2           cups  corn oil

In a small bowl, combine the crema fresca and the cumin.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Bring the water to a boil and lightly salt it.  Add the plantain pieces, and cook until the slices are soft, about 15 minutes.  Drain the plantains, let cool, and push them through a ricer.  Form the mashed plantains into small golf-ball sized portions.  Refrigerate the plantanos until completely chilled and rested, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Line a tortilla press with plastic wrap, and press out each piece of dough.  Set aside until all the dough is used.

Place a small wedge of queso blanco in the center of each plantain circle.  Fold the dough around the cheese like an envelope.  Roll the package, sealing the edges and making sure the cheese is completely enclosed.

In a deep saucepot, heat enough oil to deep-fry the plantain packages.  When the oil reaches 375 degrees, fry the plantains until they are golden brown all over, about 2 minutes.  Drain the plantains on paper toweling.

Serve drizzled with the cumin-crema fresca sauce.

This recipe yields 16 hors d'oeuvres servings.

Recipe By     :Michelle Bernstein
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  baking potatoes -- like russets
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano Reggiano
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
                        === CREAMY LEMON SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1         tablespoon  flour
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2                     lemons -- zested
  1                cup  grated Parmesan

Cover potatoes in a large pot with cold water.  Bring the water to a boil until the potatoes are easily pierced with a skewer (30 minutes) do not over cook.  Drain potatoes and let stand until cool enough to handle.  Scrape the skin off the potatoes with a paring knife.  Press the peeled potato through a ricer.  Spread the riced potatoes into a thin even layer on a work surface.  Let cool completely.

In a small bowl, beat the egg, salt, pepper, and nutmeg together.  Gather the cold potatoes into a mound and form a well in the center.  Pour the egg mixture into the well.  Knead the potato and egg mixture together with both hands, gradually adding the grated cheese and enough flour, about 1 1/2 cups, to form a smooth but slightly sticky dough.  It should take no longer than 3 minutes to work the flour.  Use a knife or dough scraper to scrape the sticky dough from the work surface back into the dough as you knead.

Wash and dry hands.  Dust the dough, your hands and work surface lightly with remaining flour.  Cut the dough into 6 pieces and set off to one side of the work surface.  With 1 piece of dough, form a long rope using your hands in a back and forth motion.

Slice the rope into 1/2-inch pieces.  Press each piece into the tip of a fork, with your thumb roll the gnocchi off the fork.  Set on a baking sheet with flour.

Cook immediately in boiling salted water.  They are cooked when they rise to the surface, about 1 minute.  Toss in Creamy Lemon Sauce and serve.

Creamy Lemon Sauce:  Saute the minced garlic in butter on medium heat.  Add the flour.  Cook for 1 minute.  Add the cream and lemon zest.  After the gnocchi are cooked, toss in the sauce then top with Parmesan.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  tomato puree
  1              pound  Italian melting cheese -- coarsely grated
                        = (such as fontina)
  4             ounces  prosciutto di Parma
  1              small  red onion -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  capers
     1/2           cup  roasted red peppers -- drained, and
                        thinly sliced
  4             ounces  freshly-grated pecorino Romano
  4             ounces  bel paese -- sliced
     1/2           cup  jarred Italian eggplant
  4                     jumbo shrimp -- halved, deveined,
                        and grilled
  4                     basil sprigs, leaves only -- roughly torn
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- plus
                        more for greasing the pans
                        === GRILLED PIZZA DOUGH ===
  1 1/3           cups  lukewarm water
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  molasses
  2 1/2    tablespoons  kosher salt
  2 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
                        more for coating
  2               cups  bread flour
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  whole-wheat flour

Preheat a grill with coals on one half and bricks on the other (so that there is a hot and cool side).  Assemble all of your topping ingredients on a big platter.

Lightly oil a sheet pan and roll and stretch one ball of dough until it is approximately 12-inches in length and 8-inches across.  It is not necessary to make a perfect circle, but the dough should be an even thickness of 1/8-inch.  Carefully stretch the dough onto the hot side of the grill and cook until the dough puffs on top, crisps on the bottom, and grill marks appear, about 1 to 2 minutes.

Flip the dough onto the cool side of the grill and brush the cooked side with olive oil.  Quickly and sparingly assemble the toppings of your choice, such as tomato puree, fontina, and prosciutto di Parma, capers, and red peppers; or tomato puree, pecorino Romano, bel paese, grilled jumbo shrimp, and jarred Italian eggplant.  Garnish with torn basil leaves.  Feel free to improvise the toppings and come up with your own.

Once the pizza has been dressed, season it with salt and pepper, to taste, drag it over to the hot side of the grill, and cook until the ingredients are heated through.  (If the pizza browns too quickly, pull it to the cool side and cover the grill to finish cooking.)  Using a wide spatula or two pairs of tongs, carefully lift the pizza onto a cutting board and divide into 6 or 8 pieces.  Serve right away.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

For the Grilled Pizza Dough:  In a large bowl, combine the water, yeast, and molasses and stir gently to mix.  Set aside for five minutes until bubbly and foamy.  Add the salt, to taste, and oil and stir to mix.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flours.  Add the flours to the yeast mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until a dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.

Divide the dough into six equal pieces.  Roll into balls and place on an oiled baking pan.  Brush the balls with olive oil and cover with plastic wrap.  Let rise in a warm place for 20 minutes.

When the grill is ready, oil a second baking sheet and flatten one ball of dough into a 10- to 12-inch piece about 1/8-inch thick.  A perfect circle is less crucial than even thickness.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

Cook's Note:  Dough can be held for 1 day in the refrigerator.  Let sit 1 hour at room temperature before grilling.

             Grilled Seafood - {Frutti Di Mare Alla Griglia}

Recipe By     :Rocco DiSpirito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9             pounds  assorted Mediterranean fish and shellfish
                        = (such as branzino, dorade, and red
                        mullet, scaled and gutted; and
                        langoustines and large sea scallops,
                        shelled)
  8                     lemons -- juice 5, and
                        cut the other 4 in half
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for dressing fish
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             ounces  thyme sprigs
  10                    parsley sprigs -- roughly chopped

Preheat grill.

Rinse the fish inside and out and pat dry.  Place the fish and shellfish in a shallow plate and sprinkle on all sides with lemon juice.  Drizzle olive oil over everything and season inside and out with salt and pepper.  Stuff the whole fish with a few thyme sprigs.

When the grill is too hot to hold your hand 6-inches above the grill for more than a few seconds, it's ready.  Grill the fish without moving it until golden brown grill marks appear.  Turn it over and finish grilling on the second side; until the flesh is moist and opaque.  Some fish may take longer than others; check often and remove the fish as it finishes cooking.

To serve, arrange the cooked fish on a large serving platter and drizzle all over with extra-virgin olive oil.  Mix any leftover lemon juice with olive oil and coarse salt to make a dipping sauce.  Garnish with the parsley and lemon halves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  dry active yeast - (1/4 oz)
  1                cup  warm water - (abt 110 degrees)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                     egg -- beaten
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  milk -- scalded, but
                        cooled to warm
  6             ounces  melted butter -- divided
  5               cups  flour -- plus more as needed

In a standing mixing bowl with dough hook, dissolve yeast in warm water.  Let sit until lightly foamy, then stir in sugar and add egg, salt, warm milk, and 4 ounces of the butter.  Slowly add 5 cups flour, adding more as needed to make an elastic dough.  Mix well, then roll out to floured surface and knead dough for about 5 minutes.

Place dough in buttered bowl, cover with towel, and set in a warm place to rise until double in bulk, about 1 hour.

Lightly oil a 6-cup, 3-inch muffin tin pan.  Punch down dough and form dough into 1-inch balls.  Place 3 balls in each muffin tin.  Fill muffin pan, cover with towel, and allow to rise an additional 1/2 hour.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Brush with remaining melted butter.  Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden brown.

This recipe yields 24 to 30 rolls.

Recipe By     :Cheryl Smith
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6            bunches  fresh spinach -- stems removed,
                        and washed
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1             medium  red onion -- small diced
  2               cups  milk
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  grated Gruyere
  1 1/2           cups  fresh bread crumbs

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Bring a pot of water to a boil, add salt, to taste.  Blanch the spinach in the water for a few seconds, then transfer spinach in a strainer to a bowl of iced water to stop the cooking.  Squeeze excess water out of the spinach, and chop roughly.

Heat butter in a saucepan.  Add the flour and cook until a light tan color, making a blonde roux.  Add the onions and cook for 1 minute, then add the milk, nutmeg, salt, and pepper, and whisk to remove any lumps from the roux.  Bring to a simmer and cook for about 6 minutes.

Combine the spinach, bechamel, and adjust seasonings.  Fill 6 to 8 (4-ounce) gratin dishes with the creamed spinach.  Mix the cheese and breadcrumbs, and scatter over top of gratin.  Put the gratins in the oven, and cook until bubbling and golden on top, about 25 to 30 mintues.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lime -- halved, plus
  1                     lime -- sliced 8 pieces
  4              whole  Red Sea bream - (1 1/2 to 2 lbs ea) -- cleaned, scaled,
                        and scored
  6         tablespoon  Dry Jerk Rub -- (see recipe)
  8             sprigs  fresh thyme sprigs
  4        tablespoons  olive oil

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  broccoli rabe -- rough stems and
                        leaves trimmed
  1               head  fennel -- trimmed, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
  1                     red onion -- peeled, halved,
                        and thinly sliced
  16                    cherry tomatoes -- stemmed, halved
                        Leaves from 2 large basil sprigs -- plus
                        additional sprigs -- for garnish
  7        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
  4          teaspoons  balsamic vinegar -- plus
                        more for drizzling
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     wild striped bass fillets - (6 oz ea) -- skinned
  2                     preserved lemons -- quartered, as
                        garnish

Bring a large stockpot of water to boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt.  Set up an ice bath.  Cook the broccoli rabe in boiling water until it is bright green and tender, about 4 minutes.  Drain, cool in the ice bath, and drain again.  Set aside.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Lay out 4 (12-inch) pieces of foil out on a counter.  Put the fennel, onion, tomatoes, and basil in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil and a splash of vinegar.  Divide the vegetables between each sheet of foil, making a small mound.

Season the fish on both sides with salt and pepper, to taste, and place 1 on top of each pile of vegetables.  Drizzle each pile with a tablespoon of oil and 1 teaspoon of vinegar and use a second piece of foil on each, and roll up the sides, to seal the pouch completely.

Put the pouches on a sheet pan and cook in the oven for 9 minutes.  Turn the package over halfway through.  While the fish cooks, saute the broccoli rabe in a large saute pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil until it is hot throughout.

Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  To serve, put the pouches on each of four plates and open them at the table.  Garnish with basil sprigs and pass the broccoli rabe.

     1/4         pound  strip bacon -- cut 1/4" pieces
  1                cup  diced yellow onion
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped garlic
  3               cups  cut fresh okra in rounds
  2               cups  fresh corn kernels
  2                     fresh small red hot chiles -- chopped
  2               cups  cooked Black-Eyed Peas -- (listed below)
  1                cup  diced green onion
                        Salt -- to taste

                        === BLACK-EYE PEAS ===
  2               cups  black-eye peas
                        Water -- to cover
  1                     onion -- quartered, with
  1                     bay leaf -- attached with
  1                     clove
     1/2      teaspoon  ground black pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === OVEN DRIED CHERRY TOMATOES ===
  2               cups  cherry tomatoes -- halved
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Sprinkle brown sugar
  6                     thyme sprigs - (to 7)
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Freshly chopped parsley and Italian
                        parsley leaves

In a large saute pan, cook bacon until fat is rendered.  Remove bacon with slotted spoon and set aside.  Saute yellow onion and garlic in bacon drippings until soft.  Add okra, corn, and chile pepper and cook until tender, about 10 minutes.  Add black-eyed peas, green onion, and cherry tomatoes and cook an additional 5 minutes.  Season with salt, pepper and chopped parsley and toss in reserved bacon.

For the Black-Eye Peas:  Soak 2 cups beans overnight in water to cover.  Rinse the beans and place in a pot with enough water to cover the beans.  Add the onion and the black pepper.  Over high heat, allow to come to boil then reduce to simmer and cook for about 45 minutes or until beans are firm but cooked.  Season with salt.  Let the peas sit in this liquid for 15 minutes before draining.

For the Oven-dried Tomatoes:  Preheat oven to 250 degrees.

Place the cut cherry tomatoes on a sheet pan, cut-side up.  Season with salt, pepper, brown sugar, and sprigs of thyme.  Dry in the oven for 4 to 6 hours.  Check periodically to make sure they don't burn.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

In a large saute pan, cook bacon until fat is rendered.  Remove bacon with slotted spoon and set aside.  Saute yellow onion and garlic in bacon drippings until soft.  Add okra, corn, and chile pepper and cook until tender, about 10 minutes.  Add black-eyed peas, green onion, and cherry tomatoes and cook an additional 5 minutes.  Season with salt, pepper and chopped parsley and toss in reserved bacon.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Black-Eye Peas:  Soak 2 cups beans overnight in water to cover.  Rinse the beans and place in a pot with enough water to cover the beans.  Add the onion and the black pepper.  Over high heat, allow to come to boil then reduce to simmer and cook for about 45 minutes or until beans are firm but cooked.  Season with salt.  Let the peas sit in this liquid for 15 minutes before draining.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Oven-dried Tomatoes:  Preheat oven to 250 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the cut cherry tomatoes on a sheet pan, cut-side up.  Season with salt, pepper, brown sugar, and sprigs of thyme.  Dry in the oven for 4 to 6 hours.  Check periodically to make sure they don&apos;t burn.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === POTATOES ===
  2               cups  bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- plus
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste

  4             pounds  baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled, and
                        cut into fourths, lengthwise
  2               cups  shredded mozzarella
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
                        === STEAKS ===
  4                     porterhouse steaks - (12 oz ea)
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  dried oregano
  2        tablespoons  onion powder
  2        tablespoons  garlic powder
  2                     lemons -- halved

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

To make the potatoes, in a small bowl mix the bread crumbs, 1/2-cup olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper together.

Cover potatoes generously with bread crumb mixture.  Place slices on a sheet pan and cook potatoes for 1 hour.  After an hour, remove from the oven and sprinkle shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan on top of the potatoes.

To make the steaks, preheat the broiler.  Put the steaks in the broiler pan and coat on both sides with the olive oil, oregano, onion powder, and garlic powder.  Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper.

Broil the steaks for 5 minutes, then turn, and cook the second side for an additional 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove and let rest while you finish the potatoes.

Adjust the oven temperature to 400 degrees and put the potatoes back in.  Cook until the cheese is melted and beginning to brown, about 3 minutes.  Squeeze a half of lemon on each steak and serve with the potatoes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  water -- divided
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  aniseed
  12                    red or pink roses with open blooms -- petals removed
  1                     peeled red cactus fruit
                        = (or 2 red plums, skinned)
  12                    fresh chestnuts
  2        tablespoons  honey
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     boneless fresh quail
                        Olive oil -- as needed

Heat 2 cups of the water to boiling.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in large skillet, cook the garlic and aniseed for 5 minutes, and set aside.

Put the rose petals and cactus fruit in a blender and puree until smooth and set aside.

Cut an "x" over the flat ends of the chestnuts with a knife.  Toast the chestnuts in a hot cast-iron skillet for 5 minutes.  When the shells open, add the chestnuts to the boiling water and cook for 15 minutes.  Drain the chestnuts and allow them to cool.  Peel the chestnuts, add them to the rose petal mixture, and puree while adding the remaining cup of water, slowly.

Reheat the skillet with garlic butter mixture and add the rose petals puree.  Simmer for 10 minutes then whisk in the honey, salt, and pepper.

Push the sauce through a sieve, into a clean pan, pressing on the solids to extract the juice and some chestnut pulp.  Keep the sauce warm.

Preheat a grill or grill pan.

Drizzle the quails with olive oil and season with salt.  Grill the quails until they are medium-rare, about 5 minutes per side.  Serve with the Rose Petal Sauce.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  chopped onion
  1                cup  fresh bread crumbs
  2                     Granny Smith apples -- cored, peeled,
                        and chopped
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
  1                     orange -- zested
  1         tablespoon  caraway seeds
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             pounds  boned pork loin
  1                cup  apple cider
  1                cup  sour cream
  2             ounces  white wine

Melt the butter over low heat and cook onions until translucent, and then remove the onions from heat.  Fold in the bread crumbs, apples, raisins, orange zest, and caraway, and season with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Cut a pocket into the pork loin between the meat and outer layer of fat, the pocket should be shy of reaching each end of the loin by one inch.  Fill the pocket with the stuffing.  Roll loin up lengthways closing the stuffed pocket and tie with a string.  Score the rind of pork with a sharp knife.

Whisk together cider and sour cream and place in a casserole equal to the size of the pork.  Place pork in casserole rind-side down and bake for 30 minutes.

After 30 minutes turn pork over and cook, rind-side up, for another 30 minutes.

Reduce heat to 350 degrees and cook for another hour (baste every 20 minutes with the pan juices) or until you reach a internal temperature of 150 degrees.  Let rest for 20 minutes.

Deglaze the roasting pan with 2 ounces white wine and season.  Slice the meat and serve with the jus.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Reheat skillet, adding more oil if necessary.  Saute cod until almost done, add to vegetables.

Reheat the skillet.  Add the ketchup mixture, and bring to a boil.  Add back the vegetables and cod.  Stir in the rice, mixing well.  Keep moving the rice, like a stir-fry.

After a few minutes, add the crawfish, pigeon peas, and the scallions.  Season, to taste.  Scatter the shrimp on the top of the rice.  Cover the skillet and put it into the oven for about 15 minutes.  Cook until shrimp are opaque, and slightly curled.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

                Seared Pekin Duck With Chestnuts And Wine

Recipe By     :Rocco DiSpirito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  young Tuscan red wine
                        = (also known as "vino novello")
  1                cup  whole chestnuts -- peeled*
  4                     white Pekin duck breasts - (8 oz ea) -- skin on, and
                        excess fat trimmed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             pounds  Brussels sprouts -- trimmed of outer
                        leaves and sliced into three pieces from
                        stem to tip
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar

* Note:  To peel the chestnuts, score with an X on the flat side and cook in a pot of boiling water until the outer shell peels back.  Drain and remove the peel with a paring knife.

In a small saucepan, combine the wine and vinegar and reduce by half over medium heat.  Add the chestnuts and cook until they are cooked through and tender, about 10 minutes.  Set aside.

Heat a heavy bottom saute pan over medium heat and season the duck on both sides with salt and pepper.  Saute the duck breasts slowly skin-side down, draining the fat that accumulates in the pan into a bowl.  Reserve the fat.

When the fat has rendered off the duck breasts and the skin is golden brown and crispy, ladle the fat over the tops of the breasts to cook the other side for 2 or 3 minutes, for medium-rare meat.  Remove from heat and keep warm.

Drain all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan and increase the heat to high.  Add the Brussels sprouts and vinegar and cook until they are golden brown and tender.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

To serve, pile some Brussels sprouts in the center of a plate.  Slice the duck breasts into 5 pieces and lay on top of the greens.  Scatter some of the chestnuts about and drizzle the dish with the wine reduction.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

           Serrano Ham Wrapped Oysters With Chipotle Mayonnaise

Recipe By     :Aaron Sanchez
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres                  Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     egg yolk
  1                     garlic clove
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1                     chipotle pepper in adobo
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for searing
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  flour
  1           teaspoon  ground chile d' arbol powder
  6              whole  oysters -- shucked, bottom
                        shell washed, dried, and reserved
     1/2         pound  very very thinly-sliced serrano ham

In a food processor, add the egg yolk, garlic, lemon juice, and chipotle pepper.  Puree the ingredients, and with the machine running, slowly add the olive oil, until the mixture is fully emulsified.  Season the mayonnaise with salt and pepper, and set aside, refrigerated, until ready to use.

In a bowl, combine the flour, chile powder, salt, and pepper.

Dredge each oyster in the seasoned flour, and then wrap the oyster in a piece of serrano ham, covering the oyster completely.  Repeat until all 6 oysters are dredged and wrapped.

In a saute pan over medium-high heat, heat a little olive oil.  When the oil is smoking, sear the wrapped oysters, turning to crisp up the ham on all sides, about 4 minutes per side.

Place the crisped oysters back into the bottom halves of the oyster shells and place a dollop of the chipotle mayonnaise on each.

This recipe yields 6 hors d'oeuvre servings.

Caution: The American Egg Board states: There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell.

                        pounded with a mallet
                        Cajun Dry Spice Mix -- (see recipe)
                        Flour -- for dredging
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  water
                        === SMOTHER GRAVY ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  small diced onions
     1/4           cup  small diced red pepper
     1/4           cup  small diced celery
     1/4           cup  brunoised carrot
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  Cajun Dry Spice Mix -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  flour - (to 4)
  3               cups  unsalted chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Scallions -- sliced on the bias

In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way.

Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 360 degrees.

Season the pork with the Cajun spices, according to your taste.  Season the flour with salt and pepper.  Whisk the eggs until foamy and add water.

Prepare the pork by dredging in the flour, then dipping in the egg wash, then back in the flour again.  Fry the pork in batches, until crust is golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain on paper towels to remove any excess oil.  Serve with Smother Gravy and garnish with scallions.

Smother Gravy:  In a heavy bottom saucepan melt the butter over medium heat, add the onions, and cook for 1 minute before adding the red pepper, celery, carrots, garlic, and the thyme.  Cook over low heat for 5 minutes, until vegetables are tender.

Turn the heat up to medium and add the Cajun spices and flour.  Stirring constantly, saute until you can smell the spices and the flour starts to get a little golden.

Pour the chicken stock into the pan while stirring constantly with a whisk.  The gravy will start to thicken as it comes to a boil.  Add the Worcestershire and reduce the heat to low to prevent the gravy from burning.  Allow the gravy to simmer for 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  (Makes about 4 cups)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

       Spaghettini With Garlic And Oil - {Spaghettini Aglio E Olio}

Recipe By     :Rocco DiSpirito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  spaghettini
  6                     garlic cloves - (to 8) -- smashed
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced Italian parsley -- for garnish
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes -- for garnish
  1           teaspoon  salt

Bring a 6-quart pasta pot of water to boil over high heat and add 2 tablespoons of salt.  Add the pasta and stir well.  Try to time it so that the garlic is done when the pasta is al dente.  While the pasta cooks, reserve 1 cup of the pasta water to moisten the pasta at the end if necessary.

Heat a 10-inch saute pan over medium heat and add the olive oil.  Add the garlic and cook until golden brown, taking care not to let the garlic get too dark, about 2 minutes.  When the garlic is light brown, remove the pan from the heat, and add the parsley and red pepper flakes.

Drain the pasta and add it to the saute pan.  Toss, season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately in warmed bowls.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Bring a 6-quart pasta pot of water to boil over high heat and add 2 tablespoons of salt.  Add the pasta and stir well.  Try to time it so that the garlic is done when the pasta is al dente.  While the pasta cooks, reserve 1 cup of the pasta water to moisten the pasta at the end if necessary.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a 10-inch saute pan over medium heat and add the olive oil.  Add the garlic and cook until golden brown, taking care not to let the garlic get too dark, about 2 minutes.  When the garlic is light brown, remove the pan from the heat, and add the parsley and red pepper flakes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain the pasta and add it to the saute pan.  Toss, season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately in warmed bowls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  ground allspice
  2          teaspoons  ground mace
  1           teaspoon  ground cloves
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  sliced garlic
  10            sprigs  fresh thyme
     1/2        bottle  red wine - (350 ml)
                        === BEEF ROAST ===
  8             pounds  rolled rib-eye roast -- trussed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2              large  carrots -- roughly chopped
  2             medium  onions -- roughly chopped
  1                     garlic head -- peeled and smashed
  2                     celery stalks -- roughly chopped
  6             sprigs  fresh thyme
     1/2        bottle  red wine - (350 ml)

Mix all the marinade ingredients together in a strong plastic bag.  Put the roast into the bag and seal tightly.  Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 days turning the bag at least 2 times a day.

Remove roast from the marinade, and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour before browning.

Preheat oven to 275 degrees.

Heat oil in a large dutch oven over high heat.  Pat the roast dry of excess marinade.  Season the roast with salt and pepper, and sear on all sides until golden brown.

Remove the roast to a dish.  Heat the oil in the pan and saute the carrots, onions, garlic, celery, and thyme.  Add the red wine and any left over marinade to the vegetables, and bring it to a simmer.  Scrape up any bits in the bottom of the pot.

Place the roast back into the pot.  Cover the pot with a heavy lid and bake, half the total cooking time with the lid on, and half without.  Allow 20 minutes per pound of meat, or until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees, about 2 hours.

Add water to pot if it looks like its drying out too fast.  Remove the roast to a platter, and let rest for 15 minutes before carving.  Strain the gravy from the pot and put in a sauceboat.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Place greens in a mound in center of individual plates and arrange the sliced duck breasts around the outside.  Drizzle any extra dressing around the plate.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  1                     egg
     1/4           cup  dry bread crumbs
     1/2         pound  flank steak -- pounded flat
                        to 3" by 4" by 1/8"
  1                     French bread roll
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
     1/2                avocado -- cut into 4 slices
     1/2                tomato -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  mesclun greens
     1/2                red onion -- thinly sliced
  1                     pickled jalapeÒo

In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of oil.

In a shallow bowl, lightly beat the eggs.  In another shallow bowl, put the bread crumbs.  Dip the beef in the egg, then in bread crumbs, carefully coating both sides.

Saute the meat in the hot oil until the bread crumbs are browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side.  Remove the meat from the oil, but keep the skillet and oil warm.  Cut the meat into 1/2-inch strips.

Cut the roll in half lengthwise and pull out the soft center from both sides.  Cover the bottom side with mayonnaise and beef strips.  Place 4 ripe avocado slices on the other side and spread the slices, like a thick butter.  Layer 4 slices of tomato on top of the beef and cover with a mound of mixed greens, some sliced onion, and the pickled jalapeÒo.

Put the torta back in the skillet and brown the roll, pressing down with a spatula.  When brown on both sides, cut and serve.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Categories    : Chicken                         Hors D'Oeuvres
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              piece  fresh sugarcane stick - (12" long)
  1              pound  chicken fillets or the breast -- cut 1/2"-thk strips
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        === SANGO SAUCE ===
                        Olive oil -- for cooking
  1                     white onion -- chopped
  1                     red bell pepper -- chopped
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- chopped
  1                     cubanella pepper -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves
  4               cups  chicken stock
  1                     green plantain -- peeled, chopped
  1                cup  toasted shelled peanuts

Cut the sugarcane in half, forming 2 (6-inch) canes.  Then, cut the sugarcane lengthwise, into quarters, forming 8 skewers, about 1/8 of an inch thick.

Thread each piece of chicken onto a single sugarcane skewer.  Repeat the process with rest of skewers and chicken.  Place the skewers in a shallow bowl.

In a small bowl, combine the oil and garlic, mix well, and then pour the mixture over the chicken skewers let to marinate, covered and refrigerated, for at least 2 hours.

Meanwhile, make the sauce.  In a saucepot, over medium heat, pour a little oil.  Saute the onion, peppers, and garlic slowly, cooking for about 10 minutes.  Then, add the chicken stock, green plantains, and peanuts.  Cook this mixture until the plantains have become tender, about 20 minutes.  Remove the pot from the heat, and then, using an immersion blender or a food processor, puree the sauce.

Preheat a grill or the broiler.

Grill the chicken skewers until they are firm to the touch and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.  Serve with a side dish of the Sango Sauce, for dipping.

This recipe yields 8 hors d'oeuvres portions.

Thread each piece of chicken onto a single sugarcane skewer.  Repeat the process with rest of skewers and chicken.  Place the skewers in a shallow bowl.

<DirT>
Meanwhile, make the sauce.  In a saucepot, over medium heat, pour a little oil.  Saute the onion, peppers, and garlic slowly, cooking for about 10 minutes.  Then, add the chicken stock, green plantains, and peanuts.  Cook this mixture until the plantains have become tender, about 20 minutes.  Remove the pot from the heat, and then, using an immersion blender or a food processor, puree the sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat a grill or the broiler.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grill the chicken skewers until they are firm to the touch and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.  Serve with a side dish of the Sango Sauce, for dipping.

Recipe By     :Tanya Holland
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  sweet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  honey
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened, plus
  2             ounces  unsalted butter
  1                cup  milk
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/4           cup  creme fraiche
  2             ounces  caviar -- your choice
     1/2         pound  gravlax or other cured salmon -- sliced thinly
                        Dill sprigs -- for garnish

Place prepared sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with water.  Add 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Bring to a boil, and cook until the potatoes are tender and can be mashed easily with a fork.

Drain well and return to the saucepan.  Add the honey and 4 tablespoons of the butter and mash until smooth.  If possible, puree this mixture in food mill.

In a small bowl, combine the milk and eggs and stir in the sweet potato puree.  In another bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt and cayenne.  Add the dry ingredients to the sweet potatoes and stir until just blended.

Melt the remaining butter and reserve.

Heat non-stick skillets over medium-heat and coat with some of melted butter.  Drop sweet potato mixture into skillets in 1 1/2-tablespoon amounts.  Turn once, cooking until golden and crisp, about 1 minute per side.

Transfer to a large baking sheet.  Repeat the process with the remaining butter and batter.  The pancakes can stand at room temperature for 2 hours.  Reheat in a 325 degree oven for 5 minutes before serving.

To serve, arrange 3 blinis on a plate and garnish each with a slice of cured salmon, a dollop of creme fraiche and a small spoonful of caviar.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2               cups  graham cracker crumbs
     1/4           cup  confectioners' sugar
  8        tablespoons  melted butter
                        === CHEESECAKE ===
  2             pounds  cream cheese -- softened
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  5              large  eggs
  2                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  4                     sweet potatoes -- baked, peeled,
                        and passed through a food mill
                        === CANDIED PECANS ===
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  toasted pecans
                        Butter -- for greasing the pan

To make the Crust:  Mix the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter in a bowl.  Using a tablespoon, press this mixture into a 10-inch springform pan, and chill for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake crust for 10 minutes and allow to cool.  Butter or spray a pan with vegetable spray.

To make the Cheesecake:  Raise oven temperature to 450 degrees.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, place cream cheese.  Use paddle attachment and beat until smooth.  Continue to mix and add sugar and salt.  Add the eggs 1 at a time, then add sour cream, flour, and spices.  Lower speed and add sweet potato puree.

Pour the batter into crust lined pan.  Place a baking pan of hot water under cheesecake pan.  Bake for 15 minutes at 450 degrees, then lower temperature to 250 degrees and bake an additional 1 1/2 hours or until cake center is firm.

For Candied Pecans:  Melt the sugar and cook until temperature reaches 310 degrees.  Stir in nuts until completely coated.  Pour onto buttered baking pan.  Try to keep the nuts in individual pieces or pulse in food processor for praline effect.

Let the cake cool completely in pan on rack for 30 minutes, then wrap in plastic, still in pan, and refrigerate until completely chilled.  Loosen pan sides and remove cheesecake.  Carefully slice cake with knife dipped in hot water, then wiped.  Garnish with candied pecans.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SEMOLINA ===
  4             ounces  olive oil
  4             ounces  finely-ground semolina
  4             ounces  coarsely-ground semolina
  2             ounces  finely-chopped blanched almonds
                        Ground cinnamon -- to taste
                        === SYRUP ===
  12            ounces  water
  10            ounces  sugar
     1/2                lemon
  1           teaspoon  whole cloves
  1                     cinnamon stick

Heat oil in a medium pot on medium-high heat.  Add the semolinas and almonds and stir constantly until the semolina is cooked and golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Remove from heat.

In a small pot, mix the water, sugar, lemon half, cloves, and cinnamon.  Place on high heat and bring to a boil.  Turn heat to medium-high heat and simmer until sugar has dissolved, about 6 minutes.  Pass through a sieve and discard lemon and spices.

Carefully, pour the syrup over the semolina and stir until well blended.  Cover the pot and let sit to absorb, about 10 minutes.

Spoon the mixture into 3 1/2- to 4-ounce ramekins and let cool.  Unmold onto a plate and sprinkle with cinnamon.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Cat Cora
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  Roma tomatoes -- halved
  3             ounces  olive oil -- plus
  5             ounces  olive oil -- for frying
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped Calabrian chiles
  4             ounces  parsley -- finely chopped
  4             ounces  scallions -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped oregano leaves
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped basil leaves
  4             ounces  flour
  4             ounces  bread crumbs
                        = (panko preferably, but Italian is ok)
  1              pinch  granulated sugar -- if needed

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Place the tomatoes in a medium bowl.  Drizzle with 2 ounces of the oil and season with salt and pepper.  Place seed-side down on a lightly oiled baking sheet.  Place in the oven and bake until the skins wrinkle and the tomatoes are soft, about 30 to 40 minutes.

Remove from the oven and cool.  Peel the skins from the tomatoes and place in a colander over a bowl, to drain for about 20 minutes, occasionally pressing them to release juice.  Reserve tomato juice for a later dish.

Heat 1 ounce of the oil in a saute pan over high heat.  Add in the onions and cook until translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Add in garlic and chiles and cook for 1 minute.  Remove and cool.

In a medium bowl, combine the roasted tomatoes, parsley, scallions, oregano, and basil with the onion mixture.  Add in the flour and bread crumbs and season with salt and pepper.  Add more bread crumbs, if needed.  Add sugar if tomato mix is acidic.  Shape mixture into 2-ounce patties.

Heat the remaining 5 ounces of oil in a medium skillet over high heat to reach 375 degrees.  Turn heat to medium-high heat and place the patties into the skillet in small batches.  Cook on both sides until golden brown.  Add more oil as needed.  Remove patties and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt while warm.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped white onion
  2 1/2         pounds  ground beef
  4          teaspoons  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/4           cup  fresh basil chiffonade
  2        tablespoons  capers
     3/4           cup  currants
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped green olives

  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  salt
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
                        === DOUGH ===
  4               cups  cornmeal
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  5        tablespoons  salt
  3        tablespoons  butter
  4               cups  boiling water
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  4                     banana leaves
                        Grilled pineapple wedges -- for accompaniment
                        === ROASTED RED PEPPER COULIS ===
  2                     red peppers -- roasted, and
                        skin, ribs, and seeds removed

In a large saute pan, heat the oil and cook garlic and onions until soft and translucent.  Add beef and cook until meat is browned.  Add remaining ingredients and cook for 20 minutes.

Put cornmeal, sugar, salt, and butter in medium mixing bowl and pour over enough boiling water to make mixture moist enough to spread.

To assemble Pastelles:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cut washed and dried banana leaves into 8-inch squares.  Lightly oil each square.  Spread 1 tablespoon of corn dough in center of leaf.  Top with 2 tablespoons of filling.  Fold banana leaves and close in envelope style.

Steam filled leaves for 1 hour on a rack-lined baking sheet with water coming half way up sides; maintain the water level.  Garnish with grilled pineapple wedges and Roasted Red Pepper Coulis.

For the Roasted Red Pepper Coulis:  Puree and emulsify the coulis.

This recipe yields 12 to 14 pastelles; 4 to 6 servings.

                        === POUND CAKE ===
  1              pound  cake flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1              pound  unsalted butter -- softened
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  9                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
                        Peach liqueur
                        = (or maracino, a Cuban cherry liqueur)
                        === PASSION FRUIT PASTRY CREAM ===
  4               cups  milk -- divided
  1                     vanilla bean -- split

  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  2             ounces  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  passion fruit puree
                        === MACERATED TROPICAL FRUIT ===
  6               cups  diced assorted fruit
                        = (pineapple, mango, kiwi, star fruit,
                        papaya, lychee, etc)
     1/4           cup  super fine sugar
                        === CHANTILLY CREAM ===
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Candied ginger -- as a garnish

Make the trifle in a 9-inch round trifle bowl.

Cut each pound cake round in half, horizontally into layers, so that you have 4 thin slices.  Begin with by putting a slice of cake at the bottom of the glass.  Spritz or drizzle the cake with a little peach liqueur.

Fill a pastry bag with the Passion Fruit Pastry Cream and pipe it on top of the cake.

Then add about 2 cups of the Macerated Tropical Fruit.  Repeat this layering until you reach the top of the glass, finishing with a slice of cake.

Top with the Chantilly Cream and garnish with candied ginger.

For the Pound Cake:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.  Cream the butter and the sugar until light and fluffy.  Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in the extract and zest.  Fold the dry ingredients by hand.  Divide the batter into 2 greased 8-inch rounds, lined with parchment paper.  Bake until golden brown and springy to the touch, about 1 hour.

For the Passion Fruit Pastry Cream:  Mix the flour and the sugar together.  In a heavy bottom saucepan start heating 3 cups of the milk and the vanilla bean over medium heat.  In a bowl whisk together remaining 1 cup of milk with the egg yolks, then add the flour and the sugar and whisk until smooth.

As soon as the milk comes to a boil, pour about a third of the milk mixture into the eggs.  Stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Then add the mixture back into the pot.  Stirring constantly until the custard thickens.

As the custard starts to bubble, you should stir more vigorously to take out any lumps that form.  Boil the custard for about 1 minute to allow the flour to cook out.  Remove pasty cream from the heat into a clean bowl, and fold in the butter and the passion fruit puree.  Put a piece of plastic wrap right on the top of the pastry cream and refrigerate until completely chilled, about 2 to 3 hours.  (Makes about 6 cups)

For the Chantilly Cream:  Whip all ingredients together until soft peaks form.

For the Macerated Tropical Fruit Salad:  Toss cut fruit with sugar and set aside for 30 minutes

This recipe yields 16 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  cassavas or yucca -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" by 3" wedges
  1                     red onion -- halved, and
                        sliced thinly into half moons
  2                     garlic cloves
     1/2         bunch  Italian parsley
     1/2         bunch  cilantro
  2                     limes -- juiced
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

In a pot of boiling water, cook the yucca until tender, but not falling apart and losing its shape, about 10 minutes.  Remove the yucca from the water, and dunk into an ice bath to stop the cooking process (shocking) and set aside.

Meanwhile, make the mojo.  In a blender, place half of the red onion, garlic, parsley, cilantro, and lime juice.  Start to puree and slowly drizzle in the olive oil.  When well pureed, season with salt and pepper and set aside.  Julienne the remaining half of the onion.

Heat 2 inches of oil in a deep cast-iron skillet to 375 degrees.  Begin frying the partially cooked yucca until golden brown, about 5 minutes.

When uniform in color, remove the yucca from the oil and place in a bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  Pour the mojo over the yucca, and garnish with the other half of the red onion.

This recipe yields 2 servings.
