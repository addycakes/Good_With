  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
     3/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  3              large  egg yolks
  1 1/2    tablespoons  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Steamed cut-up fresh vegetables, such as
                        red-skinned potatoes, carrots, zucchini,
                        fennel bulbs, cauliflower and green beans
  6                     hard-boiled eggs -- shelled, each
                        cut into 4 wedges

Using mortar and pestle, mash garlic with salt until almost smooth.  Transfer mixture to processor.

Whisk 6 tablespoons oil, lemon juice, egg yolks and 1 1/2 tablespoons water in small metal bowl.  Set bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water (do not allow bowl to touch water).  Whisk constantly until thermometer inserted into mixture registers 140 degrees for 3 consecutive minutes, about 9 minutes total.  Cool slightly.  Transfer to processor with garlic.

With machine running, gradually add remaining 3/4 cup oil in thin steady stream and blend until thick (if oil is added too quickly, mayonnaise will separate and become runny).  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to small bowl.  (AÔoli can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Place bowl of aÔoli on platter.  Surround with vegetables and eggs.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  3        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
  4        tablespoons  ice water -- (about)
                        === FILLING ===
  6                     bacon slices -- cut into 1/2" pieces
     1/2           cup  chopped shallots
  8             ounces  arugula -- stems trimmed, and
                        leaves coarsely chopped - (abt 5 1/2 cups)
  2          teaspoons  balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  whipping cream
  3              large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  shredded GruyËre cheese - (abt 2 1/2 oz)

For crust:  Blend flour and salt in processor.  Add butter and shortening.  Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Mix in enough ice water to form moist clumps.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill until dough is firm enough to roll out, about 30 minutes.

Roll out dough on floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Trim dough overhang to 1 inch.  Fold overhang in and press, forming double-thick high-standing sides.  Pierce crust all over with fork.  Freeze crust 30 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep frozen.)

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Bake crust until golden brown, piercing with fork if crust bubbles, about 20 minutes.  Transfer crust to rack.  Reduce temperature to 375 degrees.

For filling:  Cook bacon in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 5 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels and drain.  Add shallots to same skillet and sautÈ until tender, about 2 minutes.  Add arugula and sautÈ until just wilted, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Add balsamic vinegar; toss to combine.

Sprinkle arugula mixture, then bacon over crust.  Whisk cream, eggs, salt and pepper in large bowl to blend.  Stir in cheese.  Pour mixture into crust.

Bake quiche until filling is slightly puffed and golden, about 35 minutes.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Cut into wedges.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Quiche made its way from France to our shores in the sixties, but it was in the seventies that its popularity soared.

     1/3           cup  finely-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     bacon slices -- cut into 1/2" pieces
  4                     green onions, white parts only -- thinly sliced

Steam asparagus until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.  Drain.

Whisk eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in large bowl to blend well.

SautÈ bacon pieces in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Add sliced green onions and sautÈ until onions are translucent, about 3 minutes.  Add cooked asparagus; sautÈ until heated through.

Reduce heat to medium.  Spread asparagus mixture in single layer in skillet.  Pour egg mixture over asparagus.  Cook until eggs are very softly set, tilting skillet, gently running rubber spatula around edges and allowing uncooked egg portion to flow underneath, about 4 minutes.

Tilt skillet and slide omelet out onto plate, folding omelet in half.  Cut omelet into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings as an appetizer.

            Baked Artichokes With Crab And Sourdough Stuffing

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
  1                cup  finely-chopped red bell pepper
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
  2                     celery stalks -- finely chopped
  8                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3               cups  fresh breadcrumbs -- made from
                        crustless sourdough bread
  8             ounces  crabmeat
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              large  artichokes - (abt 1 lb ea)

Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add bell pepper, onion, celery and garlic.  SautÈ until onion is translucent, about 6 minutes.  Transfer to large bowl and cool completely.  Mix in breadcrumbs and crabmeat.  Season stuffing with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Cut off top third of each artichoke; discard.  Cut off stem.  Pull out yellow and small purple-tipped leaves from center.  Using melon baller, scoop out fibrous choke.

Gently pull leaves outward from center until leaves open slightly.  Pack stuffing into each artichoke cavity and between first and second center layers of leaves, mounding slightly.  Place artichokes in 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish.  Add enough water to come 3/4 inch up sides of dish.  Cover with foil.  Bake artichokes until outer leaf pulls away easily, about 1 hour 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Artichokes, an Old World food, came to America with Italian immigrants and found a happy home in the near-Mediterranean climate of California.  As "ethnic" fare, artichokes took their time catching on outside the Golden State.  They finally did in the thirties and became something of a fad.  Artichokes were not limited to the vegetable course, either.  Sometimes the center "choke" was scooped out and the hollow filled with a stuffing for a fashionable light lunch entrÈe.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beans                           Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  spicy brown mustard
  1         tablespoon  apple cider vinegar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/4           cups  Coca-Cola -- or more if needed
  3               cans  assorted beans - (15 to 16 oz ea) -- drained
                        = (such as kidney, black and pinto beans)
  6                     bacon slices -- quartered crosswise

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Oil 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass baking dish.

Mix first 5 ingredients in large bowl.  Stir in 1 1/4 cups Coca-Cola.  Add beans; stir to blend.  Transfer to prepared dish.  Top bean mixture with bacon pieces.

Bake until bacon is crisp and bean mixture is hot and bubbling, about 1 hour.  If mixture is dry, pour 1/4 cup more Coca-Cola over bean mixture to moisten.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Coca-Cola was invented in the late 1800s by Atlanta pharmacist John Styth Pemberton, and it really hit its stride after the turn of the century.  The company has introduced several variations over the years (Diet Coke, Cherry Coke and the short-lived New Coke), but Coca-Cola Classic has always been the big seller.  And it has made its way into quite a few recipes, including a Coca-Cola cake and a Coke-glazed baked ham.  Here it adds a sweet caramel note to a simple version of baked beans.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    chicken thighs with skin and bones -- (abt 3 3/4 lbs)
  1                can  crushed tomatoes with added puree -- (14 1/2 to 16 oz)
     1/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  3        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4           cup  Frenchís mustard

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Remove skin from chicken thighs and discard.  Place thighs close together in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.

Whisk next 7 ingredients in saucepan over medium heat until mixture boils.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in mustard.  Pour sauce evenly over chicken.

Bake chicken uncovered until cooked through, brown and glazed, turning and basting with sauce every 30 minutes, about 1 hour 30 minutes total.  Cool 5 minutes and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A century ago, spicy English mustards like Colman's were too pungent for American tastes, even in small quantities: Back then, mustard was used only in salad dressings.  George French came along in 1904 with a formula for a milder condiment he called Frenchís Cream Salad Mustard.  Eventually slathered on everything from bologna sandwiches to soft pretzels, Frenchís mustard is also delicious in this barbecue sauce.

Comments:  A century ago, spicy English mustards like Colman&apos;s were too pungent for American tastes, even in small quantities: Back then, mustard was used only in salad dressings.  George French came along in 1904 with a formula for a milder condiment he called Frenchís Cream Salad Mustard.  Eventually slathered on everything from bologna sandwiches to soft pretzels, Frenchís mustard is also delicious in this barbecue sauce.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Egg Dishes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  hard-boiled eggs -- peeled
     1/4           cup  purchased tartar sauce
  1         tablespoon  spicy brown mustard (such as Guldenís)
  1 1/4      teaspoons  Tabasco or other hot pepper sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Paprika

Cut eggs in half lengthwise.  Scoop out yolks; place in small bowl.  Add tartar sauce, mustard and Tabasco; mash with fork.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spoon mixture into egg white halves, dividing equally.  Sprinkle with paprika.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Cover; chill.)

This recipe yields 8 appetizer servings.

Comments:  The seeds of the Mexican tabasco chili were planted on Avery Island, Louisiana, in the mid 1800s, and in 1868, former New Orleans banker Edmund McIlhenny began experimenting with them.  He created Tabasco sauce by mixing mashed chilies with salt, letting them age in oak barrels, then adding vinegar.  Tabasco is so popular today that it often appears on restaurant tables right next to the salt and pepper.  A good dose of the stuff puts the devil in these eggs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2          pound  beef tenderloin -- well trimmed,
                        meat cut into 2" by 1" by 1/2" strips
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped shallots
  1              pound  small button mushrooms -- thickly sliced
  1                cup  canned beef broth
  2        tablespoons  Cognac
     3/4           cup  crËme fraÓche or whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh dill
  12            ounces  egg noodles - (wide)
  1         tablespoon  paprika

Pat meat dry with paper towels.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat until very hot.  Working in batches, add meat in single layer and cook just until brown on outside, about 1 minute per side.  Transfer to rimmed baking sheet.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chopped shallots and sautÈ until tender, scraping up browned bits, about 2 minutes.  Add button mushrooms.  Sprinkle with pepper and sautÈ until liquid evaporates, about 12 minutes.  Add beef broth, then Cognac.  Simmer until liquid thickens and just coats mushrooms, about 14 minutes.

Stir in crËme fraÓche and Dijon mustard.  Add meat and any accumulated juices from baking sheet.  Simmer over medium-low heat until meat is heated through but still medium-rare, about 2 minutes.  Stir in chopped dill.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, cook noodles in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 8 minutes.  Drain.  Transfer to bowl.  Add remaining 4 tablespoons butter and toss to coat.  Season with salt and pepper.  Divide noodles among plates.  Top with beef and sauce.  Sprinkle generously with paprika.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This Russian dish has been around for several centuries, but it wasnít until the fifties that it became all the rage in the United States (despite our fear of Communism).  Here is a delicious rendition that pays tribute to the "gourmet" chafing-dish dinner party.  Now, as then, beef stroganoff is a good thing to cook in front of a small crowd.

Comments:  This Russian dish has been around for several centuries, but it wasnít until the fifties that it became all the rage in the United States (despite our fear of Communism).  Here is a delicious rendition that pays tribute to the &quot;gourmet&quot; chafing-dish dinner party.  Now, as then, beef stroganoff is a good thing to cook in front of a small crowd.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/2           cup  whipping cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  brandy
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  6        tablespoons  ground toasted hazelnuts
  1 1/2           cups  hazelnuts -- toasted, chopped

Place chocolate in medium metal bowl.  Bring cream to simmer in small saucepan.  Pour over chocolate; let stand 2 minutes.  Whisk until smooth.  Mix in brandy and vanilla.  Cool completely, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Using electric mixer, beat chocolate mixture until fluffy and lighter in color, about 4 minutes.  Mix in 6 tablespoons ground hazelnuts.  Cover and refrigerate truffle mixture until firm, about 2 hours.

Line baking sheet with waxed paper.  Place 1 1/2 cups chopped nuts in another medium bowl.  Fill glass with hot water.  Dip 1-inch-diameter melon baller into water, then into truffle mixture, forming round truffle.  Drop truffle into nuts; roll to coat completely and press to adhere.  Place on prepared sheet.  Repeat with remaining truffle mixture and nuts.  Cover and chill until firm, about 1 hour.  (Can be made 2 days ahead; keep chilled.)

This recipe yields about 30.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  head garlic
  2        tablespoons  dry red wine -- plus
  2               cups  dry red wine
  4                     thick bacon slices -- cut 1"-wide strips
  3 1/2         pounds  boneless beef cross-rib roast -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" pieces
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1              large  carrot -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  3              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  3              large  fresh sage sprigs
  3              large  fresh rosemary sprigs
  2                     bay leaves
  3               cups  canned beef broth -- or more if needed
  12            ounces  pearl onions
  3            bunches  baby carrots -- trimmed, peeled
  12            ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, quartered
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place garlic on large piece of foil.  Pour 2 tablespoons wine over garlic.  Wrap foil around garlic to enclose.  Roast garlic until soft, about 40 minutes.  Cool.  Press garlic between fingertips to release from skins; set aside.

Cook bacon in large pot over medium heat until brown, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to paper towels.  Pour drippings into small bowl.  Return 2 tablespoons to same pot; reserve remainder.  Increase heat to high.  Working in batches, add beef to pot and brown, about 7 minutes per batch.  Using slotted spoon, transfer meat to large bowl.

Reduce heat to medium-low.  Add chopped onion and chopped carrot to pot; sautÈ 5 minutes.  Mix in flour.  Return beef and accumulated juices to pot.  Stir in tomato paste.  Add herb sprigs, bay leaves, roasted garlic and 2 cups wine; simmer 15 minutes.  Add 3 cups broth.  Cover; simmer 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.  Uncover; simmer until meat is tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours longer.  Discard herb sprigs and bay leaves.

Cook pearl onions in large saucepan of boiling salted water for 2 minutes.  Using 4- to 5-inch-diameter strainer, transfer onions to medium bowl; cool slightly, then peel.  Return water to boil.  Add carrots and cook until tender, about 4 minutes.  Drain. Transfer to bowl of ice water to cool.  Drain.  (Bacon, stew and vegetables can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and refrigerate.)

Heat 2 tablespoons reserved bacon drippings in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms; sautÈ until golden brown, about 6 minutes.  Add pearl onions to mushrooms; sautÈ until onions are golden, about 4 minutes.  Add carrots; cook until heated through, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Bring stew to simmer, thinning with more broth, if desired.  Stir bacon and 2/3 of vegetables into stew.  Transfer to large bowl.  Top stew with remaining vegetables.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  On the first show of her series "The French Chef," Julia Child taught viewers to make this staple of French bourgeois cuisine.  Roasted garlic, baby vegetables and wild mushrooms bring the dish right up to date.

  3              small  bay leaves
  3               cups  canned beef broth
  2               cups  dry red wine
                        Chopped celery leaves

Stir flour and allspice in medium bowl to blend. Sprinkle short ribs all over with salt and pepper.  Add 6 ribs to flour mixture and turn to coat.  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add floured ribs; sautÈ until brown, turning occasionally, about 6 minutes.  Transfer to large bowl.  Repeat flouring and browning with remaining 6 ribs; reserve remaining flour-coating mixture.

Add 1 tablespoon oil to pot.  Add onions, carrots and celery stalks; sautÈ until vegetables begin to brown and are very tender, scraping bottom of pot often, about 30 minutes.

Add garlic, thyme and caraway seeds to pot; stir 1 minute.  Mix in tomatoes and bay leaves.  Return ribs and accumulated juices to pot, arranging ribs in single layer.  Add broth and wine.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until meat is almost tender, about 1 hour.

Uncover pot.  Simmer ribs 30 minutes, occasionally spooning fat from surface; reserve 2 tablespoons fat.  Stir reserved flour-coating mixture and reserved 2 tablespoons fat in small bowl until smooth; mix paste into sauce around ribs.  Simmer until meat is very tender and gravy thickens, about 45 minutes longer.  Season with salt and pepper.

Transfer short ribs and gravy to large bowl.  Sprinkle with celery leaves.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Tiring of the ultra-refined nouvelle cuisine that epitomized eighties dining, cooks rediscovered the comforting humble cuts such as short ribs and shanks.  Orecchiette pasta or mashed potatoes are great to catch the gravy.

                 Brie, Roquefort And Wild Mushroom Fondue

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  olive oil
  4             ounces  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, caps diced
  1                     shallot -- minced
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  12            ounces  chilled 60% (double crËme) Brie cheese -- (do not use
                        triple crËme)
  2             ounces  chilled Roquefort cheese
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     crusty white bread loaf - (13 oz) -- cut 1 1/2" cubes
                        Vegetables, such as carrot sticks,
                        blanched broccoli, cauliflower and boiled
                        small potatoes

Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms, shallot and thyme; sautÈ until mushrooms just begin to soften, about 2 minutes.

Place flour in large bowl.  Cut rind from Brie; discard rind.  Cut Brie into cubes; drop into flour.  Toss to coat; separate cheese cubes.  Crumble Roquefort into same bowl; toss to coat.

Place wine in heavy medium saucepan and bring to simmer over medium heat.  Add cheese by handfuls, stirring until melted after each addition.  Continue stirring until smooth.

Stir mushroom mixture into fondue.  Season with generous amount of pepper.  Transfer to fondue pot.  Set pot over candle or canned heat burner.  Serve with bread and vegetables.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  While fondue originated in the French-speaking part of Switzerland (the word means "melted" in French), the dish has become an international favorite.  The principal ingredients are cheese (usually GruyËre mixed with either Emmenthal or Appenzeller), white wine, kirsch and garlic.  But there are as many variations on that theme as there are mountains in Switzerland.

  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        === PORK ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  2                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced - (abt 2 cups)
     3/4           cup  canned low-salt chicken broth
     1/2           cup  apple cider
     1/4           cup  Calvados or apple brandy
  2        tablespoons  raisins
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/3           cup  whipping cream

For brine:  Combine first 7 ingredients in large bowl.  Stir until sugar and salt dissolve.  Add pork chops to brine.  Top with plate to submerge pork.  Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 2 days.

For pork:  Drain brine from pork chops.  Pat pork dry.  Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat.  Add pork and cook until brown but not cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer pork to plate.

Reduce heat to medium.  Add onion to same skillet.  Cover and cook until onion is soft, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Add apples and sautÈ until pale golden, about 3 minutes.  Stir in broth and cider, then Calvados, raisins and ginger, scraping up browned bits from bottom of skillet.  Add cream and mustard.  Bring sauce to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Add pork.  Cover; cook 3 minutes.  Turn pork over and cook until thermometer inserted into center of pork registers 150 degrees, about 3 minutes longer.  Transfer pork to plates.

Simmer sauce until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes longer.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Spoon sauce over pork and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Pork, always a favorite in the Midwest and the South, gained popularity early in the century.  Immigrants from pork-loving countries such as Germany and Poland were crowding the cities and finding that fresh pork, a luxury back home, was abundant and affordable.  Recipes of the time called for pan-frying chops, covering them with apples and baking them for an hour or so.  But that would leave todayís pork, which is less fatty, very dry.  Here, brining is the trick for making pork chops flavorful and juicy.

Comments:  Pork, always a favorite in the Midwest and the South, gained popularity early in the century.  Immigrants from pork-loving countries such as Germany and Poland were crowding the cities and finding that fresh pork, a luxury back home, was abundant and affordable.  Recipes of the time called for pan-frying chops, covering them with apples and baking them for an hour or so.  But that would leave todayís pork, which is less fatty, very dry.  Here, brining is the trick for making pork chops flavorful and juicy.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1                     garlic clove -- pressed
  1                     anchovy fillet -- mashed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Romaine leaves - (small)
                        Assorted fresh vegetables

Mix first 6 ingredients in small bowl.  Season dip with salt and pepper.

Serve with lettuce and vegetables.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings as appetizers.

Comments:  Over the Fourth of July weekend in 1924, a group of unexpected guests arrived at Caesarís Palace restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico.  Running low on food, the owner, Caesar Cardini, threw together a salad with ingredients he had on hand.  He made a thick dressing with a coddled egg, garlic-flavored oil, lemon juice, grated cheese and Worcestershire, which added a taste of anchovy.  This dip has all the flavors of that first Caesar salad, and romaine lettuce and fresh veggies are nice "dippers."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  sweet paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  fennel seeds -- crushed
  4                     halibut fillets - (6 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4          teaspoons  butter

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Mix first 7 ingredients in small bowl.  Place fillets on baking sheet.  Brush on both sides with 1 tablespoon oil.  Sprinkle top of each with seasoning.

Heat heavy large skillet (preferably cast-iron) over high heat until very hot.  Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil; swirl to coat.  Place fillets, seasoned-side down, in skillet.  Cook until very brown on bottom, 1 minute.  Return fillets, browned-side up, to baking sheet.  Place in oven; bake until just opaque in center, about 8 minutes.  Top each with 1 teaspoon butter.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A nod to what could arguably be the dish of the eighties, blackened redfish.  The technique works equally well with halibut.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  1              large  red onion -- thinly sliced
  1              large  red bell pepper -- thinly sliced
     1/2                fennel bulb -- cored, sliced thin
  2          teaspoons  herbes de Provence -- see * Note
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  8                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  sour cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  drained capers
  18            slices  olive bread, 4" by 1 1/2" by 1/4" thk

* Note:  A combination of dried thyme, basil, savory and fennel seeds can be substituted for herbes de Provence.

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and next 4 ingredients.  Cover; cook until vegetables release their juices, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes.  Uncover; sautÈ until juices evaporate, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic; cook until vegetables are very tender and just beginning to brown, about 12 minutes longer.  Cool completely.

Puree vegetable mixture and sour cream in processor until almost smooth.  Season generously with salt and pepper.  Transfer to bowl.  Sprinkle with capers.

Preheat broiler.  Arrange bread slices on baking sheet.  Brush both sides of bread slices with 1/3 cup oil.  Toast about 2 minutes per side.  Cool.  Serve with spread.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Leaping off the backs of onion-soup-mix boxes and showing up at cocktail parties everywhere, Liptonís sour cream-and-onion dip took the country by storm.  Convenient and quick, the dip also tasted great on potato chips, without which, in the fifties anyway, it wasnít a party.  These days it isnít a party without little toasts topped by something Mediterranean -- hence this zesty update.

Comments:  Leaping off the backs of onion-soup-mix boxes and showing up at cocktail parties everywhere, Liptonís sour cream-and-onion dip took the country by storm.  Convenient and quick, the dip also tasted great on potato chips, without which, in the fifties anyway, it wasnít a party.  These days it isnít a party without little toasts topped by something Mediterranean -- hence this zesty update.

                Carrot Cake With Maple-Cream Cheese Icing

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2               cups  sugar
  1 1/4           cups  canola oil
  4              large  eggs
  3               cups  grated peeled carrots
  1 1/4           cups  coarsely-chopped walnuts
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled ginger
                        === ICING ===
  10            ounces  cream cheese (such as Philadelphia) -- room temperature
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  2 1/2           cups  powdered sugar
     1/4           cup  pure maple syrup
  12                    walnut halves -- for garnish

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter two 9-inch-diameter cake pans.  Line bottom of pans with waxed paper.  Butter and flour paper; tap out excess flour.

Whisk flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in medium bowl to blend.  Whisk sugar and oil in large bowl until well blended.  Whisk in eggs 1 at a time.  Add flour mixture and stir until blended.  Stir in carrots, walnuts and ginger.  Divide batter between prepared pans.

Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans 15 minutes.  Turn out onto racks.  Peel off waxed paper; cool cakes completely.

For Icing:  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and butter in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Add powdered sugar and beat at low speed until well blended.  Beat in maple syrup.  Chill until just firm enough to spread, 30 minutes.

Place 1 cake layer on platter.  Spread with 3/4 cup icing.  Top with second layer.  Spread remaining icing over entire cake.  Arrange walnut halves around top edge.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome; chill.  Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before serving.)

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  A standard at health food restaurants across the country, carrot cake was ubiquitous in the seventies.  Grated carrots made it a nutritious choice, or so the thinking went.  This ultra-moist version is updated with a maple icing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  minced celery
     1/4           cup  minced green onion
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  dry mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper - (generous)
  1              pound  fresh crabmeat
  2 3/4           cups  fresh breadcrumbs -- made from
                        crustless French bread
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Lemon wedges

Mix first 7 ingredients in medium bowl.  Mix in crab.  Mix in enough breadcrumbs (about 2 cups) to form mixture that barely holds together.  Spread remaining breadcrumbs on baking sheet.

Shape crab mixture into eight 3/4-inch-thick patties.  Coat crab cakes with remaining breadcrumbs, pressing to adhere.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead; keep refrigerated.)

Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 4 crab cakes; reduce heat to medium and cook until brown, about 4 minutes per side.  Wipe skillet clean.  Repeat with remaining butter, oil and crab cakes.

Transfer crab cakes to plates.  Serve crab cakes immediately with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 8 appetizer or 4 main-course servings.

Comments:  From coast to coast, diners in the eighties showed an insatiable appetite for crab cakes.  Some chefs deep-fried them; others spiced them with Old Bay Seasoning.  But the best crab cakes, like the ones here, let the sweet flavor of the crab predominate.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  1              pound  chicken livers -- trimmed
  1                cup  canned low-salt chicken broth
  1              small  onion -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  Cognac
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  dry red wine
     3/4           cup  dried black Mission figs
     1/2           cup  chopped toasted walnuts

                        Red leaf lettuce -- for garnish
  1                     French-bread baguette -- sliced, toasted

Spray 3-cup soufflÈ dish or terrine with vegetable oil spray.  Line dish with plastic wrap; spray plastic.

Combine chicken livers, broth and onion in medium saucepan.  Bring to boil.  Cover and simmer until livers are cooked through, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes.  Drain cooking liquid; transfer chicken livers and onion to processor.  Add butter, Cognac and salt to processor.  Puree until smooth.  Transfer to prepared dish.  Cover and refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours.

Bring wine to simmer in small saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add figs.  Let stand until figs soften, about 15 minutes.  Drain wine.  Quarter figs.  (P‚tÈ and figs can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Keep p‚tÈ refrigerated.  Transfer figs to small bowl; cover and refrigerate.)

Unmold p‚tÈ onto platter.  Press walnuts onto sides of p‚tÈ.  Garnish top with chives and some figs.  Arrange lettuce on platter with p‚tÈ.  Place remaining figs atop lettuce.  Serve with toasts.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  By the seventies, Julia Child, through her books and television shows, had made French food accessible, and the Cuisinart, introduced in 1973, made many of the cuisineís more complicated techniques quick and simple.  As a result, p‚tÈ became increasingly popular, and remains so today.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lemon -- halved
  12                    baby artichokes
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     chicken - (3 1/2 lbs) -- cut into 8 pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  20                    pearl onions -- blanched 1 minute in
                        boiling water, and peeled
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  water
  3              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley

Squeeze juice from lemon halves into large bowl; add lemon halves.  Fill bowl with water.  Trim stem of 1 artichoke.  Starting at base, bend leaves back and snap off where they break naturally, continuing until all tough outer leaves have been removed.  Using small sharp knife, trim outside of base until smooth and no dark green areas remain.  Cut artichoke in half lengthwise; cut out any choke.  Add to lemon water.  Repeat with remaining artichokes.

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.  Working in batches, add chicken to pot and brown well on all sides, about 12 minutes per batch.  Transfer chicken to plate.

Drain artichokes.  Add artichokes and pearl onions to pot and sautÈ until onions are golden, about 6 minutes.  Add vinegar and stir until evaporated, about 3 minutes.  Stir in 1/2 cup water, garlic and bay leaves.  Arrange chicken atop vegetables.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.  Cover; simmer until chicken is tender, about 30 minutes.  Discard bay leaves.

Transfer chicken and vegetables to platter.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                   Chipotle Beef Chili With Lime Crema

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chili                           Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  ground beef
  3               cups  chopped onions
  6                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  chili powder
  2               cans  beef broth - (14 1/2 oz ea)
  1                cup  canned crushed tomatoes with added puree
     1/2           cup  stout or dark beer
  2        tablespoons  minced canned chipotle chilies
  2        tablespoons  yellow cornmeal
  2               cans  black beans - (15 1/2 oz ea) -- drained, rinsed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  grated lime peel
                        Corn tortilla chips

Heat heavy large pot over high heat.  Add beef; sautÈ until cooked through, breaking up meat with spoon, about 8 minutes.  Transfer to large bowl.

Add onions and garlic to same pot.  SautÈ until onions are tender, 8 minutes.  Add chili powder.  SautÈ until fragrant, 3 minutes.  Add beef, broth, tomatoes, stout and chilies.  Cover partially; simmer until chili is thick, stirring often, about 1 hour 10 minutes.

Gradually stir cornmeal into chili Stir in beans.  Simmer until heated through.  Season generously with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Rewarm over medium heat.)

Whisk sour cream, lime juice and lime peel in small bowl.  Season with salt.

Spoon chili into bowls.  Spoon lime crema atop chili.  Serve with chips.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  A typical chili of the depression years consisted of cheap meat stretched by even cheaper beans.  Chili remained modestly popular even when the hard times waned, until Lyndon Johnson boosted its national profile during the 1960s.  Now chili is back and bigger than ever.  Even with the modern addition of smoked jalapeÒos (chipotles), the inclusion of black beans and beer, and a stylish drizzle of lime crema, this recipe is a classic-hot, hearty and filling.

                    Chocolate Chunk And Pecan Cookies

Serving Size  : 18    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  butter -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
  1              large  egg
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped pecans
  6             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Mix first 4 ingredients in medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat butter, brown sugar, vanilla and almond extract in large bowl until blended.  Add egg; beat until fluffy.  Beat in flour mixture.  Stir pecans and chocolate pieces into dough.

Using 2 tablespoonfuls dough for each cookie, drop dough mounds onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.  Press tops slightly to flatten.

Bake cookies until edges begin to brown but centers are still soft, about 13 minutes.  Let cool on sheets 2 minutes.  Transfer cookies to racks; cool completely.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 18 cookies.

Comments:  In 1933, Ruth Wakefield of the Toll House Inn in Whitman, Massachusetts, chopped up some chocolate bars and added the chunks to cookie dough, hoping that they would blend into the dough as they melted.  Instead they held their shape, and Toll House cookies were a delicious creation.  By the 1940s they were a hit.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped
  1                     container plain low-fat yogurt - (8 oz)
     2/3           cup  water - (about)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2               cups  cake flour
  2               cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Rocky Road Frosting -- (see recipe)
  1 1/2           cups  miniature marshmallows
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped walnuts

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line bottom of pans with parchment; butter parchment.  Dust pans with flour; tap out excess.

Stir chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water until melted and smooth.  Remove from over water.  Cool just to room temperature.

Pour yogurt into 2-cup measuring cup.  Add enough water to measure 1 1/2 cups; whisk to blend.  Whisk in vanilla.

Combine flour, sugar, butter, eggs, baking soda, baking powder and salt in large bowl.  Add yogurt mixture and melted chocolate.  Using electric mixer, beat until smooth, occasionally scraping bowl with rubber spatula, about 3 minutes.  Divide batter between prepared pans.  Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.

Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Run small knife around sides of pans to loosen cakes.  Invert onto racks; peel off parchment.  Cool completely.

Place 1 cake layer, flat-side up, on platter.  Spread 2/3 cup frosting over.  Top with second cake layer, flat-side down.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake.  Press marshmallows around top edge in 1-inch band and 1 inch down sides from top edge of cake.  Sprinkle walnuts over center of cake.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome and store at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Cake making was quite a fad in the twenties.  The new gas stoves were efficient, reliable and easy to operate; besides, with more women working outside the home, there wasnít as much time to prepare multiple desserts, so fancy layer cakes were made to satisfy everyone.  Marshmallows were popular in the decade, and they were used in desserts, salads and side dishes.  Here they sweeten an old-fashioned frosting and decorate this easy-to-make chocolate cake.

  2             ounces  good-quality white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt or Bakerís)

Stir bittersweet chocolate and butter in large metal bowl set over saucepan of simmering water until smooth.  Remove from over water.  Stir in 6 tablespoons liqueur.  Cool to room temperature, whisking occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Beat 1 cup cream with 2 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl to soft peaks.  Fold into chocolate mixture.  Toss 2 cups berries with remaining 3 tablespoons liqueur in small bowl.  Divide berry mixture among 6 wine-glasses.  Spoon mousse over.  Arrange remaining 1 cup berries around edge of mousse in glasses.  Cover and refrigerate until set, about 2 hours.

Stir white chocolate and 2 tablespoons cream in medium metal bowl set over saucepan of barely simmering water until melted and smooth.  Remove the bowl from over water.  Cool chocolate to room temperature.

Beat remaining 6 tablespoons cream in another medium bowl to soft peaks.  Fold cream into white chocolate mixture.  Refrigerate mixture until firm, about 1 hour.  Pipe or dollop the white chocolate cream atop center of each mousse.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Sinfully rich chocolate mousse was introduced to Americans by Julia Child on television during the sixties.  The combination here of fresh berries, white chocolate cream and dark chocolate mousse has timeless appeal.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  finely-chopped walnuts - (scant)
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  3               cups  Bisquick (buttermilk baking mix)
     3/4           cup  buttermilk
  1              large  egg
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  powdered sugar
  5          teaspoons  whole milk -- or more if needed
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Mix walnuts, 4 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon in small bowl.  Mix Bisquick and 2 tablespoons sugar in large bowl; add buttermilk and egg and stir until sticky dough forms.

Turn dough out onto work surface sprinkled with Bisquick; knead 6 to 8 turns until smooth.  Roll out dough to 12- by 9-inch rectangle.  Spread 2 tablespoons butter over, then sprinkle with walnut-sugar mixture, leaving 1-inch border on all sides.  Starting at 1 long side, roll up jelly-roll style.  Press roll to flatten slightly.  Transfer, seam-side down, to ungreased baking sheet.

Using sharp knife, make crosswise cuts 3/4 of the way into roll along 1 long side, spacing cuts 1 inch apart.  Shape roll into ring, with cuts facing outward; pinch ends together to seal.  Turn cut slices to lie almost on their sides.

Bake cake until deep golden brown and baked through, about 25 minutes.  Cool 10 minutes on sheet.

Stir 2 tablespoons butter in small saucepan over medium heat until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in powdered sugar, 5 teaspoons milk and vanilla, adding more milk by teaspoonfuls if icing is too thick.  Drizzle icing over warm cake.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Bisquick got its start in the early thirties when Carl Smith, a salesman for General Mills, took a late-night train ride.  He went to the dining car in hopes of finding something to eat, and was pleasantly surprised to be served freshly made biscuits.  When he asked about them, the chef confessed that he kept a pre-mixed batch of ingredients for the dough in the freezer for late orders.  Smith reported back to General Mills, suggesting that they market such a mix, and they did.  But itís not just for biscuits; Bisquick can be used to make pancakes and waffles, and this luscious coffee cake, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1              large  egg -- separated
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
                        === FILLING ===
  3           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  1 2/3           cups  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice -- plus
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
  2          teaspoons  grated lime peel
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon peel
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  sour cream
     2/3           cup  orange marmalade
                        Orange slices
                        Fresh mint sprigs

For Crust:  Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 425 degrees.  Butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2-inch-high sides.

Whisk egg yolk, lemon juice, lemon peel and vanilla in small bowl to blend.  Blend flour and sugar in processor.  Add butter and process until coarse crumbs form.  With machine running, add yolk mixture and blend until moist clumps form.  Press dough onto bottom and 1 1/2 inches up sides of prepared pan.  Freeze crust 10 minutes.

Whisk egg white until foamy.  Brush crust lightly with some egg white.  Bake until crust is pale golden, about 15 minutes.  Cool on rack while preparing filling.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

For Filling:  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in large bowl until smooth.  Add sugar; beat until well blended.  Beat in 2 tablespoons cornstarch, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, all citrus peel and vanilla.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating just until blended after each addition.  Beat in sour cream.

Pour filling into crust.  Bake cake until puffed and cracked around edges and center moves only slightly when pan is gently shaken, about 55 minutes.  Remove from oven.  Run small knife around sides of pan to loosen cake.  Cool cake in pan on rack.  Refrigerate cake overnight.

Boil marmalade and 2 teaspoons lemon juice in saucepan until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes.  Spread warm glaze atop cake.  Chill cake 10 minutes.  Remove pan sides.  Transfer cake to platter.  Garnish with orange and mint.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  While the cheesecake has been around for centuries, it was perfected in the 1920s by New York delicatessens.  It first appeared at Arnold Reubenís eponymous restaurant on East 58th Street and soon was featured at Lindyís on Times Square and at Juniorís in Brooklyn.  Marmalade tops this luscious cake; it also has citrus peel in the filling.

                  Classic Saganaki With Olives And Lemon

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  kasseri cheese or Pecorino Romano - (8 oz) -- cut 1/2"-thick
                        rectangular slices
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed
  3        tablespoons  olive oil - (about)
     1/2                lemon
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh oregano
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Tomato wedges
                        Pita wedges
                        Kalamata olives

Rinse cheese slices under cold water (do not pat dry).  Coat with flour.  Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until almost smoking.  Add cheese and cook until beginning to brown, about 1 minutes per side.  Transfer to plates.

Squeeze lemon over cheese; sprinkle with oregano and pepper.  Serve with tomatoes, pita and olives.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Ouzeries are Greek cafÈs that specialize in mezedes, or appetizers, as well as in ouzo, the strong, anise-tinged drink after which the cafÈs are named.  Saganaki gets its name from the two-handled pan in which it is made, but it can be prepared in any heavy small skillet.  For a final flourish, the cheese is often splashed with ouzo and flamed.

                   Coffee Baked Alaska With Mocha Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1              quart  coffee ice cream -- softened
  1                     frozen pound cake - (10 3/4 oz)
  4              large  egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1           teaspoon  coffee liqueur
     1/3           cup  sugar
                        === SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  freshly-brewed strong coffee
  10            ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  coffee liqueur

For Cake:  Line 9- by 5- by 2 1/2-inch metal loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving overhang.  Spoon ice cream into prepared pan, spreading evenly and smoothing top.  Cut cake horizontally in half.  Arrange 1 cake piece, cut-side down, atop ice cream and against 1 corner of pan.  Cut remaining cake piece into strips and arrange in pan to cover ice cream completely.  Cover with overhanging plastic and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours.

Uncover cake.  Invert onto metal or other ovenproof platter.  Freeze while preparing meringue.  Beat egg whites in large bowl until foamy.  Add cream of tartar.  Beat until soft peaks form.  Beat in liqueur.  Gradually add sugar, beating until stiff glossy peaks form.  Spread meringue over cake, covering cake completely and sealing meringue to platter.  Freeze overnight.

For Sauce:  Combine coffee and semisweet chocolate in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until mixture is smooth.  Increase heat to medium.  Simmer until sauce thickens, about 2 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Stir in coffee liqueur.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Keep cake frozen.  Cover sauce and refrigerate; rewarm sauce over medium-low heat before serving.)

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 500 degrees for 20 minutes.  Bake dessert until meringue is lightly browned and just set, about 3 minutes.

Cut baked Alaska into slices; arrange on plates.  Spoon warm sauce around dessert and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Invented in the 1800s, the baked Alaska was possibly named to commemorate America's purchase of that northern territory.  The dessert was a big hit in the fifties because convenience was a watchword, and for all the showy effect it created at the table, baked Alaska was not difficult to make.  Restaurants served ornately decorated versions under flaming cascades of liqueur, while home cooks could just bake it in the oven.  Either way, the magic was there -- a layer of meringue kept the ice cream inside from melting in the oven.  These days, store-bought premium ice creams help baked Alaska taste even better and offer a wide range of flavor options.

             Crab Salad With Sun-Dried Tomato Louis Dressing

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  mayonnaise
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped drained oil-packed
                        sun-dried tomatoes
     1/4           cup  milk
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  tomato paste
     1/4      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  1              pound  asparagus -- trimmed to 5"
                        lengths
  12              cups  bite-size pieces romaine lettuce -- (lightly packed
                        from 2 heads)
  1              pound  lump crabmeat
  1                cup  cherry tomatoes
  2              large  hard-boiled eggs -- cut into wedges
                        Lemon wedges

Whisk first 9 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.

Cook asparagus in saucepan of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain.  Transfer to bowl of ice water; cool.  Drain.  (Dressing and asparagus can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Place lettuce in large bowl.  Toss with enough dressing to coat.  Mound lettuce on plates.  Top with crab.  Garnish with asparagus, tomatoes, eggs and lemon.  Pass remaining dressing separately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Itís unclear just who the Louis of Crab Louis salad fame was; perhaps he was affiliated with the Olympic Club in Seattle, where opera star Enrico Caruso, who visited there in 1904, is said to have fallen in love with the crab salad.  San Francisco also claims the dish, which reached its zenith there in the teens, as a specialty at Solariís restaurant and at the St. Francis Hotel.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  garlic cloves
  1 3/4           cups  pitted Kalamata olives or
                        other brine-cured black olives
  4                     anchovy fillets
  1 1/2    tablespoons  drained capers
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3               cups  chopped onions
     1/4           cup  minced peeled fresh ginger
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  curry powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  plain yogurt
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  3               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
  1                cup  unsweetened applesauce
  4             pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/2"-thick slices
  1            package  frozen peas - (10 oz)
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  canned unsweetened coconut milk -- see * Note
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Fresh cilantro sprigs
                        === FOR SERVING ===
                        Steamed white rice
                        Major Grey mango chutney
                        Sliced peeled bananas
                        Chopped pitted peeled mangoes
                        Shredded unsweetened coconut
                        Chopped toasted peanuts

* Note:  Available at Indian, Southeast Asian and Latin American markets and at many supermarkets.

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add onions and sautÈ until golden, about 15 minutes.  Add ginger and garlic; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add curry, cumin and cinnamon; sautÈ until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add flour, then yogurt and tomato paste, whisking until sauce is smooth, about 1 minute.  Add broth and applesauce.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat; simmer until sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Cover and chill.  Bring to simmer before continuing.)

Add chicken and peas to sauce.  Simmer until chicken is almost cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Add sour cream and coconut milk.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Stir until chicken is cooked through and sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, about 3 minutes (do not boil).  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to bowl.  Garnish with cilantro sprigs.

Place rice, chutney, bananas, mangoes, coconut and peanuts in separate bowls.  Serve alongside curry.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Serve the curry with steamed white rice and Indian beer, and make a stop at an Indian restaurant to get some samosas -- savory filled pastries -- to pass as appetizers, and the flatbread called naan to sop up the curry sauce.  For dessert, how about assorted teas and a carrot cake?

             Devil's Food Cake With Creamy Chocolate Frosting

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  water
  1                cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
     3/4           cup  buttermilk
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  1              large  egg
  1              large  egg white
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Creamy Chocolate Frosting -- (see recipe)

Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter two 9-inch-diameter pans with 1 3/4-inch-high sides.  Dust with flour; discard excess.  Bring 3/4 cup water to boil in medium saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in cocoa to form paste.  Cool slightly.  Add buttermilk; whisk until blended.

Whisk flour and next 3 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar and next 4 ingredients in large bowl until light, about 5 minutes.  Beat in cocoa mixture.  Add dry ingredients and beat just until blended.  Divide batter between prepared pans.

Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on rack 10 minutes.  Turn cakes out onto racks; cool.

Place 1 cake layer on platter.  Spread about 2/3 cup Creamy Chocolate Frosting over.  Top with second layer.  Spread remaining frosting over entire cake.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome; let stand at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  At the turn of the century, folks were feeling devilish, no longer satisfied with angel food cake, the evangelical treat of the late 1800s.  They wanted chocolate and plenty of it, and devil's food cake filled the bill.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  Sherry wine vinegar
  1 1/2           cups  fresh orange juice
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1 1/2           cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
  4              large  oranges
  2                     boneless Muscovy duck breast halves -- (1 lb ea), thawed
                        if frozen
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  2        tablespoons  grated orange peel

Stir sugar and water in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; boil until syrup turns deep amber, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, 8 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Mix in vinegar (mixture will bubble vigorously).  Add juice and shallots; boil until reduced to 1/2 cup, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes.  Add broth; boil until reduced to 3/4 cup, 30 minutes.  Set aside.

Using small knife, cut off peel and white pith from 4 oranges.  Working over bowl, cut between membranes to release segments.  (Sauce and oranges can be prepared 6 hours ahead.  Cover separately; chill.)

Using small knife, score duck skin (do not pierce meat) in crosshatch pattern.  Sprinkle duck with salt and pepper.  Heat heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Place duck breasts skin-side down in skillet.  Cook until brown and crisp, about 8 minutes.  Turn duck and cook to desired doneness, about 10 minutes longer for medium-rare.  Transfer to cutting board.  Let stand 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring sauce to simmer.  Add butter and 1 tablespoon grated orange peel; whisk just until butter melts.  Drain orange segments and mix into sauce.  Set aside.

Slice duck breasts crosswise on diagonal.  Arrange on 4 plates.  Spoon orange segments with sauce alongside.  Sprinkle with remaining peel.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  One of the dishes that introduced Americans to French food.  This version calls for duck breasts and a simple reduction sauce.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Mix olive oil, minced garlic and dried crushed red pepper in small bowl.  Place pizza crust on rimless baking sheet.  Sprinkle grated mozzarella cheese over all but 1-inch border of crust.  Top mozzarella with chopped tomato, then oregano, sliced sausages, chopped green onions and grated Parmesan, in that order.  Drizzle garlic-oil mixture over pizza.

Bake pizza until crust edges are crisp and brown and cheese melts, about 15 minutes.  Sprinkle pizza with minced fresh parsley.  Cut pizza into wedges and then serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Wolfgang Puck gets the credit for redefining pizza at his trend-setting Spago restaurant in West Hollywood.  The inventive pizzas came topped with everything from goat cheese and Black Forest ham to artichokes and exotic mushrooms.  Duck sausage pizzas, like this one, were a real hit.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR CRUST ===
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  solid vegetable shortening -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
  2        tablespoons  ice water - (about)
                        === FOR FILLING ===
  1              pound  fresh ripe figs - (abt 10) -- quartered
  4        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  fresh raspberries
  1              large  egg yolk -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for glaze

Make crust:  Mix flour and salt in processor.  Add shortening and butter.  Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Mix in water 1 tablespoon at a time just until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Roll out dough between 2 layers of plastic wrap to 12-inch round.  Remove top layer of plastic.  Invert dough onto unrimmed baking sheet.  Remove top layer of plastic.

Make filling:  Combine figs and 3 tablespoons sugar in large bowl; toss to coat.  Toss raspberries with 1/2 tablespoon sugar in medium bowl.  Arrange figs in concentric rows over dough on baking sheet, leaving 2-inch border around edges.  Sprinkle raspberries over figs.  Fold dough border over fruit, pleating loosely and pinching to seal any cracks.  Brush dough border with egg mixture.  Sprinkle border with 1/2 tablespoon sugar.

Bake galette until crust is brown and filling bubbles, about 35 minutes.  Transfer baking sheet to rack and cool galette slightly, about 20 minutes.  Slide spatula under all sides of crust to free galette from baking sheet.  Using large tart pan bottom as aid, transfer galette to platter.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Seasonal fruits star in a lovely rustic dessert.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  solid vegetable shortening -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  6        tablespoons  ice water - (about)
                        === FILLING ===
  5             pounds  Golden Delicious apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2"-thick slices
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick)
  1                cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/4      teaspoons  Chinese five-spice powder -- see * Note
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar

* Note:  Chinese five-spice powder is sold in the spice section of most supermarkets.

For Crust:  Mix first 3 ingredients in large bowl.  Add shortening; cut in using pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture resembles coarse meal with a few pea-size pieces.  Mix in enough ice water by tablespoonfuls to form moist clumps.  Gather dough.  Divide into 2 pieces, 1 slightly larger than the other.  Flatten each into disk.  Wrap each disk in plastic; chill at least 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Let dough soften slightly at room temperature before rolling out.)

For Filling:  Toss apples and lemon juice in large bowl.  Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add apples and brown sugar; cook until apples are just tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, return apples to same bowl.  Boil juices in pot until thick, about 15 minutes.  Pour juices over apples; cool completely.  Mix in flour and five-spice powder.

Position rack in lowest third of oven; preheat to 375 degrees.  Place baking sheet on rack.  Roll out larger dough disk on floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch glass pie dish; trim overhang to 1 inch, if necessary.  Spoon filling into crust.  Roll out smaller dough disk to 10-inch round.  Drape over filling.  Press top and bottom edges of dough together; crimp decoratively.  Cut small hole in center of crust. Brush crust with cream.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon sugar.

Place pie on baking sheet in oven; bake until crust is golden brown and filling bubbles thickly, about 1 hour 5 minutes.  Transfer pie to rack and cool.  Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  By the time Crisco came out in 1911, apple pies had long been an American classic.  But Crisco, the first hydrogenated vegetable shortening, gave cooks a boost.  Here was a shelf-stable alternative to perishable butter and lard.  While a lot of consumers were skeptical of Crisco, many early sales were generated by Orthodox Jews, who bought the shortening after a recipe booklet was published in Yiddish showing how Crisco could be used without breaking kosher dietary laws.  Its success was assured when rationing made lard scarce during World War I.

Comments:  By the time Crisco came out in 1911, apple pies had long been an American classic.  But Crisco, the first hydrogenated vegetable shortening, gave cooks a boost.  Here was a shelf-stable alternative to perishable butter and lard.  While a lot of consumers were skeptical of Crisco, many early sales were generated by Orthodox Jews, who bought the shortening after a recipe booklet was published in Yiddish showing how Crisco could be used without breaking kosher dietary laws.  Its success was assured when rationing made lard scarce during World War I.

                            French 75 Cocktail

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  gin
     1/4           cup  Cointreau or Triple Sec
  1 1/4      teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  6                     thin strips lemon peel -- yellow part only
  1             bottle  brut champagne - (750 ml) -- chilled

Mix first 3 ingredients in measuring cup.  Divide among 6 champagne glasses.  Add 1 lemon strip to each.  Fill with champagne.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This intoxicating champagne cocktail was named after a French 75-millimeter gun used in World War I.  Many American bartenders claimed to have invented the drink.  One recipe, from 1919, called for absinthe, Calvados and gin, but no champagne.  Supposedly, the champagne version was introduced at Harry's New York Bar in Paris in 1925.  Or the cocktail might have originated with American soldiers in Paris, who added gin and liqueur to champagne to crank up its potency.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  22                    chocolate wafer cookies
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  whole milk
  1              pinch  salt
  3              large  egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  6             ounces  good-quality white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Bakerís or Lindt)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  green crËme de menthe
  2        tablespoons  light crËme de cacao
     3/4           cup  chilled whipping cream
                        Shaved white and dark chocolates

For Crust:  Spray 9-inch-diameter glass or ceramic pie dish with nonstick spray.  Finely grind chocolate cookies and sugar in processor.  Blend in butter.  Press crumb mixture onto bottom and up sides of prepared dish.  Freeze.

For Filling:  Combine milk and salt in heavy small saucepan.  Bring to simmer.  Whisk egg yolks and cornstarch in medium bowl to blend well.  Gradually whisk in hot milk mixture.  Return mixture to same saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until mixture thickens, about 6 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Add white chocolate and butter; whisk until smooth.

Transfer custard to large bowl.  Whisk in crËme de menthe and crËme de cacao.  Set custard over another large bowl of ice water until cold and thick but not set, stirring often, about 30 minutes.

Whip cream in medium bowl until stiff peaks form.  Stir 1/3 of whipped cream into custard.  Fold in remaining whipped cream.  Pour filling into crust.  Freeze at least 5 hours or up to 2 days.

Garnish with shaved chocolates.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Inspired by the creamy mint-chocolate after-dinner drink, grasshopper pie was a hostess's dream: Composed of only a handful of ingredients, it took just minutes to assemble; then it could be stored in the freezer until serving time.  Here is an updated rendition -- with white chocolate instead of the original marshmallows -- that is every bit as cool and minty as its predecessor.  Those who don't want a grasshopper-green dessert can substitute clear ("white") crËme de menthe for the colored liqueur.

                Goat Cheese And Watercress Tea Sandwiches

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  11            ounces  soft fresh goat cheese - (2 logs) -- room temperature
                        = (such as Montrachet)
     1/2           cup  chopped watercress leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
  16                    thin slices cinnamon-raisin, date or
                        whole-wheat sandwich bread -- crusts trimmed
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (about) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped toasted pecans
                        Watercress sprigs -- for garnish

Mix cheese and chopped watercress in medium bowl.  Season with salt.  Spread mixture evenly over 8 bread slices.  Top with remaining bread.  Butter edges of sandwiches.  Cut sandwiches diagonally in half.  Place pecans on plate.  Dip buttered edges of sandwiches into pecans.  Arrange sandwiches on platter.  Garnish with watercress sprigs.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Cover sandwiches tightly; chill.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The genteel ladiesí tea, at which guests wore hats and white gloves and nibbled tiny sandwiches, was very much a part of home entertaining during the thirties.  Borrowed from the British, it was a trend that flickered and then died out, but has now come back in homes and hotels across the country.  These modern tea sandwiches are more savory than sweet, and would go well with a glass of Sherry if youíre in need of something a little stronger than Earl Grey.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  6             ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed and sliced
  6             ounces  oyster mushrooms -- sliced
     3/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
  3        tablespoons  chopped shallots
     1/2           cup  Madeira
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1              pound  fresh green beans -- trimmed
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  2              large  leeks, white and pale green parts only -- sliced thin
                        crosswise
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add all mushrooms and thyme; sautÈ 5 minutes.  Add 2 tablespoons shallots; sautÈ until mushrooms are tender, about 3 minutes.  Add Madeira and simmer until almost all liquid evaporates, about 2 minutes.  Add cream and simmer until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.  Set sauce aside.

Cook beans in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, 5 minutes.  Drain.  Transfer to bowl of ice water; cool.  Drain.  (Sauce and beans can be made 6 hours ahead.  Cover separately; chill.)

Pour enough oil into large deep saucepan to reach depth of 4 inches.  Heat oil to 350 degrees.  Place 1/4 of leeks in small metal strainer.  Lower strainer into oil; fry until golden, 40 seconds.  Lift strainer from oil.  Drain leeks on paper towels.  Repeat with remaining leeks in 3 more batches.  Season leeks with salt.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add beans and remaining 1 tablespoon shallots; toss to heat through.  Season with salt and pepper.  Place beans on platter.

Bring sauce to simmer.  Spoon sauce over beans.  Sprinkle with fried leeks.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Remember the green bean casserole made with nothing but convenience ingredients: frozen or canned green beans, canned cream of mushroom soup and, for the topping, canned fried onions?  Here it is again, only fresher and better.

  1                cup  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Additional whipping cream
                        Fresh chives

Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add leeks; sautÈ 3 minutes.  Add garlic; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add potatoes and 4 1/2 cups broth; bring to boil.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer until potatoes are very tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.

Add peas; cover and continue cooking until just tender, about 5 minutes.

Working in batches, puree soup in blender.  Transfer to bowl.  Cool slightly.  Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and chill.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.)

Mix 1 cup cream into soup.  Thin soup with more broth, if desired.  Season soup to taste with salt and pepper.  Ladle soup into bowls.  Drizzle with additional cream and garnish with chives.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Chef Louis Diat created this famous cold soup (without the peas, which are a nice addition) during his tenure at The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York.  Diat named the soup after Vichy, the resort town near his boyhood home in France.  Hot potato-leek soup had been popular with French chefs for centuries, but Diat -- inspired by his own childhood habit of adding milk to hot soup to cool it off -- served his version cold.  Exactly when vichyssoise first appeared on the hotel menu is unclear, but British food writer Elizabeth David claimed that it debuted in 1917.

         Grilled Chicken Salad With Greens And Balsamic Dressing

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  olivada
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     boneless chicken breast halves with skin
  4          teaspoons  minced fresh thyme
  1                     bag mixed baby greens - (4 1/2 to 5 oz)
  1              small  fresh fennel bulb -- cored, sliced thin
     1/2                large head radicchio -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced red onion
  12                    fresh figs -- quartered, (optional
                        Toasted pine nuts

Whisk 1/2 cup oil, vinegar, olivada and garlic in small bowl to blend; season with salt and pepper.  Place chicken in 8- by 8- by 2-inch dish; sprinkle with thyme.  Pour 1/2 cup dressing over chicken; turn to coat.  Whisk 2 tablespoons oil into remaining dressing in small bowl.  Cover chicken and dressing separately; chill at least 4 and up to 6 hours, turning chicken occasionally.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Bring dressing to room temperature.  Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade.  Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.  Grill until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer to plate.

Combine greens, fennel, radicchio and onion in large bowl; toss with remaining dressing.  Mound on 4 plates.  Slice chicken breasts lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Arrange atop salads.  Garnish with figs, if desired, and pine nuts.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Variations on the grilled chicken salad were everywhere in recent years.  Likewise, balsamic vinegar dressings and marinades often turned up on menus, olivada (olive paste) became a pantry staple, packaged salad greens were popular convenience items, and fennel and radicchio became regulars in the produce bins.

            Grilled Cumin-Lamb Pitas With Couscous And Yogurt

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  plain yogurt
  2                     garlic cloves -- pressed
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  2 1/4         pounds  boneless lamb sirloin -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  1                cup  water
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  couscous
     1/2                cucumber -- seeded, chopped
  1                     ripe tomato -- chopped
     1/2         small  onion -- halved, sliced thin
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     pita breads - (6" dia)

Set strainer over large bowl.  Line strainer with 2 layers of cheesecloth (do not let strainer touch bottom of bowl).  Spoon yogurt into strainer.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour (liquid will drain out and yogurt will thicken; discard liquid).  Mix yogurt, garlic and lemon juice in small bowl.  Season to taste with salt.

Rub cumin and coriander over lamb pieces.  Thread lamb onto 6 metal skewers.  (Yogurt and lamb can be prepared 4 hours ahead.  Cover separately and chill.)

Combine 1 cup water and 1/4 teaspoon salt in medium saucepan.  Bring to boil.  Add couscous.  Remove from heat.  Cover; let stand until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.  Transfer couscous to large bowl; fluff with fork.  Cool to room temperature.  Stir in chopped cucumber, tomato, onion, olive oil and fresh dill.  Season with salt and pepper.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Grill lamb to desired doneness, turning frequently, about 10 minutes for medium-rare.  Transfer to platter.  Sprinkle with salt.  Grill pitas until heated through and lightly toasted, about 1 minute per side.

Place 1 pita on each of 6 plates.  Spread yogurt mixture evenly over pitas.  Spoon couscous down center of pitas.  Slide lamb off skewers onto couscous.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The manly art of grilling reached its first peak in this decade, as dads stood by their Webers, stoking the fire and pulling dinner from its clutches while moms did the shopping and cleanup.  Besides burgers and wienies, people loved to make shish kebab.  Today, grilling knows no gender, and skewers remain a handy way to prepare small foods.  Experience has taught us that the vegetables are best cooked separately, or not at all -- as this hot-cold, tender-crunchy wonder of a sandwich illustrates.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  peeled cored pineapple in 1/4" pieces
     3/4           cup  peeled pitted mango in 1/4" pieces
     2/3           cup  red bell pepper in 1/4" pieces
     1/2           cup  seeded tomato in 1/4" pieces
     1/3           cup  seeded English hothouse cucumber in 1/4"
                        pieces
     1/3           cup  red onion in 1/4" pieces
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh mint
  2        tablespoons  minced seeded jalapeÒo chili
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
                        Salt -- to taste
  6                     sea bass fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        Olive oil

Combine first 10 ingredients in medium bowl; toss to blend.  Season salsa with salt.  Chill to blend flavors, at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours, tossing occasionally.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Brush fish with oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill until just opaque in center, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer to plates.  Top with salsa and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Colorful salsas and relishes made with fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs became popular in this decade of diets.  The toppings are light and fresh and packed with flavor-just right with grilled low-fat fish.

<DirT>
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Brush fish with oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill until just opaque in center, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer to plates.  Top with salsa and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Colorful salsas and relishes made with fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs became popular in this decade of diets.  The toppings are light and fresh and packed with flavor-just right with grilled low-fat fish.

                    Hazelnut-Crusted Goat Cheese Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  plain dry breadcrumbs
  5 1/2         ounces  soft fresh goat cheese log (Montrachet) -- cut 4 equal rounds,
                        and chilled
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
  3        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped hazelnuts
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
  1         tablespoon  frozen orange juice concentrate -- thawed
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     large bunch watercress -- stems trimmed
  1              large  Belgian endive head -- sliced thin
                        lengthwise

Place flour and breadcrumbs on separate plates.  Coat cheese rounds with flour.  Dip cheese into egg, then into breadcrumbs, coating completely.  Place on small baking sheet.  Spoon hazelnuts atop cheese.  Gently press hazelnuts into cheese to adhere.  Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes or overnight.

Whisk vinegar, orange peel and orange juice concentrate in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in oil.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Vinaigrette can be made 4 hours ahead.  Store at room temperature; rewhisk before using.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake cheese until heated through and coating browns, about 6 minutes.  Toss watercress and endive in large bowl with enough vinaigrette to coat.  Season greens with salt and pepper.  Divide greens among 4 plates.  Top with warm cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Alice Waters, who opened Chez Panisse in 1971, took salads to new heights with unusual, farm-fresh greens; she also popularized the use of goat cheese, which was being made by Laura Chenel not far from the Berkeley restaurant.  Those ingredients come together in this delicious salad.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  1         tablespoon  ice water -- or more if needed
     3/4           cup  dry-roasted lightly-salted macadamia nuts -- chopped
                        === FILLING ===
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1           teaspoon  grated lime peel
     2/3           cup  chilled whipping cream
  5                     ripe kiwis -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4"-thick rounds

For crust:  Blend flour, sugar and salt in processor.  Add butter.  Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 1 tablespoon ice water and blend until moist clumps form.  Add more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.

Transfer dough to floured surface.  Gently knead nuts into dough.  Press dough onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Freeze crust 20 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake crust until sides begin to set, about 15 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Bake crust until cooked through and pale golden, piercing with fork if crust bubbles, about 10 minutes longer.  Cool crust completely.

For filling:  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, sugar, lime juice and lime peel in large bowl until smooth and fluffy.  Beat whipping cream in medium bowl until firm peaks form.  Fold into cream cheese mixture.  Spoon filling into crust; smooth top with knife.  Refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours.

Arrange kiwis in concentric circles atop filling, overlapping slightly.  (Can be prepared up to 4 hours ahead.  Cover with plastic and refrigerate.)  Cut tart into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Frieda Caplan, doyenne of the produce company Frieda's, introduced the U.S. to the kiwi in the sixties.  It took a few years, but in the seventies, the green fruit with the fuzzy brown skin really took off.

                   Linguine With Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves - (packed)
     1/4           cup  blanched slivered almonds -- toasted
     1/4           cup  drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
  1                     garlic clove
     1/8      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  water
     2/3           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
  1              pound  linguine
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Blend first 5 ingredients in processor until nuts are finely chopped.  With machine running, gradually add oil, then 1/2 cup water, blending until almost smooth.  Transfer pesto to bowl.  Mix in 1/3 cup cheese.  Season to taste with salt.

Cook linguine in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking water.  Return pasta to pot.  Add pesto and toss to coat, adding enough reserved water to form thin sauce.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve, passing remaining cheese.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Imported from Italy early in the decade, sun-dried tomatoes seduced the nation.  Two other obsessions were pasta and pesto.  All those ingredients combine here in a dish that doesnít age.

Blend first 5 ingredients in processor until nuts are finely chopped.  With machine running, gradually add oil, then 1/2 cup water, blending until almost smooth.  Transfer pesto to bowl.  Mix in 1/3 cup cheese.  Season to taste with salt.

Cook linguine in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking water.  Return pasta to pot.  Add pesto and toss to coat, adding enough reserved water to form thin sauce.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve, passing remaining cheese.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Imported from Italy early in the decade, sun-dried tomatoes seduced the nation.  Two other obsessions were pasta and pesto.  All those ingredients combine here in a dish that doesnít age.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2 1/4           cups  cake flour
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/3           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/3           cup  triple sec
  2        tablespoons  tequila
  2          teaspoons  grated lime peel
  8              large  egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
                        === GLAZE ===
  2               cups  powdered sugar
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  tequila
  4          teaspoons  triple sec
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lime peel
                        Strawberry Compote With Tequila And Lime -- (see recipe)

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Whisk flour, 3/4 cup sugar, baking powder and salt in large bowl to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat yolks and next 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Add to dry ingredients; beat just until smooth.

Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in another large bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar, beating until stiff but not dry.  Fold 1/3 of whites into batter, then fold in remaining whites.  Transfer batter to ungreased 10-inch-diameter angel food cake pan; smooth top.

Bake cake until tester inserted near center comes out clean, about 1 hour.  Immediately invert center tube of pan onto narrow-necked bottle; cool cake completely in pan.

Run long knife around center tube and sides of pan to loosen cake.  Using center tube as aid, lift cake out of pan; run knife between cake and pan bottom to loosen.  Invert cake onto platter.

For Glaze:  Stir first 5 ingredients in medium bowl until smooth.  Spread over top of cake, allowing glaze to drip down sides.  Let stand until glaze sets, about 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome; let stand at room temperature.)

Serve cake with Strawberry Compote With Tequila And Lime.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Californian Harry Baker invented the chiffon cake in 1927, but he kept the recipe a tightly guarded secret for another 20 years.  He finally relented and sold his formula to General Mills.  The mystery ingredient?  Vegetable oil, which gave the cake richness and a light, moist texture.  We spike this one with all the flavors of a Margarita cocktail; the "Strawberry Compote With Tequila And Lime" (see recipe) is an elegant touch.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  3              large  onions -- coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
  1              pound  lean ground beef
  1              pound  ground pork
  1                can  crushed tomatoes with added puree -- (14 1/2 oz)
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  crushed saltine cracker crumbs
     1/2           cup  chopped celery leaves
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pound  mushrooms -- sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Oil 13- by 9- by 2-inch roasting pan.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and sugar; sautÈ until onions are deep golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Stir in oregano and garlic.  Add vinegar; cook until evaporated, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to large bowl and cool.

Add ground beef, pork, 1 cup crushed tomatoes and next 6 ingredients to onions.  Mix with fork until just blended.  Form meat mixture into 10- by 5-inch loaf shape in prepared pan.  Bake 45 minutes.

Spread remaining crushed tomatoes over meat loaf.  Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil.  Bake until thermometer inserted into center registers 155 degrees, about 1 hour.  Cool 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms; sautÈ until tender, about 12 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Cut meat loaf into thick slices.  Spoon mushrooms and pan juices over.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Meat loaf has been a favorite throughout the century, especially during the 1940s when meat was rationed and ground beef was a bargain cut.  Weíve put a contemporary stamp on this suppertime classic by adding lots of caramelized onions.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  8             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
  2               cups  sugar
  6              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1           teaspoon  instant espresso powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  sour cream
     3/4           cup  chopped walnuts
                        Powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Spray 13- by 9- 2-inch metal baking pan with nonstick spray.  Line with waxed paper, extending over 2 sides of pan.  Spray paper.  Stir chocolate and butter in heavy small saucepan over low heat until melted.  Cool to lukewarm.

Using electric mixer, beat 2 cups sugar, eggs and vanilla in medium bowl until fluffy, about 5 minutes.  Add chocolate mixture; beat just until blended.  Add flour and next 3 ingredients; beat just until blended.  Stir in sour cream and nuts.

Transfer batter to pan.  Bake until tester inserted into center comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 35 minutes.  Transfer pan to rack; cool completely.  Cut into squares.  Top with powdered sugar.

This recipe yields about 24 brownies.

Comments:  In 1897, the Sears catalog offered its customers a treat called brownies.  No one seems to remember whether they were bar cookies or a chocolate confection named after a popular cartoon character.  No matter; by the 1900s the brownie as we now know it had arrived.  The recipe for these dense, moist brownies is from Heather Ho, pastry chef at Boulevard in San Francisco.

  5             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  1         tablespoon  brandy
  2              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
  5        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2      teaspoons  instant espresso powder or
                        instant coffee powder
  1              pinch  salt - (large)
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  chilled whipping cream

Generously butter four 3/4-cup soufflÈ dishes or custard cups.  Arrange on baking sheet.  Stir chocolate and butter in heavy small saucepan over low heat until smooth.  Remove from heat; stir in brandy.  Cool 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Using electric mixer, beat eggs, yolks, 4 tablespoons sugar, vanilla, 1 teaspoon espresso powder and salt in medium bowl until very thick ribbon falls when beaters are lifted, about 6 minutes.  Sift flour over batter; fold in flour.  Fold in chocolate mixture.  Divide batter among dishes, filling completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover loosely; refrigerate.  Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before baking.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake cakes until tops are puffed and dry and tester inserted into center comes out with moist batter still attached, about 15 minutes.  Cool cakes 5 minutes.

        Mushroom Wraps With Spinach, Bell Peppers And Goat Cheese

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches                      Wraps


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  portobello mushrooms -- stemmed, and
                        caps thinly sliced
  2               cans  Mexican-style stewed tomatoes -- (14 1/2 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     burrito-size flour tortillas
  1 1/2           cups  crumbled soft fresh goat cheese, such as
                        Montrachet - (abt 7 oz)
  12       tablespoons  chopped green onions
  12       tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  2               cups  sliced yellow bell peppers
  2              large  plum tomatoes -- seeded, and
                        cut into thin strips
  3               cups  baby spinach leaves - (lightly packed) -- abt 3 oz

Heat oil in large pot over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms and sautÈ until tender, about 10 minutes.  Add canned tomatoes with juices.  Cook until liquid thickens slightly, about 15 minutes.  Season mushroom mixture with salt and pepper.

Heat large skillet over high heat.  Add 1 tortilla to skillet and cook until pliable, about 15 seconds per side.  Place on work surface.  Spoon 1/6 of mushroom mixture in strip on lower half, leaving 2-inch border at sides.  Top with 1/4 cup cheese, 2 tablespoons onions, 2 tablespoons cilantro, 1/6 of peppers and tomatoes, then 1/2 cup spinach leaves.  Fold in sides of tortilla over filling; fold up bottom and continue to roll up, enclosing filling.  Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  At the end of the century, vegetarian cooking gained wide acceptance-and became sophisticated.  Wraps (basically burritos) were a hot fast food; everything from Thai chicken to ahi tuna got "wrapped" in flour tortillas or flatbread.  The two trends pair up in this terrific dish.  To make these even more like burritos, add one 15- to 16-ounce can of drained black beans to the filling.

              Oxtail Soup With Red Wine And Root Vegetables

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3 1/4         pounds  meaty oxtails -- patted dry
                        = (about seven 3" segments)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  10              cups  water
  5               cans  beef broth - (14 1/2 oz ea)
  3               cups  dry red wine
  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  2             medium  leeks, white and pale green parts only -- chopped
  3             medium  carrots -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  2             medium  parsnips -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1                     bay leaf
  2              large  russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle oxtails with salt and pepper.  Add oxtails to pot and brown on all sides, about 20 minutes.  Add 10 cups water, beef broth and 2 cups wine.  Bring to simmer.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover partially and simmer gently until meat is tender, stirring occasionally, about 3 hours.

Using tongs, transfer oxtails to large bowl.  Carefully pour cooking liquid into 8-cup glass measuring cup or large bowl.  Freeze cooking liquid until fat separates from liquid, about 45 minutes.  Spoon fat from top of cooking liquid.  Remove meat from oxtails; discard bones.  Add meat to cooking liquid.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in same pot over medium-high heat.  Add onions, leeks, carrots, parsnips, garlic, thyme and bay leaf.  SautÈ until vegetables are golden, about 12 minutes.  Add cooking liquid with meat and remaining 1 cup wine.  Bring to boil.  Add potatoes.  Cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.

Add parsley to soup.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Ladle into bowls.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  During hard times, luxury cuts like steaks and chops give way to humbler ones.  None are humbler than the oxtail, and all across the country, depression-era cooks made much of it, frequently in soup.  Even in these days, when humble cuts have become restaurant menu stars, soup is still a good way to go with oxtails.  Simmering them slowly with garlic and vegetables in red wine yields a rich broth and tender, succulent meat, making a lavish feast for us all.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     garlic clove
  2               cups  fresh spinach - (loosely packed)
  1              bunch  watercress -- stems trimmed
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  dry breadcrumbs
  2        tablespoons  Pernod or other anise-flavored liqueur
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds -- ground
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  rock salt - (about)
  24                    fresh oysters -- shucked, and
                        shells reserved
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Position rack in top third of oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Finely chop garlic in processor.  Add spinach, watercress and green onions to garlic.  Process, using on/off turns, until mixture is finely chopped.  Transfer mixture to medium bowl.

Combine butter, breadcrumbs, Pernod, fennel and hot sauce in processor.  Process until well blended.  Return spinach mixture to processor.  Process, using on/off turns, just until mixtures are blended.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Sprinkle rock salt over large baking sheet to depth of 1/2 inch.  Arrange oysters in half shells atop rock salt.  Top each oyster with 1 tablespoon spinach mixture.  Sprinkle with cheese.  Bake until spinach mixture browns on top, about 8 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 first-course servings.

Comments:  The original recipe for oysters Rockefeller, created at the New Orleans restaurant Antoine's in 1899, remains a secret to this day.  The appetizer, oysters topped with a mixture of finely chopped greens and copious amounts of butter and then baked in their shells, was considered so rich that it had to be named after the richest man of the day, John D. Rockefeller.  A few years later, no self-respecting restaurateur would be without his own version on the menu.  This lighter take features spinach, watercress, green onions and grated Parmesan.

Comments:  The original recipe for oysters Rockefeller, created at the New Orleans restaurant Antoine&apos;s in 1899, remains a secret to this day.  The appetizer, oysters topped with a mixture of finely chopped greens and copious amounts of butter and then baked in their shells, was considered so rich that it had to be named after the richest man of the day, John D. Rockefeller.  A few years later, no self-respecting restaurateur would be without his own version on the menu.  This lighter take features spinach, watercress, green onions and grated Parmesan.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  chopped macadamia nuts
     1/4           cup  dried tart cherries -- see * Note
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
     1/2        medium  pineapple -- peeled, quartered
                        lengthwise, cored, cut crosswise 1/4"-thk
                        pieces
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  finely-grated orange peel
  3              large  eggs -- separated
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     2/3           cup  buttermilk
                        Whipped cream

* Note:  Sold at specialty foods stores, natural foods stores and some supermarkets.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Melt 6 tablespoons butter in 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 2-inch-high sides set atop burner on medium-low heat.  Stir in sugar, nuts, cherries and ginger.  Cook until sugar mixture bubbles, stirring often, about 6 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Arrange pineapple pieces, overlapping slightly and in concentric circles, over sugar mixture.  Set aside.

Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat 3/4 cup sugar and orange peel in large bowl until fragrant.  Beat in 6 tablespoons butter until light.  Beat in yolks 1 at a time.  Beat in lemon juice and vanilla.  Beat in flour mixture alternately with buttermilk.

Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in another large bowl until soft peaks form.  Add 2 tablespoons sugar and beat until firm peaks form.  Fold into batter.  Spoon into pan atop pineapple.

Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour.  Transfer to rack; cool 5 minutes.  Invert onto platter.  Serve with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Among favorite desserts of the decade were waffles, served with ice cream and syrup, as well as this easy cake's ancestor.  The treat reached its maximum popularity with the increasing availability of canned pineapple and the marketing efforts of the Dole Company.  Today's widely available fresh fruit -- spiked with ginger, macadamia nuts and orange zest -- gives a great result.

            Polenta With Fresh Herbs And White Cheddar Cheese

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6 2/3           cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh marjoram
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh thyme
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh sage
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 2/3           cups  polenta (coarse cornmeal) -- see * Note
  1 1/2           cups  grated sharp white cheddar cheese -- (packed), abt 6 oz
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  If unavailable, use 1 2/3 cups regular cornmeal and cook for about 12 minutes.

Combine broth, all herbs, garlic and salt in heavy large saucepan and bring to boil over medium-high heat.  Gradually sprinkle in polenta, whisking constantly.  Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until polenta is thick and creamy and begins to pull away from sides of pan, whisking often, about 25 minutes.  Add cheese; stir until cheese melts.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 6 side-dish servings.

Comments:  Regarded as peasant food for centuries, polenta achieved culinary stardom in the past few years, thanks to widespread exploration of all aspects of Italian gastronomy.  Polenta can be enjoyed in its soft, creamy state right after being prepared; or it can be chilled in a loaf pan, sliced and cooked on a grill or griddle.  Try this soft version with sausages.  The coarse polenta specified is sometimes labeled "stone-ground corn grits."

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  sour cream
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  9             ounces  thickly-sliced corned beef -- coarsely chopped
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped drained canned beets
     3/4           cup  chopped onion
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil

Mix sour cream and dill in small bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover and chill until ready to serve.  (Dilled sour cream can be made 2 days ahead.)

Steam potatoes until tender, about 8 minutes.  Transfer to large bowl; chill until cold, about 15 minutes.  Mix in corned beef, beets and onion.  Working in batches and using on/off turns, coarsely chop mixture in processor.  Return mixture to same bowl.  Add egg; toss to mix.  (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add corned beef mixture; cook until bottom is brown and crisp, about 10 minutes.  Continue cooking until brown and crisp on both sides, flattening with spatula and turning mixture over in sections, about 10 minutes.

Transfer to plates.  Serve with dilled sour cream.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Early in this century, fresh meat became a staple on many American tables.  But old methods of flavoring and preserving beef -- corning, for instance, which involved brining the meat with spices -- remained popular.  Often in New England, leftover corned beef simmered with vegetables would be chopped up and transformed into red flannel hash, so called because of the crimson color beets gave to the dish.

          Rib-Eye Steaks With Bell Peppers And Gorgonzola Butter

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  crumbled Gorgonzola cheese - (packed) -- abt 1 1/2 oz
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick) -- room temperature
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh marjoram
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  6              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  4                     beef rib-eye steaks, 1 1/4" thick
  2              large  green bell peppers -- cut 1 1/2"-wide
                        strips
  2              large  red bell peppers -- cut 1 1/2"-wide
                        strips
  2              large  yellow bell peppers -- cut 1 1/2"-wide
                        strips

Beat cheese, butter and 1 tablespoon marjoram in small bowl to blend.  Season Gorgonzola butter with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Combine oil, garlic and 2 tablespoons marjoram in large glass baking dish.  Add steaks and all peppers; sprinkle with black pepper.  Turn to coat.  Let stand 2 hours at room temperature or chill up to 6 hours, turning occasionally.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Place steaks and peppers on grill; sprinkle with salt.  Grill steaks about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare, and peppers until tender, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes.

Transfer steaks to platter; surround with peppers.  Top each steak with 1/4 of Gorgonzola butter.  Let stand just until butter softens, about 5 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  By mid-decade, indulgence foods were back with a vengeance-a sign that too much of a good-for-you thing was starting to get boring at the dinner table.  And when the diet gurus switched their focus from complex carbohydrates to protein, steak regained some respect from nutrition buffs.  Also, many specialty foods shops began catering to the most health-conscious meat eaters by offering beef raised without hormones.

Comments:  By mid-decade, indulgence foods were back with a vengeance-a sign that too much of a good-for-you thing was starting to get boring at the dinner table.  And when the diet gurus switched their focus from complex carbohydrates to protein, steak regained some respect from nutrition buffs.  Also, many specialty foods shops began catering to the most health-conscious meat eaters by offering beef raised without hormones.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  5                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  1                     roasting chicken - (abt 7 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     lemon -- quartered
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  canned low-salt chicken broth -- more or less
  2          teaspoons  all-purpose flour

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Mix first 4 ingredients in bowl.  Rinse chicken; pat dry.  Place chicken in roasting pan.  Rub all but 1 tablespoon garlic-thyme oil over.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Place lemon in cavity of chicken.  Tie legs with string.

Roast chicken 20 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees.  Roast chicken until meat thermometer inserted into thickest part of inner thigh registers 180 degrees, about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Lift chicken and tilt slightly, emptying juices from cavity into pan.  Transfer chicken to serving platter.  Tent chicken with aluminum foil to keep warm.

Pour pan juices into large glass measuring cup.  Spoon fat off top.  Add wine to pan; place over high heat.  Bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits.  Pour wine mixture into measuring cup with pan juices (do not clean roasting pan).  Add enough chicken broth to cup to measure 1 1/2 cups.  Return broth mixture to same roasting pan.  Mix flour into reserved 1 tablespoon garlic-thyme oil.  Whisk into broth mixture.  Boil broth mixture in roasting pan set over 2 burners until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.  Season pan-juice mixture to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour into sauceboat.

Serve chicken, passing pan-juice mixture separately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  In the eighties, the popularity of this homestyle dish caused take-out rotisserie chicken shops to spring up across the country.

          Roasted Clams With Pancetta And Red Bell Pepper Coulis

Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  red bell pepper
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  24                    littleneck clams -- scrubbed
  3             slices  pancetta or bacon -- cut into 24 pieces
                        Lemon wedges

Char bell pepper over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag; let stand 10 minutes.  Peel, seed and coarsely chop bell pepper.  Transfer to processor.  Add oil, oregano and garlic; puree until smooth.  Season coulis with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with foil.  Arrange clams on sheet.  Bake until clams open, about 6 minutes (discard any that do not open).  Cool slightly.  Remove top shells; discard, leaving clams in half shells on sheet.

Preheat broiler.  Top each clam with 1 teaspoon coulis, then 1 pancetta piece.  Broil clams until coulis bubbles and pancetta browns, about 3 minutes.  Transfer to platter.  Garnish with lemon; serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings as appetizers.

Comments:  In 1917, a society grande dame asked Julius Keller, maÓtre dí of the Casino restaurant in New York, to surprise her with a new dish.  Keller presented clams baked on the half shell, topped with minced bell pepper, herb butter and bacon.  By the twenties, Clams Casino, as Keller called it, was ubiquitous on restaurant menus.  Here is a lightened version with great lively flavors.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               ears  fresh corn
  1              large  poblano chili
  3               cups  water
  1                can  low-salt chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                     russet potato - (abt 8 oz) -- peeled, quartered
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Cilantro sprigs

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Keeping husks on corn, place corn on heavy rimmed baking sheet.  Roast until corn is fragrant and husks brown, about 30 minutes.  Let cool.  Remove husks from corn.  Cut off corn kernels and set aside.

Char chili over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag and let stand 10 minutes.  Peel, seed and quarter chili.

Combine 3 1/2 cups water, broth and potato in large pot.  Cover partially and simmer over medium heat until potato is tender, about 20 minutes.

Using slotted spoon, transfer potato to processor; reserve cooking liquid.  Add corn, chili and chopped cilantro to processor.  Puree until mixture is as smooth as possible, gradually adding most of reserved cooking liquid through feed tube.

Strain corn puree through sieve into large saucepan, pressing on solids.  Mix in remaining cooking liquid and cream.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Bring soup to simmer. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Ladle soup into bowls.  Garnish with cilantro sprigs and then serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The decade saw the rise of a modern southwestern cuisine, and the rise of chilies, like the poblano that gives this soup a kick.

                      Rosemary Focaccia With Olives

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     russet potato - (12 to 16 oz)
  2 1/2           cups  bread flour -- or more if needed
  3          teaspoons  fresh rosemary leaves
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  warm water -- (105 to 115 deg)
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
  1           envelope  dry yeast
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  12                    oil-cured black olives -- pitted, halved
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse sea salt

Pierce potato several times with fork.  Microwave on high until tender, turning once, about 12 minutes.  Cut in half.  Scoop flesh into small bowl; mash well.  Measure 2/3 cup (packed) mashed potato; cool (reserve extra potato for another use).

Combine 2 1/2 cups flour, half of rosemary and 1 teaspoon salt in processor; blend until rosemary is chopped, about 1 minute.  Add potato; blend in, using about 25 on/off turns.

Combine 1 cup warm water and sugar in 2-cup glass measuring cup; sprinkle yeast over.  Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.

Stir 3 tablespoons oil into yeast mixture.  With processor running, pour yeast mixture into flour mixture.  Process until smooth, about 1 minute.  Scrape dough out onto lightly floured surface.  Knead until dough feels silky, sprinkling with more flour as needed, about 1 minute.  Place dough in large oiled bowl; turn to coat.  Cover with towel; let rise in warm area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Brush large baking sheet with oil.

Punch down dough; knead 30 seconds on lightly floured surface.  Stretch or pat out dough to 12-inch round.  Transfer round to prepared baking sheet.  Press dough all over with fingertips to dimple.  Brush with 1 tablespoon oil.  Press olive halves, cut-side down, into dough.  Sprinkle with sea salt.  Let rise until just puffy, about 20 minutes.

Bake until golden, about 18 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields one 13-inch round bread.

Comments:  Over the past few years, the popular Italian flatbread has made its way into bread baskets at home and in restaurants.  This version is tender and redolent of rosemary and olive oil.  Itís perfect as a snack, served with soup and salad, or split for sandwiches.

                           Sangria Jell-O Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  raspberry-flavored Jell-O - (6 oz)
  1 3/4           cups  fruity red wine
  1                cup  chilled orange juice
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  3              large  oranges
  1                cup  green seedless -- halved lengthwise
  1                cup  sliced hulled strawberries
                        Additional grapes and strawberries
                        Orange slices

Lightly oil 6-cup ring mold.  Place raspberry Jell-O in large bowl.  Bring wine to simmer in small saucepan.  Add wine to Jell-O and stir until Jell-O is dissolved, about 2 minutes.  Stir in orange juice and lemon juice.  Place bowl in larger bowl filled with ice and water.  Cool until Jell-O begins to set slightly, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, grate 1 tablespoon peel from oranges.  Cut remaining peel and white pith from oranges; discard.  Cut between membranes; release segments.

Add orange segments and peel, 1 cup grapes and 1 cup strawberries to Jell-O; stir to blend well.  Pour mixture into mold.  Chill at least 6 hours or overnight.

Run knife around mold sides to loosen Jell-O.  Place mold in bowl filled with enough hot water to come halfway up sides of mold for 30 seconds.  Place platter atop mold; invert Jell-O onto platter.  Garnish with additional fruit.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Until powdered gelatin came on the market in the 1890s, making gelatin molds was a labor-intensive endeavor.  By the twenties, electric refrigeration and the Jell-O brand made the salads so easy to prepare that cookbooks were filled with recipes for them.  This one incorporates the flavors of sangria.  Serve it as a side dish or as a dessert.

  1                     cucumber - (abt 11 oz) -- peeled, halved

  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2          teaspoons  minced canned chipotle chilies
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

     1/2                avocado -- peeled, chopped fine
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped peeled jicama
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped plum tomatoes

Coarsely chop half of cucumber; place in blender.  Add 1/2 cup broth and next 5 ingredients; puree until smooth.  Pour soup into large bowl.  Mix in cup broth.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover; chill at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours.

Mix 1 rounded tablespoon each of green onions, avocado, jicama, green bell pepper and tomatoes in small bowl; reserve for garnish.  Mix remaining green onions, avocado, jicama, bell pepper and tomatoes into soup.  Ladle soup into bowls.  Sprinkle with reserved garnish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Many Americans first tasted this cold vegetable soup at the 1964 New York Worldís Fair.  Gazpacho came into favor partly as a vehicle for showing off blenders, the popularity of which created a boom in recipes that called for liquefying ingredients.  This recipe goes the Spanish classic one better with the addition of smoky chipotle chilies.

               Smoked Salmon Tartare With Ginger And Sesame

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : First Course                    Fish (Ocean)
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  wasabi powder
  6             ounces  sliced smoked salmon (not lox) -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  fin-diced peeled seeded English hothouse
                        cucumber
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  minced green onion
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame seeds
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  oriental sesame oil
  2             pieces  dried nori - (8" by 1" by 1/2"
                        cut from one 8" by 8" sheet)
                        Water crackers or Japanese rice crackers

Stir lemon juice and wasabi powder in medium bowl to blend.  Mix in salmon, cucumber, cilantro, green onion, sesame seeds, ginger and sesame oil.  Shape all of salmon mixture into 1 1/2-inch-thick patty, about 3 1/2 inches in diameter.

Moisten ends of nori strips.  Wrap nori strips snugly around sides of patty, pressing ends together to seal.  Place salmon tartare on platter.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Cover; refrigerate.)  Surround with crackers.

This recipe yields 6 first-course servings.

Comments:  In the early part of the decade, an appreciation of Asian flavors, a desire for spa-style cuisine, and the popularity of sushi dovetailed with the creation of this appetizer, usually prepared with raw salmon or tuna.  The dish is now found on restaurant menus nationwide.  This version, which calls for smoked salmon, features a wonderful combination of Pacific Rim flavors.

Comments:  In the early part of the decade, an appreciation of Asian flavors, a desire for spa-style cuisine, and the popularity of sushi dovetailed with the creation of this appetizer, usually prepared with raw salmon or tuna.  The dish is now found on restaurant menus nationwide.  This version, which calls for smoked salmon, features a wonderful combination of Pacific Rim flavors.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  ground chuck beef
     1/2           cup  shredded Monterey Jack cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  1                can  chopped mild green chilies - (4 oz)
  2        tablespoons  minced green onions
  1         tablespoon  tequila
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     avocado -- pitted, peeled,
                        and sliced
                        Lime-pickled Red Onions -- (see recipe)
                        Purchased salsas

Using hands, gently mix first 8 ingredients in large bowl just until blended.  Form into four 3/4-inch-thick oval patties.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Grill patties until cooked to desired doneness, about 6 minutes per side for medium-rare.

Transfer patties to plates.  Top with avocado slices and Lime-pickled Red Onions.  Serve, passing salsas alongside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Dr. James Henry Salisbury might have been the first of the protein-diet doctors, proclaiming in 1888 that humankind's maladies were caused by too much starchy food.  His solution?  Chopped lean meat, or hamburger steak.  To hide the "liver-y" taste of hamburger, he recommended adding horseradish, mustard or Worcestershire sauce.  By the 1900s, Salisbury steak was a staple menu item, often served with mushroom gravy or smothered in onions.  This version, inspired by todayís southwestern cooking, has terrific flavor.

                    Spaghetti With Sicilian Meatballs

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatballs


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  spaghetti
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onion
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cans  diced tomatoes in juice - (28 oz ea)
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === MEATBALLS ===
     2/3           cup  fresh breadcrumbs
  3        tablespoons  milk
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  1              large  egg
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pound  sweet Italian sausages -- casings removed
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts -- toasted
  2        tablespoons  dried currants

For Sauce:  Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-low heat.  Add onion; sautÈ until golden, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic; stir 1 minute.  Add tomatoes with juices and 2 tablespoons basil; bring to boil.  Reduce heat; simmer until sauce thickens, breaking up tomatoes with fork, about 1 hour.  Mix in 2 tablespoons basil.  Season with salt and pepper.  Set sauce aside.

For Meatballs:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil baking sheet.  Mix crumbs and milk in medium bowl; let stand 5 minutes.  Mix in Parmesan, onion, basil, egg, garlic and pepper.  Add sausage, pine nuts and currants; blend well.  Using wet hands, form mixture into 1 1/4-inch balls.  Place on baking sheet.  Bake until meatballs are light brown and cooked through, about 30 minutes.  Add to sauce.

Cook spaghetti in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.  Drain.  Mound in dish.  Bring sauce and meatballs to simmer.  Spoon over spaghetti.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Americans enjoyed most of the food at the scores of Italian restaurants that opened in the twenties, but they couldnít understand the appeal of spaghetti and tomato sauce: Where was the meat?  To accommodate, the restaurants began to top the pasta with meatballs.  This recipe takes the dish a step further by adding the Sicilian flavors of pine nuts and currants.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2         pounds  baby back pork rib racks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     2/3           cup  ketchup
     2/3           cup  tangerine-orange juice
  3        tablespoons  black bean garlic sauce -- see * Note
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  chili-garlic sauce -- see * Note
  2        tablespoons  dry Sherry
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  oriental sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds

* Note:  Available at Asian markets and in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets.

Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 400 degrees.  Sprinkle ribs with salt and pepper.  Wrap each rib rack tightly in heavy-duty foil; set on rimmed baking sheet.  Bake ribs 45 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Unwrap; drain juices.  Cut racks into 3-rib sections.

Mix ketchup and next 8 ingredients in large bowl to blend.

Line same baking sheet with foil.  Dip ribs into sauce.  Place ribs, meaty-side up, on sheet.  Roast 15 minutes.  Dip into sauce again.  Roast until meat is very tender and ribs are glazed, about 15 minutes.  Sprinkle sesame seeds over ribs; roast 10 minutes longer.  Cut into individual ribs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Little spareribs with "oriental" glazes were quite popular in the fifties.  The sweet lacquers were composed primarily of ketchup, soy sauce and ginger, and they were nice complements to the rich meat.  Forty years of progress at the supermarket have given us access to many more Asian ingredients, not to mention a taste for zestier fare.  The glazes today tend to be like this one -- complexly flavored and definitely more authentic.

Toss potatoes, carrots and 3 tablespoons oil in large bowl.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Spread vegetables in large roasting pan.  Roast 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, using tip of knife, make several slits in roast; insert garlic into slits.  Brush roast with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.  Rub spice mixture over roast.

Push vegetables to sides of pan, leaving space in center.  Place roast in center of pan.  Roast until meat thermometer inserted into center of meat registers 125 degrees for medium-rare, about 1 hour.

Transfer roast to platter.  Tent with foil.  Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees.  Spread vegetables in pan; continue roasting until vegetables are tender and brown, about 10 minutes.  Sprinkle with cilantro.

Surround roast with vegetables.  Cut roast into thin slices and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  As American cities filled up in the early part of the twentieth century, new urbanites learned to make the most of small apartment kitchens by using recipes that yielded a lot of food with little bother.  Roast beef with vegetables filled the bill.  Cattle, raised on enormous western ranches, and beef were moved efficiently around the country on the transcontinental railroad system, so the meat was cheap and plentiful.  A spice rub and cilantro make this roast especially appealing.

  4                     radishes -- chopped
     1/2           cup  crumbled feta cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh mint
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     avocados -- pitted, peeled,
                        and sliced

* Note:  Also called cracked wheat; available at natural foods stores and supermarkets.

Combine 1 1/2 cups hot water and bulgur in large bowl.  Cover tightly and let stand until bulgur is tender, about 45 minutes.  Strain bulgur.  Place bulgur in clean dry towel and squeeze out any excess liquid.  Return bulgur to bowl.

Add tomatoes, parsley, onions, cucumber, radishes, cheese, mint and lemon peel to bulgur.  Stir to combine.  Whisk oil and lemon juice in medium bowl to blend.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.  Add all but 2 tablespoons dressing to bulgur mixture.  Toss to combine.  Season tabbouleh to taste with salt and pepper.

Add avocado slices to remaining dressing; toss to coat.  Mound tabbouleh on platter.  Garnish with avocado slices.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  A growing interest in Middle Eastern food, spurred most likely by the vegetarian movement, brought tabbouleh to the attention of many Americans.  It was often served as a side dish at health food restaurants.

               Three-Cheese Pasta Gratin With Almond Crust

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                     garlic clove -- pressed
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  hot whole milk
  10            ounces  extra-sharp cheddar cheese -- grated
  8             ounces  hot pepper Monterey Jack cheese -- grated
  1 2/3           cups  grated Parmesan cheese - (lightly packed)
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  whole almonds
     1/4           cup  fine dry breadcrumbs
  1              pound  short tube-shaped pasta
                        = (such as cavatapi or macaroni)

Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add garlic; sautÈ until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add flour; stir 3 minutes.  Whisk in hot milk.  Bring to simmer, stirring.  Cover partially; simmer until sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.

Remove from heat.  Add cheddar and Jack cheese, 1 1/3 cups Parmesan cheese and hot pepper sauce.  Whisk until sauce is smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.  Whisk over medium heat to rewarm before using.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Generously butter bottom and sides of 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish.  Blend 1/3 cup Parmesan, almonds and breadcrumbs in processor until nuts are coarsely ground.  Add 1/2 cup almond mixture to prepared dish.  Tilt dish to coat bottom and sides.  Return any loose almond mixture to processor.

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender.  Drain well.  Return pasta to pot.  Add sauce; stir to coat.  Transfer to prepared dish.  Sprinkle remaining almond mixture over.

Bake until almond mixture is golden and crunchy and sauce bubbles, about 30 minutes.  Cool on rack 5 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Even lean, mean depression-era macaroni and cheese was comforting, a tribute to the twin powers of carbohydrates and melted cheese, which are just as irresistible now as they were then.  Some fans love the crunchy crust while others crave the creamy center.  This lush and ultra-tangy millennium mac and cheese aims to please adherents of both schools of thought.

Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bag frozen dark sweet cherries - (16 oz) -- thawed
  2               cups  cherry juice -- plus
  1         tablespoon  cherry juice
     1/2           cup  dried tart cherries
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  1         tablespoon  arrowroot
     1/4           cup  thin matchstick-size strips orange peel -- orange part only
     1/3           cup  kirsch (clear cherry brandy)
  1              quart  vanilla or cherry-vanilla-swirl ice cream

Place sieve over bowl.  Add thawed cherries; let drain.  Pour drained juices into heavy medium skillet (set cherries aside).  Mix 2 cups cherry juice, dried cherries and sugar into same skillet.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Boil sauce until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes.

Mix arrowroot with remaining 1 tablespoon juice in small bowl.  Whisk into sauce.  Boil until thickened, about 1 minute.  Discard vanilla bean.  Mix in drained cherries and orange peel.

Heat kirsch in skillet over low heat.  Remove from heat.  Carefully ignite kirsch with match.  Carefully pour flaming kirsch into sauce.  Scoop ice cream into bowls.  Spoon sauce over.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Flaming desserts-like this one and crepes suzette-were all the rage at fine dining establishments in the sixties.  The title here refers to the sweet cherries, dried cherries and cherry juice -- enhanced by vanilla bean and orange peel -- that provide such terrific flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
  2               cups  fresh breadcrumbs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  whipping cream
  8             ounces  cherry tomatoes -- halved
  1                cup  frozen petite peas -- thawed
  1              pound  fresh tuna -- cut into 1/2" pieces
  1              pound  fresh fettuccine
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  fresh minced parsley

Melt 4 tablespoons butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add lemon peel; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add breadcrumbs; sautÈ until golden, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Combine cream, tomatoes, peas and 3 tablespoons butter in large deep skillet.  Simmer over medium heat until sauce begins to thicken, about 3 minutes.  Add tuna and simmer until tuna is cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender.  Drain.  Add pasta, cheese and parsley to sauce; toss.  Season with salt and pepper.  Divide pasta among plates.  Sprinkle with lemon breadcrumbs and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Both easy and inexpensive, tuna-noodle casserole stretched proteins and carbohydrates to the limits and fed at least a generation of American kids very well.  Canned tuna will never go away, but fresh tuna has joined it as a culinary staple, and it stars in this deconstructed version of the classic.  All the elements that make tuna casserole so appealing and comforting are here, just slightly rearranged.  And thereís no need to serve this on a cafeteria tray: Itís good enough for your best china.

  2                     baskets fresh raspberries - (1/2-pint ea)
  6              large  egg yolks
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  1 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  12         teaspoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Spread 1 tablespoon jam over bottom of each of six 3/4-cup soufflÈ dishes or custard cups.  Press 7 berries, placed on their sides, into jam in each dish.  Reserve remaining raspberries for garnish.

Whisk yolks and 6 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl to blend.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean.  Gradually whisk in cream.  Divide mixture among dishes.  Arrange dishes in 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan.  Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides of dishes.

Bake custards until set in center, about 40 minutes.  Place pan on work surface.  Cool custards in water 30 minutes.  Remove from water; chill overnight.

Preheat broiler.  Sieve 2 teaspoons brown sugar atop each custard.  Place dishes on small baking sheet.  Broil until sugar just starts to caramelize, rotating sheet for even browning, about 2 minutes.  Chill until topping hardens, about 2 hours.  Garnish with reserved berries.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Even though purists protested, a variety of ingredients were used to flavor the classic French custard.  And in all its incarnations, it became the fin-de-siÈcle way to end a swanky restaurant meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2         pounds  eggplant -- unpeeled, and
                        cut into 1/2"-thick rounds
                        Salt -- as needed
     1/2           cup  olive oil - (about)
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  finely-chopped peeled carrots
  1                cup  finely-chopped celery
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  12            ounces  portobello mushrooms -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1                can  crushed tomatoes with added puree -- (28 oz)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
  7        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3 1/2           cups  whole milk
  4              large  egg yolks

Cover 2 baking sheets with paper towels.  Sprinkle both sides of eggplant rounds with salt.  Arrange eggplant in single layer atop towels.  Let stand 30 minutes.

Position first rack in bottom third of oven and second rack in top third of oven and preheat to 425 degrees.  Remove eggplant and paper towels from baking sheets.  Pat eggplant dry.  Oil same baking sheets.  Brush both sides of eggplant rounds with 1/4 cup oil.  Arrange in single layer on baking sheets.  Bake 10 minutes.  Turn eggplant and rotate pans in oven.  Continue baking until tender, about 15 minutes longer.  Cool.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Meanwhile, heat 1/4 cup oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion, carrots and celery.  SautÈ until onion is very tender, about 12 minutes.  Mix in garlic, then mushrooms.  SautÈ until juices evaporate, about 10 minutes.  Mix in oregano and cinnamon.  Add tomatoes and parsley.  Cook until mixture is thick, about 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Lightly oil 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Arrange half of eggplant rounds in single layer in dish.  Spoon half of tomato mixture evenly over eggplant.  Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cheese.  Repeat layering with remaining eggplant, tomato mixture and 2 tablespoons cheese.

Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Whisk in flour.  Stir 2 minutes.  Gradually whisk in milk.  Simmer until sauce thickens, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes.  Whisk in 1/2 cup cheese.  Season with salt and pepper.  Whisk yolks in large bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in hot sauce.  Pour sauce over vegetables in dish.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup cheese over sauce.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Bake moussaka until heated through and sauce is golden brown on top, about 45 minutes (or about 55 minutes for refrigerated moussaka).  Cool 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Although it would be years before most Greek cooking would become familiar to Americans, one Greek dish, moussaka, did catch on in the seventies.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (abt 3 1/2 lbs) -- cut into 8 pieces
  8               cups  water
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1              pound  red-skinned potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  1              pound  tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
  3             medium  carrots -- peeled, sliced
  4             ounces  green beans -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  2             medium  zucchini -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  1                cup  fresh or frozen corn kernels
  2               cups  thinly-sliced fresh spinach leaves -- (packed)
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring chicken, water, wine and 1 teaspoon salt to boil in large pot, skimming surface.  Cover; simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 25 minutes.  Transfer chicken breast and thigh pieces to platter (leave remaining chicken and stock in pot).  Remove meat from bones; cut into 1/2-inch pieces.  Cover and chill meat.  Return scraps and bones to pot.

Cover stock and simmer 1 hour.  Strain.  Cool stock slightly.  Chill overnight.  Spoon fat off top and discard.

Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large pot over medium heat.  Add onion; sautÈ until golden, about 6 minutes.  Add stock and bring to boil.  Add potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, green beans and 1 teaspoon salt.  Simmer 10 minutes.  Add zucchini and corn; simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.  Stir in spinach and chicken meat.  Simmer until chicken is heated through, about 3 minutes.  Stir in basil.  Season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Throughout World War II, everyone who had even a little plot of land was encouraged to grow a vegetable garden.  Back then, this comforting soup would most frequently be made from water and contain no chicken, which was a Sunday treat.  For convenience, you can skip the first part of this recipe and use six cups of stock or canned broth and omit the chicken altogether.  But if you want to make the stock from scratch, be sure to do so a day ahead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  dried tart cherries -- see * Note
  1                cup  boiling water
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  sour cream

* Note:  Sold at specialty foods stores, natural foods stores and some supermarkets.

Soak cherries in 1 cup boiling water until softened, about 10 minutes.  Drain.

Comments:  This simple apple salad got its name from the luxurious Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.  Invented in 1896 not by a chef but by the maÓtre d'hÙtel Oscar Tschirky, the Waldorf salad was an instant success.  As often happens, many variations evolved -- some with raisins, some with chopped nuts.  This one has green apples and red seedless grapes.

Comments:  This simple apple salad got its name from the luxurious Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.  Invented in 1896 not by a chef but by the maÓtre d&apos;hÙtel Oscar Tschirky, the Waldorf salad was an instant success.  As often happens, many variations evolved -- some with raisins, some with chopped nuts.  This one has green apples and red seedless grapes.

                 White Chocolate Mousse With Blackberries

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  whole milk
  4              large  egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  8             ounces  good-quality white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt or Baker's)
  2        tablespoons  Cointreau, Grand Marnier or
                        other orange liqueur
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
  2               cups  fresh blackberries
  4              small  fresh mint sprigs
                        Rolled wafer cookies -- (optional)

Whisk milk, yolks and 2 tablespoons sugar in small metal bowl to blend.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water.  Whisk constantly until mixture thickens and thermometer registers 160 degrees, about 4 minutes.  Remove from over water.  Add white chocolate; whisk until melted and smooth.  Refrigerate mixture until cool but not set, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.  Mix in 1 tablespoon liqueur.

Beat cream in large bowl to stiff peaks.  Fold in white chocolate mixture.

Puree 3/4 cup berries with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in processor.  Strain into small bowl, pressing on solids.  Mix in 1/4 cup berries and remaining 1 tablespoon liqueur.  Spoon berry mixture into 4 coupe dishes or balloon-shaped wineglasses.  Gently spoon mousse over.  Cover and refrigerate until mousse is softly set, about 3 hours.

Top mousse with remaining berries.  Garnish with mint sprigs.  Serve with cookies, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Dark chocolate never goes out of fashion, but white chocolate was all the rage in the eighties.  Foodies couldn't get enough, enjoying it in truffles, tarts and sumptuous ivory-colored mousses like this one.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
     1/2         ounce  dried porcini mushrooms -- rinsed
                        = (available at Italian markets and
                        many supermarkets)
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2 1/2           cups  finely-chopped onions
  12            ounces  crimini mushrooms -- finely chopped
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh marjoram
  1 1/2           cups  arborio rice or medium-grain white rice
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Additional grated Parmesan cheese

Bring broth to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Add porcini and simmer until just tender, about 2 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to plate.  Cool mushrooms and chop finely.  Cover broth and keep warm over very low heat.

Melt butter with oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add onions; sautÈ until tender, about 10 minutes.  Add crimini mushrooms; sautÈ until tender, about 8 minutes.  Add porcini, garlic and both herbs; sautÈ 4 minutes.  Add rice; stir 2 minutes.  Add wine; cook until liquid is absorbed, stirring often, about 3 minutes.

Add 1 cup hot broth; simmer until liquid is absorbed, stirring often, about 8 minutes.  Continue to cook until rice is just tender and mixture is creamy, adding more broth by cupfuls and stirring often, about 30 minutes.

Mix in 1/2 cup cheese. Season with salt and pepper.  Serve, passing additional cheese separately.

This recipe yields 6 first-course or 4 main-course servings.

Comments:  Popular in the Italian kitchen for eons, risotto and wild mushrooms were embraced in the nineties by American home cooks and restaurant chefs alike.  Offer this delicious version as a starter or a main course.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
  3              large  eggs
  1             medium  zucchini -- grated, and
                        squeezed to remove excess moisture
     1/2           cup  dried currants
                        Additional vegetable oil
                        Butter
                        Maple syrup

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Whisk first 7 ingredients in large bowl.  Whisk buttermilk, 3/4 cup oil and eggs in medium bowl.  Add to dry ingredients and mix just until blended but still lumpy.  Fold in zucchini and currants.

Heat griddle or heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Brush lightly with vegetable oil.  Working in batches, pour batter by 1/3 cupfuls onto griddle, spacing apart.  Cook until bottoms are golden, about 2 minutes.  Turn and cook until second sides are golden and pancakes are cooked through, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to baking sheet; keep warm in oven.  Serve hot with butter and syrup.

This recipe yields 12 pancakes.

Comments:  Aunt Jemimaís Pancake Flour, first marketed in 1899, was Americaís original ready-mix food.  Until the mix became nationally available in 1910, Americans thought of pancakes only as a hearty wintertime breakfast.  But with the convenience offered by a mix, flapjacks were established as a quick anytime meal.  Here, weíve taken a few modern liberties with the favorite breakfast standby, with great results.
