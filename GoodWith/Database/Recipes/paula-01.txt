Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  4                     McIntosh apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  1                     container refrigerated flaky biscuit dough

For the filling:  Add the butter to a large saute pan and melt.  Add the apples, sugar, cinnamon, and lemon juice and cook over medium heat until the apples are soft, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.

When the filling is cool, roll the biscuits out on a lightly-floured surface so that each biscuit forms a 7- to 8-inch circle.  Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of the filling on 1/2 of each circle.  Brush the edges of the circle with water.  Fold the circle over the filling to make a half-moon shapes.  Seal by pressing the edges with the tines of a fork.

Heat a deep fryer or a deep pot halfway filled with oil to 350 degrees.

Carefully add the pies to the oil, 1 at a time, and fry until golden brown, turning the pies as necessary for even browning, about 5 to 8 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  8               ears  corn
  1              pound  bacon

Gently pull back the husk exposing the corn.  Do not remove the husk.  Remove the corn silk and use a brush to make sure all the silk is removed.  Soak the corn with the silks removed in water for 30 minutes.  This will prevent the husks from charring.

Preheat a grill to medium heat.

Remove from the water and pat dry.  Take a strip of bacon and wrap it around the corn.  Fold the corn leaves back over, covering the bacon and corn.  Tie the leaves with butcher string and repeat the process for each ear of corn.  Place the ears of corn on the hot grill and cook, turning occasionally until bacon is cooked and corn is tender, approximately 15 to 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RED VELVET POUND CAKE ===
  1                cup  butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  vegetable shortening
  3               cups  granulated sugar
  7                     eggs
  1             bottle  red food coloring - (1 oz)
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  3               cups  cake flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  milk
                        === MERINGUE ===
  6                     egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/2          cups  sugar
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  1             gallon  strawberry ice cream
                        Red Velvet Pound Cake -- (listed above)
                        Meringue -- (listed above)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.

Using a mixing bowl, combine the butter, shortening, and sugar and cream until light and fluffy.  Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add in the food coloring and vanilla.  Combine the flour and salt, and add to the creamed mixture alternating with the milk, beating well.

Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean.  Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn it out onto a cooling rack.

Preheat the broiler.

To make the meringue, place egg whites and cream of tartar into a mixing bowl.  Beat until soft peaks form.  Gradually add the sugar and beat until stiff and set aside.

To assemble the Baked Alaska you have to work quickly.  Slice the cake into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Spread top of 1/2 of the cake slices with about 1 cup strawberry ice cream.  Top with the remaining half of the cake slices.  Place on a sheet pan.  Spread meringue on all sides and form peaks using a knife.  Broil until the meringue is light brown.  Be careful not to burn peaks.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  ground 80% lean beef
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  cold water
  1                     onion -- sliced 1/4" thick
  4                     eggs
  4                     hamburger buns
  4             slices  American cheese

In a large bowl, season the ground beef with salt and pepper.  Add 1/2 cup cold water and mix by hand until meat has absorbed all the water (the water keeps the burgers moist and juicy).  Shape into 4 patties.

Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.  Spray the skillet with non-stick cooking spray.  Add the burgers and cook to desired temperature, about 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium-well.  Remove the burgers from the pan and set aside.

Add the onions slices to the same skillet and cook until golden brown on both sides, being careful to keep them in whole slices.  It should take about 3 minutes per side.  Remove from the pan and set aside.

Crack the eggs into the same skillet and cook until the yolk is not runny.  Carefully remove from the pan.

Lay the bottom of 4 hamburger buns on a flat surface.  Top each bun with a burger.  Top the burgers with 1 egg, onion slice, 1 slice of cheese and then the top bun.  Lightly press the sandwiches together with your hand.

Place the sandwiches into the pan and cook for 1 minute on each side to griddle the buns.  Serve with French fries and pickles.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     2/3           cup  soy sauce
  1              bunch  cilantro -- leaves chopped
     1/2           cup  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2               cups  water
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme - (to 4) -- leaves chopped
  1                     beef tenderloin - (abt 5 lbs) -- silver connective
                        tissue removed
                        Oil -- to brush grill

Preheat grill or oven to 350 degrees.

Prepare marinade by combining the bourbon, brown sugar, soy sauce, cilantro, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, water, and thyme in a bowl.  Make sure the tenderloin has been cleaned and the tissues has been removed.  Fold the tail end of the beef back underneath itself so that it is of uniform thickness and secure with butcher's string.  Place meat in a dish and pour marinade over meat, cover, and refrigerate for approximately 8 to 12 hours turning meat over several times.

When grill is ready, place meat on oiled surface and reserve the liquid from the marinade.  Cook over high heat with lid closed, turning meat often and occasionally basting with the marinade.  The tenderloin will cook to rare in approximately 30 to 45 minutes.

Serve with horseradish cream on the side.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  8 1/2                 semisweet chocolate squares - (1 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  butter
  3                     eggs -- separated
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  bourbon
     1/4           cup  flour
  1 1/2           cups  chopped pecans
                        === GANACHE ===
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1 1/4           cups  semisweet chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Grease and flour a 9-inch springform pan.  Melt the chocolate and butter in a small bowl over a double boiler.  Remove from heat, and set pot aside leaving the bowl on top of pot.

Whisk egg yolks and 1/2 of the sugar in a metal mixing bowl.  Place bowl over slightly simmering water, and whisk until yolks reach 140 degrees.  Remove bowl from heat and beat egg and sugar mixture with an electric mixer to a ribbon stage.  Add the Bourbon to the chocolate mixture, then fold the yolk and sugar mixture into the chocolate mixture.  Mix flour with pecans and fold into chocolate mixture.

Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites and 1/2 of the remaining sugar to form soft peaks, then fold into chocolate mixture.  Pour batter into prepared pan and bake for 20 to 25 minutes.  Allow cake to cool in pan and then place in the freezer for at least 2 hours.  Once it's frozen, remove sides of springform pan.  Invert cake onto a wire rack and remove bottom of springform pan.

Prepare ganache by bringing heavy cream to a boil and pouring cream over chocolate chips in a bowl.  Whisk until completely smooth.  Set wire rack with cake on top of sheetpan.  Pour warm lukewarm ganache over cake, coating cake completely, recoating if necessary.  Gently jiggle wire rack to help drain excess ganache.  Remove cake from wire rack with spatula and place on a serving plate.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  Velveeta cheese -- sliced
  1                cup  butter
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract

  2                     boxes confectioners' sugar - (16 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  cocoa powder

Spray lightly the bottom of a 9- by 2-inch square pan with a nonstick spray.

In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the cheese and butter together, stirring constantly until smooth.  Remove from heat and add the vanilla and nuts.

In a large bowl sift together the sugar and cocoa.  Pour the cheese mixture into the sugar and cocoa mixture and stir until completely mixed.  The candy will be very stiff.

Using your hands, remove candy from bowl and press evenly and firmly into pan.  Because of the amount of butter in this recipe, pat the top of the candy with a paper towel to remove the excess oil.  Place pan in refrigerator until candy is firm.

To serve candy, cut into squares.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  smoked meat
                        = (ham hocks, smoked turkey wings, or
                        smoked neck bones)
  1         tablespoon  House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  seasoned salt
  1         tablespoon  hot red pepper sauce
  1                     large bunch collard greens
  1         tablespoon  butter

In a large pot, bring 3 quarts of water to a boil and add smoked meat, House Seasoning, seasoned salt and hot sauce.  Reduce heat to medium and cook for 1 hour.

Wash the collard greens thoroughly.  Remove the stems that run down the center by holding the leaf in your left hand and stripping the leaf down with your right hand.  The tender young leaves in the heart of the collards don't need to be stripped.

Stack 6 to 8 leaves on top of one another, roll up, and slice into 1/2- to 1-inch thick slices.  Place greens in pot with meat and add butter.  Cook for 45 to 60 minutes, stirring occasionally.  When done taste and adjust seasoning.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LEMON DILL SAUCE ===
  1                cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
                        === CRAB CAKES ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                     green onion -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped red bell pepper
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  3        tablespoons  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1                     egg
     1/2      teaspoon  minced fresh parsley
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
  1              pound  white or claw crabmeat -- picked free of any
                        bits of shell
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil

To make the sauce, combine all of the ingredients in a bowl and stir well.  Refrigerate until chilled.  The sauce will thicken as it chills.

To prepare the crab cakes, melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat.  Saute the onion, bell pepper, and garlic until the pepper is limp, approximately 3 minutes.  Add the cream, mustard, 1 egg, parsley, cayenne pepper to taste, and 1/2 cup bread crumbs, and mix well.  Gently fold in the crabmeat.

Form the mixture into 8 patties, about 1/2-inch thick.  In a mixing bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 cup of bread crumbs with the Parmesan.  Pat this topping onto both sides of the patties.  Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.

Using a skillet, combine the oil and remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.  Saute the crab cakes in the hot oil-butter mixture for approximately 3 minutes on each side or until golden brown.  These crab cakes can also be baked for 7 to 10 minutes in a 400 degree oven.

To serve, spoon a dollop of the lemon dill sauce along side each crab cake.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     turkey - (abt 10 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  your favorite dry rub

Cooks Note:  To measure the amount of oil needed to fry the turkey, place turkey in fryer, add water to top of turkey, remove the turkey and the water line will indicate how much oil will be needed to fry your turkey.

Wash bird inside and out, and allow to drain.  Rub turkey all over with House Seasoning.  Coat turkey with dry rub.  Allow the bird to sit until it reaches room temperature.

Heat peanut oil in a turkey fryer or a very, very large stockpot to 350 degrees.  Lower turkey into hot oil, making sure it is fully submerged.  Fry turkey for 3 minutes per pound plus 5 minutes per bird.  Remove turkey from oil and drain on paper towels.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     eggs
     1/4           cup  milk
  4                     ripe bananas
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped walnuts
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  8             slices  egg bread
  4        tablespoons  butter
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting
                        Maple syrup or jam -- for serving

In a large shallow bowl, using a fork, beat the eggs until lightly frothy.  Stir in the milk and set aside.  Peel the bananas into a small bowl and mash them with a fork.  Stir in the walnuts and the nutmeg.

Spread the banana mixture over half of the bread slices, leaving a 1/4-inch border uncovered on all edges.  Top with the remaining bread slices and press down gently to seal.

Place 2 sandwiches in the egg mixture and press down gently.  Turn over and let soak for a moment until evenly saturated on both sides.  Repeat with the other 2 remaining sandwiches.

In a frying pan or on a griddle, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.  Place the sandwiches on griddle and fry until the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Add the remaining butter, flip the sandwiches with a spatula and fry until golden brown.

To serve place the toast on plates and dust with confectioners' sugar.  Serve with maple syrup or jam.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     egg whites -- room temperature
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  2          teaspoons  white vinegar
     3/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
  1             square  unsweetened chocolate - (2 oz)
  4                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  water
  1                cup  heavy cream -- whipped

  1                cup  heavy cream -- whipped
                        Chocolate shavings

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Grease a 9-inch pie pan.

To make the meringue, beat egg whites with a hand held electric mixer until soft peaks form.  In a separate bowl, mix the sugar and cornstarch together, then add 2 tablespoons at a time to the egg whites, beating well between each addition.  After the third addition, add the white vinegar.  Before the last addition, add the vanilla extract.  Place into the pie shell and press against sides to form a pie crust.  Place in oven and turn off oven heat.  Leave pie in oven at least 3 hours.

For filling, melt chocolate in a bowl over a double boiler.  In another bowl, beat the yolks, sugar, salt, and water thoroughly.  Stir mixture into melted chocolate.  Cook mixture over double boiler stirring constantly until very thick.  Cool mixture completely.

Fold chocolate mixture into whipped cream.  Pour into cooled shell and chill overnight.

Top with remaining whipped cream and garnish with chocolate shavings.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Candies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  sugar
  1                cup  white corn syrup
     3/4           cup  cold water
  3                     egg whites
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla
  2               cups  chopped pecans

In a heavy saucepan over medium heat, stir together the sugar, corn syrup, and water.  Stir only until sugar has dissolved.  Do not stir after this point.  Cook syrup mixture until it reaches 250 degrees on a candy thermometer, bringing it to a hard ball stage.

While the syrup is cooking, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Once the sugar mixture reaches 250 degrees, carefully pour a slow steady stream of syrup into the stiffly beaten egg whites, beating constantly at high speed.  Add the vanilla and continue to beat until mixture holds its shape, approximately 5 minutes.  Stir in pecans.

Using 2 spoons, drop the divinity onto waxed paper, using 1 spoon to push the candy off the other.  This may take a little practice because the technique is to twirl the pushing spoon, making the candy look like the top of a soft serve ice cream.  If the candy becomes too stiff, add a few drops of hot water.  You will need to work fast when making this type of candy.

After you spoon the cooked sugar and nuts onto the waxed paper, you're done.  Cool the candies on racks completely.  You can store them in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  6                     egg -- separated
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1               pint  heavy cream
  4              pints  milk

Caution: The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     eggs -- separated
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
     3/4           cup  cake flour -- sifted
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting, sifted
  1                cup  jam or jelly -- stirred well
                        Whipped cream

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

In a small bowl beat egg whites until stiff but not dry and set aside.  In another bowl, beat the egg yolks until light.  Gradually add the sugar and vanilla, and mix well.  Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.  Add the sifted flour mixture to the egg yolk mixture.  Fold in the egg whites into the egg mixture and pour the batter into a 15- by 10- by 1-inch jelly-roll pan lined with waxed paper.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until the cake is golden.

Loosen edges of cake, invert cake onto a towel dusted with confectioners' sugar.  Gently peel wax paper off cake.  Trim 1/4-inch of hard crust off each long side of the jelly-roll cake.  Begin with the narrow side and roll the cake and towel up together.  Cool cake on rack, seam-side down, for 10 to 15 minutes.

Once cake has cooled, gently unroll and spread cake with jam or jelly and re-roll.  Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar or cover with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  4               cups  sliced peeled peaches
  2               cups  sugar -- divided
     1/2           cup  water
  8        tablespoons  butter

  1 1/2           cups  milk

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Butter the sides of a heavy 2-quart saucepan.  Place the sugar, salt, and corn syrup, milk, and butter in saucepan.  Over medium heat, stir mixture constantly with a wooden spoon until sugars have dissolved and mixture comes to a boil.  Continue to cook to a soft ball stage, approximately 236 degrees on a candy thermometer.  If you do a cold water test, the ball of candy will flatten when you take it out of the water.  Remove from heat and allow to cool for 10 minutes.

Add the vanilla and nuts, and beat with a spoon by hand for approximately 2 minutes or until candy is slightly thick and begins to lose its gloss.  Quickly drop heaping tablespoons onto waxed paper.  If the candy becomes stiff, add a few drops of hot water.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  1            package  butterscotch chips - (12 oz)
  1                cup  marshmallow cream
     1/2           cup  nonfat instant powdered milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2                bag caramel candies -- approx 22 pieces
  2        tablespoons  milk
  2               cups  salted cocktail peanuts -- coarsely chopped

In a medium-size glass bowl, melt the butterscotch chips in the microwave on high for 2 minutes.  Remove bowl and stir in the marshmallow cream and powdered milk.  Add the vanilla and mix well.  The mixture will be very thick.

At this point use your hands and knead the mixture almost like bread dough.  Roll the mixture into walnut-size pieces and shape like your little finger.  Place finger shapes onto waxed paper to set.

In a separate bowl, melt the caramels and milk together in the microwave on high for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Remove from microwave and stir well.  Roll set fingers into the caramel, making sure the caramel is not too hot and will burn your fingers.  Once rolled in caramel, immediately roll in chopped nuts, and place back on the waxed paper to harden.

This recipe yields 20 pieces.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  Vidalia onions
  4                     beef bouillon cubes
  4        tablespoons  butter
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare a fire in a charcoal grill or preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Trim and slice from the top of each onion, and peel the onion without cutting off the root end.  Using a potato peeler, cut a small cone shaped section from the center of the onion.  Cut the onion into quarters from the top down, stopping within a 1/2-inch of the root end.

Place a bouillon cube in the center of each onion, slip slivers of butter between the sections, and sprinkle with pepper.  Wrap each onion in heavy duty foil and place the onions directly onto the hot coals.  Cook the onions for 45 minutes turning every so often.

To serve, place each onion in individual bowl because the onions will produce a lot of broth, which tastes like French onion soup.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  Idaho potatoes
                        Vegetable oil -- for coating
  8        tablespoons  butter
  2               cups  grated cheddar cheese -- plus
                        more for sprinkling
  2               cups  grated Monterey Jack
  2               cups  sour cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  shrimp -- peeled, sauteed
                        Paprika -- to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Begin by washing potatoes, drying them, and gently pricking them with a fork on the sides.  Coat each potato with vegetable oil, place on foil covered pan, and bake for approximately 1 hour.

Place the butter in a large bowl.  Remove the potatoes from the oven and slice each potato in half.  Gently scoop out the potato and place in the bowl.  Using a mixer on high, mix the potatoes, butter, sour cream, salt, and pepper.  Fold the shrimp and both cheeses into the mixture.

Gently stuff the mixture back into the potato shells, making sure not to break them.  Pile the mixture as high as you can on top of the potato shells.  Sprinkle each potato with cheese and paprika for color.  Bake in the oven for approximately 20 to 30 minutes until browned on top.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     eggs
     1/3           cup  water
  1                cup  hot red pepper sauce -- more or less
                        = (Texas Pete suggested)
  2               cups  self-rising flour
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  1                     chicken - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- cut into pieces
                        Oil -- for frying,
                        = (preferably peanut oil)

In a medium-size bowl, beat the eggs with the water.  Add enough hot sauce so the egg mixture is bright orange.  In another bowl, combine the flour and pepper.  Season the chicken with the House Seasoning.  Dip the seasoned chicken in the egg, and then coat well in the flour mixture.

Heat the oil to 350 degrees in a deep pot.  Do not fill the pot more than 1/2 full with oil.  Fry the chicken in the shortening until brown and crisp.  Dark meat takes longer then white meat.  It should take dark meat about 13 to 14 minutes, white meat around 8 to 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  red bell peppers
     3/4         pound  ground chuck
     1/2         pound  ground pork
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  beef bouillon granules
  2          teaspoons  House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  cooked rice
     1/2           cup  jarred cheese and salsa
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1                cup  diced tomatoes
     1/2           cup  chopped green onion tops
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1                cup  hot water

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Start by cutting the peppers in half lengthwise, leaving the stems intact, and halving them also.  Remove the seeds and ribs inside the peppers.

Using a hot skillet, saute the ground beef, pork, onion, garlic, 1 teaspoon of bouillon granules, and House Seasoning together.  Saute until onions become translucent.  Drain the fat off.  Add the rice, cheese, sour cream, tomatoes, green onion tops, and soy sauce.  Mix well and stuff the mixture into the peppers.

In a small bowl, mix the hot water and the remaining bouillon granules.  Pour this mixture into a shallow casserole large enough to hold all of the peppers.  Place the stuffed peppers in the dish, cover with foil and bake for 25 to 35 minutes.  Remove the foil and spoon the juice from bottom of the casserole over the top of the peppers.  Bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHORTCAKES ===
  4               cups  bisquick
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1 1/2            cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  melted butter
  1 1/2      teaspoons  almond flavoring
                        === PEACHES ===
  6                     peaches
  1           teaspoon  Fruit Fresh (fruit preservative)
                        Splash of warm water
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
                        === WHIPPED CREAM ===
  2               cups  heavy whipping cream
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        === TOPPINGS ===
                        Vanilla Ice Cream
                        Mint sprigs

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

To make the shortcakes, mix the bisquick, sugar, milk, butter, and almond flavoring in a medium-size bowl and pour into 12 well greased muffin tins.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until done and remove from oven.  Cool for 5 minutes and pop out of pans.

Peel, core, and slice the peaches.  Immediately sprinkle with Fruit Fresh to prevent peaches from turning dark.  Add a splash of warm water to the peaches to moisten.  Stir the sugar into the peaches, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.

In a large mixing bowl or mixer, combine the heavy cream and sugar, and whip until peaks start to form.

To serve, split the biscuit in half and place bottom half on a plate.  Top with 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream, pour fresh peaches and syrup on top, and place top half of biscuit over ice cream and fruit.  Ladle more fresh peaches on top and finish with a dollop of whipped cream.  Garnish with a mint sprig.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

To make the shortcakes, mix the bisquick, sugar, milk, butter, and almond flavoring in a medium-size bowl and pour into 12 well greased muffin tins.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until done and remove from oven.  Cool for 5 minutes and pop out of pans.

Peel, core, and slice the peaches.  Immediately sprinkle with Fruit Fresh to prevent peaches from turning dark.  Add a splash of warm water to the peaches to moisten.  Stir the sugar into the peaches, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.

In a large mixing bowl or mixer, combine the heavy cream and sugar, and whip until peaks start to form.

To serve, split the biscuit in half and place bottom half on a plate.  Top with 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream, pour fresh peaches and syrup on top, and place top half of biscuit over ice cream and fruit.  Ladle more fresh peaches on top and finish with a dollop of whipped cream.  Garnish with a mint sprig.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2               cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  vegetable shortening
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  buttermilk
  1                cup  boiling water
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  2           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2           cup  cocoa
                        === FILLING ===
  5        tablespoons  flour
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  vegetable shortening
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the sugar and shortening until fluffy.  Add eggs and continue to beat.  Stir together buttermilk, boiling water, vanilla, and blend this into the creamed mixture at low speed.

Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and cocoa.  Add to mixture 1 cup at a time, blending well at low speed.  Batter will be very thin but do not worry.  Drop by teaspoons onto ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake for 5 minutes.  Allow to cool and transfer onto waxed paper.

To make the filling, place flour into saucepan and slowly add milk, stirring until smooth.  Set over medium heat and cook, stirring until very thick.  Mixture should become as thick as solid vegetable shortening.  Remove from heat and allow to cool completely.

In a medium bowl, cream together sugar, butter, shortening, and vanilla using a handheld electric mixer.  Add the cooled flour mixture and whip until fluffy.  Spread onto bottom side of cookie and top with another cookie to make a sandwich.  Wrap individually in plastic wrap and store in refrigerator.

This recipe yields 25 pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sesame seeds
  1                     box light brown sugar - (16 oz)
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  white vinegar

Heavily butter an 11- by 2-inch pyrex baking dish.

Wash sesame seeds and remove any debris that may be in the seeds and drain well.  Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until a drop of water bounces around the skillet.  Pour seeds into skillet and stir constantly.  Dry and parch seeds until light brown, approximately 2 minutes.  Do not burn seeds.

In a heavy saucepan, combine and melt the sugar, butter, milk and vinegar.  Using a wooden spoon, stir constantly until ingredients are dissolved.  Cook over medium-high heat to light crack stage.  If using a candy thermometer, the temperature should be between 265 and 285 degrees.  Once it reaches the desired temperature, remove from heat and beat in the sesame seeds with your spoon.  Pour immediately into prepared dish.  Score candy while still warm and cut into squares when cool.
