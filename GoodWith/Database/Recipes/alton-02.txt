Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  cake flour -- sifted
  12                    egg whites -- the closer to room
                        temperature the better
     1/3           cup  warm water
  1           teaspoon  orange extract
                        = (or extract of your choice)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cream of tartar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a food processor spin sugar about 2 minutes until it is superfine.  Sift half of the sugar with the salt and the cake flour, setting the remaining sugar aside.

In a large bowl, use a balloon whisk to thoroughly combine egg whites, water, orange extract, and cream of tartar.  After 2 minutes, switch to a hand mixer.  Slowly sift the reserved sugar, beating continuously at medium speed.  Once you have achieved medium peaks, sift enough of the flour mixture in to dust the top of the foam.  Using a spatula fold in gently.  Continue until all of the flour mixture is incorporated.

Carefully spoon mixture into an ungreased tube pan.  Bake for 35 minutes before checking for doneness with a wooden skewer.  (When inserted halfway between the inner and outer wall, the skewer should come out dry).

Cool upside down on cooling rack for at least an hour before removing from pan.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Cook's Note:  Since they're easier to separate, use the freshest eggs you can get.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     eggplant
  2                     garlic cloves
  2             ounces  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  tahini
     1/2         bunch  parsley -- leaves only
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Pierce some holes in the skin of the eggplant (to avoid explosion) and grill over medium-high heat turning every 7 minutes, until the skin is blackened and the body is nice and soft.  Total time for grilling is about 30 minutes.  If you do not have a grill you can roast your eggplant in a 375 degree oven for about 30 minutes.

Remove eggplant from the grill and let cool.

Once the eggplant is cool enough to handle, peel away the skin and discard.  Place the eggplant flesh in a colander and drain for 10 minutes.

In a food processor, combine garlic, lemon juice, tahini and parsley and pulse to combine.  Add the eggplant flesh.  Season with salt and pepper and pulse to combine.  Adjust the flavor with more Tahini or lemon juice if you prefer.  If it's bitter, some sugar or honey will help.  Research shows that the white variety of plant is sweeter in flavor.

This recipe yields 1 cup.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     eggs -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  dark corn syrup
  10            ounces  butter -- cubed, and
                        at room temperature

In a large mixing bowl, whip the eggs until light and fluffy.

In a small saucepan bring the sugar and the corn syrup to a boil.  Lubricate the inside of a metal baster with a small amount of vegetable oil and dispense it completely.  Then use this to drizzle the sugar mixture into the mixing bowl with the eggs.  The mixer should be on low speed until you finish drizzling in all of the sugar mixture.

Once the entire mixture of the sugar is incorporated, slowly add the butter pieces.  Only add more butter when you can no longer see the previously added pieces.  It will go fast at first and then slow down.  Continue to whip until the mixture is creamy.

This recipe yields enough for 1 (2-layer) 9-inch cake.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."

              Butternut Dumplings With Brown Butter And Sage

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Dumplings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2          small  butternut squash -- halved and seeded
  4             medium  baking (russet) potatoes -- pierced
  1                     egg
  1 1/2    tablespoons  kosher salt
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        additional for dusting
                        Oil -- as needed
  1              bunch  sage -- leaves chiffonade
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

On a sheet pan, place the squash flesh-side down and roast until very tender (about 45 minutes).  At the same time, bake potatoes directly on the rack of oven for 1 hour.

Split the potatoes and allow to cool slightly, or until you can handle them.  Don't let them cool completely.  Scoop the flesh of the potatoes and the squash into a bowl and mash with a hand masher.  Mix in the egg, salt and nutmeg.  Then add the flour and mix until a soft dough forms.  Do not do this in a mixer, it will overwork the dough.  Add flour by the spoonful if it's still too moist.

Turn out onto a floured board and divide into 8 portions.  Roll out into ropes and cut into 1/2-inch pieces.  Line the pieces up on a floured sheet pan as you work.  At this point you could freeze them on the pan until solid, then transfer to zip top bags and store in the freezer.

In a large pot of boiling, salted water gently drop in the dumplings.  Don't overcrowd.  As they begin to float, remove them with a slotted spoon and toss them into an ice bath.

Drain off the water and toss in a little oil.  Store loosely in containers until ready to use.

To reheat, in a saute pan over high heat add 1 tablespoon of soft butter.  Cook until the butter begins to foam and turn brown.  Add 2 teaspoons sage leaves and 1 cup of dumplings.  Cook for an additional minute until the dumplings are heated through.  Repeat until you have desired amount of servings.  Plate and top with freshly grated Parmesan.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On a sheet pan, place the squash flesh-side down and roast until very tender (about 45 minutes).  At the same time, bake potatoes directly on the rack of oven for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Split the potatoes and allow to cool slightly, or until you can handle them.  Don&apos;t let them cool completely.  Scoop the flesh of the potatoes and the squash into a bowl and mash with a hand masher.  Mix in the egg, salt and nutmeg.  Then add the flour and mix until a soft dough forms.  Do not do this in a mixer, it will overwork the dough.  Add flour by the spoonful if it&apos;s still too moist.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn out onto a floured board and divide into 8 portions.  Roll out into ropes and cut into 1/2-inch pieces.  Line the pieces up on a floured sheet pan as you work.  At this point you could freeze them on the pan until solid, then transfer to zip top bags and store in the freezer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large pot of boiling, salted water gently drop in the dumplings.  Don&apos;t overcrowd.  As they begin to float, remove them with a slotted spoon and toss them into an ice bath.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain off the water and toss in a little oil.  Store loosely in containers until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To reheat, in a saute pan over high heat add 1 tablespoon of soft butter.  Cook until the butter begins to foam and turn brown.  Add 2 teaspoons sage leaves and 1 cup of dumplings.  Cook for an additional minute until the dumplings are heated through.  Repeat until you have desired amount of servings.  Plate and top with freshly grated Parmesan.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Butter -- as needed for mold
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan
  3        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/8      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1 1/3           cups  milk -- hot
  4              large  egg yolks
  6             ounces  sharp Cheddar
  5                     egg whites -- plus
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar

Use room temperature butter to grease an 8-inch souffle mold.  Add the grated Parmesan and roll around the mold to cover the sides.  Cover with plastic wrap and place into the freezer for 5 minutes.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks to a creamy consistency.  Temper the yolks into the milk mixture, constantly whisking.  Remove from the heat and add the cheese.  Whisk until incorporated.

In a separate bowl, using a hand mixer, whip the egg whites and cream of tartar until glossy and firm.  Add 1/4 of the mixture to the base.  Continue to add the whites by thirds, folding very gently.

Pour the mixture into the souffle.  Fill the souffle to 1/2-inch from the top.  Place on an aluminum pie pan.  Bake in the oven for 35 minutes.

Serving Size  : 15    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ham                             Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     city-style (brined) ham -- hock end*
     1/4           cup  brown mustard
  2               cups  dark brown sugar
  1              ounce  bourbon
                        = (poured into a spritz bottle)
  2               cups  crushed ginger snap cookies

Heat oven to 250 degrees.

Remove ham from bag, rinse and drain thoroughly.  Place ham, cut-side down, in a roasting pan.  Using a small paring knife or clean utility knife set to the smallest blade setting, score the ham from bottom to top, spiraling clockwise as you cut.  (If you're using a paring knife, be careful to only cut through the skin and first few layers of fat).  Rotate the ham after each cut so that the scores are no more than 2-inches across.  Once you've made it all the way around, move the knife to the other hand and repeat, spiraling counter clockwise.  The aim is to create a diamond pattern all over the ham.  (Don't worry too much about precision here.)

Tent the ham with heavy duty foil, insert a thermometer, and cook for 3 to 4 hours or until the internal temperature at the deepest part of the meat registers 130 degrees.

Remove and use tongs to pull away the diamonds of skin and any sheets of fat that come off with them.

Heat oven to 350 degrees.

Dab dry with paper towels, then brush on a liberal coat of mustard, using either a basting brush or a clean paint brush (clean as in never-touched paint).  Sprinkle on brown sugar, packing loosely as you go until the ham is coated.  Spritz this layer lightly with bourbon, then loosely pack on as much of the crushed cookies as you can.

Insert the thermometer (don't use the old hole) and return to the oven (uncovered).  Cook until interior temperature reaches 140 degrees, approximately 1 hour.

Let the roast rest for 1/2 hour before carving.

This recipe yields 10 to 15 servings.

* Cook's note:  A city ham is basically any brined ham that's packed in a plastic bag, held in a refrigerated case and marked "ready to cook", "partially cooked" or "ready to serve".  Better city hams are also labeled "ham in natural juices".

Remove ham from bag, rinse and drain thoroughly.  Place ham, cut-side down, in a roasting pan.  Using a small paring knife or clean utility knife set to the smallest blade setting, score the ham from bottom to top, spiraling clockwise as you cut.  (If you&apos;re using a paring knife, be careful to only cut through the skin and first few layers of fat).  Rotate the ham after each cut so that the scores are no more than 2-inches across.  Once you&apos;ve made it all the way around, move the knife to the other hand and repeat, spiraling counter clockwise.  The aim is to create a diamond pattern all over the ham.  (Don&apos;t worry too much about precision here.)

Tent the ham with heavy duty foil, insert a thermometer, and cook for 3 to 4 hours or until the internal temperature at the deepest part of the meat registers 130 degrees.

              Clams On The Half Shell With Fresh Mayonnaise

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  24                    littleneck clams -- steamed, chilled
                        === MAYONNAISE ===
  2          teaspoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  champagne vinegar
  1                     egg yolk
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
  2            pinches  sugar
  1                cup  oil -- safflower or corn

In a bowl, combine lemon juice and champagne vinegar.

In a separate glass bowl, whisk together egg yolk and dry ingredients.

Add half of the lemon juice mixture to the dry ingredients.  Mix well before adding any oil.  Begin adding oil, a little at a time, until it is incorporated into the emulsion.  The color should lighten once 1/4 of the oil is emulsified.  Then add the oil in a slow constant stream, whisking continuously.  After 3/4 of the oil is incorporated, add the rest of the lemon juice mixture.

Continue to whisk until all of the oil is incorporated.  Leave at room temperature for 1 hour.  Refrigerate, covered, for up to 1 week.

Serve one teaspoon mayonnaise on top of chilled clams on the half shell.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Variations:  Add 1 tablespoon of any of the following ingredients: roasted garlic, basil chiffonade, chopped chipotle peppers, finely diced roasted red peppers, or prepared horseradish to one cup of mayonnaise.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."

                        Soft butter -- for the pan
                        Flour -- for dusting pan
  4              large  eggs
  1                cup  sugar -- sifted
  1                cup  brown sugar -- sifted
  8             ounces  melted butter
  1 1/4           cups  cocoa -- sifted
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  flour -- sifted
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Butter and flour an 8-inch square pan.

In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the eggs at medium speed until fluffy and light yellow.  Add both sugars.  Add remaining ingredients, and mix to combine.

Pour the batter into a greased and floured 8-inch square pan and bake for 45 minutes.  Check for doneness with the tried-and-true toothpick method: a toothpick inserted into the center of the pan should come out clean.

When it's done, remove to a rack to cool.  Resist the temptation to cut into it until it's mostly cool.

This recipe yields 16 brownies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     country (dry cured) ham
  1              liter  Dr. Pepper
  1                cup  sweet pickle juice -- (optional)

Unwrap ham and scrub off any surface mold (if you hung in a sack for 6 months you'd have mold too).  Carefully remove hock with hand saw.  (If this idea makes you eye your first aid kit, ask your butcher to do it.  But make sure you keep the hock, it's the best friend collard greens ever had.)

Place ham in cooler and cover with clean water.  (As long as it's not too dirty you can use what southerners call the "hose pipe").  Stash the cooler in the bushes.  If it's summer, throw in some ice.  If it's freezing out, keep the cooler inside.  Change the water twice a day for two days turning the ham each time.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Place ham in a large disposable turkey-roasting pan and add enough Dr. Pepper to come about halfway up the side of the ham.  Add pickle juice if you've got it and tent completely with heavy-duty foil.  Cook for 1/2 hour then reduce heat to 325 degrees, and cook another 1 1/2 hours.

Turn the ham over, insert an oven safe thermometer (probe-style is best) and cook another 1 1/2 hours, or until the deepest part of the ham hits 140 degrees (approximately 15 to 20 minutes per pound total).

Let rest 1/2 hour then slice paper-thin.  Serve with biscuits or soft yeast rolls.

This recipe yields 20 servings.

Cooks note:  Even after soaking, country ham is quite salty, so thin slicing is mandatory.  If you're a bacon fan, however, cut a thicker (1/4-inch) slice and fry it up for breakfast.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  butter
     1/2           cup  sliced yellow onion
  4                     strips cooked bacon -- crumbled
  8                     eggs
  12            ounces  milk
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
  6             ounces  cheddar -- shredded
  6                     Savory Crepes -- (see recipe)
                        Butter -- for coating pan

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a small saute pan, melt the butter and sweat the onions until translucent.  In a small bowl, mix the onions and crumbled bacon together.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk, and season with salt and pepper.

In a large, non-stick, 6-cup muffin tin, place one crepe into each cup.  Make sure that the edges of the crepes are slightly pleated and overlap the edge of the tin slightly.  Spoon the bacon and onion mixture into each cup.  Distribute the cheese evenly into the cups.  Pour the egg mixture into each cup so that all of the quiches are the same size.  Place into a preheated oven for 15 minutes or until the egg mixture is completely set.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                Dry Aged Standing Rib Roast With Sage Jus

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     standing (4-bone-in) rib roast
                        = (preferably from the loin end)
                        Canola oil -- to coat roast
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  red wine
  4                     fresh sage leaves

Remove any plastic wrapping or butcher's paper from the roast.  Place the standing rib roast upright onto a half sheet pan fitted with a rack.  The rack is essential for drainage.  Place dry towels loosely on top of the roast.  This will help to draw moisture away from the meat.  Place into a refrigerator at approximately 50 to 60 percent humidity and between 34 and 38 degrees.  You can measure both with a refrigerator thermometer.  Change the towels daily for 3 days.

Place a 16-inch round azalea terra cotta planter into a cold oven.  Invert the planter to become a lid over a pizza stone or the bottom of the planter.  The oven should be cold to start, to avoid any cracking in the terra cotta pieces.  Turn the oven to 250 degrees.

Remove the roast from the refrigerator and rub with canola oil.  Remember to rub the bones with oil, as well.  Once the roast is completely coated with oil cover the roast with kosher salt, about half a teaspoon per bone.  Next, rub with freshly ground pepper to coat the surface.  Place the roast over a glass bake-ware dish slightly smaller than the length of the roast.  This will catch the drippings needed for the sauce.  Finally, place a probe thermometer into the center of the roast and set for 118 degrees.  Put the roast and the bake-ware dish onto the pizza stone, cover with the terra cotta pot, and return to the oven.  Turn the oven down to 200 degrees and roast until internal temperature is achieved.

Remove the roast and turn oven up to 500 degrees.  Remove the terra cotta lid and recover with heavy-duty foil.  Allow the roast to rest until an internal temperature of 130 degrees is reached.  Place the roast back into the preheated 500 degree oven for about 10 minutes or until you've achieved your desired crust.  Remove and transfer roast to a cutting board.  Keep covered with foil until ready to serve.

Degrease the juices in the glass pan.  Place the pan over low heat and deglaze with 1 cup of water.  Add the wine and reduce by half.  Roll the sage leaves in between your fingers to release the flavors and aroma.  Add to the sauce and cook for 1 minute.  Strain and serve on the side.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     medium-large eggplants
                        Kosher salt -- for purging
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  chile flakes
  4              small  tomatoes -- seeded and chopped
     1/2           cup  cream
  4        tablespoons  basil chiffonade
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Peel each eggplant leaving 1-inch of skin at the top and bottom unpeeled.  Slice the eggplant thinly lengthwise, about 1/4-inch thick.  Evenly coat each slice with the salt and purge on a sheet pan fitted with a rack for 30 minutes.  Rinse with cold water and roll in paper towels to dry.  Slice the pieces into thin strips to resemble pasta.

In a large saute pan heat the oil.  Add the garlic and chili flakes and toast.  Add the eggplant "pasta" and toss to coat.  Add the tomatoes and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the cream and increase heat to thicken sauce.  Finally add the basil and Parmesan and toss to combine.  Season with pepper, no salt needed as the eggplant will have residual salt from the purge.  Serve immediately.

                      Fish Roll With Compound Butter

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 9     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     thin salmon fillets
  3                     flounder fillets
  8                     sea scallops
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh dill
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Canola oil -- for brushing
                        === COMPOUND BUTTER ===
  4             ounces  butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  dry parsley flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

On your counter top lay out a sheet of parchment paper and top it with a layer of plastic wrap.

Lay out your fillets of salmon, tails away from you.  Overlap the fillets of flounder about 1-inch over the tails of the salmon.  Then place the scallops on a metal skewer and set at the end of the flounder furthest from you.  Sprinkle the herbs over the fish and season with salt and pepper.

Using the plastic wrap pull the fish towards you so that the plastic begins to pull the flounder over the scallops.  Be sure not to roll the plastic into the fish roll.  Use a sheet pan to push the roll tightly as you pull the plastic toward you.  The roll should be tight and you should be able to remove the sheet of plastic.  Then roll the fish in the parchment away from you so it is covered and can be placed into the refrigerator.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.

For Compound Butter:  In a large bowl using a wooden spoon mix all ingredients.  Place the mixture on a piece of parchment and fold the parchment over itself.  Pull to form a roll and twist the ends.  Place in the freezer for 10 minutes to set up.  Slice into 1/4-inch rounds and remove the parchment.

Preheat your broiler and place the oven rack 6-inches from the heating element.

Remove the metal skewer and slice the roulade into 3/4- to 1-inch rounds.  Place onto a broiler pan and brush each round with canola oil.  Put under the broiler for 3 to 6 minutes depending on how well done you like your fish.

Serve with 1 slice of compound butter on each fish roll.

This recipe yields 9 servings.

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  2              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  water
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

By Hand:  On a clean surface make a well with the flour.  In a measuring cup mix the eggs, water and oil and salt.  Pour the wet mixture slowly into the flour and mix with your 2 fingers until all of the wet is incorporated.  Do not force the dough to take all of the flour.  If you are going to use a pasta machine to roll out the dough you may at this point form the dough into a disk and cover with plastic wrap.  Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour to rest.  If you going to roll this by hand you should knead the dough on a floured work surface for 8 to 10 minutes.

By Food Processor:  In the bowl of your food processor combine the flour and salt and pulse 2 to 3 times.  In a liquid measuring cup whisk the eggs, water and oil.  While pulsing the machine pour this mixture in a continuous stream and continue running the machine until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.  Follow directions above for hand rolling or machine.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sheet puff pastry -- thawed
                        Sugar -- for dusting
  1                     Granny Smith apple -- peeled, cored,
                        and quartered
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
                        Apricot jam -- as needed

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Crimp seams of puff pastry together with fingertips.  Dust both sides of pastry with sugar.  Using a rolling pin, roll pastry in each direction to close seams.  Using a sharp pizza cutter (and tracing a small plate) cut out 2 circles of pastry.  Place pastry circles on a chilled sheet pan and let cool in the refrigerator for a few minutes.

Using a vegetable peeler cut wafer thin apple slices.  Put apple slices in lemon-juice-spiked water.

Flip pastry circles over on the sheet pans and poke them with a fork to provide an outlet for steam.  Put parchment paper on the pan underneath the pastry circles.  Sprinkle pastry with sugar and arrange apple slices on top.

Bake in the middle of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes.  Poke the crust; if it feels soft it needs more time in the oven.

Microwave some apricot jam for 30 seconds.  Dab (don't brush) the jam on the tarts.  Cool tarts at least 4 hours and seal in a resealable plastic bag.

Serve at room temperature or heat in the microwave and top with ice cream.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

<DirT>
Crimp seams of puff pastry together with fingertips.  Dust both sides of pastry with sugar.  Using a rolling pin, roll pastry in each direction to close seams.  Using a sharp pizza cutter (and tracing a small plate) cut out 2 circles of pastry.  Place pastry circles on a chilled sheet pan and let cool in the refrigerator for a few minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a vegetable peeler cut wafer thin apple slices.  Put apple slices in lemon-juice-spiked water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Flip pastry circles over on the sheet pans and poke them with a fork to provide an outlet for steam.  Put parchment paper on the pan underneath the pastry circles.  Sprinkle pastry with sugar and arrange apple slices on top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake in the middle of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes.  Poke the crust; if it feels soft it needs more time in the oven.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Microwave some apricot jam for 30 seconds.  Dab (don&apos;t brush) the jam on the tarts.  Cool tarts at least 4 hours and seal in a resealable plastic bag.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve at room temperature or heat in the microwave and top with ice cream.

It is very important to sterilize all equipment that will come into contact with the beer.  Also the hops, yeast, and Irish moss need to be kept refrigerated until use.  Begin by sterilizing your equipment that you will use to boil the mash; the pot, metal spoon, probe of the probe thermometer, colander and strainer, including the fermenter.  To sterilize everything put 2 ounces of non-scented household bleach and 3 to 4 gallons of water into the fermenter.  Place other smaller items in the solution to soak.  The items that are too large to fit into the fermenter can be sterilized by pouring the solution in the fermenter into and over these items and then thoroughly rinsing all equipment, including the fermenter.

After sterilization is complete you can begin brewing beer by adding 2 gallons of spring water as well as the 1/2 pound milled grain to your pot and turn the burner on to medium-high.  Place the probe thermometer into the pot and set the temperature to 155 degrees, once the liquid reaches 155 degrees set a timer for 30 minutes.

In the meantime soak the container of liquid malt extract in warm water; it will aid in removing it from the container.  After the grain has cooked for 30 minutes add 1 gallon of water and the liquid malt extract and bring to a boil stirring so that the extract does not burn on the bottom until dissolved.  The liquid will foam up to the top; when it does this, turn the heat off and let it settle then turn the heat back on and bring to a boil.  Let it foam again and turn the heat off, let it settle and turn the heat back on and add the hops.  Add 1-ounce of the Cascade hops and 3/4-ounce of Kent goldings hops and boil for 10 minutes.  Next add 1/2 teaspoon Irish moss and boil for 5 minutes.  Now add the last hops, 1 ounce Kent Goldings, cover, turn off the heat and let sit for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile put the last gallon and 1 pint of water as well as the bag of ice into the fermenter and fit the top with the colander and mesh strainer.  Strain the mash into the fementer and allow to cool to 80 degrees before pitching the yeast.  Once the mash is cooled to 80 degrees it is now safe to add the yeast, shake the vial until the liquid is well mixed and then add to the fermenter.  Cover with the lid and put airlock in place.  Put into cool dark place to ferment for 7 to 10 days.

Attach the siphon on the spigot and transfer beer from one fermenter to the second one.  Add the sugar/water mixture.  Bottle using the wand.  Cap and place into a cool dark place for another 10 to 14 days.

Open and enjoy.

This recipe yields 5 gallons.

  1                     sheep stomach
  1                     sheep liver
  1                     sheep heart
  1                     sheep tongue
     1/2         pound  suet -- minced
  3             medium  onions -- minced
     1/2         pound  dry oats -- toasted
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried ground herbs

Rinse the stomach thoroughly and soak overnight in cold salted water.

Rinse the liver, heart, and tongue.  In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook these parts over medium heat for 2 hours.  Remove and mince.  Remove any gristle or skin and discard.

In a large bowl, combine the minced liver, heart, tongue, suet, onions, and toasted oats.  Season with salt, pepper, and dried herbs.  Moisten with some of the cooking water so the mixture binds.

Remove the stomach from the cold salted water and fill 2/3 with the mixture.  Sew or tie the stomach closed.  Use a turning fork to pierce the stomach several times.  This will prevent the haggis from bursting.

In a large pot of boiling water, gently place the filled stomach, being careful not to splash.  Cook over high heat for 3 hours.

Serve with mashed potatoes, if you serve it at all.

This recipe yields various servings depending on how much you throw out.

Rinse the stomach thoroughly and soak overnight in cold salted water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rinse the liver, heart, and tongue.  In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook these parts over medium heat for 2 hours.  Remove and mince.  Remove any gristle or skin and discard.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, combine the minced liver, heart, tongue, suet, onions, and toasted oats.  Season with salt, pepper, and dried herbs.  Moisten with some of the cooking water so the mixture binds.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the stomach from the cold salted water and fill 2/3 with the mixture.  Sew or tie the stomach closed.  Use a turning fork to pierce the stomach several times.  This will prevent the haggis from bursting.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large pot of boiling water, gently place the filled stomach, being careful not to splash.  Cook over high heat for 3 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve with mashed potatoes, if you serve it at all.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields various servings depending on how much you throw out.

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  salt
  1                cup  sugar
  2             ounces  honey
  3        tablespoons  mustard powder
  1              pound  pork belly

In a small bowl, combine salt and sugar.  Spread honey evenly over pork belly, then coat with mustard.  Spread the salt and sugar mixture generously over the mustard.  Place into a re-sealable plastic bag and refrigerate for 3 days.

After three days have passed, remove the pork from the brine, rinse the belly, and pat dry with paper towels.  Lay on a rack over a sheet pan and place in front of a fan for 1 hour to form a pellicle.  Lay the pork in the protein box of a cold smoker and smoke for 4 to 6 hours.  Chill the meat in the freezer for 1 hour to stiffen for easy slicing into strips of bacon.  Slice what you need and keep the remainder in a freezer safe bag in the refrigerator or freezer.

Place the strips of bacon onto a sheet pan fitted with a rack and place into a cold oven.  Turn the oven to 400 degrees and cook for about 12 to 15 minutes, depending on how crispy you like your bacon.  Remove from rack and drain on paper towels.  Enjoy.

This recipe yields 1 pound cured pork belly.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     egg yolk
     1/2      teaspoon  fine salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
  2            pinches  sugar
  2          teaspoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  1                cup  safflower or corn oil

In a glass bowl, whisk together egg yolk and dry ingredients.  Combine lemon juice and vinegar in a separate bowl then thoroughly whisk half into the yolk mixture.

Start whisking briskly, then start adding the oil a few drops at a time until the liquid seems to thicken and lighten a bit, (which means you've got an emulsion on your hands).

Once you reach that point you can relax your arm a little (but just a little) and increase the oil flow to a constant (albeit thin) stream.  Once half of the oil is in add the rest of the lemon juice mixture.

Continue whisking until all of the oil is incorporated.  Leave at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours then refrigerate for up to 1 week.

This recipe yields 9 fluid ounces.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of food poisoning.... Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell?

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  salt
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2             ounces  molasses
  2        tablespoons  coarse ground black pepper
  1              pound  pork belly

In a small bowl, combine salt and sugar.  Spread molasses evenly over pork belly, then coat with the pepper.  Spread the salt and sugar mixture generously over the entire slab.  Place into a re-sealable plastic bag and refrigerate for 3 days.

After three days have passed, remove the pork from the brine, rinse the belly, and pat dry with paper towels.  Lay on a rack over a sheet pan and place in front of a fan for 1 hour to form a pellicle.  Lay the pork in the protein box of a cold smoker and smoke for 4 to 6 hours.  Chill the meat in the freezer for 1 hour to stiffen for easy slicing into strips of bacon.  Slice what you need and keep the remainder in a freezer safe bag in the refrigerator or freezer.

Place the strips of bacon onto a sheet pan fitted with a rack and place into a cold oven.  Turn the oven to 400 degrees and cook for about 12 to 15 minutes, depending on how crispy you like your bacon.  Remove from rack and drain on paper towels.  Enjoy.

This recipe yields 1 pound cured pork belly.

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  diced yellow onions
  3        tablespoons  butter
     2/3         pound  shiitakes -- stemmed, and
                        sliced thinly
     1/3         pound  creminis -- half sliced thin,
                        and half diced fine
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4             ounces  milk
     1/2           cup  shredded mild white cheese, mozzarella or
                        provolone
                        Savory Crepes -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced chives
     1/4           cup  shredded Parmesan

In a large saute pan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter and sweat the onion.  Add all the mushrooms and the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.  Season with salt and pepper and cook until mushrooms are soft.  Add the milk and reduce by half.  Add the provolone and melt.  The consistency we're looking for is similar to that of a potpie.

On a buttered sheet pan layer two crepes.  This way if the bottom one sticks you can still remove your "cake" from the pan.  Spread a thin layer of the filling onto the crepe.  Sprinkle a few chives on each layer.  Top with another crepe and spread more mushroom filling on top.  Repeat this method until you are out of filling.  Top with another crepe and sprinkle on Parmesan.  Place under broiler until Parmesan is melted and golden brown.  Place onto a cutting board and slice into wedges.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a large saute pan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter and sweat the onion.  Add all the mushrooms and the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.  Season with salt and pepper and cook until mushrooms are soft.  Add the milk and reduce by half.  Add the provolone and melt.  The consistency we&apos;re looking for is similar to that of a potpie.

On a buttered sheet pan layer two crepes.  This way if the bottom one sticks you can still remove your &quot;cake&quot; from the pan.  Spread a thin layer of the filling onto the crepe.  Sprinkle a few chives on each layer.  Top with another crepe and spread more mushroom filling on top.  Repeat this method until you are out of filling.  Top with another crepe and sprinkle on Parmesan.  Place under broiler until Parmesan is melted and golden brown.  Place onto a cutting board and slice into wedges.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     blade-cut chuck roast - (abt 2 lbs)
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  cumin
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  5                     garlic cloves - (to 6) -- smashed
  1                cup  tomato juice
     1/3           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  cocktail olives -- drained and broken
     1/2           cup  dark raisins

Preheat the oven to 190-200 degrees.  Place a wide, heavy skillet or fry pan over high heat for 2 minutes.  Meanwhile, rub both sides of meat with the salt and cumin.  When the pan is hot (really hot) brown meat on both sides and remove from pan.

Add just enough vegetable oil to cover the bottom of the pan then add the onion and garlic.  Stir constantly until onion is softened.  Add the tomato juice, vinegar, olives, and raisins.  Bring to a boil and reduce the liquid by half.

Create a pouch with wide, heavy duty aluminum foil.  Place half the reduced liquid/chunk mixture on the foil, add the roast, and then top with the remaining mixture.  Close the pouch, and wrap tightly in another complete layer of foil.

Cook for 3 to 3 1/2 hours or until a fork pushes easily into the meat.  Remove from oven and rest (still wrapped) for at least 1/2 hour.

Snip off 1 corner of the foil pouch and drain the liquid into a bowl or measuring cup.  Add some of the "chunkies" and puree with an immersion blender.

Slice meat thinly, or pull apart with a fork.  Serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 3 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
  3              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  3               cups  shredded fresh pumpkin
  1                cup  toasted pumpkin seeds

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Sift the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together.

In a separate bowl, mix the sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla.  Combine both mixtures and fold in the shredded pumpkin and pumpkin seeds.  Once the ingredients are all incorporated pour into a non-stick 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan.  If your pan is not non-stick coat it with butter and flour.

Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  At this point a knife inserted into the middle of the loaf should come out clean.  Cool for 15 minutes and turn out onto a cooling rack.  Cool completely.  For muffins temperature should also be 325 degrees, but bake for 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 1 loaf or 1 1/2 dozen small muffins.

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  cider vinegar
  1             medium  jalapeÒo -- split
  1           teaspoon  red chile flakes
  1                cup  salt
  5 1/2           cups  brown sugar
  1                cup  honey
     1/2        gallon  water
  1              pound  pork belly

In a large saucepot, bring the first six ingredients to a simmer.  Cook until all of the solids are dissolved.  Add water and submerge pork belly.  Remove from the heat and place in the refrigerator for 3 days.

After three days have passed, remove the pork from the brine, rinse the belly, and pat dry with paper towels.  Lay on a rack over a sheet pan and place in front of a fan for 1 hour to form a pellicle.  Lay the pork in the protein box of a cold smoker and smoke for 4 to 6 hours.  Chill the meat in the freezer for 1 hour to stiffen for easy slicing into strips of bacon.  Slice what you need and keep the remainder in a freezer safe bag in the refrigerator or freezer.

Place the strips of bacon onto a sheet pan fitted with a rack and place into a cold oven.  Turn the oven to 400 degrees and cook for about 12 to 15 minutes, depending on how crispy you like your bacon.  Remove from rack and drain on paper towels.  Enjoy.

This recipe yields 1 pound brined pork belly.

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  water
  1                cup  flour
  3        tablespoons  melted butter
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh herbs, spinach or
                        sun-dried tomatoes
                        Butter -- for coating pan

In a blender, combine all of the ingredients and pulse for 10 seconds.  Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour.  This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking.  The batter will keep for up to 48 hours.

Heat a small non-stick pan.  Add butter to coat.  Pour 1 ounce of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly.  Cook for 30 seconds and flip.  Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to the cutting board.  Lay them out flat so they can cool.  Continue until all batter is gone.

After they have cooled you can stack them and store in sealable plastic bags in the refrigerator for several days or in the freezer for up to two months.  When using frozen crepes, thaw on a rack before gently peeling apart.

This recipe yields 17 to 22 crepes.

                         Scrap Iron Chef's Bacon

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  salt
  8             ounces  molasses
     1/2        gallon  water - (2 quarts)
     1/2        gallon  apple cider - (2 quarts)
  2        tablespoons  course-ground black pepper
  5              pound  piece raw pork belly from the loin end

In a large non-reactive pot, bring half the water, 1 cup of sugar, salt, and 8 ounces molasses to a boil.  Stir to dissolve the sugar.  Pour into a large container with the remaining water, and the apple cider.  Place in the refrigerator and cool to 40 degrees.

Press the black pepper into the pork belly.  Once the brine has cooled place the peppered pork belly into the mixture until completely submerged.  Refrigerate for three days.

After three days have passed, remove the pork from the brine and pat dry with paper towels.  Lay on a rack over a sheet pan and place in front of a fan for 1 hour to form a pellicle.  Lay the pork in the protein box of a cold smoker and smoke for 4 to 6 hours.  Chill the meat in the freezer for 1 hour to stiffen for easy slicing into strips of bacon.  Slice what you need and keep the remainder in a freezer safe bag in the refrigerator or freezer.

Place the strips of bacon onto a sheet pan fitted with a rack and place into a cold oven.  Turn the oven to 400 degrees and cook for about 12 to 15 minutes, depending on how crispy you like your bacon.  Remove from rack and drain on paper towels.  Enjoy.

This recipe yields approximately 4 pounds of bacon.

                              Smoked Salmon

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  crushed black peppercorns
  2              large  salmon fillets or sides -- pin bones removed

In a bowl, mix together salt, sugar, brown sugar and peppercorns.  Spread extra-wide aluminum foil a little longer than the length of the fish and top with an equally long layer of plastic wrap.  Sprinkle 1/3 of the rub onto the plastic.

Lay 1 side of the fish skin down onto the rub.  Sprinkle 1/3 of the rub onto the flesh of the salmon.  Place second side of salmon, flesh down onto the first side.  Use the remaining rub to cover the skin on the top piece.  Fold plastic over to cover then close edges of foil together and crimp tightly around the fish.

Place wrapped fish onto a plank or sheet pan and top with another plank or pan.  Weigh with a heavy phone book or a brick or two and refrigerate for 12 hours.  Flip the fish over and refrigerate another 12 hours.  Some juice will leak out during the process so make sure there's a place for the runoff to gather.

Unwrap fish and rinse off the cure with cold water.  Pat salmon with paper towels then place in a cool, dry place (not the refrigerator) until the surface of the fish is dry and matte-like, 1 to 3 hours depending on humidity.  A fan may be used to speed the process.

Smoke fish over smoldering hardwood chips or sawdust, keeping the temperature inside the smoker between 150 and 160 degrees until the thickest part of the fish registers 150 degrees.  Serve immediately or cool to room temperature, wrap tightly and refrigerate for up to 3 days.

This recipe yields 20 to 30 portions, depending on size of fillet.

Cook's Note:  Trout, mackerel, and bluefish also smoke well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  33                    graham cracker squares -- crumbled
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted, plus
                        additional for brushing the pan
  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        === FILLING ===
  20            ounces  cream cheese
  1 1/4           cups  sour cream
  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  2                     eggs
  3                     yolks
     1/3           cup  heavy cream

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Brush some of the melted butter around a 9- by 3-inch cake pan.  Adhere parchment to the bottom and the sides.

In a small bowl, combine crumbled graham crackers, the remaining melted butter, and 1 tablespoon of sugar.  Press 2/3 of the mixture into the bottom of the parchment-lined pan.  Place remaining crumbs on a sheet pan and bake both the crust and the remaining mixture for 10 minutes.  Cool.  Reserve additional crumb mixture for sides.

In a mixer with a paddle attachment, beat sour cream for 10 seconds.  Add the cream cheese and sugar and mix on low for 30 seconds and then turn up to medium.  Scrape the bowl.

In a separate container, combine vanilla, eggs, yolks, and heavy cream.  With the mixer on medium, slowly pour the liquid mixture in.  When half of it is incorporated, stop and scrape.  Continue adding the mixture until the rest of the ingredients are incorporated.  Once completely combined, pour into the cooled crust.

Lower oven temperature to 250 degrees.  Place cheesecake into a preheated water bath, in the oven for 1 hour.  Turn the oven off and open the door for one minute.  Close the door for one more hour.  Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and place in the refrigerator for 6 hours to completely cool before serving.

When ready to serve, place the entire cake pan into a hot water bath for about 15 seconds.  Unmold onto a cake round or serving dish.  Take the remaining graham cracker mixture and press into the sides of the cake.

To slice, place your knife into a hot water bath and wipe dry each time you make a pass through the cake.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

                            Spooky Edible Eyes

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Halloween

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2       packages  unflavored powdered gelatin
     1/2           cup  low fat milk
  1                cup  water
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  coconut extract
                        Oil -- for molds
                        Food coloring set
                        = (red, yellow, blue, and green)

Combine one package of gelatin with the milk and bloom for five minutes.

In a small saucepan, combine half a cup of water with the sugar and coconut extract and bring to a boil.  Combine with the gelatin mixture and stir until all solids dissolve.  Lubricate molds with oil and pour in gelatin mixture.  Refrigerate for one hour.  Gently tap and shake to unmold.

For the iris, combine remaining gelatin with 1/4 cup of water and bloom for five minutes.  In a small saucepan, bring the remaining water to a boil.  Remove and gently stir into gelatin mixture until solids dissolve.  Create the colors of your choice using the food coloring kit.  Using an eyedropper, fill the indentation of the eyeballs with the colored gelatin.  It will set within moments of contact with the cold gelatin.

In a small ramekin, mix one drop of each color to create black for the pupil.  Dip a toothpick into the black and paint the center of the iris.  To achieve bloodshot eyes, use red food coloring and brush with a cotton swab around the base of each eyeball.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  squid tentacles and tubes
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2           cup  miso broth
                        = (1/2 cup water mixed
                        with 1 tbspn miso paste)
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  thinly-sliced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  minced ginger
  2                     dried arbol chiles
     1/3           cup  medium-diced sweet onion
     1/4           cup  torn-into-strips oyster mushrooms
     1/3           cup  medium-diced red bell pepper
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

On a clean cutting board, remove the tentacles from the bodies of the squid and reserve.  Make sure the tubes are cleaned out and split them open lengthwise so they look like a flat triangle.  Using a matte knife, lightly score the squid in a crosshatch pattern.  Cut each tube into four pieces of roughly equal size.

In a bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of soy sauce with 1 teaspoon of cornstarch and toss the squid in it to coat.  Marinate while preparing for the rest of the dish.  Combine the miso broth and balsamic vinegar with the remaining cornstarch.

In a hot pan or wok, add the sesame oil and swirl to coat the pan.  Add the squid and cook for 30 to 40 seconds.  It will curl up naturally and brown.  Working quickly, add the garlic, ginger, and chiles.  Allow them to fry for 10 to 15 seconds stirring constantly (they can burn fast).

Add the onion, mushrooms, and bell pepper and saute for another minute.  Pour in the stock mixture and simmer until the sauce begins to thicken.  Season with white pepper and additional soy sauce, if necessary.  Serve over rice.

This recipe yields 2 entree servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  water
  1                cup  flour
  3        tablespoons  melted butter
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  your favorite liqueur
                        Butter -- for coating pan

In a blender, combine all of the ingredients and pulse for 10 seconds.  Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour.  This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking.  The batter will keep for up to 48 hours.

Heat a small non-stick pan.  Add butter to coat.  Pour 1 ounce of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly.  Cook for 30 seconds and flip.  Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to the cutting board.  Lay them out flat so they can cool.  Continue until all batter is gone.

After they have cooled you can stack them and store in sealable plastic bags in the refrigerator for several days or in the freezer for up to two months.  When using frozen crepes, thaw on a rack before gently peeling apart.

This recipe yields 17 to 22 crepes.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     garlic cloves - (to 7) -- peeled, plus
  2                     garlic cloves -- 1 sliced, 1 minced
                        Enough olive oil to cover the bottom of a
                        wide saute pan
  4                     big handfuls greens -- roughly shredded
                        = (baby mustard, turnip, chard)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place saute pan over medium heat and then lightly crush 5 to 7 garlic cloves.  When the pan is hot, add just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan and add the garlic.  Cook, stirring frequently until golden brown (3 to 5 minutes).  Remove from the oil.  At this point, the greens can be quickly Sauteed for a mild garlic flavor.

If you're looking for something a little stronger, thinly sliver 1 clove and add it to the pan stirring constantly (burned garlic is not Good Eats, nor is anything that touches it).  Once the slivers turn golden, add the greens and toss to coat with the hot oil.  Season with salt and pepper as soon as the greens start to wilt and plate immediately.

If you're looking for even more garlic flavor, finely mince a clove of garlic and toss it into the greens during the last 30 seconds of cooking and toss the greens to distribute.  Keep the pan and the greens moving constantly, if you can.

Serve as a side dish or toss with pasta and serve as a main course.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
