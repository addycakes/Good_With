                Argentine Stuffed Flank Steak - {Matambre}

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  flank steak -- trimmed
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4         pound  fresh spinach -- washed, drained,
                        and stems trimmed
  4              small  thin carrots
  4              large  hard-boiled eggs -- peeled, and
                        quartered lengthwise
  1                cup  large pitted green Spanish olives -- halved lengthwise
  1              large  onion -- sliced into rings
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1             bottle  dry red wine - (750 ml)
                        = (Argentine Malbec recommended)
  1               head  garlic -- halved
  1              large  onion -- halved
  1                     handful fresh thyme sprigs
  1                     handful fresh oregano sprigs
  2                     bay leaves

Butterfly the steak by slicing lengthwise and opening it up like a book.  Pound the meat gently with a mallet to flatten and even out the thickness; rub all sides with olive oil and generously season with salt and pepper.

With the steak lying lengthwise, scatter the spinach leaves evenly over the surface of the meat, leaving a 1-inch border all around.  Arrange the carrots in long rows across the steak, about 2 inches apart.  Put the egg strips and olives between the carrot rows.  Scatter the onion rings and cheese over the filling, sprinkle with salt and red pepper flakes.  Carefully roll the meat up over the filling, from bottom to top, into a long thick cylinder (jellyroll-style.)  Tie with butcher's twine to hold it together, as you would a roast.

Coat a large Dutch oven or pan with olive oil and put over moderate heat.  Lay the stuffed steak in the hot oil and sear until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes.  Pour in the wine and enough water to come up almost to the top of the meat.  Toss in the head of garlic, onion, and herbs to flavor the broth.  Cover, and slowly simmer on medium-low heat until the meat is fork-tender, about 1 1/2 hours, turning the meat over once halfway through cooking.  Taste the broth before serving and adjust spices, if necessary.

Transfer the matambre to a cutting board and let rest for 15 minutes.  Remove the kitchen strings and cut crosswise into 1-inch slices -- the colors of the filling will look absolutely gorgeous spiraled in the steak.  Spoon some of the sauce over the meat and serve.  Matambre is good hot, room temperature, or cold.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut in thin strips
  1                     green bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut in thin strips
  2              large  ripe tomatoes -- seeded, diced
  2             medium  white onions -- sliced thin
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4         pound  dry-cured ham -- diced
                        = (such as presunto or prosciutto)
  1              pound  hard smoked sausage -- removed from casing
                        = (such as linguica or chorizo)
  1         tablespoon  paprika - (generous)
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
  2                     bay leaves
  1                cup  dry white wine
  4             pounds  small littleneck clams or cockles -- scrubbed, and
                        rinsed well
  1                     lemon -- juiced
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
                        Portuguese bread -- as accompaniment

Coat a large Dutch oven with the olive oil and set over medium heat.  When the oil forms a little haze, add the bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, and garlic; cook and stir for about 7 minutes until the vegetables are soft, but not browned.  Add the ham and sausage and stir for 2 minutes to release some of the flavorful fat.  Stir in the paprika, pepper flakes, bay leaves, and wine.  Simmer and stir for 10 minutes to cook down the liquid a bit.  (If using a cataplana, transfer the sauce into the vessel, and proceed as directed.)

Lay the clams in the sauce and toss with a large spoon so they are well coated and some of the sauce is on the top.  Squeeze in the lemon juice and shower with chopped parsley.  Tightly close the Dutch oven or cataplana and simmer over moderate heat for 15 minutes until the clams open -- no peeking.  Discard any clams that haven't opened at that point.

Remove the cataplana from the stove and open it at the table.  Ladle into soup bowls and serve immediately with crusty Portuguese bread.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                    Blueberry Scones With Lemon Glaze

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BLUEBERRY SCONES ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  5        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut in chunks
  1                cup  heavy cream -- plus
                        more for brushing the scones
  1                cup  fresh blueberries
                        === LEMON GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  freshly squeezed lemon juice
  2               cups  confectioners' sugar -- sifted
  1                     lemon -- zest finely grated
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Sift together the dry ingredients; the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.  Using 2 forks or a pastry blender, cut in the butter to coat the pieces with the flour.  The mixture should look like coarse crumbs.

Make a well in the center and pour in the heavy cream.  Fold everything together just to incorporate; do not overwork the dough.  Fold the blueberries into the batter.  Take care not to mash or bruise the blueberries because their strong color will bleed into the dough.

Press the dough out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 12 by 3 by 1 1/4 inches.  Cut the rectangle in half then cut the pieces in half again, giving you 4 (3-inch) squares.  Cut the squares in half on a diagonal to give you the classic triangle shape.

Place the scones on an ungreased cookie sheet and brush the tops with a little heavy cream.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until beautiful and brown.  Let the scones cool a bit before you apply the glaze.

Technically you should make this simple lemon glaze in a double boiler (i.e. over a pot of simmering water with a heatproof bowl set on top) but it's even simpler to zap it in the microwave.  Mix the lemon juice and confectioners' sugar together in a microwave-safe bowl.  Stir until the sugar dissolves.  Add the lemon zest and butter.  Nuke it for 30 seconds on high.  Whisk the glaze to smooth out any lumps, then drizzle the glaze over the top of the scones.  Let it set a minute before serving.

This recipe yields 8 scones.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  orange juice
  2          teaspoons  powdered gelatin - (1 envelope)
  1 1/2           cups  plain non-fat yogurt
  1                     container low-fat ricotta cheese - (15 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar
  1                     orange -- zest finely grated
  1                     store-bought angel food bundt cake
  2              pints  fresh blueberries
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        Fresh mint leaves -- for garnish

Pour 1/2 cup of the orange juice into a small pot and heat over medium flame until hot; remove from heat.  Sprinkle the gelatin on top of the hot orange juice, give it a stir, and let stand for 5 minutes to soften.

Combine the yogurt, ricotta, vanilla, brown sugar, orange zest, and the gelatin mixture in a food processor and process until smooth, thick, and custard-like.

Put the angel food cake in a trifle bowl and push it down so it sits on the bottom.  Pour the remaining 1/2 cup of orange juice over the cake to moisten.  Spoon the yogurt custard over the cake to cover.  Chill in the refrigerator to set up.

To make the blueberry compote:  Combine the blueberries, sugar, and lemon juice in a pot over medium heat.  Stir gently until the berries breakdown and release their natural juice; the consistency should remain a bit chunky.  Set aside to cool.

Top the chilled trifle with the blueberry compote and garnish with fresh mint.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  dried black turtle beans -- picked through,
                        and rinsed
  1              pound  salt cured beef
                        = (such as carne seca or corned beef)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2         pound  salt pork -- cut 1" cubes
  1             medium  white onion -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     serrano pepper -- halved
  2                     bay leaves
  1              pound  smoked ham hocks
  1              pound  linguica or Spanish chorizo sausage -- cut 2" pieces
  1              pound  pork ribs -- separated into
                        individual ribs
  1              pound  beef stew meat, top round or chuck -- cut 2" cubes
                        Hot sauce -- to taste
  2                     oranges -- peeled, and
                        cut in segments
                        Sauteed Collard Greens -- (see recipe)
                        Cooked white rice -- for serving

Starting a day ahead, place the dried beans in a large bowl and cover with cold water; soak the beans overnight in the refrigerator.  In a separate bowl, soak the salt cured beef in cool water to cover to tenderize the meat, do this overnight also but change the water a couple of times.  Drain the beans and carne seca; cut up the cured beef into chunks.

Coat a large heavy pot with the oil and place over medium heat.  When the oil is hot, add the salt pork, onions, garlic, pepper, and bay leaves.  Cook and stir for 5 minutes to render out the pork fat and soften the vegetables.  Add the ham hocks, sausage, ribs, cubed beef, carne seca, and black beans.  Cover with just enough cold water to cover (about 2 1/2 quarts).  Bring the liquid to a boil and then reduce to medium-low heat, cover, and simmer for 2 hours, stirring now and again.  Skim any foam that rises to the surface during cooking and add more water if necessary to keep the ingredients covered during cooking.

Dig the ham hocks out of the pot, discard the rind and fat, shred the meat, and return the ham to the pot.  The beans should be really tender, like they are almost bursting.  Mash about 1 cup of the beans against the side of the pot to cream them out.  Give the stew a good stir, taste and check for seasoning.

To serve, ladle some of the bean broth into shot glasses or little cups, add a dash of hot pepper sauce and drink -- this is traditionally done to get the palate prepared for the feijoada.  Serve feijoada in large wide bowls, garnished with orange segments and accompanied by Sauteed Collard Greens and white rice.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Starting a day ahead, place the dried beans in a large bowl and cover with cold water; soak the beans overnight in the refrigerator.  In a separate bowl, soak the salt cured beef in cool water to cover to tenderize the meat, do this overnight also but change the water a couple of times.  Drain the beans and carne seca; cut up the cured beef into chunks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Coat a large heavy pot with the oil and place over medium heat.  When the oil is hot, add the salt pork, onions, garlic, pepper, and bay leaves.  Cook and stir for 5 minutes to render out the pork fat and soften the vegetables.  Add the ham hocks, sausage, ribs, cubed beef, carne seca, and black beans.  Cover with just enough cold water to cover (about 2 1/2 quarts).  Bring the liquid to a boil and then reduce to medium-low heat, cover, and simmer for 2 hours, stirring now and again.  Skim any foam that rises to the surface during cooking and add more water if necessary to keep the ingredients covered during cooking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dig the ham hocks out of the pot, discard the rind and fat, shred the meat, and return the ham to the pot.  The beans should be really tender, like they are almost bursting.  Mash about 1 cup of the beans against the side of the pot to cream them out.  Give the stew a good stir, taste and check for seasoning.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, ladle some of the bean broth into shot glasses or little cups, add a dash of hot pepper sauce and drink -- this is traditionally done to get the palate prepared for the feijoada.  Serve feijoada in large wide bowls, garnished with orange segments and accompanied by Sauteed Collard Greens and white rice.

  8                     limes -- cut 8 wedges each,

Place the lime wedges and sugar in the bottom of a pitcher.  Using a muddler or the handle of a wooden spoon, crush and mash the limes to release the oils and juice from the rind.

When you have some nice juice in there and the sugar begins to dissolve, add the liquor and stir to combine.

Fill lowball glasses with ice cubes and pour the cocktail over the ice and serve.  Do not remove the pieces of crushed lime.

  6                     red bell peppers
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour

  1              large  egg

  4                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2              large  ripe tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
     1/2                lemon -- sliced paper-thin
                        circles
  1         tablespoon  capers -- drained
     1/2         bunch  fresh basil -- hand-torn
                        = (1/4 bunch to flavor the base, 1/4
                        bunch to finish the dish)
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        = (Pinot Grigio recommended)
  1                cup  chicken broth

Prepare your wood burning brick oven according to manufacturer's directions or preheat a conventional oven to 400 degrees.

Place the peppers on a cookie sheet and season with salt and pepper.  Roast the peppers for 15 minutes, turning periodically with tongs, so they are really charred and blistered on all sides.  Put the peppers into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and steam for about 10 minutes to loosen the skins.  Pull out the cores and seeds from the peppers and peel off the blackened skins; coarsely chop the peppers into chunks and set aside.

Season the flour with the garlic powder, dried oregano, and a fair amount of salt and pepper.  Whisk the egg and milk together in a shallow bowl.  Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour and tap off the excess.  Dip each piece in the egg wash to coat, then dredge again in the flour.

Place a large oven-proof skillet over medium heat and pour in about 1/4-inch of oil.  Pan-fry the chicken in batches, skin-side down, until crisp, about 5 minutes.  Turn the chicken over and brown the other side about 3 minutes longer.  Remove the chicken to a side plate; it will not be completely cooked.

Carefully pour out the oil from the skillet and add 1/4 cup of clean olive oil.  Put the pan back on the stove over medium heat.  Add the anchovies, red pepper flakes, garlic, onion, tomatoes, lemon slices, capers, 1/2 of the roasted red peppers, and 1/2 of the basil; season with salt and pepper.  This part of the recipe is going to be your base.  What we are looking for is a fragrant vegetable pulp, so simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring often, until everything breaks down.

Add the remaining roasted peppers and basil.  Tuck the chicken into the stew and pour in the wine and chicken broth.  Transfer the chicken cacciatore to the hot oven and cook for 20 to 30 minutes until the chicken is cooked.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                             Chicken Marsala

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts - -- (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
                        All-purpose flour -- for dredging
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             ounces  prosciutto -- thinly sliced
  8             ounces  crimini or porcini mushrooms -- stemmed, halved
     1/2           cup  sweet Marsala wine
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
  2         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley

Put the chicken breasts side by side on a cutting board and lay a piece of plastic wrap over them; pound with a flat meat mallet, until they are about 1/4-inch thick.  Put some flour in a shallow platter and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper; mix with a fork to distribute evenly.

Heat the oil over medium-high flame in a large skillet.  When the oil is nice and hot, dredge both sides of the chicken cutlets in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess.  Slip the cutlets into the pan and fry for 5 minutes on each side until golden, turning once -- do this in batches if the pieces don't fit comfortably in the pan.  Remove the chicken to a large platter in a single layer to keep warm.

Lower the heat to medium and add the prosciutto to the drippings in the pan, saute for 1 minute to render out some of the fat.  Now, add the mushrooms and saute until they are nicely browned and their moisture has evaporated, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper.

Pour the Marsala in the pan and boil down for a few seconds to cook out the alcohol.  Add the chicken stock and simmer for a minute to reduce the sauce slightly.  Stir in the butter and return the chicken to the pan; simmer gently for 1 minute to heat the chicken through.  Season with salt and pepper and garnish with chopped parsley before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2           cup  kalamata olives -- pitted
     1/2         bunch  fresh basil leaves
  2               cans  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz ea) -- drained, and
                        hand crushed
  1              pinch  sugar
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts - -- (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  1         tablespoon  water
  1                cup  dried bread crumbs
  1                     ball fresh buffalo mozzarella - (8 oz) -- water drained
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan
  1              pound  spaghetti pasta -- cooked al dente

Coat a saute pan with olive oil and place over medium heat.  When the oil gets hazy, add the onions, garlic, and bay leaves; cook and stir for 5 minutes until fragrant and soft.  Add the olives and some hand-torn basil.  Carefully add the tomatoes (nothing splashes like tomatoes), cook and stir until the liquid is cooked down and the sauce is thick, about 15 minutes; season with sugar, salt and pepper.  Lower the heat, cover, and keep warm.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Get the ingredients together for the chicken so you have a little assembly line.  Put the chicken breasts side by side on a cutting board and lay a piece of plastic wrap over them.  Pound the chicken breasts with a flat meat mallet, until they are about 1/2-inch thick.

Put the flour in a shallow platter and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper; mix with a fork to distribute evenly.  In a wide bowl, combine the eggs and water, beat until frothy.  Put the bread crumbs on a plate, season with salt and pepper.

Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high flame in a large oven-proof skillet.  Lightly dredge both sides of the chicken cutlets in the seasoned flour, and then dip them in the egg wash to coat completely, letting the excess drip off, then dredge in the bread crumbs.  When the oil is nice and hot, add the cutlets and fry for 4 minutes on each side until golden and crusty, turning once.

Ladle the tomato-olive sauce over the chicken and sprinkle with mozzarella, Parmesan, and basil.  Bake the Chicken Parmesan for 15 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly.  Serve hot with spaghetti.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  free-range chicken - (abt 3 1/2 lbs) -- rinsed, and
                        giblets discarded
  2                     carrots -- cut large chunks
  3                     celery stalks -- cut large chunks
  2              large  white onions -- quartered
  1               head  garlic -- halved
  1                     turnip -- halved
     1/4         bunch  fresh thyme
  2                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns

Place the chicken and vegetables in a large stockpot over medium heat.  Pour in only enough cold water to cover (about 3 quarts); too much will make the broth taste weak.  Toss in the thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns, and allow it to slowly come to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-low and gently simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, partially covered, until the chicken is done.  As it cooks, skim any impurities that rise to the surface; add a little more water if necessary to keep the chicken covered while simmering.

Carefully remove the chicken to a cutting board.  When its cool enough to handle, discard the skin and bones; hand-shred the meat into a storage container.

Carefully strain the stock through a fine sieve into another pot to remove the vegetable solids.  Use the stock immediately or if you plan on storing it, place the pot in a sink full of ice water and stir to cool down the stock.  Cover and refrigerate for up to one week or freeze.

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

Place the chicken and vegetables in a large stockpot over medium heat.  Pour in only enough cold water to cover (about 3 quarts); too much will make the broth taste weak.  Toss in the thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns, and allow it to slowly come to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-low and gently simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, partially covered, until the chicken is done.  As it cooks, skim any impurities that rise to the surface; add a little more water if necessary to keep the chicken covered while simmering.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Carefully remove the chicken to a cutting board.  When its cool enough to handle, discard the skin and bones; hand-shred the meat into a storage container.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Carefully strain the stock through a fine sieve into another pot to remove the vegetable solids.  Use the stock immediately or if you plan on storing it, place the pot in a sink full of ice water and stir to cool down the stock.  Cover and refrigerate for up to one week or freeze.
</DirT>

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1              pound  lean ground beef
  1                cup  ketchup
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  prepared yellow mustard
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     all-beef hot dogs - (abt 1/2 lb)
  4                     hot dog rolls
     1/2           cup  shredded Cheddar

To make the chili:  Heat a skillet over medium flame and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  When the oil gets hazy, add the onion and cook, stirring, until they are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the ground beef, breaking it up with the back of a spoon, and cook until nicely browned, about 10 minutes.  Stir in the ketchup, chili powder, and mustard; simmer for 15 minutes until thick; season with salt and pepper.

For the hot dogs:  While the chili is cooking, place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot.  Brush the grates with oil to keep the hot dogs from sticking.

Parboil the dogs first before grilling: bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the hot dogs for about 5 minutes.  Remove from the water and grill the hot dogs just long enough to give them grill marks.  Brush the insides of the rolls with the remaining oil and place them face down on the grill until toasty.

To serve, top each hot dog with the chili and some Cheddar cheese.

This recipe yields 4 hot dogs.

                          Chocolate Cherry Bombe

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh cherries -- pitted
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  brandy or cherry syrup
                        = (kirsch or Torani syrup recommended)
     3/4           cup  water -- plus
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  3               cups  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  chopped pistachios
  10            ounces  semisweet chocolate -- cut in chunks

Line a 1 1/2 quart glass or stainless bowl with plastic wrap, leaving enough excess hanging over the edge, and stick it in the freezer.

In a medium pot, combine the cherries, 1 cup of sugar, lemon juice, kirsch, and 3/4 cup of water.  Simmer over medium-high heat until the juice from the cherries is released and the fruit is soft, about 20 minutes.  Mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water to make a slurry and add it to the cherry mixture.  Simmer, stirring, for another 2 minutes to thicken.  Remove the cherry sauce from the heat, you should have about 4 cups.  Put the cherry sauce in the freezer or in an ice bath to chill until cold.

Using a wire whisk, beat 2 cups of the heavy cream, the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, and vanilla together until soft peaks form.  Using a rubber spatula, fold the whipped cream into half of the cherry mixture (2 cups) to make a light mousse -- don't overdo it, it's ok if there are streaks of cream in the filling.  Gently fold in the pistachios.  Take the plastic-lined bowl out of the freezer and spoon the cherry mousse into it, filling it all the way to the top, and spreading evenly around the rim.  Freeze again for at least 8 hours, so the mousse sets up firm.

Heat the remaining 1 cup of cream and the chocolate in a pot over medium-low flame.  Stir to melt the chocolate completely and smooth it out into the cream.  Cool until warm to the touch, the chocolate should still be pourable.

Take the bowl of cherry mousse out of the freezer and invert it, bottom-side up, on a wire rack set over a sheet pan.  Carefully peel off the plastic and pour the chocolate ganache over the bombe to cover it completely, allowing the excess to drip down into the sheet pan.  Stick the chocolate cherry bombe back in the freezer to chill.  Using a couple of flat spatulas, carefully remove the bombe from the rack and put in on a chilled platter.  Cut into wedges; serve with the reserved cherry sauce.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  sweet-tart apples
                        = (such as Braeburn, Fuji, or Gala)
                        Popsicle sticks
  1              pound  semisweet chocolate -- cut into chunks
  1                cup  M&M's, chopped pistachios, shredded
                        coconut, toffee pieces, or crushed Oreos

Twist off the stems from the apples and push a Popsicle stick down into the core.  Put the apples in the fridge while preparing the chocolate; they'll coat better if they're cold.

Slowly melt the chocolate in a double boiler over hot water or in a microwave set on high for 2 minutes, stirring halfway through the heating time to smooth it out.  Remove from the heat and stir until completely melted and warm, not hot.

Dunk each apple into the chocolate, allowing the excess to drip back into the bowl.  Roll the apples around in the chocolate, turning with the stick, so it's coated all the way up to the top.  Use a spoon to baste any hard to get spots.

Put the desired coating in a separate bowl and roll the dipped apple around so it is completely covered.  Set the chocolate dipped apples on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper.  Refrigerate until the chocolate is set.

This recipe yields 6 apples.

Twist off the stems from the apples and push a Popsicle stick down into the core.  Put the apples in the fridge while preparing the chocolate; they&apos;ll coat better if they&apos;re cold.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Slowly melt the chocolate in a double boiler over hot water or in a microwave set on high for 2 minutes, stirring halfway through the heating time to smooth it out.  Remove from the heat and stir until completely melted and warm, not hot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dunk each apple into the chocolate, allowing the excess to drip back into the bowl.  Roll the apples around in the chocolate, turning with the stick, so it&apos;s coated all the way up to the top.  Use a spoon to baste any hard to get spots.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the desired coating in a separate bowl and roll the dipped apple around so it is completely covered.  Set the chocolate dipped apples on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper.  Refrigerate until the chocolate is set.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 apples.

              Chocolate Souffle With Espresso Creme Anglaise

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- for greasing
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
  1                     vanilla bean -- split, scraped
  6              large  eggs -- separated
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  hazelnut flavored liqueur
                        = (Frangelico recommended)
  1              pinch  salt
                        === ESPRESSO CREME ANGLAISE ===
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1                     vanilla bean -- split, scraped
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                cup  brewed espresso coffee
  2        tablespoons  instant espresso powder
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and remove the top oven rack.  Prepare 6 (8-ounce) coffee cups or ramekins with straight sides (or a 2-quart souffle dish) by greasing with butter and coating with granulated sugar, pour out any excess.  The butter and sugar will keep the souffles from sticking to the sides, which will allow them to rise evenly.  The sugar will also give the souffle a crunchy crust, which is a great contrast to the soft interior.

To make the pastry cream base for the souffle:  Combine the milk and vanilla bean and seeds in a heavy large pot and place over medium-low heat.  Bring the mixture to a brief simmer, until bubbles form around the edge of the pot; do not boil.  Remove from heat and discard the vanilla bean.  The vanilla bean can be rinsed and dried and kept for another use.

In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, flour, and 1/4 cup of sugar until slightly thickened and lemon-colored.  Temper the yolks by gradually whisking in about half of the hot milk mixture (do not add too quickly or the eggs will cook.)  Return the pastry cream back to the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until it is nice and thick, enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Slowly melt the chocolate with the Frangelico in a double boiler over hot water or in a microwave set on high for 2 minutes, stirring halfway through the heating time to smooth it out.  Stir the melted chocolate mixture into the pastry cream; cool to room temperature.

In a separate clean bowl, beat the egg whites and salt just until they hold soft peaks.  Using a rubber spatula, fold 1/3 of the beaten whites into the chocolate pastry cream to lighten it, then gently fold in the rest.  Spoon the batter into the prepared coffee cups, 2/3 of the way full, and shake them gently to smooth out the top.

Place the coffee cups on a cookie sheet and bake on the middle rack for about 20 minutes.  The souffle is done when it has puffed over the rim, the outside is golden and the center is still a bit loose and creamy; take care not to over bake.

To serve, have each guest crack open the top of the souffle with a spoon and pour in the Espresso CrËme Anglaise.  Dust the top with confectioners' sugar.

For the Espresso Creme Anglaise:  Pour the heavy cream and vanilla bean and seeds into a saucepan and place over medium-low heat.  Bring the mixture to a brief simmer, until bubbles form around the edge of the pot; do not boil.  Remove from heat.  Discard the vanilla bean.  The vanilla bean can be rinsed and dried and kept for another use.

In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, coffee, and espresso powder, until well blended.  Temper the yolks by gradually whisking in the hot cream mixture (do not add too quickly or the eggs will cook).  Return the custard back to the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Serve immediately with Chocolate Souffle.  (If not serving immediately, press plastic wrap on the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate.)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TART SHELL PASTRY ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cold, and cut
                        into small chunks
  1              large  egg -- separated
  2        tablespoons  ice water -- plus
                        more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  milk
  10            ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature

To make the Tart Shell Pastry:  Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl.  Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Make a well in the middle of the pastry.  Combine the egg yolk with the ice water in a small bowl, whisking to blend; pour it into the well and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky.  Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Form the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle, about 1/4-inch thick.  Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin (this may take a little practice) and lay it inside a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly; press the edges into the sides of the pan.  It is important to press the dough evenly into every nook and corner of the ring, especially the scalloped edges.  Shave off the excess hanging dough with a knife.  Put the tart in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to relax.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the tart pan on a sturdy cookie sheet so it will be easy to move in and out of the oven.  Line the tart with aluminum foil and add pie weights or dried beans to keep the sides of the tart from buckling.  Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and weights.

Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the crust with a beaten egg white.  Return to the oven and continue to bake for another 8 minutes until the tart is golden in color, but not brown.  Remember the tart will be cooked again with the filling.  It should be cooked but light in color so that it will not burn on the second bake.  Set aside to cool and lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees.

To make the Filling:  Heat the heavy cream and milk in a pot over medium-low flame, until it simmers slightly around the edges.  Remove from the heat; add the chopped chocolate and stir until melted and smoothed out.  Add the sugar and salt and whisk until well incorporated.

Beat the eggs in a small bowl until blended and add them to the chocolate mixture, stir until completely blended.  Pour the filling into the cooled tart shell and bake at 325 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes until the filling is set and the surface is glossy.  If you see any bubbles or cracks forming on the surface, take the tart out right away -- that means it is beginning to become over baked.  Cool before cutting.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Pizza Dough -- (see recipe)
  2              dozen  large hard-shell clams
                        = (such as cherrystone or chowder clams)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1                     red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2             medium  vine-ripe tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
  2                     fresh oregano sprigs -- leaves striped from
                        the stem
  1                     container ricotta cheese - (15 oz)
     1/2         pound  bacon strips -- sliced
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated pecorino
  1                     handful fresh flat-leaf parsley -- chopped

Make the pizza dough as directed in the master recipe.  Stick a pizza stone in the oven and preheat them to 500 degrees.

Wash and scrub clams well to remove the exterior sand.  Fill a steamer or pot with 1-inch of water, add 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and toss in the bay leaves.  Heat until the water is simmering and then add the clams.  Cover and steam for 5 to 10 minutes until the clams open -- discard any that do not.  Remove the clams from the shells, coarsely chop them up, and put in a bowl.  Add the lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil, and season with salt and pepper; set aside.

Coat a saute pan with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and place over medium heat.  When the oil gets hazy, add the onion, bell pepper, garlic, tomatoes, and oregano.  Cook and stir until the vegetables have cooked down and are really soft, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat.

Spread the ricotta evenly on the crust with a back of a spoon.  Scatter the chopped clams all around and top with the sauteed red pepper mixture.  Distribute the pieces of bacon on top.  Slide the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the crust is golden and crisp, and the cheese is bubbly.

Before cutting the pizza into slices, drizzle with olive oil, grate pecorino on top, and shower with chopped parsley.

This recipe yields 3 pizzas.

             Croissant French Toast With Soft Caramel Apples

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BATTER ===
  3              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1              pinch  ground cinnamon
                        === CARAMEL APPLES ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  6                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut in 1/2"-thick wedges
     1/2           cup  pure maple syrup
                        ===
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4              large  croissants -- halved lengthwise
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting
                        Ground cinnamon -- for dusting

Make the batter for the French toast by whisking together the eggs, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon until evenly blended.  Cover and refrigerate.

Pay close attention while you make the caramel apples -- put the sugar in a large dry skillet and place it over medium-low heat.  Stir constantly with a wooden spoon until the sugar melts and begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.  Be careful; the sugar is really hot at this point.

Still stirring, add the butter, which will foam a little.  Once the sugar and butter become a caramel sauce, fold in the apple wedges.  Now, because the apples are cooler than the sugar, the sugar may start to seize and harden, but don't freak out -- keep stirring, once the apples warm up, the caramel will smooth out again.

When the caramel sauce starts to form around the apples, pour in the maple syrup.  Give it a stir and simmer for about 10 minutes until the apples are fork tender.  Pull them off the heat and keep warm until you are ready to serve.

For the French toast itself, warm the butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat.  You probably will only be able to fit a couple of croissants in the pan at once, so prepare these in batches.  Take a croissant half and quickly dredge it in the batter.  The key word here is quickly; the croissants are very soft and will disintegrate if soaked in the batter.  Lay the croissants in the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes.  Carefully flip them over with a spatula and brown the other side.

The presentation is like a caramel apple sandwich -- take the bottom half of the croissant and put it on a plate, spoon some of the caramel apples on top of that, and cover with the top half of the croissant.  Dust with confectioners' sugar and cinnamon and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Make the batter for the French toast by whisking together the eggs, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon until evenly blended.  Cover and refrigerate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pay close attention while you make the caramel apples -- put the sugar in a large dry skillet and place it over medium-low heat.  Stir constantly with a wooden spoon until the sugar melts and begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.  Be careful; the sugar is really hot at this point.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Still stirring, add the butter, which will foam a little.  Once the sugar and butter become a caramel sauce, fold in the apple wedges.  Now, because the apples are cooler than the sugar, the sugar may start to seize and harden, but don&apos;t freak out -- keep stirring, once the apples warm up, the caramel will smooth out again.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the caramel sauce starts to form around the apples, pour in the maple syrup.  Give it a stir and simmer for about 10 minutes until the apples are fork tender.  Pull them off the heat and keep warm until you are ready to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the French toast itself, warm the butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat.  You probably will only be able to fit a couple of croissants in the pan at once, so prepare these in batches.  Take a croissant half and quickly dredge it in the batter.  The key word here is quickly; the croissants are very soft and will disintegrate if soaked in the batter.  Lay the croissants in the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes.  Carefully flip them over with a spatula and brown the other side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The presentation is like a caramel apple sandwich -- take the bottom half of the croissant and put it on a plate, spoon some of the caramel apples on top of that, and cover with the top half of the croissant.  Dust with confectioners&apos; sugar and cinnamon and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cold, and
                        cut into small chunks
  1              large  egg yolk
  3        tablespoons  ice water -- plus
                        more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin-olive oil
  2              large  Vidalia onions -- sliced
     3/4         pound  smoked ham -- cubed
  8              large  eggs
  1              quart  heavy cream
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ASPARAGUS SALAD ===
  2            bunches  asparagus - (abt 1 lb ea) -- stems trimmed
  4             ounces  Parmesan -- shaved with a peeler
  2                     handfuls fresh flat-leaf parsley -- hand-torn
  1                     handful fresh mint -- hand-torn
  1                     handful fresh dill -- hand-torn
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the Pastry:  Combine the flour, salt, and sugar in a large mixing bowl.  Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

Beat the egg yolk and ice water in a small bowl to blend, add it to the pastry.  Work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky.  Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time.

Form the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Sprinkle the counter and a rolling pin lightly with flour.  Roll the dough out into a 14-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick.  Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin (this may take a little practice) and lay it inside a 9-inch springform pan.  Press the dough firmly into the bottom and sides so it fits tightly; trim the excess dough around the rim.  Place the pan on a sturdy cookie sheet so it will be easier to move in and out of the oven, this quiche is pretty heavy.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

To make the Filling:  Heat a skillet over medium-low heat, coat the pan with oil, and add the onions.  Slowly cook the onions, stirring, until they caramelize and release their natural sugars.  Add a couple of tablespoons of water to help the onions break down, if needed.  Toss in the ham, cook, stirring, for about 10 minutes to get some color on it.  Remove from heat.

In a large bowl, beat the eggs until frothy, pour in the cream; season with salt and pepper.  Arrange the caramelized onions and ham over the bottom of the crust and carefully pour in the cream and egg mixture; the filling should be about 1-inch from the top of the pan.

Cover loosely with foil and bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes.  Remove the foil and continue to bake for 15 minutes or until the quiche is set, puffy, and jiggles slightly.  Remove to a wire rack and let cool for 30 minutes.  In the meantime make the asparagus salad.

To make the Asparagus Salad:  In a large pot of boiling salted water, blanch the asparagus for 4 minutes, or until they are just crisp-tender.  Drain the asparagus, transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking, and drain well.

Slice the asparagus into 1/2-inch pieces and put them in a mixing bowl.  Add the Parmesan and herbs, drizzle the herb and asparagus salad with olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice, season with salt and pepper.  Toss gently to combine.

Loosen the quiche from the sides of the pan by running a thin metal spatula around the inside rim.  Carefully unmold the ring, and transfer the quiche (with the bottom base) to a serving plate.  Cut it into wedges, drizzle with a little olive oil, and a few turns of freshly ground black pepper.  Garnish with the asparagus salad on top.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dried chickpeas -- picked through,
                        and rinsed
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1              small  onion -- coarsely chopped
  6                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1         tablespoon  cumin seeds -- toasted, ground
  1         tablespoon  coriander seeds -- toasted, ground
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2                     handfuls fresh flat-leaf parsley -- leaves coarsely
                        chopped
  1                     handful fresh cilantro -- leaves coarsely
                        chopped
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  8                     Pita Breads -- (see recipe), warm
                        = (or store bought)
                        === TAHINI SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  tahini (sesame seed paste)
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt or water
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  paprika
                        ===
                        Shredded lettuce
                        Sliced tomatoes
                        Chopped cucumbers

Put the dried chickpeas in a large bowl and add cool water to cover by 2 inches.  Soak the beans in the refrigerator for at least 18 hours or up to 24; the chickpeas will swell to triple their original size.  Drain and rinse thoroughly.

Put the soaked chickpeas in a food processor and pulse to coarsely grind, not until smooth but with no whole chickpeas remaining either.  Add the baking powder, onion, garlic, spices, and herbs; process until the mixture is pureed; scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.  Taste and season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate while heating the oil, this should take about 15 minutes.

Pour 3-inches of the oil in a deep fryer or deep heavy pot and heat to 375 degrees.

Roll the falafel mixture into ping-pong size balls.  (Alternatively, use an ice cream scoop.)  Carefully slip a few at a time into the hot oil, making sure they don't stick to the bottom.  Fry until the chickpea fritters are a crusty dark brown on all sides, turning as needed, about 5 minutes per batch.  Remove the falafels with a slotted spoon and drain on a platter lined with paper towels.

Open the pita bread halves to make pockets (don't split all the way) and put 4 fried falafels into each.  Drizzle with the Tahini Sauce and layer with lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers.  Serve immediately.

Tahini Sauce:  Combine all the ingredients in a blender, process on high speed to make a smooth and creamy sauce.  Adjust seasoning, to taste, and serve with falafels or as a salad dressing.  (Makes about 1 cup)

This recipe yields 24 falafels.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1                     vanilla bean -- split and scraped
  3              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
  1              pinch  salt

To make the caramel:  Have ready a 2-quart round flan mold and a large roasting pan.

Combine 1 cup of the sugar and 2 tablespoons of water in a heavy-bottomed pot or pan.  Place over medium-high heat and cook until the sugar begins to melt.  Swirl the pan over the heat until the syrup darkens to a medium amber color, about 10 minutes; don't stir with a spoon.

Remove from the heat and immediately add the lemon juice, swirl the pan again to combine, and then pour into the flan mold.  Tilt the dish so that the caramel evenly coats the bottom and a bit up the sides, place in the roasting pan and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees, bring a kettle of water to a boil for the water bath and keep it hot.

Combine the cream, cinnamon, and vanilla in a small saucepan over medium-low flame.  Bring the cream to a brief simmer, stirring occasionally.  Take care not to let the cream come to a full boil to prevent it from spilling over.

In a large bowl, cream together the whole eggs and yolks with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar; add a pinch of salt.  Whisk until the mixture is pale yellow and thick.  Temper the egg mixture by gradually whisking in the hot cream mixture; don't add it too quickly or the eggs will cook.  Pass the mixture through a strainer into a large measuring cup to ensure that the flan will be perfectly smooth.  Pour the custard into the caramel-coated mold.

To create the water bath:  Pour the hot (not boiling) water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the side of the mold; be careful not get water into the custard.  Carefully transfer to the middle oven rack, and bake for 30 to 45 minutes, until the custard is barely set and just jiggles slightly.  Let the flan cool in the water bath, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.

When you are ready to serve, run a knife around the inside of the mold to loosen the flan.  Place a dessert plate on top of the flan and invert to pop it out.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  2              large  egg yolks
  1                cup  ice water
  1                cup  all-purpose flour

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Pour 3 inches of oil in a deep fryer or large, heavy pot and heat to 375 degrees.

In a deep mixing bowl, lightly beat the egg yolks and pour in the ice water; mix to combine.  Add the flour and continue to mix until the batter is the consistency of heavy cream.

Dip 2 zucchini flowers at a time in the batter to coat completely, letting the excess drip off.  Fry the flowers in the hot oil for 2 minutes until crisp and golden brown.

Drain the fried flowers on a platter lined with paper towels, season with salt and pepper while they are still hot.  Repeat with the remaining zucchini flowers.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Candies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  semisweet chocolate -- cut in chunks
  1                cup  creamy peanut butter
     1/4           cup  warm water
     1/4           cup  honey
  1                cup  heavy cream -- whipped
  2        tablespoons  chopped salted peanuts

Have 2 mini-muffin pans, a can of non-stick spray, a pastry brush, and a package of paper/foil candy cups out and ready; clear some space in the freezer.

Slowly melt the chocolate in a double boiler over hot water or in a microwave set on high for 2 minutes, stirring halfway through the heating time to smooth it out.  Dot a bit of chocolate in the center of each muffin cup and press a candy wrapper in the molds so it sticks in place.  Lightly spray the insides of the wrappers with a little non-stick cooking spray.

Brush about a tablespoon of the melted chocolate into the paper liners, pulling it up the insides of the wrapper so it's all coated.  Stick the chocolate cups in the freezer to harden while making the peanut butter filling.  Keep the remaining melted chocolate warm so it stays smooth; we'll need it again in a few minutes.

Combine the peanut butter, warm water, and honey in a mixing bowl, blend with a whisk until smooth and thinned out a bit.  Using a rubber spatula, fold the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture to make a light mousse -- don't overdo it, it's ok if there are streaks of cream in the filling.  Spoon the peanut butter mousse into a pastry bag filled with a large plain tip.

Take the chocolate cups out; they should be pretty solid by now, and pipe the peanut butter mousse into the centers, leaving room for a cap of chocolate.  Freeze again for a few minutes just so the mousse sets up a bit.

Spoon more melted chocolate on top to cover the peanut butter and fill the cup to the top; spreading evenly with a knife so it's smooth and level.  Sprinkle a little chopped peanuts on top and stick the peanut butter cups in the freezer to set up for 15 to 20 minutes.  Invert the muffin pans on a cutting board to pop out the peanut butter cups.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

               Gaucho-Grilled Steak With Chimichurri Sauce

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHIMICHURRI ===
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     jalapeÒos -- minced
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1              bunch  fresh flat-leaf parsley -- finely chopped
  1                     handful fresh oregano -- finely chopped
  2                     limes -- juiced
  1                cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  crushed black peppercorns
                        ===
  4             pounds  skirt steak -- excess fat trimmed
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine the garlic, jalapeno and vinegar in a bowl.  Stir in the parsley, oregano, and lime juice.  Whisk in the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Mix well and set aside at room temperature to allow the flavors to marry.

Marinate the steak in olive oil for 30 minutes, turning to coat both sides.

Preheat an outdoor charcoal grill or oven broiler to high.  Remove the steak from the oil and season both sides with a generous amount of salt and pepper; you should see the seasoning on the meat.  Grill the steaks on the hottest part of the barbecue for 4 minutes per side, until well charred.  Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let stand for 5 minutes.

Cut the steak across the grain on the diagonal and fan the slices out on a platter.  Spoon some Chimichurri over the meat and serve with the remaining sauce at the table.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

                          Gooey Caramel Popcorn

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Snacks

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
     1/2       package  marshmallows - (10-oz pkg) -- abt 4 cups
  10              cups  hot salted popcorn -- uncooked kernels
                        removed

In a saucepan, combine the brown sugar, water, corn syrup, butter, and cream of tartar (this bit of acid keeps the sugar from crystallizing.)  Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon to dissolve the sugar.  When the sugar syrup reaches a boil, stop stirring and swirl the pan around over the heat so it doesn't burn.

As the syrup reaches the caramel stage, the bubbles on top will become smaller, thicker, and closer together.  Simmer for 10 to 12 minutes, until the caramel coats the back of the spoon.  (If so inclined, stick a candy thermometer in the pot and cook until the syrup reaches the soft-crack stage, about 270 degrees.  When you drop a bit of this syrup into cold water, it will solidify into threads that, when removed, are hard yet bendable.)

Remove the caramel from the heat and stir in the marshmallows.  Fold the marshmallows into the hot caramel so they all melt into a gooey caramel sauce.

The caramel will coat better if the popcorn is hot, so make it while boiling the sugar or pop it first then keep it warm.  Put the popcorn in a big bowl and pour the caramel marshmallow mixture over the popcorn.  Gently fold with a wooden spoon to coat each kernel.

Grab handfuls of the popcorn and squeeze it together to form popcorn balls; make them about the size of a tennis ball.  Put the popcorn balls on a sheet pan lined with waxed paper to cool completely.

This recipe yields 12 popcorn balls.

  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1                cup  fresh bread crumbs

To prepare the eggplants:  Cut off the stems, remove the skin with a vegetable peeler, and cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Season all the pieces of eggplant with salt and pepper on both sides.  Coat a large skillet with oil and heat over medium flame.

Fry the eggplant in a single layer, turning once, until brown on both sides -- you will need to do this in batches, adding more oil, as necessary.  Drain the eggplant as they cook on a paper towel-lined platter.

Add a little more oil to the pan and toss in the onion, garlic, lemon slices, oregano, and parsley.  Cook and stir until soft and fragrant, about 3 minutes.

Add the ground lamb, stirring to break up the meat; season with salt and pepper, and toss in the cinnamon stick.  Stir in the tomato paste and hand-crushed tomatoes.  Simmer until the liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Line the bottom of a 9- by 13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish with 1/3 of the eggplant slices; they should completely cover the bottom with no gaps.  Spread 1/2 of the meat sauce over the eggplant, evening it out with a spatula.  Sprinkle with 1/2 of the feta and Parmesan.  Repeat the layers again, ending with a final layer of eggplant.  Cover the top with a nice even layer of bread crumbs.

Bake the moussaka for 30 to 40 minutes or until the top is golden.  Let cool 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                        Green Bean And Bacon Salad

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  French green beans -- stems trimmed
     1/4         pound  thick-cut bacon -- cut 1/4" pieces
  1                     shallot -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  walnut halves and pieces -- toasted
  1                     handful fresh flat-leaf parsley -- leaves chopped
  1         tablespoon  grainy mustard
  1         tablespoon  hot water
  1              pinch  sugar
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

In a large pot of boiling salted water, blanch the green beans for 4 minutes, or until they are just crisp-tender.  Drain the beans, transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking, and drain well.  Put the green beans in a mixing bowl.

In a large skillet, cook the bacon over moderate heat, until crispy.  Transfer the bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels.  Add the bacon to the green beans, along with the shallot, walnuts, and parsley.

In a mason jar, combine the mustard, water, sugar, and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.  Drizzle in the oil, put the cap on, and shake vigorously to emulsify.

If planning to eat the salad right away, pour the dressing over the green bean salad and serve.  If taking on a picnic, put the salad in a sealable plastic container and pack the dressing separately until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  eggplants - (abt 1 lb total)
  4                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  tahini (sesame seed paste)
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1                     handful fresh flat-leaf parsley -- coarsely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped roasted pistachios -- for garnish
                        Pita bread -- cut into wedges,
                        for dipping

Pierce the eggplants in a few places with a fork, so steam has somewhere to go when you cook them.

For a smoky flavor that will add depth to the finished dish, grill the eggplants on a very hot, oiled grill pan (or barbecue) until the skins are wrinkled and black, and the eggplants shriveled and soft; turning often.  (If you prefer, roast the eggplants in a preheated 400 degree oven for 30 minutes.)

When the eggplants are cool enough to handle, split them open and scoop out the flesh, discarding the skin and as many seeds as possible.

In a food processor, combine the garlic, tahini, lemon juice and parsley; puree until smooth.  Add the eggplant flesh; season with cumin, salt, and pepper; pulse several times to make a thick, coarse puree.  Pour in the oil and pulse again to incorporate.  Taste and adjust seasoning, as needed.

Pour into a serving bowl and garnish with chopped pistachios.  Serve with pita wedges for dipping.

This recipe yields about 2 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAPONATA ===
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     anchovy fillets -- coarsely chopped
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  4                     Japanese eggplants -- cubed
                        = (or 1 large Italian eggplant)
  2                     tomatoes -- halved, and
                        seeds squeezed out, coarsely chopped
  1                     red bell pepper -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  capers -- drained
     1/4           cup  raisins
     1/2           cup  pitted kalamata olives
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1              pinch  sugar
     1/2         bunch  fresh basil -- hand-torn
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === LEMON CREME FRAICHE ===
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1                     garlic clove
  1                     lemon -- zest finely grated
     1/4           cup  creme fraiche
                        === HERB SEARED TUNA ===
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  sushi-quality tuna loin
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  finely-chopped fresh herbs
                        = (such as basil, parsley, and chives)

To make the Caponata:  Pour the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat.  Add the anchovies and red pepper flakes and cook and stir for a few minutes to create a base flavor.

Fry the eggplant in the anchovy oil, until it gets brown and sticky, stirring often.  Add the tomatoes, red pepper, onion, and garlic, continue to cook until the vegetables break down and soften, about 15 minutes.

Toss in the capers, raisins, olives, balsamic vinegar, sugar, and basil; season with salt and pepper.  Lower the heat and slowly simmer until thick, about 20 to 30 minutes.  The caponata tastes great hot, cold or at room temperature.

To make the Lemon Creme Fraiche:  Put the chicken stock, garlic, and lemon zest in a saucepan and place over medium heat.  Simmer gently until the stock is reduced by half and thickened slightly.  Take the pot off the heat, fish out the garlic, and add the creme fraiche.  Just before you are ready to plate the dish, buzz the sauce with a handheld blender until it's thick and frothy.

To make the Herb-Seared Tuna:  Rub a little olive oil on the piece of tuna and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper.  Put the chopped herbs in a flat dish and roll in the herbs to coat.

Place a large skillet over medium-high heat and coat with 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  When the oil gets hazy, lay the herb-coated tuna in the hot pan and sear for approximately 1 1/2 minutes on each side; as the tuna cooks, the red meat will become whiter.  Transfer the tuna to a cutting board and slice.

To serve:  Spoon the caponata on the bottom of 2 plates, lay the herb-seared tuna slices around the center, and drizzle the whole thing with the frothy lemon creme fraiche sauce.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

To make the Caponata:  Pour the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat.  Add the anchovies and red pepper flakes and cook and stir for a few minutes to create a base flavor.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fry the eggplant in the anchovy oil, until it gets brown and sticky, stirring often.  Add the tomatoes, red pepper, onion, and garlic, continue to cook until the vegetables break down and soften, about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Toss in the capers, raisins, olives, balsamic vinegar, sugar, and basil; season with salt and pepper.  Lower the heat and slowly simmer until thick, about 20 to 30 minutes.  The caponata tastes great hot, cold or at room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Lemon Creme Fraiche:  Put the chicken stock, garlic, and lemon zest in a saucepan and place over medium heat.  Simmer gently until the stock is reduced by half and thickened slightly.  Take the pot off the heat, fish out the garlic, and add the creme fraiche.  Just before you are ready to plate the dish, buzz the sauce with a handheld blender until it&apos;s thick and frothy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Herb-Seared Tuna:  Rub a little olive oil on the piece of tuna and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper.  Put the chopped herbs in a flat dish and roll in the herbs to coat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a large skillet over medium-high heat and coat with 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  When the oil gets hazy, lay the herb-coated tuna in the hot pan and sear for approximately 1 1/2 minutes on each side; as the tuna cooks, the red meat will become whiter.  Transfer the tuna to a cutting board and slice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve:  Spoon the caponata on the bottom of 2 plates, lay the herb-seared tuna slices around the center, and drizzle the whole thing with the frothy lemon creme fraiche sauce.
</DirT>

This recipe yields 2 servings.

                     Horseradish Burgers With Havarti

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  ground chuck
     1/4           cup  grated fresh or prepared horseradish
     1/2         bunch  fresh chives -- minced
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Canola oil
  16            slices  havarti cheese
  8              large  hamburger buns -- split
                        === SERVING OPTIONS ===
                        Ketchup
                        Mayonnaise
                        Mustard
                        Cooked bacon
                        Lettuce
                        Sliced tomato
                        Sliced onion

Put the beef in a large mixing bowl.  Use a rubber spatula to fold in the horseradish and chives; season with salt and pepper.  Hand-form the meat into 8 burgers, cover them, and chill in the fridge while preparing your grill.

Place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill and get it very hot.  Burgers stick to a cold grill, so it's important that you give it plenty of time to heat.

Take a few paper towels and fold them several times to make a thick square.  Blot a small amount of oil on the paper towel then carefully and quickly wipe the hot grates of the grill; this will create a non-stick grilling surface.

Grill the burgers for 8 minutes per side for medium; 7 minutes if you like your meat rare.

When the burgers are just about cooked, put a couple of slices of cheese on top of each and cover the grill for 1 minute to melt the cheese.  Remove the burgers to a clean side plate so you have enough room to toast the buns.

Rub the grill rack with the same paper towel as before to clean the small charred pieces, then toast the hamburger buns cut-side down for 1 minute.  Serve the burgers with your favorite condiment and any garnish you like, such as bacon, lettuce, sliced tomato, and onion.

This recipe yields 8 burgers.

                      Lemon-Ginger Ice In Lemon Cups

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Ices/Sorbets

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             medium  to large lemons
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  2               cups  water
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 2") -- peeled, sliced
                        Crushed ice -- as needed
  1                     lemon -- zest finely grated
                        Fresh mint leaves -- for garnish

To make the lemon cups:  Trim a very thin slice off of the lemon bottoms so they'll sit sturdy when standing up.  Cut off the top 1/3 of the lemon and reserve to cap the cups.  Carefully hollow out each lemon with a teaspoon, turning and digging into the pith so the entire inside of the fruit comes out, take care to leave the lemon shell in tact.

Chop and mash the lemon pulp and strain into a blender.  (You should have about 1 cup of fresh lemon juice, reserve it for the filling.)  Freeze the lemon cups in egg cartons, with their lids, at least 1 hour or up to overnight.  The frozen shell will prevent the lemon ice from melting too quickly when you serve it.

To make the ginger syrup:  Combine the sugar, water, and ginger in a pot over medium heat.  Gently simmer and stir for 2 minutes until the sugar is dissolved and the ginger fragrant -- do not allow the syrup to boil or get dark.  Remove from heat, cover, and steep until cool.

Fill a blender with crushed ice, pour in the reserved cup of fresh lemon juice, add the ginger syrup (remove the big pieces of ginger), and process until slushy.  Add the lemon zest and blend again.  Freeze for 1 hour to firm it up a bit.

Scoop the lemon ginger ice into the prepared lemon cups, garnish with mint leaves, top with the lemon cap, and serve.  Serve in egg cups for a great presentation.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dry linguine
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for serving
  4                     garlic cloves -- slivered
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2             pounds  littleneck or Manila clams -- scrubbed, and
                        rinsed well
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
                        = (such as Pinot Grigio)
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     handfuls fresh flat-leaf parsley -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  lightly-toasted and fried bread crumbs -- (optional)

Prepare the sauce while the pasta is cooking to ensure that the linguine will be hot and ready when the sauce is finished.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender yet firm (as they say in Italian "al dente.")  Drain the pasta well.

Meanwhile, heat the olive oil over medium flame in a deep saute pan with a lid.  Add the garlic and red pepper flakes; saute for 2 minutes.  Add the clams, wine, and lemon juice.  Cover and cook, shaking the pan periodically, until all the clams are opened, about 7 minutes.  Discard any that have not opened.

Crank the flame up to medium-high heat.  Add the hot, drained linguine to the pan; add the butter and season with salt and pepper.  Toss the pasta with the clams to it's nicely coated.  Shower with chopped parsley and toasted bread crumbs.  Drizzle with a nice dose of olive oil before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === WONTON CRISPS ===
     1/2           cup  sesame oil
  40                    wonton skins
                        === EDAMAME PUREE ===
  1            package  frozen soy beans - (16 oz)
  1         tablespoon  wasabi powder or paste
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  6        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
                        === MARINATED TUNA ===
     1/2           cup  low-sodium soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  sake
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  red chili paste
                        = (such as sambal)
  1              pound  sushi-quality tuna -- cut 1/4" strips
                        = (such as ahi, yellowfin or bluefin)
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds -- toasted, for garnish

Preheat the oven 350 degrees.

Brush a couple of cookie sheets with sesame oil.  Lay the wonton skins side by side in a single layer.  Brush the surface of the wontons with sesame oil.  Bake for 15 minutes until the wontons crisp up and the edges get golden.  Using a spatula, remove the wonton crisps to a platter to let them cool.

Blanch the soy beans in boiling salted water for 5 minutes.  Drain, then pinch the beans out of their pods and put them in a food processor.  Add the wasabi, salt, lemon juice, and water.  Puree to break up the soy beans.  Pour in the canola oil and puree until smooth.  Refrigerate.

Whisk together the soy sauce, sake, brown sugar and chili paste until the sugar dissolves.  Arrange the sliced tuna in a single layer in a shallow dish.  Pour the marinade over the tuna, cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes.  Don't marinate the tuna any longer because it will start to "cook" and the texture will be mushy.

To put these little gems together, dollop a spoonful of the edamame puree on the wonton crisp then lay a slice of tuna on the top.  Garnish with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds.

This recipe yields 40 pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             medium  white onions -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced

  1              quart  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Canola oil -- for pan-frying
  8                     corn tortillas -- cut 1/8"-thk strips
  1 1/2           cups  shredded cooked chicken
  2                     avocados -- halved, pitted,
                        peeled, and diced

Ladle the hot soup into 4 soup bowls and put a pile of shredded chicken on top of each.  Top with the diced avocado and fried tortilla strips (and cheese if using).  Garnish with cilantro and serve with lime wedges.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  whole black coffee beans
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  brewed espresso coffee -- cold
  2             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- melted, cooled

Pour the heavy cream, vanilla and coffee beans into a saucepan and place over medium-low heat.  Bring the cream to a brief simmer; do not boil or it will overflow within seconds.  Remove from heat and strain to remove the beans.

In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the sugar until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is lemon-colored, about 3 minutes.  Temper the yolks by gradually whisking the hot cream into the yolk and sugar mixture (do not add the hot cream too quickly or the eggs will cook.)  Stir in the brewed coffee and melted chocolate.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Pour the egg-cream mixture into 6 (8-ounce) ramekins or cappuccino cups, filling 3/4 of the way full with mixture.  Fill a large, shallow baking pan with 1/2-inch of warm water.  Carefully place the ramekins in the water bath and bake for about 35 minutes, the center should jiggle slightly.  Remove the pan from the oven and let the ramekins cool in the water for 10 minutes.  Then pop them in the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        === GREEN OLIVE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     shallots -- sliced
  1                     fresh red chile -- halved lengthwise
     1/2         pound  large green Spanish olives -- pitted
     1/4         bunch  fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
  2        tablespoons  sherry vinegar
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        ===
  4             pieces  lavosh bread -- cut in half

To prepare the Moroccan Spice Mix for the chicken:  Combine the cinnamon stick, cloves, cayenne, cumin, fennel, coriander, and paprika in a dry skillet over low heat and toast for just a minute to release the fragrant oils; shake the pan so they don't scorch.  In a spice mill or clean coffee grinder, grind the toasted spices together, with 1 1/2 teaspoons of kosher salt and the brown sugar.  (A word of advice: make sure you thoroughly wipe out your coffee grinder before you make coffee again -- Moroccan spices taste great on chicken but horrible with coffee.)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Rinse the chicken with cool water, inside and out, then pat it dry with paper towels.  Massage the chicken skin with the spice rub; make sure you don't miss a spot.  Season the inside of the chicken generously with salt and pepper.

Stuff the lemons halves, cilantro, and garlic in the cavity and place the chicken in a roasting pan fitted with a rack.  Fold the wing tips under the bird and tie the legs together with kitchen string.  Drizzle the oil all over the chicken.  If you have time, let the chicken marinate for 30 minutes to really get the flavors down deep into the meat.

Roast the chicken for 1 hour; pop an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh; if it reads 160 degrees, it's done.  Allow the chicken to rest for 10 minutes so the juices can settle back into the meat.

Remove and discard the skin from the chicken.  Pull the chicken from the bone and shred the meat, with your fingers or 2 forks.  Put the shredded chicken in a large bowl and squeeze the lemon halves that have cooked inside the bird over the meat to moisten.

To prepare the Apricot Couscous:  Put the couscous in a medium bowl; pour the water over it, stir with a fork to combine.  Cover and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then uncover and fluff with a fork.  Put the apricots, almonds, green onions, mint, and cilantro on a cutting board and coarsely chop everything up; add this to the couscous.  Add lemon juice, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.  Toss gently to combine.

To prepare the Green Olive Sauce:  In a small skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Saute the shallots and chile over low heat for 8 minutes until caramelized, then scrape into a food processor.  Add the olives, parsley, vinegar, lemon juice, and 1/2 cup of oil; puree a good 3 minutes until totally smooth.

To put the whole thing together: put the shredded chicken and couscous on the lavosh bread, add a few spoonfuls of the olive sauce, and roll the sandwich up.  Wrap in foil and take the sandwich to a picnic, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

To prepare the Moroccan Spice Mix for the chicken:  Combine the cinnamon stick, cloves, cayenne, cumin, fennel, coriander, and paprika in a dry skillet over low heat and toast for just a minute to release the fragrant oils; shake the pan so they don&apos;t scorch.  In a spice mill or clean coffee grinder, grind the toasted spices together, with 1 1/2 teaspoons of kosher salt and the brown sugar.  (A word of advice: make sure you thoroughly wipe out your coffee grinder before you make coffee again -- Moroccan spices taste great on chicken but horrible with coffee.)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Pizza Dough -- (see recipe)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             slices  prosciutto -- sliced in strips
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2                     fresh rosemary sprigs -- needles striped
                        from the stem
  1              pound  assorted wild mushrooms -- coarsely chopped
                        = (such as crimini, portobello, shiitake,
                        and oyster)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     goat cheese logs - (4 oz ea)
  2               cups  shredded fontina
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated pecorino

Make the pizza dough as directed in the master recipe.  Stick a pizza stone in the oven and preheat them to 500 degrees.

Coat a saute pan with the olive oil and place over medium heat.  When the oil gets hazy, add the prosciutto strips, stir to render out the ham's fat and flavor.  Toss in the garlic and rosemary, saute for a minute until fragrant.  Add the mushrooms, cook and stir until they've released their moisture and are nicely browned, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat.

Crumble goat cheese evenly on the crust, scatter sauteed mushrooms all around, and top with shredded fontina.  Slide the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the crust is golden and crisp, and the cheese is bubbly.

Before cutting the pizza into slices, grate pecorino over the whole damn thing!

This recipe yields 3 pizzas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PAPRIKA BUTTER ===
  2              heads  roasted garlic
  3                     anchovy fillets
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
  2        tablespoons  sweet paprika
  2                     fresh thyme sprigs -- leaves striped from
                        the stem
                        === STEAKS ===
  4                     New York strip steaks - (10 oz ea)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     handfuls fresh rosemary
  2                     handfuls fresh thyme
                        === GRILLED FENNEL SALAD ===
  4              small  fennel bulbs -- tops removed,
                        sliced into 1" rings
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     lemon
     1/2           cup  pitted green Spanish olives
     1/4         bunch  fresh basil
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander

Mash the roasted garlic and anchovies on a cutting board with the flat side of a knife to make a paste.  In a mixing bowl, cream the butter with a wooden spoon or spatula.  Add the paprika, thyme leaves, and the mashed garlic mixture.  Mix until the ingredients are well blended and the butter is red; set aside at room temperature.

Rub both sides of the steaks with oil, season with a generous amount of salt and pepper.  Put the steaks on a large platter and toss the rosemary and thyme on top.  Drizzle with a bit more olive oil and cover with plastic.  Allow the steaks to marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill and get it very hot.  Take a few paper towels and fold them several times to make a thick square.  Blot a small amount of oil on the paper towel then carefully and quickly wipe the hot grates of the grill; this will create a non-stick grilling surface.  Grill the steaks about 7 minutes per side for medium-rare.

While the steaks are working, put the fennel rings in a bowl and drizzle with a healthy dose of olive oil; add the juice of 1/2 of a lemon.  Put the fennel on the free side of the grill and grill for 5 minutes per side.  Take everything off the grill; let the steak rest while you put the salad together.

Put the grilled fennel in a bowl and add the remaining salad ingredients: the olives, basil, red pepper flakes, coriander, and remaining lemon juice.  Drizzle with another dose of olive oil, season with salt and pepper and give the salad a good toss.  This salad is best when the fennel is still warm, so lather the steak with the paprika butter and serve it with the salad as soon as possible.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

             Pan-Roasted Chicken With Mushrooms And Rosemary

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              ounce  boneless chicken breast with wing attached -- with skin
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  5                     fresh white mushrooms -- halved
  2                     shallots -- halved
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2                lemon -- juiced

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Season the chicken on both sides with a generous amount of salt and pepper.  Place a cast-iron or regular ovenproof skillet on the stove over medium heat.  Drizzle the pan with the oil and lay the chicken in the hot fat, skin-side down.  Cook for about 5 minutes until the skin begins to set and crisp.

Throw in the mushrooms, shallots, and rosemary.  Stick the whole thing in the hot oven and roast for 15 minutes until the chicken is cooked, and the mushrooms and shallots are soft and roasted.

The last thing to make is a quick sauce using the flavors left in the bottom of the skillet.  Take all the stuff out of the pan and arrange on a dinner plate to keep warm while preparing the pan sauce.

Pour out all but 1 tablespoon of the rendered chicken fat and return the skillet to the stovetop.  Stir in the water and lemon juice and cook over medium heat, scraping up the flavors with a wooden spoon.  Cook the liquid down to a syrup, about 5 minutes.  Drizzle the pan sauce over the dish, season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3 1/2           cups  bread flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1           teaspoon  olive oil

In the bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water; stir to blend.  Let the yeast stand until foamy, about 5 to 10 minutes.

Stir in the salt.  Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until all the flour has been incorporated and the dough gathers into a ball; this should take about 4 minutes.

Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until it's smooth and elastic.  Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, turn it over to coat, and cover with plastic wrap.  Allow to rise until double in size, about 1 1/2 hours.

Place a large pizza stone on the lower oven rack, preheat the oven (and stone) to 500 degrees.

Punch the dough down, divide it into 8 pieces, and gather each piece into a ball; keeping all of them lightly floured and covered while you work.  Allow the balls of dough to rest, covered, for 15 minutes so they will be easier to roll out.

Using a rolling pin, roll each dough ball into a circle that is about 8-inches in diameter and 1/4-inch thick.  Make sure the circle is totally smooth, with no creases or seams in the dough, which can prevent the pitas from puffing up properly.  Cover the disks as you roll them out, but do not stack them up.

Put 2 pita rounds at a time on the hot pizza stone and bake for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the bread puffs up like a balloon and is pale golden.  Watch closely; they bake fast.

Remove the bread from the oven and place on a rack to cool for 5 minutes; they will naturally deflate, leaving a pocket in the center.  Wrap the pitas in a large kitchen towel to keep them soft.

This recipe yields 8 pitas.

Categories    : Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1                cup  warm water
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
  3               cups  00 flour -- plus
                        more for dusting

In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water; stir gently to dissolve.  Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.

Turn the mixer on low and add the salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until all the flour has been incorporated.  When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium; stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook.  Get a feel for the dough by squeezing a small amount together: if it's crumbly, add more water; if it's sticky, add more flour -- 1 tablespoon at a time.  Mix until the dough gathers into a ball, this should take about 5 minutes.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times; kneading until it's smooth and elastic.  Form the dough into a round and place in a lightly oiled bowl, turn it over to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e. over a gas pilot light) until doubled in size, about 1 hour.  This is a good time to stick a pizza stone in the oven and preheat them to 500 degrees.

Once the dough is domed and spongy, turn it out onto a lightly floured counter.  Roll and stretch the dough into a cylinder and divide into 3 equal pieces.  Cover and let rest for 10 minutes so it will be easier to roll out.

Roll or pat out a piece of dough into a 12 inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick.  Dust a pizza paddle with flour and slide it under the pizza dough.  Brush the crust with a thin layer of olive oil, and top with your favorite flavors.  Slide the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the crust is golden and crisp.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

This recipe yields 3 pizza crusts.

In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water; stir gently to dissolve.  Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn the mixer on low and add the salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until all the flour has been incorporated.  When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium; stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook.  Get a feel for the dough by squeezing a small amount together: if it&apos;s crumbly, add more water; if it&apos;s sticky, add more flour -- 1 tablespoon at a time.  Mix until the dough gathers into a ball, this should take about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times; kneading until it&apos;s smooth and elastic.  Form the dough into a round and place in a lightly oiled bowl, turn it over to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e. over a gas pilot light) until doubled in size, about 1 hour.  This is a good time to stick a pizza stone in the oven and preheat them to 500 degrees.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIZZA DOUGH ===
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1                cup  warm water
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
  3               cups  00 flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
                        === PIZZA TOPPING ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              bunch  fresh basil leaves
  2               cans  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz ea) -- drained, and
                        hand crushed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     sweet Italian sausages
  1                     ball fresh buffalo mozzarella - (8 oz) -- water drained
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan

For the Pizza Dough:  In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water; stir gently to dissolve.  Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.

Turn the mixer on low and add the salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until all the flour has been incorporated.  When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium; stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook.  Get a feel for the dough by squeezing a small amount together: if it's crumbly, add more water; if it's sticky, add more flour -- 1 tablespoon at a time.  Mix until the dough gathers into a ball, this should take about 5 minutes.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times; kneading until it's smooth and elastic.  Form the dough into a round and place in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it over to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e. over a gas pilot light) until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Once the dough is domed and spongy, turn it out onto a lightly floured counter.  Roll and stretch the dough into a cylinder and divide into 3 equal pieces.  Cover and let rest for 15 minutes so it will be easier to roll out.

In the meantime, make the Pizza Topping:  Coat a saute pan with the olive oil and place over medium heat.  When the oil gets hazy, add the onion and garlic, cook and stir for 5 minutes to soften.  Stir in 1/2 bunch torn basil leaves.  Carefully add the tomatoes (nothing splashes like tomatoes), cook and stir until the liquid is cooked down and the sauce is thick, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper and then take it off the stove.

Preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot.  Brush the grates with oil to keep the sausages from sticking.  Grill the sausages until cooked through, turning with tongs.  Set aside.  Keep the grill hot to make the pizza.

Roll or pat out a piece of dough into a rustic, oblong shape, about 1/4-inch thick -- do this directly on a lightly floured pizza paddle for ease.  Brush the crust with a thin layer of olive oil, and lay oil-side down onto the hot grill.  Once the dough looks set, in about 2 minutes, turn the crust over.

Spread the tomato sauce evenly on the crust with a ladle.  Rip the mozzarella into pieces with your hands and distribute them on top; crumble the grilled sausage all over the pizza.  Close the grill cover and cook until the cheese is melted and bubbling and the crust is golden and crisp, about 5 minutes.

Remove the pizza from grill and sprinkle with some fresh basil leaves and a good dusting of Parmesan.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

This recipe yields 3 pizzas.

  2          teaspoons  sea salt
  2                     lemons -- halved, plus
                        more for serving
  3                     bay leaves
  1                     handful fresh thyme leaves
  1                     handful fresh flat-leaf parsley
     1/4           cup  seafood seasoning
                        = (Old Bay or Zatarains shrimp boil
                        recommended)
  2             pounds  jumbo shrimp -- with shells, heads,
                        and tails on
                        Bloody Mary Cocktail Sauce -- (see recipe)

Fill a large pot with about a 1/2 gallon of water, add the salt and squeeze in the lemon juice; toss the halves in there too for extra flavor.  Add the herbs and seafood seasoning.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and simmer for 5 minutes to infuse the water with the aromatics.

Reduce heat to medium-low and add shrimp.  Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until the shrimp are bright pink and the tails curl.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the shrimp from the poaching liquid and chill thoroughly before peeling.

Serve with lemon wedges and Bloody Mary Cocktail Sauce as part of a raw shellfish bar.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === POMMES FRITES ===
     1/2        gallon  vegetable oil
  8             medium  Idaho potatoes -- peeled
                        Sea salt -- as needed
                        === PARSLEY BUTTER ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut in chunks
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced

Pour the oil into a deep fryer or heavy saucepan to reach halfway up the sides and heat to 325 degrees, use a deep-fry thermometer to determine this.  While the oil is heating, peel the skin off the potatoes and cut them into uniform 1/4-inch sticks; feel free to use a knife, mandoline, or French fry cutter.  Dry the potato sticks thoroughly to keep the hot oil from splattering.

Fry the potatoes in batches so the pot isn't crowded and the oil temperature does not plummet.  Cook the French fries for 3 minutes, until soft but not browned.  Remove the fries with a long-handled metal strainer and drain on brown paper bags.

Increase the oil temperature to 375 degrees.  Return the par-fried potatoes to the oil and cook a second time for 2 minutes, or until golden and crispy.  Drain on fresh brown paper bags then place in a serving bowl.  Salt the fries while they're still hot and pour the parsley butter on top; toss gently to combine.  Wrap the pommes frites in parchment paper cones and stick them in the bottom of mini martini shakers for serving individually.

To make the parsley butter:  Combine the butter, parsley, and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat.  Swirl the pan around until the butter is completely melted.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  active dry yeast
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  warm water
  1 1/2           cups  stone-ground cornmeal -- plus
                        additional for sprinkling
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  boiling water
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted, cooled
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for brushing
  1         tablespoon  coarse salt

In a small bowl combine the yeast, sugar, and the warm water in a large bowl until the yeast is dissolved and foamy, about 5 to 10 minutes.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal and salt with the boiling water.  Beat vigorously with a wooden spoon to blend.  Add the melted butter and mix to incorporate.

Now, pour the yeast mixture into the cornmeal mixture, stirring to combine.  Gradually add the flour, mixing well after each addition.  Add a couple of tablespoons of water if the dough feels dry and doesn't come together easily.  Continue to mix until a dough forms into a ball.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking, until smooth and elastic, about 5 to 10 minutes.

Grease a large bowl with oil and transfer the dough to the bowl, brush the top with more oil so it is completely coated.  Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.

Turn the dough out onto the floured surface and knead briefly, 3 or 4 times, to punch out the air.  Gather the dough into a ball and shape it into a round loaf.  Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and let rise again until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and place a pizza stone in the oven to heat up.

Put the dough round on the pizza stone and brush the top with oil.  Sprinkle the top of the bread with coarse salt.  Bake in middle of the oven for 40 to 50 minutes until the bread is golden brown and bottom sounds hollow when tapped.  To recreate the steam effect from authentic Portuguese brick ovens, spray the bread and oven walls with cold water every 10 minutes.  Transfer the bread to a wire rack to cool.

This recipe yields 1 (8-inch) round loaf.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHOCOLATE SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2         pound  semisweet chocolate -- cut in chunks
     1/4      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        === PROFITEROLES ===
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  sifted all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  3              large  eggs
  1              quart  vanilla ice cream

Chocolate Sauce:  Combine the cream and butter in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.  Heat the mixture until bubbles appear around the sides of the pot, but do not allow the cream to boil.  Mix in the chocolate and vanilla; remove from the heat and stir until the chocolate melts and the sauce is smooth.  May be served warm or chilled.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

Profiteroles:  To make the pate a choux: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the water, butter, sugar, and salt to a gentle boil over medium-high heat, stirring to melt the butter completely.  Add all the flour and baking powder at once and continue to stir until all the flour is incorporated and the dough becomes a mass that pulls away from the sides of the pot.

Remove from the heat and scrape the dough into a mixing bowl.  Using a standing or hand-held mixer, beat the dough on medium speed to cool it off a bit.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl periodically.  When all eggs have been incorporated, the dough should be a thick, smooth, and glossy paste.

Form 24 golf ball-size mounds on the lined baking sheet about 2-inches apart allowing room for them to spread; keep the mounds as high and round as possible.  You can use a pastry bag fitted with a star tip or a large spoon, your choice.

Place the pans in the oven and bake for 10 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and continue to cook for 25 minutes.  Do not open the oven door or remove the pans from the oven until the puffs are firm to the touch.  The profiteroles should be golden brown and well-risen.  Allow the shells to cool before filling.

Using a serrated knife, slice the pastry puffs almost in 1/2.  Place 3 profiteroles on each dessert plate and fill with a scoop of ice cream.  Drizzle the chocolate sauce over the top; garnish with powdered sugar and fresh mint if desired.

This recipe yields 24 profiteroles; 8 to 12 servings.

Chocolate Sauce:  Combine the cream and butter in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.  Heat the mixture until bubbles appear around the sides of the pot, but do not allow the cream to boil.  Mix in the chocolate and vanilla; remove from the heat and stir until the chocolate melts and the sauce is smooth.  May be served warm or chilled.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

<DirT>
Profiteroles:  To make the pate a choux: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the water, butter, sugar, and salt to a gentle boil over medium-high heat, stirring to melt the butter completely.  Add all the flour and baking powder at once and continue to stir until all the flour is incorporated and the dough becomes a mass that pulls away from the sides of the pot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the heat and scrape the dough into a mixing bowl.  Using a standing or hand-held mixer, beat the dough on medium speed to cool it off a bit.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl periodically.  When all eggs have been incorporated, the dough should be a thick, smooth, and glossy paste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Form 24 golf ball-size mounds on the lined baking sheet about 2-inches apart allowing room for them to spread; keep the mounds as high and round as possible.  You can use a pastry bag fitted with a star tip or a large spoon, your choice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the pans in the oven and bake for 10 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and continue to cook for 25 minutes.  Do not open the oven door or remove the pans from the oven until the puffs are firm to the touch.  The profiteroles should be golden brown and well-risen.  Allow the shells to cool before filling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a serrated knife, slice the pastry puffs almost in 1/2.  Place 3 profiteroles on each dessert plate and fill with a scoop of ice cream.  Drizzle the chocolate sauce over the top; garnish with powdered sugar and fresh mint if desired.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 24 profiteroles; 8 to 12 servings.

  24                    littleneck clams
                        Crushed ice or rock salt
                        Cucumber Mignonette Sauce -- (see recipe)

Scrub the clams under cold water with a stiff brush to remove the dirt.  Next, find a durable thick cloth and fold it over several times to create a square; this will steady the clams as you shuck them and also protect your hand.

Using the towel as a mitt, hold the clam firmly in the palm of your towel-covered hand; have a small bowl handy to catch the delicious juice.  Insert the tip of a clam or oyster knife between the shell halves, and work it around one side to the other as you pry it open.

Using the knife, cut the muscles away from the top shell, bend the shell back, and discard it.  Run the knife underneath the clam to detach it completely, but leave it in its shell (take care not to cut the meat itself.)  Tip out the clam juice into the bowl and pour it back over the shucked clams.

Nestle the clams in a bed of crushed ice or rock salt to keep them steady.  Spoon the Cucumber Mignonette Sauce on top and serve as part of a raw shellfish bar.

This recipe yields 24 clams.

  24                    oysters

                        Cucumber Mignonette Sauce -- (see recipe)

Scrub the oysters under cold water with a stiff brush to remove the dirt, especially in the hinge area where mud has a tendency to get trapped.  Next, find a durable thick cloth and fold it over several times to create a square; this will steady the oysters as you shuck them and also protect your hand.

Using the towel as a mitt, place the oyster, cup-side down in the palm of your towel-covered hand with the hinge facing you; have a small bowl handy to catch the delicious juice.  Insert the tip of an oyster knife or dull butter knife as far into the hinge as it will go; don't jab it in there or you could break the shell.  With gentle force, twist the knife back and forth to pry the shell open.

Using the knife, cut the muscle away from the top shell, bend the shell back, and discard it.  Run the knife underneath the oyster to detach it completely, but leave it in its shell.  Tip out the briny liquor into the bowl and pour it back over the shucked oysters.

Nestle the oysters in a bed of crushed ice or rock salt to keep them steady.  Spoon the Cucumber Mignonette Sauce on top and serve as part of a raw shellfish bar.

                        === PORK ===
  5             pounds  pork loin roast -- with rib bones
                        attached, back bone removed
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     handful fresh sage leaves -- chopped
  1                     handful fresh thyme leaves -- chopped

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1             bottle  hard cider - (12 oz)
  1                cup  chicken broth
                        === BAKED APPLES ===
  8                     gala apples
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- room temperature
  1              large  corn muffin -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
  6                     fresh sage leaves -- coarsely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  hard cider

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place the pork roast in a roasting pan with the ribs facing up.  In a small bowl, mix the olive oil with the sage and thyme to flavor the oil.  Brush the whole pork roast with the "herb bath" and season with a generous amount of salt and pepper.  Roast the pork loin for 2 1/2 hours, until the meat is crackled.  (Put the apples in the oven along with the pork roast in the last half hour of cooking.)

Remove the pork roast to a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving.  Pour out some of the excess fat from the roasting pan and put it on the stove over medium-high heat.

Sprinkle the flour into the hot pan juices, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps.  Cook and stir the roux until it is light brown.  Add the cider and continue to stir to incorporate.  Pour in the chicken broth; boil and stir for 5 minutes until the sauce is thick; taste and check for salt and pepper.

Serve the cider gravy with the pork roast And Baked Apples.

To make the Baked Apples:  Core the apples with an apple corer, making a good size cavity to hold the stuffing.  In a mixing bowl, combine the softened butter, muffin crumbs, raisins, sage, garlic, 3 tablespoons of the brown sugar, salt, and pepper.

Spoon the sweet and savory stuffing into the cavities of the cored apples; stand them up, side by side, in a baking dish and sprinkle the tops with the remaining 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.  Pour the cider around the apples and bake for 30 to 35 minutes at 375 degrees, until soft when pierced with a knife.

Place the warm apples in the center of a round serving dish.  Spoon the cider sauce around the apples and serve with the pork loin.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

(Put the apples in the oven along with the pork roast in the last half hour of cooking.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the pork roast to a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving.  Pour out some of the excess fat from the roasting pan and put it on the stove over medium-high heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sprinkle the flour into the hot pan juices, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps.  Cook and stir the roux until it is light brown.  Add the cider and continue to stir to incorporate.  Pour in the chicken broth; boil and stir for 5 minutes until the sauce is thick; taste and check for salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve the cider gravy with the pork roast And Baked Apples.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Baked Apples:  Core the apples with an apple corer, making a good size cavity to hold the stuffing.  In a mixing bowl, combine the softened butter, muffin crumbs, raisins, sage, garlic, 3 tablespoons of the brown sugar, salt, and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon the sweet and savory stuffing into the cavities of the cored apples; stand them up, side by side, in a baking dish and sprinkle the tops with the remaining 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.  Pour the cider around the apples and bake for 30 to 35 minutes at 375 degrees, until soft when pierced with a knife.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the warm apples in the center of a round serving dish.  Spoon the cider sauce around the apples and serve with the pork loin.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  tomatillos -- husked, rinsed
  2                     jalapenos -- stemmed
     1/2        medium  onion -- peeled, quartered
  2                     garlic clove -- peeled
  1                     handful fresh cilantro leaves -- coarsely chopped
  1                     lime -- juiced
  1           teaspoon  toasted cumin seeds
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  chicken stock -- room temperature
  4               cups  shredded Jack cheese
  1                     bag salted corn tortilla chips - (16 oz)
  1              whole  roasted chicken - (abt 3 lbs) -- meat finely
                        shredded, skin and bones discarded
                        === QUICK SALSA ===
  1               pint  cherry tomatoes -- halved
  2                     green onions, white and green parts -- chopped
  1                     jalapeÒo -- chopped
  2                     handfuls fresh cilantro leaves -- hand shredded
  2                     limes -- juiced
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Sour cream -- for serving

Bring a pot of water to a boil; add the tomatillos, jalapeÒos, onion, and garlic.  Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the tomatillos are soft.  Drain and cool slightly, then put them in a blender.  Add the cilantro, lime juice, and cumin.  Puree for a few seconds to blend, and then pour in about a 1/4 cup of water and process to a coarse puree; taste and season with a generous pinch of salt.  You should have about 2 cups of this salsa verde.

Make a roux by melting the butter over medium-low heat in a thick-bottomed saucepan.  Just as the foam subsides, sprinkle in the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to remove the starchy taste from the flour; don't allow it to brown.  Gradually whisk in the chicken stock and simmer for 8 minutes to thicken.

Once you have a good base, fold in 2 cups of the shredded Jack cheese; mix until completely melted into a sauce.  Stir in the prepared salsa verde until incorporated; remove the green chili cheese sauce from the heat.

Make a quick salsa by combining the cherry tomatoes, onions, jalapeÒo, cilantro, and lime juice in a bowl; season with salt and pepper, tossing to combine.

To build these awesome nachos:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Get a very large oven-proof platter and cover it with a few handfuls of tortilla chips, follow with a portion of the shredded chicken, a coating of the cheese sauce, and a nice sprinkle of the remaining shredded jack.  Make 3 or 4 layers of the nachos, depending on the size of the platter.  Bake the nachos until they are all hot and gooey, about 5 to 10 minutes.

Spoon the tomato salsa over the top of the nachos and serve with the sour cream on the side.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  red bell peppers
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             medium  onion
  6                     vine-ripe tomatoes
  4                     garlic cloves
  1                     handful fresh flat-leaf parsley
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar

Preheat an outdoor charcoal grill to medium-high.  Rub the peppers with oil and season them with salt and pepper.  Place the peppers directly on the grill and roast for 10 minutes, turning periodically with tongs, so they are really charred and blistered on all sides.

Put the peppers into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and steam for about 10 minutes to loosen the skins.  Pull out the cores of the red peppers and remove the seeds.  Peel the blackened skins and tear the peppers into strips; put them on a serving platter.

Put the onion, tomatoes, garlic, and parsley on a cutting board; chop everything up into bite-size pieces and swipe the mixture into a bowl; season generously with salt and pepper.  Pour in the vinegar and oil, mix well to incorporate the ingredients.  Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.

Pour the salsa over the roasted red peppers and serve at room temperature with beef or other dishes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                     lemon -- zest finely grated
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cold, and
                        cut into small chunks
  1              large  egg yolk
  2        tablespoons  ice water -- plus
                        more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
  4              large  ripe peaches -- pitted, sliced
  1               pint  fresh blueberries
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  all-purpose flour
                        === GLAZE ===
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for egg wash
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        ===
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

To make the Pastry:  Combine the flour, sugar, salt, and lemon zest in a large mixing bowl.  Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the egg yolk and pour in the ice water; work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky.  Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time.  Form the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

To make the Filling:  Combine the peaches, blueberries, lemon juice, sugar, and flour in a large mixing bowl.  Toss the mixture gently to coat the fruit.

Prepare your wood burning brick oven according to manufacturer's directions or place a pizza stone in a conventional oven and preheat to 375 degrees.

Sprinkle the counter and a rolling pin lightly with flour.  Roll the dough out into a 14-inch circle, about 1/4-inch thick; it doesn't have to be perfect, free-form is the look you want for this rustic tart.  Transfer the dough to a lightly floured pizza paddle.

Spoon the fruit mixture into the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch border all around; brush the border with the egg wash.  Lift the edge of crust over the filling, leaving the fruit exposed in center.  Gently fold and pinch the dough to seal any cracks.  Brush the crust with the remaining egg wash and sprinkle with sugar.

Bake the crostata directly on the brick oven floor towards the front or on the preheated pizza stone for 30 to 40 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and fruit is bubbly and tender.  Slide a pizza paddle under the tart to remove it from the oven.  Serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 1 tart.

                      Salad Nicoise With Seared Tuna

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh tarragon
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === SALAD ===
  1              pound  small red new potatoes -- scrubbed, halved
  8              large  eggs
     1/2         pound  haricots verts or French green beans -- stems trimmed
  2             pounds  fresh sushi-quality tuna
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1               pint  teardrop or cherry tomatoes -- halved
  1                cup  nicoise olives
  16                    anchovy fillets
  16                    caper berries with stems
     1/2         bunch  fresh chives -- snipped in half

To make the Vinaigrette:  Combine all ingredients in a mason jar.  Screw the cap on the jar and shake the vinaigrette vigorously to emulsify.  Set the dressing aside while preparing the salad so the flavors can marry.

Cooking the potatoes, eggs, and green beans in the same pot cuts down on prep time and clean up.  To do this, put the potatoes in a large saucepan, add water to cover and a nice pinch of salt; bring to a boil over medium heat.  Simmer the potatoes for 12 minutes to give them a head start, and then add the eggs.

Place a steamer basket or colander on top of the simmering water.  Put the green beans in the steamer and cover with a lid.  Steam the beans for 5 minutes until crisp-tender while continuing to cook the potatoes until fork tender.

Drain out the water and put the potatoes, eggs, and green beans in a colander; rinse briefly under cold water.  Peel the shells off the eggs and cut them in 1/2 lengthwise.

Place a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Rub the tuna on all sides with olive oil, and a bit of the vinaigrette; season with a fair amount of salt and pepper.  Lay the tuna in the hot pan and sear for approximately 2 minutes on each side; as the tuna cooks, the red meat will become whiter.  Transfer the tuna to a cutting board and slice.

To assemble the Salad:  Combine the potatoes, green beans, tomatoes, olives, anchovies, capers, and chives in a large mixing bowl.  Take the vinaigrette and give it another good shake to recombine.  Drizzle the salad with enough vinaigrette to fully moisten and toss gently to coat; season with salt and pepper.  Take care not to mush up the ingredients -- the important thing about salad nicoise is that it is arranged nicely on a platter with all the elements keeping their individual integrity.

Put the tossed salad down the center of a serving platter and lay the seared tuna attractively across the top and the eggs around the rim.  Drizzle with the remaining vinaigrette and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Rub the tuna on all sides with olive oil, and a bit of the vinaigrette; season with a fair amount of salt and pepper.  Lay the tuna in the hot pan and sear for approximately 2 minutes on each side; as the tuna cooks, the red meat will become whiter.  Transfer the tuna to a cutting board and slice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble the Salad:  Combine the potatoes, green beans, tomatoes, olives, anchovies, capers, and chives in a large mixing bowl.  Take the vinaigrette and give it another good shake to recombine.  Drizzle the salad with enough vinaigrette to fully moisten and toss gently to coat; season with salt and pepper.  Take care not to mush up the ingredients -- the important thing about salad nicoise is that it is arranged nicely on a platter with all the elements keeping their individual integrity.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the tossed salad down the center of a serving platter and lay the seared tuna attractively across the top and the eggs around the rim.  Drizzle with the remaining vinaigrette and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                Salt Cod Fritters - {Pasteis De Bacalhau}

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried salt cod
  2               cups  milk
  4             medium  Idaho potatoes
  1              large  Spanish onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     handful fresh flat-leaf parsley -- finely chopped
  1                     handful fresh cilantro -- finely chopped
  2              large  eggs
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

Starting a day ahead, soak the dried cod in cold water for 12 to 24 hours, changing the water several times to remove the majority of the salt.

Drain the cod, rinse, and put it in a large pot.  Add the milk and enough water to cover by 1-inch; cooking the cod in milk keeps it really moist.  Simmer gently over medium-low heat for 20 to 25 minutes, until the cod is tender and pliable.  Drain and rinse well, then flake the cod into a bowl with your hands, removing any little bits of skin and bone.

While the cod is cooking, pour 1-inch of water in a large pot fitted with a steamer insert.  Add the potatoes and simmer on medium heat for 20 to 25 minutes until very tender.  Drain the potatoes, peel off the skins, and mash them well with a potato masher or pass them through a ricer or sieve.

Add the cod to the potatoes, along with the onion, garlic, parsley, cilantro, and eggs.  Beat the mixture firmly with a wooden spoon so that it well combined and firm -- a spoon should stand up in it.  (If you find it too dry, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of milk.)  Season with a pinch of pepper and taste for salt -- you may not need to add any, as the cod itself retains enough saltiness, in spite of being soaked and boiled.

With lightly moistened hands or using 2 tablespoons, shape the cod mixture into egg-shaped balls -- you should get about 25.  (The cod balls can be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day before cooking or frozen in a container.)

Heat 3-inches of oil in a deep heavy skillet or pot to 370 degrees.  Add a few of the cod balls at a time to the hot oil, turning them 3 or 4 times to get nicely browned all over.  Carefully lift the cod fritters out of the pan with a slotted spoon and place on a platter lined with paper towels to drain.  Repeat.  Serve hot or at room temperature with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 25 cod fritters.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2            bunches  collard or kale greens - (abt 2 lbs)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves
  1                cup  chicken broth
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To prepare the greens, cut away the tough stalks and stems from the collards and discard any leaves that are bruised or yellow.  Fill the sink with water and salt, the salt helps to remove any impurities.  Wash the collards thoroughly to remove the grit, 2 or 3 times, until the water runs clear.  Dry thoroughly.  Stack up several leaves and roll up lengthwise in a bundle, cut them into 1-inch ribbons.  Repeat until all the leaves are shredded.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; blanch the collard greens for 3 minutes until tender but still bright green.  Drain the greens well.

Heat a large deep skillet over medium flame and coat with the oil.  Add the garlic and saute for 2 minutes to soften.  Add the blanched greens and toss well with the oil and garlic.  Pour in the chicken broth and cook for 5 minutes until the greens are wilted and tender; take care not to overcook.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             medium  soft-shell crabs -- cleaned, rinsed
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
                        = (such as Sauvignon Blanc)
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1                     handful fresh flat-leaf parsley -- finely chopped
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

To prepare the soft-shell crabs:  Put the flour in a pie dish or plate and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper.  Dredge the crabs in the seasoned flour to coat, shaking off the excess.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high flame.  Lay the crabs in the hot oil in a single layer without crowding; you may have to fry them in batches.  Be careful, the crabs have a tendency to pop and spatter.  Cook the crabs for about 3 minutes on each side, turning once, until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels and cover to keep warm.

Lower the heat to medium and add the butter to the pan.  Let the butter melt and cook until it just begins to brown.  Add the capers and wine; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes until almost dry.  Add the lemon juice and parsley; season with salt and pepper.  Pour the caper brown butter sauce over the crabs and serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LEMON-PEPPER MAYONNAISE ===
  2              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  freshly-cracked black pepper
  1                     handful fresh flat-leaf parsley -- finely chopped
                        === SOFT-SHELL CRABS ===
  2               cups  buttermilk
  1         tablespoon  crab boil seasoning
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             medium  soft-shell crabs -- cleaned, rinsed
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
                        === SANDWICH ===
  4                     soft bread rolls -- split, and
                        lightly toasted
                        = (such as brioche or croissants)
  4                     red leaf lettuce leaves
  1                     vine-ripe tomato -- sliced
  8             slices  hickory-smoked pepper bacon -- cooked
  1                     avocado -- halved, pitted,
                        peeled, and sliced

To make the Lemon-pepper Mayonnaise:  In a food processor, combine the egg yolks, salt, mustard, and lemon juice; process together to form a stable base.  With the motor running, add a few drops of the oil, the mixture will begin to thicken.  Then, begin adding the remaining oil in a thin, steady stream.  Scrape down the sides of the processor and pour the mayonnaise into a small bowl.  Mix in the black pepper and parsley, cover, and refrigerate; may be kept for up to 3 days.

To prepare the Soft-Shell Crabs:  Pour the buttermilk in a shallow bowl large enough to hold all the crabs.  Season the buttermilk with crab boil seasoning, salt, and pepper.  Lay the crabs in the buttermilk mixture and marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for 1 hour; soaking the crabs in buttermilk helps plump them up when cooked.  Remove the crabs from the milk bath and let the excess drip off.

Pour 2 inches of oil in a heavy frying pan or large pot and heat to 350 degrees.

Put the flour in a pie dish or plate and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper.  Dredge the crabs in the seasoned flour to coat, shaking off the excess.  Lay the crabs in the hot oil in a single layer without crowding; you may have to fry them in batches.  Be careful, the crabs have a tendency to pop and spatter.  Cook the crabs for about 3 minutes on each side, turning once, until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels.

To build the Sandwich:  Spread the lemon pepper mayonnaise on both halves of the toasted bread, add the lettuce, tomato, bacon, and avocado.  Lay a fried soft-shell crab on top and close up the sandwich.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GREEN GODDESS DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  2                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
  3                     anchovy fillets
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SOFT-SHELL CRABS ===
  2               cups  buttermilk
  1         tablespoon  crab boil seasoning
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             medium  soft-shell crabs -- cleaned, rinsed
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
                        === SALAD ===
  2            bunches  watercress -- trimmed
  1               head  bibb lettuce -- trimmed, hand torn
     1/2                red onion -- sliced
  1                     hard-boiled egg
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

To make the Green Goddess Dressing:  Simply puree the ingredients together in a blender, until light green and creamy.  Cover and stick the dressing in the fridge to allow the flavors to come together.

To prepare the Soft-Shell Crabs:  Pour the buttermilk in a shallow bowl large enough to hold all the crabs.  Season the buttermilk with crab boil seasoning, salt, and pepper.  Lay the crabs in the buttermilk mixture and marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for 1 hour; soaking the crabs in buttermilk helps plump them up when cooked.  Remove the crabs from the milk bath and let the excess drip off.

Pour 2 inches of oil in a heavy frying pan or large pot and heat to 350 degrees.

Put the flour in a pie dish or plate and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper.  Dredge the crabs in the seasoned flour to coat, shaking off the excess.  Lay the crabs in the hot oil in a single layer without crowding; you may have to fry them in batches.  Be careful, the crabs have a tendency to pop and spatter.  Cook the crabs for about 3 minutes on each side, turning once, until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels.

To assemble the Salad:  Combine the watercress, lettuce, and onion slices in a mixing bowl.  Pour in 1/2 cup of the green goddess dressing, tossing to coat.  Arrange the salad on a serving platter, put the fried crabs on top, and grate the hard boiled egg over the whole thing.  Garnish with lemon wedges and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                         Spaghetti Alla Carbonara

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dry spaghetti
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             ounces  pancetta or slab bacon -- cubed, or
                        sliced into small strips
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus
                        more for serving
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     handful fresh flat-leaf parsley -- chopped

Prepare the sauce while the pasta is cooking to ensure that the spaghetti will be hot and ready when the sauce is finished; it is very important that the pasta is hot when adding the egg mixture, so that the heat of the pasta cooks the raw eggs in the sauce.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender yet firm (as they say in Italian "al dente.")  Drain the pasta well, reserving 1/2 cup of the starchy cooking water to use in the sauce if you wish.

Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a deep skillet over medium flame.  Add the pancetta and saute for about 3 minutes, until the bacon is crisp and the fat is rendered.  Toss the garlic into the fat and saute for less than 1 minute to soften.

Add the hot, drained spaghetti to the pan and toss for 2 minutes to coat the strands in the bacon fat.  Beat the eggs and Parmesan together in a mixing bowl, stirring well to prevent lumps.  Remove the pan from the heat and pour the egg/cheese mixture into the pasta, whisking quickly until the eggs thicken, but do not scramble (this is done off the heat to ensure this does not happen.)

Thin out the sauce with a bit of the reserved pasta water, until it reaches desired consistency.  Season the carbonara with several turns of freshly ground black pepper and taste for salt.  Mound the spaghetti carbonara into warm serving bowls and garnish with chopped parsley.  Pass more cheese around the table.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                   Spiced Mixed Grill With Grilled Lime

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
  1           teaspoon  cumin seed
  1           teaspoon  fennel seed
  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  cayenne
  1         tablespoon  sea salt
  8                     small whole calamari tubes -- cleaned, and
                        tentacles removed
  4                     lobster tails -- cracked in half
  8                     prawns, heads and shells on -- cut down the back
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
  2            bunches  green onions
  4                     limes -- halved

Put the curry, cumin, fennel, peppercorns, cayenne, and salt in a spice mill or clean coffee grinder.  Grind to a fine powder and set aside.

Rinse the calamari tubes under cool water and pat dry.  Split the bodies from top to bottom so you have 2 triangular pieces from each.  Put the calamari, lobster, and prawns on a platter and drizzle with a nice dose of olive oil so the seafood is well coated; season with a fair amount of salt and pepper.

Place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill and get it very hot.  Take a few paper towels and fold them several times to make a thick square.  Blot a small amount of oil on the paper towel then carefully and quickly wipe the ridges of the grill pan or the hot grates of the grill.

Place the lobster on the grill, shell-side up, and cook for 5 minutes until the shell begins to turn reddish-orange.  Turn the lobster tails over and lay the calamari, prawns, green onions, and limes (cut-side down) on the grill too until everything is slightly charred.  Grill the calamari for 2 minutes per side, and no longer, otherwise they will get rubbery.

Put the grilled mixed seafood and green onions on a large platter and sprinkle a little of the spice mix all over.  Squeeze the grilled limes over the shellfish and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                             Steak Au Poivre

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  beef tenderloin
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     handful fresh thyme sprigs
  1                     handful fresh rosemary sprigs
  2                     shallots -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  Cognac or brandy
     1/2           cup  demi-glace or dark stock
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  jarred green peppercorns -- drained
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1              bunch  watercress -- stems trimmed
                        Pommes Frites With Parsley Butter -- (see recipe)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Pat the tenderloin dry with paper towels and sprinkle all sides with a generous amount of salt and pepper -- you should see the seasoning on the meat.

Place a large skillet or roasting pan over medium-high flame, drizzle with the oil, and just when it begins to smoke lay the tenderloin in the hot pan.  Brown on all sides until a crust forms and the meat is well-seared, about 7 minutes total.

Toss the fresh thyme and rosemary on top of the tenderloin and transfer the whole thing to the oven; roast for 20 to 25 minutes for medium-rare.

Remove the tenderloin to a cutting board to rest for 10 minutes before carving.  Pour off the excess fat from the pan and put it back on the stove over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots to the pan drippings, saute, stirring with a spoon to scrape up the flavors in the bottom.

Take the pan off the heat and pour in the cognac (premeasure - never pour directly from the bottle!)  Put the pan back on the heat and tilt it slightly over the burner to ignite the alcohol, or light with a kitchen lighter.  The cognac will flame for a few seconds then go out as the alcohol burns off.  Stir in the demi-glace and cream, simmer for about 1 minute to thicken the sauce so it coats a spoon.  Finish the sauce by stirring in the mustard and peppercorns until incorporated.  Taste and season with salt, if necessary.

To serve:  Pile the watercress on a serving platter, cut the tenderloin into 1/2-inch thick slices and arrange it on top of the greens.  Drizzle the sauce over the beef and garnish with chopped parsley.  Serve the steak au poivre with Pommes Frites with Parsley Butter.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  egg whites
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  boneless beef top round -- sliced paper-thin
                        against the grain
  8                     fresh chives -- minced
     1/2           cup  peanut oil
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 1") -- peeled, minced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     green onions, white and green parts -- chopped
  1                     dried red chile
     3/4         pound  green beans -- halved on the bias
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3        tablespoons  creamy peanut butter
  2                     strips orange peel
     1/4           cup  roasted peanuts -- chopped

In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg whites, sesame oil, and 1 tablespoon of the cornstarch until foamy; season with salt and pepper.  Add the beef and chives, toss to coat in the marinade and stick it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Pour the peanut oil in a large skillet or wok and place over high heat.  When the oil is smoking hot, add 1/2 of the beef.  (If you fry all the meat at once the oil temperature will drop and the beef will stew instead of crisp.)  Fry for 2 minutes then remove to a paper towel to drain; repeat with the remaining beef.  Very carefully drain all but 2 tablespoons of the hot oil into a safe container.

Stir-fry the ginger, garlic, green onions, and chile in the remaining oil until they perfume.  Add the green beans; season with salt and pepper.  Stir-fry the beans for 2 minutes until crisp-tender; remove from the pan.

Mix the chicken broth with the remaining tablespoon of cornstarch to make a slurry and add it to the pan.  Add the soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, peanut butter, and orange peel.  Simmer until the sauce is thick, about 5 minutes.

Return the beef and green beans to the pan, tossing to coat in the sauce.  Garnish with chopped peanuts and serve with rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Very carefully drain all but 2 tablespoons of the hot oil into a safe container.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir-fry the ginger, garlic, green onions, and chile in the remaining oil until they perfume.  Add the green beans; season with salt and pepper.  Stir-fry the beans for 2 minutes until crisp-tender; remove from the pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mix the chicken broth with the remaining tablespoon of cornstarch to make a slurry and add it to the pan.  Add the soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, peanut butter, and orange peel.  Simmer until the sauce is thick, about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the beef and green beans to the pan, tossing to coat in the sauce.  Garnish with chopped peanuts and serve with rice.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  shredded Monterey jack
  4             slices  cooked bacon -- chopped
  1              pound  ground chuck
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              large  hamburger buns -- split
                        === SERVING OPTIONS ===
                        Ketchup
                        Mayonnaise
                        Mustard
                        Lettuce
                        Sliced tomato
                        Sliced onion
                        Sliced avocado

Combine the jack cheese and chopped bacon in a bowl.  Put the beef in another bowl and season with salt and pepper; use a rubber spatula to mix it in.

Flatten 1/4 of the meat mixture in the palm of your hand.  Squeeze together about a tablespoon of the cheese and bacon mixture to make a little nugget; put it in the center of the ground beef.  Bring up the sides of the patty over the filling, making sure the cheese is completely covered by the meat.  Flatten slightly for a nice patty shape.  Set them side by side on a platter in the refrigerator while preparing the grill.

Place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot.  Brush the grates with oil to keep the burgers from sticking.  Grill the burgers for 8 minutes per side for medium.  (The USDA recommends cooking ground beef until it is no longer pink and the internal temperature is 160 degrees.)  Remove the burgers to a clean side plate while you toast the buns.

Rub the grill rack with more oil and place the buns cut-side down, toast for 1 minute.  Serve the burgers with your favorite condiment and any garnish you like, such as lettuce, sliced tomato, onion, and/or avocado.

This recipe yields 4 burgers.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Mushrooms

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  raisins
  8              large  Spanish green olives -- pitted
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
  2                     handfuls fresh flat-leaf parsley
  2                     garlic cloves
  1              pound  Italian sausage -- removed from casing
     3/4           cup  freshly grated pecorino
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
  1                cup  fresh bread crumbs -- dried out
  24             large  white mushrooms -- stems removed

Prepare your wood burning brick oven according to manufacturer's directions or preheat a conventional oven to 400 degrees.

To make the stuffing, put the raisins, olives, pine nuts, parsley, and garlic on a cutting board and chop everything up; put into a mixing bowl.  Add the sausage and 1/2 cup of the cheese.  Drizzle the stuffing with about 1/4 cup of olive oil to moisten and season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes; mix well with your hands to combine.  Put the bread crumbs in another bowl, drizzle with a bit of olive oil and add 1/4 cup of the pecorino; season with salt and pepper.

Oil the bottom and sides of an earthenware or casserole dish, which is large enough to hold all the mushrooms in a single layer.  Arrange the mushrooms snugly in the pan, cap-side down; season the insides with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil.  Stuff each mushroom with a generous spoonful of the sausage stuffing and sprinkle the bread crumbs on top; drizzle with even more oil.  Bake for 20 minutes until the stuffing is browned and the mushrooms soft, rotating the dish periodically for even cooking.

This recipe yields 2 dozen stuffed mushrooms.

  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 1") -- peeled, minced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     fresh red chile -- sliced
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  bulgur wheat (fine-medium grind)
  2               cups  hot water
  1              pound  ripe tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
  1              bunch  green onions, white and green part -- finely chopped
  1                     hothouse cucumber -- halved, seeded,
                        and diced
  2                     large bunche fresh flat-leaf parsley -- leaves finely
                        chopped
  1              bunch  fresh mint leaves -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     lemons -- juiced
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Put the bulgur in a large bowl and pour in the hot water.  Cover with a dish or plastic wrap and let stand for about 30 to 45 minutes to rehydrate.  Drain in a strainer, pressing with the back of a wooden spoon to squeeze out as much water as possible.

In a mixing bowl, combine the tomatoes, onions, cucumber, parsley, and mint.  Toss the salad well to incorporate the ingredients; season with cumin, salt and pepper.

Add the bulgur; moisten with the lemon juice and olive oil.  Fold everything together to incorporate the ingredients.  The flavor will improve if the tabbouleh sits for a few hours.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                            Tacos Carne Asada

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  flank or skirt steak -- excess fat trimmed
  1             recipe  Mojo -- (see recipe)
                        Olive oil -- for coating grill
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  16                    corn tortillas - (7" dia)
                        Shredded romaine or iceberg lettuce -- for serving
                        Chopped white onion -- for serving
                        Shredded Jack cheese -- for serving
     1/2           cup  Pico De Gallo -- (see recipe)
  2                     limes -- cut in wedges for
                        serving

Lay the flank steak in a large baking dish and pour the Mojo over it.  Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 8 hours, so the flavors can sink into the meat.  Don't marinate the steak for more than 8 hours though, or the fibers break down too much and the meat gets mushy.

Preheat an outdoor grill or a ridged grill pan over medium-high flame (you can also use a broiler).  Brush the grates with a little oil to prevent the meat from sticking.  Pull the steak out of the Mojo marinade and season the steak on both sides with salt and pepper.  Grill (or broil) the steak for 7 to 10 minutes per side, turning once, until medium-rare.  Remove the steak to a cutting board and let it rest for 5 minutes to allow the juices to settle.  Thinly slice the steak across the grain on a diagonal.

Warm the tortillas for 30 seconds on each side in a dry skillet or on the grill, until toasty and pliable.

To make the tacos, stack up 2 of the warm tortillas, lay about 4 ounces of beef down the center, and sprinkle with some lettuce, onion, and cheese.  Top each taco with a spoonful of the Pico de Gallo salsa and garnish with lime wedges.  Repeat with the remaining tortillas.

This recipe yields 4 servings (2 tacos per person).

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  dried porcini mushrooms -- wiped of grit
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  pancetta or slab bacon -- finely chopped
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- finely chopped
  2                     carrots -- finely chopped
  5                     garlic cloves -- minced
  4                     fresh thyme sprigs -- leaves stripped
                        from the stem
  2                     fresh oregano sprigs -- leaves stripped
                        from the stem
  1                     fresh rosemary sprig -- needles stripped
                        from the stem
  2                     bay leaves
  1              pound  ground pork
  1              pound  ground beef
  1                cup  milk
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz) -- hand crushed
  2               cups  dry red wine
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  dry tagiatelle pasta
  1                     handful fresh basil -- hand-torn
                        Freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- for serving

Reconstitute the mushrooms in boiling water for 20 minutes until tender, drain and coarsely chop.

In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium flame.  Add the pancetta and saute for 2 minutes to render out the fat.  Add the porcinis, onion, celery, carrots, and garlic; stirring to combine.  Toss in the thyme, oregano, rosemary, and bay leaves.  Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring, until the vegetables are very tender but not browned.

Raise the heat a bit and add the ground pork and beef; brown until the meat is no longer pink, breaking up the clumps with a wooden spoon.  Add the milk and simmer until the liquid is evaporated, about 10 minutes.  Carefully pour in the tomatoes and wine; season with salt and pepper.  Bring the sauce to a boil, then lower the heat and cover.  Slowly simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring now and then, until the sauce is very thick.  Taste again for salt and pepper.

When you are ready to serve, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender yet firm (as they say in Italian "al dente.")  Drain the pasta well and toss with the Bolognese sauce.  Shower with basil and pass grated cheese around the table.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TERIYAKI SAUCE ===
  1                cup  low-sodium soy sauce
  1                cup  grapefruit juice
     1/4           cup  hoisin sauce
     1/4           cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar
  2                     fresh red chiles -- halved
  5                     garlic cloves -- halved
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 2") -- whacked open with
                        the flat side of a knife
                        === CHICKEN WINGS ===
  2              dozen  chicken wings - (abt 3 1/4 lbs) -- rinsed, patted dry
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds -- toasted, for garnish
     1/2         bunch  fresh cilantro -- chopped, for garnish

Prepare the teriyaki sauce by combining the soy sauce, grapefruit juice, hoisin sauce, ketchup, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, chiles, garlic, and ginger in a pot.  Bring to a slow boil and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Season the chicken wings generously with salt and pepper.  Lay the chicken wings in a single layer on a sheet pan.  Bake for 20 minutes or until the skin gets crispy.  With tongs, dip the wings in the teriyaki sauce and return to the oven for 10 to 15 minutes to glaze.

An impressive presentation is to serve these chicken wings family style; arrange them on a large platter, pour the remaining sauce over them and sprinkle with sesame seeds and cilantro.  Don't forget the wet naps!

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

               Vanilla Bean Ice Cream Base With Variations

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VANILLA ICE CREAM ===
  10              cups  heavy cream
  5               cups  whole milk
  1              pinch  salt
  3               cups  sugar
  3                     vanilla beans
  24             large  egg yolks
                        == CHOCOLATE-CHOCOLATE CHUNK ICE CREAM ==
     3/4           cup  whole milk
  16            ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped in chunks
                        === STRAWBERRY CHEESE CAKE ICE CREAM ===
  1 1/2           cups  no sugar added strawberry preserves
     1/2                frozen strawberry cheesecake -- cut large chunks
  10             large  fresh strawberries -- halved
                        == PEANUT BUTTER COOKIE DOUGH ICE CREAM ==
  1                     tube ready to bake peanut butter cookie do -- cut large pieces

To make the Vanilla Ice Cream:  Combine the cream, milk, salt, and 2 cups of the sugar in a large pot.  Split the vanilla beans down the middle lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with a paring knife; add them to the pot and toss in the pods for added flavor.

Place the cream mixture over medium heat, and bring up to a simmer; stirring with a wooden spoon to dissolve the sugar.  Ideally, the temperature should reach 175 degrees (just below scalding) for a smooth-textured ice cream; this should take about 15 minutes.  Shut off the heat, cover the pot, and allow the cream mixture to steep for 15 minutes to further infuse the vanilla flavor.

In the meantime, combine the egg yolks in a large mixing bowl and blend them lightly with a wire whisk.  Gradually add the remaining 1 cup of sugar and continue to whisk until the sugar is completely dissolved and the eggs are thick and pale yellow; about 6 minutes.

Using a large ladle or measuring cup, temper the eggs by gradually whisking in about 4 cups of the hot cream mixture.  Return this back to the rest of the cream in the saucepan and turn the heat to medium-low.  Stir constantly until the custard thickens and leaves a path on the back of a spoon when you run your finger across it, about 10 to 12 minutes (do not let boil.)

Pour the vanilla custard through a fine strainer into another pot* and chill completely in a sink full of ice, stirring here and there; this should take about 1 hour.  Ideally, let the ice cream base "age" overnight in the refrigerator before churning in an ice cream maker to improve the flavor and texture of the final product -- but it is still good if you decide to process it right away.  Divide the ice cream into quarts** and churn each in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions.  When done, the ice cream will be the consistency of "soft serve."  ***To harden the ice cream fully, freeze in plastic covered containers.

Flavor Variations:

* To make the Chocolate-Chocolate Chunk Ice Cream:  Heat 3/4 up of milk in a pot over medium-low heat.  Add 12 ounces of the chopped chocolate and stir until completely melted.  Pour 1 quart of the strained hot vanilla ice cream base into the melted chocolate and stir until very well incorporated.  Chill and process as directed in the master recipe.  Fold in the remaining 4 ounces of chopped chocolate after churning while the ice cream is in the "soft-serve" stage.  Churn another 1 to 2 minutes just until combined.

** To make the Strawberry Cheesecake Ice Cream:  Mix the strawberry preserves into the vanilla custard just before you start churning in the ice cream maker.  Add the pieces of strawberry cheesecake and fresh strawberries after churning while the ice cream is in the "soft-serve" stage.  Continue to churn for an additional 5 minutes or until combined but still chunky.

*** To make the Peanut Butter Cookie Dough Ice Cream:  Add the pieces of cookie dough after churning while the ice cream is in the "soft-serve" stage.  Continue to churn for an additional 1 to 2 minutes until combined but still chunky.

This recipe yields 1 gallon total.
