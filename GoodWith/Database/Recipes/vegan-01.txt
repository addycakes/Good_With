Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  sugar pumpkin - (abt 2 lbs)
                        = (or 1 large butternut or carnival
                        squash)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2        medium  green or red bell pepper -- cut into short,
                        narrow strips
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 to 16 oz) -- with liquid
  2               cups  cooked or canned pinto beans
  2               cups  corn kernels
                        = (from 2 large or 3 medium ears)
  1                cup  homemade or canned vegetable stock
                        = (or water)
  1              small  fresh hot chile - (to 2) -- seeded, minced
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro - (to 4)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cut the pumpkin in half lengthwise and remove the seeds and fibers.  Cover with aluminum foil and place the halves, cut-side up, in a foil-lined shallow baking pan.  Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until easily pierced with a knife but still firm (if using squash, prepare the same way).  When cool enough to handle, scoop out the pulp, and cut into large dice.  Set aside until needed.

Heat the oil in a soup pot.  Add the onion and sautÈ over medium-low heat until translucent.  Add the garlic and continue to sautÈ until the onion is golden.

Add the pumpkin and all the remaining ingredients except the last 2 and bring to a simmer.  Simmer gently, covered, until all the vegetables are tender, about 20 to 25 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

If time allows, let the stew stand for 1 to 2 hours before serving, then heat through as needed.  Just before serving, stir in the cilantro.  The stew should be thick and very moist but not soupy; add additional stock or water if needed.  Serve in shallow bowls.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Description:
  "In Native American mythology, squash, corn, and beans are known as of the "three sisters."  These are the very crops, along with garden vegetables, that the harvest festival of Thanksgiving is meant to celebrate!"

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  baked tofu - (12 oz)
     1/2           cup  soy mayonnaise
                        = (or reduced-fat mayonnaise)
  1              large  celery stalk -- finely diced
  1                     scallion -- minced, (optional)

Using your hands, crumble the tofu finely in a serving bowl.  Add the remaining ingredients, mix well, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  I like to serve this to lunchtime company, and make it often for school and at-home lunches.  Even tofu skeptics love it!  This is especially good served in warm pita bread.  I also like to mix leftovers with macaroni for a "tofuna"-noodle salad.  For this recipe, its best to use a baked tofu product that comes in large chunks like Soy Boy's Tofu Lin, rather than the type that comes in small cutlets.

  1                cup  green beans in 1" lengths - (to 1 1/2)
                        = (or thawed frozen green beans)
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh seitan -- cut bite size
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat half of the oil in a large soup pot.  Add the onion and garlic and sautÈ over medium-low heat until the onion is golden.  Add the potatoes, carrots, water, bouillon cube, and seasoning mix.  Bring to a simmer, then simmer gently, covered, for 10 minutes.

Add the green beans and continue to simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes more, or until the vegetables are tender.  If the potato has not begun to break up on its own, use the back of a wooden spoon to mash enough of the potatoes to thicken the base of the stew.

Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a wide skillet.  Add the seitan pieces and sautÈ over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until most sides are nicely browned and crisp.  Add the sauteed seitan to the stew.  Add a bit more water if necessary.  The consistency should be thick and moist, but not soupy.  Season to taste with salt and pepper (use salt sparingly, if at all, since the bouillon cube and seitan add a salty flavor).  Serve in shallow bowls.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This delicious vegetarian version of a classic heartland dish calls for seitan, a product made of high-protein wheat gluten.  It's available ready made in natural food stores, or make it yourself with Arrowhead Mills' Seitan Quick Mix.

  4                     average slices whole-grain bread
  1 1/2    tablespoons  light olive oil
  1                cup  chopped onion
  1                cup  chopped celery

Combine the onion and celery mixture with the mashed potatoes in the large mixing bowl.  Stir in the soaked bread, parsley, and seasoning mix.  Season to taste with salt and lots of pepper.

Pour the mixture into a well-oiled, 2-quart baking dish.  Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the top is a crusty golden brown.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  butternut squash
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              large  red onion -- chopped
  4               cups  diced peeled Macintosh apple
  1                     vegetable bouillon cube
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  2               cups  low-fat milk, soymilk, or rice milk -- or as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Halve the squash lengthwise with a sharp knife and scoop out the seeds and fibers.  Place cut-side up in a shallow baking dish and cover tightly with foil.  Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until tender.  Set aside until cool enough to handle.

Heat the oil in a soup pot.  Add the onion and sautÈ over medium-low heat until golden, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the apple dice, 4 cups water, bouillon cube, and spices.  Bring to a simmer, then simmer gently, covered, until the apples are soft, about 10 minutes.

In a food processor, puree the squash with 1/2 cup of the milk, until completely smooth.  Transfer to a bowl.

Transfer the apple-onion mixture to the food processor and puree until completely smooth.  Transfer both this and the squash puree back into the soup pot and stir together.  Add the remaining milk or soy milk, using a bit more if the puree is too thick.

Bring the soup to a simmer once again, then cook over low heat for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until well heated through.  Season to taste with salt and white pepper.  Serve at once, or let the soup stand off the heat for an hour or two, then heat through as needed before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Description:
  "Everything about this soup says "fall harvest," from its warm golden color to its slightly sweet, fresh flavor.  Once you've got the squash baked, it cooks fairly quickly."

                        hot water)
  2                     garlic cloves -- very finely minced

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Combine the rice with the stock, one additional cup of water, and the garlic in a two-quart casserole dish.  Cover and bake for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes.  At the third stirring, stir in one more cup of water.  When done, the rice should have a tender and creamy texture.

Let the risotto stand for 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Variations:  Here are some wonderful ways to dress up individual portions of risotto.  Normally, additions are stirred into the risotto, but you can also use them as toppings.  This way, kids are more likely to enjoy the risotto, while allowing adults and older kids to savor more complex flavors.  Reserve a portion of whatever vegetable you are planning to add, to serve on the side for the childrenís portions:

   ï  Wilted spinach or Swiss chard and corn kernels or goat cheese 
   ï  SautÈed zucchini, red pepper, and herbs 
   ï  Finely diced baked winter squash, sautÈed red onion, and toasted walnuts 
   ï  SautÈed leeks and chopped imported black olives 
   ï  Roasted eggplant and Italian-style stewed tomatoes 
   ï  Steamed asparagus and wilted spinach 
   ï  Grated fresh Parmesan or Parmesan-style soy cheese 
   ï  Grated mozzarella or mozzarella-style nondairy cheese

Comments:  Traditionally, it's made by cooking the rice on the stovetop, ladling in hot broth and stirring almost constantly.  An easier route to this wonderful dish is simply combine the basic ingredients in a deep casserole dish and bake, giving it a good stir every 15 minutes until done (the entire process takes an hour).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  red-skinned potatoes -- scrubbed, and
                        microwaved until done but still firm
  1                tub  extra-firm tofu - (16 oz) -- well-drained, and
                        blotted and cut into 3/4" chunks
     2/3           cup  natural barbecue sauce -- or as needed

Preheat the oven's broiler.  When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them into 1-inch chunks.  Starting with potato, alternate the potato and tofu chunks on metal skewers.  There should be enough for 8 average-length skewers.  Place on a foil-lined baking sheet and brush the kebabs generously with barbecue sauce.

Broil for 5 minutes, then turn to the other side very carefully, wearing a long oven mitt.  Broil for another 5 minutes.  If desired, turn once again and broil for another 5 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     3/4           cup  pearl barley
  3               cups  cooked fresh corn kernels
                        = (scraped from about 3 large ears)
     1/2           cup  fresh green peas -- lightly steamed
                        = (or 1/2 cup frozen petit peas, thawed)
  1              large  celery stalk -- diced
  4                     plum tomatoes -- diced
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh dill - (to 4)
  2                     scallions -- sliced
                        Juice of 1/2 to 1 lemon -- to taste

Line each individual serving plate with a few lettuce leaves, then distribute the salad over them.  If desired, sprinkle a small amount of feta cheese over the top.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  water
  1                cup  tomato juice
  1 1/2           cups  brown rice
  1         tablespoon  light olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  baking potatoes
     1/4           cup  low-fat organic milk, soy milk, or
                        rice milk
  2               cups  finely-chopped broccoli florets -- steamed
  1                cup  grated organic cheddar cheese

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bake or microwave the potatoes until done but still firm.  When cool enough to handle, cut each in half lengthwise.  Scoop out the inside of each potato half, leaving a sturdy shell, about 1/4-inch thick all around.

Transfer the scooped-out potato to a mixing bowl and mash it coarsely.  Add the remaining ingredients and stir well to combine.

Stuff the mixture back into the potato shells.  Heat as needed in the microwave or in a preheated 400 degree oven, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  For an easy meal, serve with tossed salad and corn on the cob.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  buckwheat noodles
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
                        = (or vegetable stock)
  1             medium  zucchini -- thinly sliced
  1             medium  yellow summer squash -- thinly sliced
  6             ounces  frozen chopped spinach - (to 8) -- thawed
     1/4           cup  grated organic Parmesan cheese
                        = (or Parmesan-style soy cheese)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring water to a boil in a large pot.  Add the noodles and cook at a steady simmer until al dente, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Drain at once and transfer to a covered serving dish.

In the meantime, heat the oil in a skillet.  Saute the garlic for a minute or two, until golden, then add the wine and squashes.  Cook until the squashes are tender-crisp.  Add the spinach, cover, and cook just until everything is well heated through.

Transfer to the serving bowl and toss with the noodles.  Add the Parmesan cheese, and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Toss again.  Serve at once.

       Butternut Squash With Whole Wheat, Wild Rice, Onion Stuffing

Categories    : Dressing/Stuffing               Side Dish
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  to small butternut squashes - -- (abt 1 lb ea)
     3/4           cup  raw wild rice -- rinsed
  1         tablespoon  light olive oil
  1                cup  chopped red onion - (heaping)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2 1/2           cups  torn whole wheat bread - (firmly packed)
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  dried sage
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  seasoned salt -- or to taste
  1                cup  fresh orange juice

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Halve the squashes and scoop out seeds and fibers.  Place them cut-side up in shallow baking dishes and cover tightly with covers or more foil.  Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until easily pierced with a knife but still firm.

In the meantime, bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan.  Stir in the wild rice, reduce to a simmer, then cover and cook until the water is absorbed, about 40 minutes.

Heat the oil in a skillet.  Add the onion and garlic and sautÈ until golden.

In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked wild rice with the sautÈed onion and the remaining ingredients.  When the squashes are cool enough to handle, scoop out the pulp, leaving firm shells about 1/2-inch thick.  Chop the pulp and stir it into the rice mixture.  Stuff the squashes, place in foil-lined baking dishes, and cover.

Before serving, place the squashes in a preheated 350 degree oven.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or just until well heated through.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Variation:  To add drama to this presentation, try this recipe with other squash varieties.  Hubbard squash, delicata, sweet dumpling and golden nugget are just a few of the stuffable edible squashes available.

Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  brown or brown basmati rice
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- divided
  3                     eggs -- beaten, (optional)
  1                     bag frozen mixed vegetables - (16 oz) -- thawed
  4                     scallions - (to 5) -- thinly sliced
                        Natural soy sauce -- to taste

Combine the rice with 4 cups of water in a large saucepan.  Bring to a simmer, then cover and simmer gently until the water is absorbed, about 35 minutes.

If using eggs, heat half of the oil in a medium-wide skillet.  When hot, add the beaten eggs.  Turn the heat down to medium-low.  Cover, and cook until the eggs are set on top.  Flip and cook briefly on the other side, then slide the egg pancake onto a plate.  When cool enough to handle, cut into strips about 1/2-inch wide by 1 1/2 inches long.

Heat the remaining oil in a wok or stir-fry pan.  Add the mixed vegetables and stir-fry until they are just tender-crisp.  Add the cooked rice and scallions.  Season to taste with soy sauce and stir fry over medium-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes.  Stir in the optional egg strips and serve, passing around extra soy sauce if you'd like.

This recipe yields 6 or more servings.

Comments:  Serve this with some pan-sautÈed tofu on the side, and perhaps some sliced tomatoes and bell peppers.

Combine the rice with 4 cups of water in a large saucepan.  Bring to a simmer, then cover and simmer gently until the water is absorbed, about 35 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If using eggs, heat half of the oil in a medium-wide skillet.  When hot, add the beaten eggs.  Turn the heat down to medium-low.  Cover, and cook until the eggs are set on top.  Flip and cook briefly on the other side, then slide the egg pancake onto a plate.  When cool enough to handle, cut into strips about 1/2-inch wide by 1 1/2 inches long.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the remaining oil in a wok or stir-fry pan.  Add the mixed vegetables and stir-fry until they are just tender-crisp.  Add the cooked rice and scallions.  Season to taste with soy sauce and stir fry over medium-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes.  Stir in the optional egg strips and serve, passing around extra soy sauce if you&apos;d like.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 or more servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  Serve this with some pan-sautÈed tofu on the side, and perhaps some sliced tomatoes and bell peppers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whole-wheat pastry flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
  1                cup  low-fat plain yogurt or soy yogurt
  1                cup  low-fat milk, rice milk, or soymilk -- or as needed
  1                cup  very thinly-sliced peeled apple - -- (heaping)
  2        tablespoons  sliced almonds -- (optional)
                        Cooking oil spray -- as needed
                        = (or nonhydrogenated margarine)
                        Applesauce and/or maple syrup -- for serving
                        Extra cinnamon -- for dusting

Combine the first 3 (dry) ingredients in a mixing bowl.

Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the wet ingredients.  Stir, then whisk together until thoroughly combined, but do not overbeat.  Add more milk if the batter seems too thick.  Stir in the apple slices and optional almonds.

Lightly coat a non-stick griddle with cooking oil spray or nonhydrogened margarine.  Ladle the batter on in scant 1/4 cupfuls.  Cook over medium heat on both sides until golden brown.  These need to brown a bit slower than do most griddlecakes to be cooked all the way through.

Keep the griddlecakes in a covered casserole dish in a 200 degree oven until all are done.  Serve hot with applesauce or maple syrup and a dusting of cinnamon.

This recipe yields about 24 (3- to 4-inch pancakes) 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  light olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  3             medium  celery stalks -- diced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unbleached white flour
  2              large  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        finely diced
  1              large  eggplant - (abt 1 l/2 lbs) -- peeled, diced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley - (to 3)
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh basil
                        = (or 1 tspn dried basil)
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1                cup  low-fat milk, rice milk, or soy milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the oil in a large soup pot.  Add the onion, celery, and garlic and saute over very low heat, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes.  Add a small amount of water if needed to keep the mixture moist.  Sprinkle in the flour and cook, stirring, for another minute or so.

Add the potato and eggplant dice along with enough water to cover all but about an inch of the vegetables, leaving them above the water line.  Bring to a simmer.  At this point you should be able to push all the vegetables below the water.  Add the thyme, stir well, then cover and simmer gently for 35 to 40 minutes.

Stir in the parsley, basil, and milk, using more or less as needed to achieve a slightly thick consistency.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, simmer for another 5 minutes over very low heat, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese -- preferably organic
                        = (or Parmesan-style soy cheese)
  1                cup  fine whole-grain bread crumbs
  1                cup  grated mozzarella cheese -- preferably organic,
                        = (or mozzarella-style soy cheese)

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Wash the eggplants, trim the stems, and slice crosswise into l/4-inch-thick slices.  Line a baking sheet or two, as needed with foil.  Oil lightly and sprinkle with water.  Arrange the eggplant slices on the sheets so that they're slightly overlapping, and cover with foil.  Bake until easily pierced with a fork but not mushy, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and uncover.

Turn the oven down to 350 degrees.

Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan.  Add the onion and sautÈ over moderate heat until golden.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in the tomato puree and herbs, and season with a bit of salt and pepper.

Combine the tofu and Parmesan cheese in the container of a food processor.  Process until completely smooth.

Oil a wide, round or square 2-quart casserole dish.  Layer the casserole as follows: first, half of the bread crumbs, then half of the tomato mixture, then the eggplant slices in one or two overlapping layers, then the remaining tomato mixture, then the remaining crumbs.  Finally, spread the "custard" over the top, evenly and gently, using a cake spatula, and finish with the grated cheese.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the top is touched with light-brown spots.  Let stand 10 minutes, then cut into wedges or squares to serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Description:
  "Moussaka, a hearty, layered Greek casserole, is often quite rich and complicated.  This version is neither.  The usual eggy custard topping is replaced with a deceivingly rich-tasting topping of silken tofu."

  1                     container part-skim ricotta cheese - (15 o -- preferably organic
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese -- preferably organic

                        = (homemade or purchased)

Preheat your oven's broiler.

Combine the ricotta and half of the parmesan cheese in a mixing bowl, mix well, and set aside.

Peel each eggplant and slice crosswise into 8 slices.  Broil several slices at a time, brushed with a little oil in the broiler of your oven, until both sides are lightly browned and tender but firm.

Turn the oven down to 350 degrees.

Oil one or two shallow baking dishes, as needed, and pour in just enough pasta sauce to coat the bottom.  Make "sandwiches" by spreading the ricotta mixture on one eggplant slice and covering it with another slice of the same size.  Arrange in the baking dishes, top with more sauce, and sprinkle with the remaining parmesan cheese.

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes.  Serve at once.

  2              large  pita breads
  4                     ripe flavorful plum tomatoes
                        = (or 3 medium tomatoes)
  1             medium  cucumber -- peeled, quartered
                        lengthwise, and sliced
  3                     scallions - (to 4) -- minced
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh parsley
     1/4           cup  olive oil

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Toast the pita breads in a 375 degree oven or toaster oven until golden and just beginning to become crisp, about 8 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, tear into bite-sized pieces or cut into 1-inch squares with kitchen shears or a sharp knife.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  fettuccine - (12 oz) -- see * Note
  2        tablespoons  non-hydrogenated margarine
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1                tub  silken tofu - (16 oz)
     1/2           cup  low-fat milk, rice milk, or soymilk
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === TOPPING ===
                        Grated fresh Parmesan cheese -- preferably organic
                        = (or Parmesan-style soy cheese)

* Note:  A combination of green and white fettuccine makes this a very attractive dish.

Bring water to a boil in a large pot.  Cook the noodles in rapidly simmering water until al dente, about 10 to 12 minutes, then drain.

In the meantime, heat the margarine a small skillet.  Add the crushed garlic cloves and sautÈ over medium-low heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they are golden.  Remove from the heat and discard the garlic cloves.

Combine the tofu and milk in a food processor and pour in the melted margarine from the skillet.  Process until completely smooth and creamy.  Combine the hot, drained noodles and the sauce in a large serving bowl and toss together.  Season to taste with freshly ground pepper and toss again.  Serve at once.  Pass around Parmesan cheese to whoever wants some.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Pureed silken tofu has an ultra-creamy, custardy texture that is perfect for sauces such as this, or as a base for dips and salad dressings.  Look for it in the produce section of any supermarket.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped ripe tomatoes
                        = (or 1 cup canned diced tomatoes)
  2              large  scallions -- chopped
  4               cups  cooked pinto beans
     1/2           cup  beer
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, minced
                        = (or 4-oz can chopped mild green chilies)
                        Salt -- to taste

Heat the oil in a large skillet.  Add the tomatoes and scallions and sautÈ over medium-low heat for 2 minutes.  Add the remaining ingredients and stir together, then simmer, covered, over low heat for 30 minutes.  If there's too much liquid in the skillet at this time, cook, uncovered, until it thickens up a bit.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 or more servings.

Description:
  "The word borracho was a 19th century term for a drunkard, so this recipe's name literally means "drunken pinto beans."  Simmering the pintos in beer, with lots of cilantro, results in a very special flavor."

<Desc>
The word borracho was a 19th century term for a drunkard, so this recipe&apos;s name literally means &quot;drunken pinto beans.&quot;  Simmering the pintos in beer, with lots of cilantro, results in a very special flavor.

             Greek Stewed Potatoes, Green Beans, And Zucchini

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2              large  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" chunks
  2             medium  zucchinis -- sliced lengthwise,
                        then into 1/2"-thick chunks
  1                     bag frozen green beans - (16 oz) -- thawed
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (28 oz) -- with liquid
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh parsley
                        = (or a combination of parsley and
                        chopped fresh dill)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8             ounces  feta cheese -- preferably organic

Heat the oil in a large soup pot or steep-sided stir-fry pan.  Add the onion and sautÈ until it is golden.

Add the potatoes and 1/2 cup of water.  Bring to a simmer, then cook, covered, over medium heat until the potato chunks are about half-done.

Add the zucchini, green beans, tomatoes, and oregano.  Simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are just tender.

Stir in the parsley or parsley/dill combination, then season to taste with salt and pepper.

Ladle the stew into shallow bowls.  Cut the feta cheese into chunks and let everyone crumble some over the top.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This simple, flavorful stew is traditionally eaten with chunks of feta cheese and some crusty bread.  To make the dish easy and foolproof, the recipe calls for frozen green beans.  Temperamental fresh green beans can make or break a dish, and require some time for trimming; however, if you have a good, tender batch, by all means use them.  A fresh, crusty bread is a must with this.  To round out the meal, serve a big green salad with some chickpeas tossed in, and a good wine.

                         Greens With Pinto Beans

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  spinach or Swiss chard
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves - (to 3) -- minced
  3                     scallions, white and green parts -- finely chopped
  1                cup  cooked pinto beans
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Stem and wash the greens.  If you're using chard, make sure to trim the thicker mid-ribs as well.  Steam the greens in a tightly covered pot until wilted.  The spinach will be done as soon as it wilts, but the chard needs to steam longer.  It will be done when it turns a dark green.  Drain the greens and finely chop them.

Heat the oil in a large skillet.  Add the garlic and sautÈ over low heat until it just begins to turn golden.  Add the scallions and sautÈ just until they soften a bit.  Stir in the greens, beans and seasonings.  Cook, covered, over low heat for 5 minutes, or just until everything is well heated through.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Try this side with tortilla dishes that don't themselves contain beans, or with a big taco salad.

Description:
  "Originally, this Southwestern dish was made by the Pueblo Indians with wild greens.  More contemporary recipes call for spinach or chard instead."

Stem and wash the greens.  If you&apos;re using chard, make sure to trim the thicker mid-ribs as well.  Steam the greens in a tightly covered pot until wilted.  The spinach will be done as soon as it wilts, but the chard needs to steam longer.  It will be done when it turns a dark green.  Drain the greens and finely chop them.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the oil in a large skillet.  Add the garlic and sautÈ over low heat until it just begins to turn golden.  Add the scallions and sautÈ just until they soften a bit.  Stir in the greens, beans and seasonings.  Cook, covered, over low heat for 5 minutes, or just until everything is well heated through.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Try this side with tortilla dishes that don&apos;t themselves contain beans, or with a big taco salad.

<Desc>
Originally, this Southwestern dish was made by the Pueblo Indians with wild greens.  More contemporary recipes call for spinach or chard instead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  eggplant - (abt 1 lb)
  2             medium  onions
  1             medium  zucchini or 2 small zucchinis - -- (abt 1/2 lb total)
  1              large  green or red bell pepper
                        Olive Oil-Lemon Marinade -- (see recipe)
  1              large  ripe tomato -- diced
     1/4           cup  chopped black olives
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4         pound  crumbly goat cheese -- (optional)

Cut the eggplant into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Salt them and place in a colander for 30 minutes, then rinse and drain.

Peel the onions and cut in half.  Steam or microwave until just tender.  Cut the zucchini in half lengthwise.

Prepare grill.  Brush the vegetables lightly with the Olive Oil-Lemon Marinade.  Grill the eggplant on both sides until nicely browned and quite tender, about 15 minutes total.  Grill the onions and zucchini on both sides until marked with brown, and tender, about 10 to 15 minutes total.  Place the bell pepper directly on the grill and turn frequently, allowing all sides to get charred.  Remove and place in a paper bag to steam.

When all the vegetables are cool enough to handle, chop into fairly large chunks and combine in a serving bowl.  Slip the skin off the pepper, then remove the core and seeds.  Cut into small squares.

Stir in the tomato, olives, herbs, olive oil, and vinegar, and toss well.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  If desired, sprinkle the top with crumbled goat cheese.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  1         tablespoon  light olive oil
  1                cup  chopped onions
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cups  chopped ripe juicy tomatoes -- with
     1/4           cup  water
                        = (or 16-oz can diced tomatoes, undrained)
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
  3               cups  cooked brown rice - (abt 1 cup raw)
  1                can  black-eyed peas - (16 oz) -- drained, rinsed
                        = (or 2 cups cooked - abt 2/3 cup raw)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the oil in a very large skillet or a stir-fry pan.  SautÈ the onions over medium heat until translucent.  Add the garlic and continue to sautÈ until the onions are golden.  Stir in the tomatoes, basil, and thyme; cook until the tomatoes have softened a bit, about 5 minutes.

Add the rice and black-eyed peas, and season to taste with salt and lots of pepper.  Stir well, then simmer, covered, over low heat for 15 minutes.  If the mixture seems dry, add a bit of water or cooking liquid from the peas.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  potatoes
  2              large  leeks - (or 3 medium)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- finely diced
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Microwave the potatoes in their skins until they are easily pierced with a knife but still firm.  Set aside until cool enough to handle, then peel and slice them about 1/2-inch thick.

Trim the tough green leaves and bottoms from the leeks and discard.  Slice the leeks in half lengthwise, then into 1/4-inch slices crosswise.  Place in a colander and rinse well.

Heat the half of the oil in an extra-wide skillet.  Add the leeks and sautÈ over medium-low heat, covered, until limp, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Stir occasionally.  Add the red peppers and continue to sautÈ, covered, stirring occasionally, until the leeks are soft, about 5 to 8 minutes more.

Add the remaining oil, the potatoes, and the optional parsley.  Raise the heat to medium-high and cook until the potatoes on the bottom are browned.  Stir well, and let the bottom brown several times more, until most of the mixture is nicely browned.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Description:
  "If you like leeks, you're sure to enjoy this dressed-up version of hash browns.  Use firm-textured potatoes, such as red-skinned or Yukon Gold, rather than mealy ones, for best results."

                   Middle Eastern Cucumber-Yogurt Soup

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  cucumbers -- peeled, seeded
  1               pint  plain low-fat yogurt or soy yogurt - -- (2 cups)
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped mixed fresh herbs -- or more to taste
                        = (such as dill, parsley, and mint)
  1 1/2           cups  low-fat milk, rice milk, or soymilk -- or as needed
  1           teaspoon  natural granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon -- (optional)

Grate the cucumbers on a coarse grater, then place them in a colander.  Place the colander over the container in which you will serve the soup.  Salt the grated cucumbers lightly and let stand for 30 minutes (the juice from the cucumbers will drain into the container and the cucumbers themselves will become pleasantly crisp).

Place the cucumbers in the container with the cucumber juice.  Stir in the yogurt, herbs, and enough milk to give a slightly thick consistency.  Stir in the sugar and seasonings, then add the optional lemon juice if you'd like an extra tangy flavor.  Serve at once or refrigerate until needed.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Variation:  For a heartier version of this soup, add a cup or so of cold, cooked barley.

Description:
  "Here's an exceptionally easy no-cook soup from the Middle East.  Enjoy it with barley added, as suggested in the variation."

Grate the cucumbers on a coarse grater, then place them in a colander.  Place the colander over the container in which you will serve the soup.  Salt the grated cucumbers lightly and let stand for 30 minutes (the juice from the cucumbers will drain into the container and the cucumbers themselves will become pleasantly crisp).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the cucumbers in the container with the cucumber juice.  Stir in the yogurt, herbs, and enough milk to give a slightly thick consistency.  Stir in the sugar and seasonings, then add the optional lemon juice if you&apos;d like an extra tangy flavor.  Serve at once or refrigerate until needed.

Variation:  For a heartier version of this soup, add a cup or so of cold, cooked barley.

<Desc>
Here&apos;s an exceptionally easy no-cook soup from the Middle East.  Enjoy it with barley added, as suggested in the variation.

  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1              small  onion -- minced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  8                     dried shiitake or maitake mushrooms - -- (to 10)
  1         tablespoon  natural soy sauce - (to 2) -- or to taste
  3               cups  sliced fresh mixed mushrooms - (to 4)
                        = (use 2 or 3 kinds from among baby
                        bella, oyster, fresh shiitake, or enoki)
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  5             stalks  bok choy, greens included - (to 6) -- thinly sliced
  3                     scallions, white and green parts - (to 4) -- sliced

Add the remaining ingredients and simmer for another 5 to 8 minutes, or just until the bok choy is tender-crisp.  Serve at once.

Comments:  Use the broth portion of this recipe as the basis for other Asian-style soups.

  12            ounces  vegan ribbon noodles
                        = (quinoa, spelt, etc.)
  1         tablespoon  light olive oil
  3             medium  celery stalks -- diced
  1                cup  sliced mushrooms
  2               cups  soy or rice milk
     1/4           cup  unbleached white flour
  1            package  baked tofu - (8 oz) -- finely diced
  2                     scallions - (to 3) -- sliced

                        Wheat germ -- for topping

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Bring water to a boil in a large pot.  Add the noodles and cook until just tender, according to package directions.

In the meantime, heat the margarine or oil in a medium-sized saucepan.  Add the celery dice and saute over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and continue to saute until the mushrooms are wilted.

Pour 1 1/2 cups of the soy or rice milk into the saucepan and bring to a simmer.  Combine the remaining milk with the flour in a small bowl and stir until the flour is smoothly dissolved.  Slowly pour into the saucepan, stirring constantly.  Simmer gently until the sauce has thickened, then remove from the heat.

When the noodles are done, drain them, then return them to the pot.  Pour in the sauce, then add the baked tofu and scallions and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer the mixture to an oiled, large shallow casserole dish.  Top generously with wheat germ.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and beginning to get crusty.  Allow to cool for 5 minutes, then cut into squares to serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                        Mushroom-Stuffed Potatoes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  baking potatoes
     1/4           cup  organic dairy, soy, or rice cream cheese
  1         tablespoon  light olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  8             ounces  white or cremini mushrooms -- sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bake or microwave the potatoes until done but still firm.  When cool enough to handle, cut each in half lengthwise.  Scoop out the inside of each potato half, leaving a sturdy shell, about 1/4-inch thick all around.

Transfer the scooped-out potato to a mixing bowl and mash it coarsely.  Stir in the cream cheese.

Heat the oil in a medium skillet.  Add the onion and sautÈ over medium heat until golden.  Add the mushrooms, cover, and cook until they are done to your liking, stirring occasionally.

Combine the mushroom mixture, liquid and all, with the mashed potato in the mixing bowl.  Season with salt and pepper and stir well to combine.

Stuff the mixture back into the potato shells.  Heat as needed in the microwave or in a preheated 400-degree oven, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A small amount of light cream cheese gives these stuffed potatoes a rich flavor.  Serve them with a big tossed salad with chickpeas or black-eyed peas, and some steamed green beans or asparagus.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     vegetable bouillon cube
     1/2           cup  wild rice
     1/2           cup  long-grain brown rice
  2             ounces  dried shiitake, maitake, or
                        porcini mushrooms
  1                cup  sliced crimini or baby bella mushrooms
  1                cup  carrot in 1 1/2"-long matchsticks
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh chives or scallions
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped walnuts
     1/3           cup  natural low-fat vinaigrette
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine 3 1/2 cups water and the bouillon cube in a heavy saucepan and bring to a simmer.  Stir in the wild and brown rice.  Cover and simmer gently until the water is absorbed, about 45 minutes.  Let the rice cool to room temperature.

Meanwhile, soak the mushrooms in hot water for 15 minutes, then drain.  If using shiitakes, trim and discard their tough stems.  Slice the shiitakes or porcinis into narrow strips.

Heat a nonstick skillet.  Combine the fresh mushrooms in the skillet with a little water, then cover and "sweat" them over medium heat until just wilted, about 3 minutes.

Combine the fresh and reconstituted mushrooms in a large mixing bowl with the rice mixture and all the remaining ingredients.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  Swiss chard - (abt 10 to 12 oz)
  10            ounces  penne pasta - (to 12)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  onion -- quartered, and
                        thinly sliced
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4) -- minced
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
                        = (or water)
  1 1/2         pounds  ripe tomatoes - (to 2) -- diced
                        = (substitute one 28-oz can diced
                        tomatoes if good, fresh tomatoes are
                        unavailable)
  1                can  large white cannellini beans - (16 oz) -- drained, rinsed
     1/4           cup  raisins or currants
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === OPTIONAL TOPPING ===
                        Grated fresh Parmesan cheese -- preferably organic
                        = (or Parmesan-style soy cheese)

Remove the stems from the Swiss chard and rinse it well.  Drain lightly and chop the leaves coarsely.  Bring water to a boil in a large pot.  Cook the pasta in rapidly simmering water for 10 to 12 minutes (or according to package directions), until al dente, then drain.

In the meantime, heat the oil in an extra-large saucepan or steep-sided stir-fry pan.  Add the onions and garlic and saute over medium heat until the onion is golden, about 5 minutes.

Add the wine or water and the chard.  Cover and cook just until the chard wilts down, stirring once or twice, about 3 minutes.

Stir in the tomatoes, beans, and raisins or currants.  Cook just until everything is well heated through, another 4 to 5 minutes.

Combine the cooked pasta with the sauce in a large serving bowl.  Toss well, then season to taste with salt and pepper, and toss again.  Serve at once.  Pass around some fresh Grated Parmesan cheese for topping, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  8             ounces  ribbon-style noodles
  2        tablespoons  non-hydrogenated margarine
  1              large  onion -- quartered, and

Comments:  Round out this meal with a 16-ounce bag of pre-shredded cole slaw (dressed with a low-fat sweet/sour dressing such as honey-mustard), some fresh rye bread, and some steamed green beans.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             medium  potatoes -- peeled, diced
  5               cups  vegetable stock or water
  1         tablespoon  light olive or olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves - (to 3) -- crushed or minced
  1              large  green bell pepper -- finely chopped
  1                cup  chopped fresh ripe tomatoes
                        = (substitute canned if good, ripe
                        tomatoes are unavailable)
  1                cup  cooked fresh or thawed frozen corn kernels
  1                can  chopped mild green chilies - (4 oz)
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
  1 1/2           cups  grated organic Monterey Jack cheese
                        = (or Jack-style non-dairy cheese)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the potato dice in a soup pot and cover with the stock or water.  Bring to a simmer, then simmer gently, covered, until the potatoes are just tender, about 15 minutes.

In the meantime, heat the oil in a small skillet.  SautÈ the onion over medium heat until translucent.  Add the garlic and green pepper and sautÈ until the mixture begins to brown lightly.

Remove half of the potatoes from their cooking liquid with a slotted spoon and place them in a shallow bowl.  Mash them well, then stir back into the soup pot, followed by the onion-bell pepper mixture.  Add the tomatoes, corn, green chilies, and chili powder.  Add additional water if the soup is too dense.  Stir together, return to a simmer, then simmer gently for 20 minutes.

Sprinkle in the grated cheese, a little at a time, stirring it until it is fairly well melted each time (soy cheese may not melt as completely).  Season with salt and pepper and simmer over very low heat, stirring frequently, for another 5 minutes.

Serve at once, or let stand for an hour or so before serving.  Heat through as needed and adjust the consistency with more water if the soup becomes too thick.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cans  pinto beans - (16 oz ea) -- drained, rinsed
  1                can  stewed or diced tomatoes - (14 to 16 oz) -- undrained
  2                     scallions -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  fresh cilantro or parsley leaves
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1             medium  green bell pepper -- cut 1" pieces
  4                     ripe plum tomatoes -- cut large chunks
     1/2           cup  pitted black olives
     1/4           cup  chopped mild green chilies -- (optional)
                        = (fresh or canned chilies)
  1 1/2           cups  vegetables stock -- or as needed
                        = (or water)

Combine the beans, canned tomatoes, scallions, and cilantro or parsley in a food processor or blender and process until well pureed.  Transfer to a large serving container and stir in the lemon juice, chili powder, and cumin.

Place the green pepper and fresh tomatoes in the food processor and pulse on and off 2 or 3 times.  Add the olives and pulse on and off quickly, 2 or 3 times more, or until the vegetables are finely chopped (approximately 1/4-inch pieces).

Stir into the bean puree, then add the chilies if desired.  Stir in enough stock or water to achieve a medium-thick consistency.  Serve at once or cover and refrigerate until needed.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Variation:  Garnish each serving with diced avocado and extra scallions.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  vegetable stock
                        = (or water with 1 vegetable
                        bouillon cube)
  1 1/2           cups  raw quinoa
  3                     scallions -- white and green
                        parts - (to 4), thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  salt-free all-purpose seasoning mix
  1 1/2           cups  frozen green peas -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  nonhydrogenated margarine
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/3           cup  slivered or sliced almonds

Bring the water or stock to a simmer in a large, heavy saucepan.  Rinse the quinoa well in a fine sieve.  Stir the quinoa into the boiling water along with the scallions and seasoning blend.  Cover and cook at a gentle but steady simmer until all the water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes.

Stir in the peas and margarine, then season to taste with salt.

Transfer the pilaf to a serving bowl and scatter the almonds over the top.  If time allows, you might like to lightly toast the almonds, either in a dry skillet over medium heat or in a 250 degree toaster oven.  Watch carefully, they toast quickly!

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                              Red Lentil Dal

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  raw red lentils
  1         tablespoon  light olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- minced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              small  hot green chilies - (to 2) -- to taste, minced
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated ginger
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  turmeric
  1              pinch  nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste

Rinse the lentils and combine them with 4 1/2 cups water in a large, heavy saucepan.  Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer until the lentils are quite mushy, about 40 minutes.

Heat the oil and skillet; saute the onion and garlic over medium heat until golden.  Add to the saucepan.  Stir in the remaining ingredients.  Cover and simmer over very low heat for 15 minutes.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This spicy Indian specialty is a cross between a sauce, a soup and a dip.  Serve it as part of an Indian meal, or use chapatis (Indian bread) or wedges of fresh warm pita bread to scoop it up.  For a main dish, serve the dal on top of cooked grains.

                Red Onion And Almond-Stuffed Winter Squash

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              small  winter squashes
                        = (carnival, acorn, golden acorn,
                        delicata, or other)
  1         tablespoon  natural margarine
                        = (or whipped butter)
  1              large  red onion -- chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped toasted almonds
     1/2      teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
                        = (or 1/4 tspn ground ginger)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

The squashes may be baked in the oven or microwave.  If you are going to use the oven, preheat it to 375 degrees.

Cut the squashes in half lengthwise.  Place the halves in a baking dish, cut-side up, with about 1/4 inch of water, and cover.  Bake until easily pierced with a knife but still holding their shape, about 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the type and size of squash used.  Or microwave, using as a rule of thumb about 4 to 7 minutes each for each squash.  Test occasionally to make sure they don't get overcooked.

When the squashes are cool enough to handle, scoop out and discard the seeds.  Scoop out the pulp and transfer to a mixing bowl, leaving a sturdy shell of about 1/4 inch thick all around.

Heat the margarine in a medium skillet.  Add the onion and sautÈ over medium heat until golden.  Add the almonds and continue to sautÈ until they give off a toasty aroma.

Combine the onion mixture with the squash pulp.  Add the ginger, season with salt, and stir together.  Stuff back into the squash shells.  Reheat in the microwave or oven, just until heated through, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bundle rice stick noodles - (8 oz)
  1              ounce  dried shiitake or cloud-ear mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  light olive oil
  1           teaspoon  dark sesame oil
  1             medium  onion -- halved, sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cups  thinly-sliced napa or savoy cabbage - -- (firmly packed)
  1                can  oyster (shimeji) mushrooms - (15 oz)
                        = (or straw mushrooms)
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1 1/2           cups  liquid from canned and dried mushrooms
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch

Bring water to a boil in a medium-sized saucepan.  Immerse the bundle of rice sticks and soak for 20 to 30 minutes, or until they are al dente.  When the noodles are done, drain them, place them on a cutting board, and chop in several places to shorten.

At the same time, combine the dried mushrooms in a heatproof dish with enough boiling water to cover them.  Soak for about 30 minutes, then drain.  Remove tough stems and cut them into thin strips about 2 inches long.  Reserve the liquid.

In the meantime, heat the oils in a stir-fry pan or wok.  Add the onion and stir-fry over medium heat until translucent.  Add the garlic and cabbage and stir-fry over medium-high heat until the cabbage is tender-crisp.  Add the mushrooms and soy sauce and stir-fry for another minute or so.

Use a bit of the mushroom liquid to dissolve the cornstarch.  Pour the remaining liquid into the skillet or wok and stir in the dissolved cornstarch.  Add the cooked rice sticks and toss the mixture together thoroughly but gently.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  1                cup  prepared salsa -- or more to taste

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PATTIES ===
  3               cups  well-cooked beans -- any variety
                        = (from abt 1 1/4 cups raw)
     1/2                green bell pepper -- minced
  2                     scallions -- minced
  2                     organic cage-free eggs -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  wheat germ
  1           teaspoon  Mrs. Dash - (to 2)
                        = (or other salt-free seasoning blend)
                        Light olive oil -- as needed
                        === DRESSING ===
  1                cup  plain low-fat yogurt or soy yogurt
  2         tablespoon  prepared spicy mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  dried dill
  1         tablespoon  tahini -- (optional)

Mash the beans well in a mixing bowl.  Mix thoroughly with remaining patty ingredients, except oil.

Heat just enough oil to coat the bottom of a large, nonstick skillet.  When sizzling hot, use a ladle to drop patty mixture into skillet to form 2 to 3-inch patties.  Cook on both sides over moderate heat until nicely browned.

Combine all the dressing ingredients in a small bowl and stir until completely blended.  Serve with the warm patties, whether alone or in a pita.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Description:
  "A perfect pita-sandwich filler.  You can use almost any type of well-cooked bean for these, but pink, pinto, red, or kidney work best."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sesame oil
  1              large  onion -- halved, sliced
  1              large  carrot -- thinly sliced
  1 1/2           cups  snow peas - (to 2)
  8             ounces  soba (buckwheat noodles)
                        === SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  canned vegetable stock
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce - (to 4) -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  dry sherry
     1/2      teaspoon  grated fresh ginger - (to 1) -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
     1/4           cup  cold water
                        Chopped cashews for topping -- (optional)

Heat the sesame oil in a stir-fry pan or wok.  Stir-fry the onion and carrot over moderately-high heat until tender-crisp.  Add the snow peas and stir-fry just until they have lost their raw quality but are still quite crisp.

Break the noodles in half and cook them al dente.  Watch them carefully, as they cook rather quickly.

Combine all the ingredients for the sauce in a small mixing bowl and stir well to combine.  When the noodles are done, drain them and add them to the stir-fry pan along with the sauce.  Toss together.  Cook just until everything is thoroughly heated through and the sauce has thickened.

Serve at once, topping each serving with chopped cashews, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  1         tablespoon  light olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1              pound  firm tofu -- well drained,
                        blotted, then cut into 1/2" dice
  6                     corn tortillas -- torn or cut into
                        approximately 1" pieces
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (16 oz) -- lightly drained
  1                can  chopped mild green chilies - (4 oz)

                        cheese)

Heat the oil in an extra-wide skillet.  SautÈ the onion over medium heat until lightly golden.

Add the tortillas, tomatoes, chilies, and cumin.  Stir together gently.  Cover and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes.

Comments:   In the original recipe, the tortilla pieces are scrambled with eggs; this version replaces eggs with tofu.

Description:
  "This tasty dish, brimming with lively southwestern flavors, is based on a traditional southwestern egg dish.  It's known as migas, a word that literally means "crumbs" in Spanish, in this case referring to bits of tortilla."

This tasty dish, brimming with lively southwestern flavors, is based on a traditional southwestern egg dish.  It&apos;s known as migas, a word that literally means &quot;crumbs&quot; in Spanish, in this case referring to bits of tortilla.

                    Soy And Honey-Glazed Winter Squash

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  small winter squash - (to 3)
                        = (carnival, golden acorn, delicata, or
                        other)
  2        tablespoons  honey
     1/4           cup  apple juice
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  dark sesame oil

The squashes may be baked in the oven or microwave.  If you are going to use the oven, preheat it to 375 degrees.

Cut the squashes in half lengthwise.  Place the halves cut-side up in a baking dish with about 1/2 inch of water, and cover each half tightly with foil.  Bake until easily pierced with a knife but still firm, about 30 to 45 minutes, depending on the type and size of squash used.  Or microwave, using about 4 to 7 minutes each as a rule of thumb per small squash or 10 minutes for a butternut.  Test occasionally to make sure they don't overcook.

When the squashes are cool enough to handle, scoop out and discard the seeds.  Peel the squashes and cut into 1-inch chunks.

Combine the remaining ingredients in an extra-wide skillet or stir-fry pan and heat gently, stirring together.  Add the squash and turn up the heat to medium-high.  Cook, stirring, until the liquid reduces and the squash is nicely glazed, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2             medium  red bell peppers -- cut 2" strips
  2             medium  green bell pepper -- cut 2" strips
  2             medium  yellow bell pepper -- cut 2" strips
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  sun-dried tomatoes (oil-cured or not) -- cut into strips
  2             medium  firm -- ripe tomatoes
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the oil in a large skillet.  Add the onion and sautÈ over medium heat until it is translucent.

Add the garlic, bell peppers, wine and dried tomatoes.  Stir in 1/4 cup water and bring to a simmer.  Cook, covered, over medium-low heat until the peppers are tender but not overdone, about 8 minutes.

Stir in the tomatoes and continue to cook, uncovered, just until they have lost their raw quality, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the optional parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a great partner for most any sort of pasta dish, hot or cold, or to serve alongside a summertime sandwich.  Use leftovers to fill fajitas.

Description:
  "Summer is the perfect time to make the luscious Spanish classic, piperade, when peppers of all colors are abundant and for a short time, relatively inexpensive."

  2              small  yellow summer squashes
  2               cups  fresh green beans -- cut 1" pieces
  1                can  chick-peas - (16 oz) -- drained, rinsed
  2                     scallions -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley - (to 3)
                        = (or cilantro)
  2        tablespoons  light olive oil
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar - (to 3) -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
                        Dark green lettuce leaves -- for serving

Scrub the squashes, cut them in half lengthwise, and slice them 1/4 inch thick.  Steam them until they are tender-crisp.

At the same time, steam the cut green beans separately until tender-crisp.  Once done, rinse the vegetables immediately under cold water and allow to drain for a few minutes in a colander.

Combine the squash and green beans in a large serving bowl along with all the remaining ingredients except the lettuce.  Toss well, cover, and refrigerate for several hours.  Stir occasionally to distribute the marinade.  Arrange each serving on 2 or 3 lettuce leaves.

This recipe yields 6 or more servings.

Scrub the squashes, cut them in half lengthwise, and slice them 1/4 inch thick.  Steam them until they are tender-crisp.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  baked tofu - (10 oz ea)
  8                     flour tortillas - (6" to 8" dia)
  4                     scallions -- sliced
                        Prepared salsa or picante sauce
                        Plain low-fat yogurt or soy yogurt

Cut the tofu crosswise into narrow strips.  Place in a covered, heatproof dish and warm in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes.  Warm the tortillas briefly in the microwave until they are soft and pliable; place on a serving plate covered by a cloth napkin or foil.

Arrange the scallions, salsa, and yogurt or sour cream in separate bowls on the table and let everyone assemble their own fajitas as follows: place a few strips of the tofu in the center, sprinkle with some scallion, and top with a dollop each of salsa and yogurt.  Roll up and eat!

Comments:  This is an almost-instant meal, highlighting the incredible convenience of baked tofu, a product available in most natural stores.  To complete the meal, serve with quick-cooking brown rice and garnish each plate with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and black olives.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  light olive oil
  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  2             medium  carrots -- peeled, diced
  1              large  celery stalk -- diced
  1                     Handful celery leaves
  6               cups  diced (1/2") peeled sweet potatoes
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1                cup  low-fat milk, rice milk, or soymilk -- or as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the oil in a soup pot.  Add the onion, carrots, and celery and sautÈ over low heat until the onions are golden.  Add the celery leaves and sweet potato dice.  Add just enough water to cover all but about an inch of the vegetables.  Bring to a simmer, then stir in the bay leaves and seasonings.  Simmer gently, covered, until the sweet potatoes and vegetables are quite tender, about 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove the bay leaves.

With a slotted spoon, remove about half of the solid ingredients and transfer to a food processor along with about 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid.  Process until smoothly pureed, then stir back into the soup pot.  Add the milk or soymilk as needed to achieve a slightly thick consistency.  Season with salt and pepper.  Simmer over very low heat for another 10 to 15 minutes.

Serve at once, or let stand off the heat for an hour or two before serving, then heat through as needed.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        Sweet-Glazed Tofu Cutlets

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm or extra-firm tofu
  1         tablespoon  light olive oil
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  honey or maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  dry red wine or sherry
  2                     scallions -- sliced, for garnish

Cut the tofu crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Blot them briefly between paper towels or clean tea towels.

Combine the oils, honey, soy sauce, and wine or sherry in a small bowl, then heat the mixture slowly in a wide skillet.  Arrange the tofu slices in the skillet, then flip them carefully at once so that they will be coated with the sauce on both sides.

Fry the tofu over moderately-high heat until the underside is nicely golden and crisp, then flip again and fry until the other side is crisp.  Remove the tofu cutlets to a serving platter and scatter with scallion slices.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A simple, pleasing way to prepare tofu.  I challenge anyone who thinks tofu is tasteless mush to try this crisp, salty-sweet rendition.  This is great alongside Asian-style rice or noodle dishes.

Cut the tofu crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Blot them briefly between paper towels or clean tea towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the oils, honey, soy sauce, and wine or sherry in a small bowl, then heat the mixture slowly in a wide skillet.  Arrange the tofu slices in the skillet, then flip them carefully at once so that they will be coated with the sauce on both sides.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fry the tofu over moderately-high heat until the underside is nicely golden and crisp, then flip again and fry until the other side is crisp.  Remove the tofu cutlets to a serving platter and scatter with scallion slices.  Serve warm.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A simple, pleasing way to prepare tofu.  I challenge anyone who thinks tofu is tasteless mush to try this crisp, salty-sweet rendition.  This is great alongside Asian-style rice or noodle dishes.

Cook or microwave 4 medium red-skinned potatoes until done but still quite firm.  Allow to cool, then cut into 1-inch chunks.

Cut tofu into 3/4- to l-inch-thick slices and press between paper towels or a clean tea-towel to remove some of the moisture.  After pressing, cut into 3/4- to 1-inch dice.  Marinate in Sweet and Savory Grilling Sauce or Teriyaki Marinade for 30 minutes.

Alternate tofu and potato chunks with red pepper pieces on skewers.

Prepare grill.  Brush the skewered ingredients with additional sauce or marinade used.  Grill, turning carefully, until touched with charred spots, about 10 minutes total.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  medium-firm tofu -- drained
  1              large  celery stalk -- finely diced
  1                     scallion -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  soy mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  Dijon-style mustard - (to 2) -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  good-quality curry powder
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Warmed pita breads or whole-grain bread
                        Dill pickle spears
                        Tomato wedges

Drain the tofu and break it into several pieces.  Place it in a mixing bowl and mash well with a fork until it has the texture of cottage cheese.  Add the diced celery and scallion.

In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, mustard, and curry powder and mix well.  Pour this mixture over the tofu mixture and stir well.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve in warmed pita breads or spread on whole-grain bread with dill pickle spears and tomato wedges alongside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Another useful way to prepare tofu is to mash it.  This way, it can be used as a substitute for ricotta cheese, for making tofu burgers, or tofu "scramble eggs."  A favorite is this eggless "egg salad."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  good-quality frozen cheese tortellini,
                        vegetable-filled tortellini, or
                        tofu tortellini
  1                cup  frozen green peas -- unthawed
  2               cups  finely-chopped fresh broccoli florets
  1                jar  roasted red peppers - (10 to 12 oz)
                        === DRESSING ===
                        Liquid from the roasted peppers
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        = (preferably extra-virgin)
  2        tablespoons  red-wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Dijon-style mustard
     1/4           cup  grated fresh organic Parmesan cheese
                        = (or Parmesan-style soy cheese)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Begin cooking the tortellini according to package directions.

Layer the frozen peas and the broccoli florets in a large saucepan with l/2 inch of water.  Bring them to a simmer and steam over moderate heat, covered, until the peas are thawed and the broccoli is bright green, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain the peas and broccoli and rinse them under cool water until they are at room temperature.

In the meantime, drain the roasted peppers, reserving the juices in a small mixing bowl.  Cut the peppers into strips.  Combine the liquid from the red peppers with the remaining dressing ingredients and mix.

When the tortellini are done, drain them and rinse under cool water until they are at room temperature.  Combine them in a mixing bowl with the peas, broccoli, red pepper strips, and dressing.  Add the Parmesan cheese and toss well.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss again.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SWEET POTATO SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  light olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cups  diced sweet potato - (to 2 1/2)
  1                cup  low-fat milk, rice milk, or soymilk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === PASTA ===
  1              pound  spinach or tri-color cheese tortellini or
  1              small  cheese ravioli

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  red onion -- quartered, and
                        thinly sliced
  1              large  white or yellow onion -- quartered, and
                        thinly sliced
  1                     good-quality 12" prepared pizza crust
  4             ounces  organic smoked mozzarella - (to 6) -- grated
                        = (or sharp cheddar cheese or soy cheese
                        of choice)

Heat the oil in a large skillet.  Add the onions and sautÈ slowly, covered, until translucent.  Uncover and continue to sautÈ until they are nicely golden (but not browned), stirring often.

Arrange the onions on the pizza crust, then sprinkle the cheese evenly over the onions.

Bake in a preheated 425 degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the cheese in melted.  Cut into wedges and serve at once.

This recipe yields 2 to 3 servings.

Comments:  Serve this with a salad of mixed greens, cannellini (large white beans), and ripe tomatoes.  A good wine adds to the charm of this meal as well.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PESTO SAUCE ===
     3/4         pound  fresh spinach -- washed, stemmed
     1/2           cup  fresh basil - (firmly packed)

  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  8             ounces  udon noodles
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed or minced

Heat the olive oil in a medium-sized skillet.  Add the garlic and frying pepper and sautÈ over low heat until the garlic is golden.  Add the tomatoes, olives, and black pepper and simmer over low heat for 5 minutes.  Stir this mixture into the noodles and serve at once, or let cool and serve at room temperature.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bundle bean-thread noodles - (2 oz)
  2        tablespoons  peanut or light olive oil
  1              large  onion -- quartered, and
                        thinly sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cups  thinly-shredded cabbage - (heaping)
  2               cups  diced fresh tomatoes - (heaping)
     1/2           cup  very fresh mung bean sprouts
     1/2         pound  firm tofu -- diced
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar - (to 3) -- to taste
                        Dried hot red pepper flakes -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Chopped peanuts -- for garnish
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        Thinly-sliced fresh basil leaves -- for garnish

Immerse the bundle of noodles in cold water in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil, remove from the heat, cover, and let sit for 3 to 5 minutes, or until al dente, then drain.  When cool enough to handle, place on a cutting board and cut in several directions to create shorter lengths.

In the meantime, heat the oil in a stir-fry pan or wok.  Add the onion and stir-fry over medium heat until translucent.  Turn up the heat, add the garlic and cabbage and stir-fry until the cabbage is tender-crisp and lightly browned, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and sprouts and continue to fry, stirring frequently, until the tomatoes are soft and the sprouts tender-crisp, another 5 to 7 minutes.

Stir in the vinegar, tofu, and red pepper flakes, and cellophane noodles.  Cook, stirring, until everything is well heated through.  Serve at once, garnishing each serving with chopped peanuts and the optional basil.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2              large  leeks - (or 3 medium)
  1         tablespoon  light olive oil
     1/2           cup  dry white wine -- divided
  4             ounces  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- wiped clean,

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Trim away the bottoms and large green leaves of the leeks.  Use the white and palest green parts only.  Cut the leeks lengthwise down the center, then into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Transfer to a colander and rinse well until all grit is removed.

Heat the oil in a large skillet or steep-sided stir-fry pan.  Add the leeks and half of the wine.  Cook, covered, for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the leeks have softened.  Add the mushrooms, bell peppers, and the remaining wine.  Cook, covered, for 6 to 8 minutes more, or until the mushrooms have wilted and the bell peppers are tender-crisp.

Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve at once.
