Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  fresh arugula - (3 large bunches)
     1/4         pound  chunk very good Parmesan
                        === LEMON VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice - (2 lemons)
     1/2           cup  good olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

If the arugula has roots attached, cut them off.  Fill the sink with cold water and toss the arugula for a few minutes to clean.  Spin-dry the leaves and place them in a large bowl.

In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Pour enough dressing on the arugula to moisten.  Toss well and place the salad on individual plates.

With a very sharp knife or a vegetable peeler, shave the Parmesan into large shards and arrange them on the arugula.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        Baby Leaf Salad With Bacon

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  good bacon
  1                     extra-large egg yolk -- room temperature
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  2             cloves  garlic, large -- chopped
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice -- (3 lemons)
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  good olive oil
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan -- plus
     1/4         pound  chunk of very good parmesan
                        Mesculun greens -- washed, spun dry

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lay the bacon on a baking sheet, and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until crisp.  Dry on paper towels and large dice.

For the dressing, place the egg yolk, mustard, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper into the bowl of a food processor fitted with steel blade.  Process until smooth.  With the food processor running, slowly pour the olive oil through the feed tube (as though you were making mayonnaise) and process until thick.  Add 1/2 cup grated Parmesa and pulse 3 times.

Toss the lettuce with enough dressing to moisten well.  Divide the lettuce among 4 plates.  With a very sharp knife or a vegetable peeler, shave the Parmesan into large shards and arrange them on the lettuce.  Sprinkle the diced bacon over the salad and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  baking potatoes -- unpeeled
  4        tablespoons  good olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt

Spread the potatoes in a single layer with 1 cut-side down.

Bake the potatoes for 30 to 35 minutes, turning to the other cut side after 20 minutes.  Bake until they are lightly browned, crisp outside, and tender inside.  Sprinkle with salt and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  flour
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     3/4           cup  milk -- plus
  1         tablespoon  milk
  2                     extra-large eggs
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
                        Unsalted butter
  2                     ripe bananas -- diced, plus
                        extra for serving
                        Pure maple syrup -- for serving

Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the sour cream, milk, eggs, vanilla, and lemon zest.  Add the wet ingredients to the dry ones, mixing only until combined.

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat until it bubbles.  Ladle the pancake batter into the pan to make 3 or 4 pancakes.  Distribute a rounded tablespoon of bananas on each pancake.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until bubbles appear on top and the underside is nicely browned.

Flip the pancakes and then cook for another minute until browned.  Wipe out the pan with a paper towel, add more butter to the pan, and continue cooking pancakes until all the batter is used.  Serve with sliced bananas, butter and maple syrup.

This recipe yields 12 pancakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     chickens - (2 1/2 to 3 lbs ea) -- quartered, with
                        backs removed
  1             recipe  Barbecue Sauce -- (see recipe)

Marinate the chickens in 2/3 of the barbecue sauce for a few hours or overnight in the refrigerator.

Heat the coals in a charcoal grill.  Spread the bottom of the grill with a single layer of hot coals and then add a few more coals 5 minutes before cooking, which will keep the fire going longer.

Place the chicken quarters on the grill, skin-side down, and cook for about 45 minutes, turning once or twice to cook evenly on both sides.  Brush with the marinade as needed.  The chicken quarters are done when you insert a knife between a leg and thigh and the juices run clear.  Discard any unused marinade.

Serve with extra barbecue sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  garlic - (abt 16 cloves) -- peeled
  1                cup  good olive oil
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt

                        = (8 cups of florets)
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce

Put the garlic cloves and oil in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan.  Bring to a boil and cook uncovered over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, until the garlic is browned and tender.  Turn off the heat and add the red pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Immediately pour into a heat-proof container to stop the cooking.  Allow to cool to room temperature.

For the salad, blanch the broccoli florets in a large pot of boiling salted water for 2 to 3 minutes, until crisp-tender.  Drain well and immerse immediately into a large bowl of ice water until the broccoli is cooled.  This process stops the cooking and sets the bright green color.  Drain well.

In a large bowl, toss the broccoli with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup of the oil used to cook the garlic, the soy sauce, and 8 or more cloves of cooked garlic.  Taste for seasonings and serve cold or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                     Butternut Squash And Apple Soup

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soup

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  good olive oil
  4               cups  chopped yellow onions -- (3 large)
  2        tablespoons  mild curry powder
  5             pounds  butternut squash -- (2 large)
  1 1/2         pounds  sweet apples, such as McIntosh -- (4 apples)
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  water
  2               cups  good apple cider or juice

Warm the butter, olive oil, onions, and curry powder in a large stockpot uncovered over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until the onions are tender.  Stir occasionally, scraping the bottom of the pot.

Peel the squash, cut in half, and remove the seeds.  Cut the squash into chunks.  Peel, quarter, and core the apples.  Cut into chunks.

Add the squash, apples, salt, pepper, and 2 cups of water to the pot.  Bring to a boil, cover, and cook over low heat for 30 to 40 minutes, until the squash and apples are very soft.  Process the soup through a food mill fitted with a large blade, or puree it coarsely in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade.

Pour the soup back into the pot.  Add the apple cider or juice and enough water to make the soup the consistency you like; it should be slightly sweet and quite thick.  Check the salt and pepper and serve hot.

This recipe yields 3 1/2 quarts.

                        Caesar Salad With Pancetta

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  pancetta -- sliced 1/2" thick
  2              pints  cherry tomatoes
                        Good olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              large  romaine lettuce heads
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        === DRESSING ===
  1                     extra-large egg yolk -- room temperature
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  2                     large cloves garlic -- chopped
  8                     anchovy fillets - (to 10) -- optional
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice - (3 lemons)
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  good mild olive oil
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cut the pancetta into 1/2-inch cubes and cook it in a skillet over medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, until browned and crisp.  Remove to paper towels and drain.

Place the tomatoes on a baking sheet and coat with olive oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast for 15 to 20 minutes, until soft.

Wash the lettuce leaves carefully and spin-dry in a salad spinner.  Stack the leaves on a cutting board and cut them crosswise into 1 1/2-inch slices.  Place them in a large mixing bowl.

For the dressing, place the egg yolks, mustard, garlic, anchovies, lemon juice, salt, and pepper into the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade.  Process until smooth.  With the food processor running, slowly pour the olive oil through the feed tube (as though you were making mayonnaise), until thick.  Add the grated Parmesan cheese and pulse 3 times.

Toss the lettuce with enough dressing to moisten well.  Add 1 cup grated Parmesan and toss.  Divide the lettuce among 6 or 8 plates and sprinkle with the pancetta roasted tomatoes.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  All these ingredients can be made in advance.  Be sure they're room temperature when you assemble the salad.

If you're nervous about raw egg yolks, substitue 2 tablespoons of real mayonnaise.

Pancetta is Italian bacon.  You can find it in your Italian grocery or a specialty food store.  Insist that it's cut 1/2-inch thick.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell..."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  bacon -- chopped
     1/4           cup  good olive oil
  6               cups  chopped yellow onions -- (4 large onions)
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/2           cup  flour
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground turmeric
  12              cups  chicken stock
  6               cups  medium-diced white boiling potatoes -- unpeeled (2 lbs)
  10              cups  corn kernels
                        = (10 ears fresh or 3 lbs frozen)
  2               cups  half-and-half
  8             ounces  sharp white cheddar cheese -- grated

In a large stockpot over medium-high heat, cook the bacon and olive oil until the bacon is crisp, about 5 minutes.  Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and reserve.  Reduce the heat to medium, add the onions and butter to the fat, and cook for 10 minutes, until the onions are translucent.

Stir in the flour, salt, pepper, and turmeric and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the chicken stock and potatoes, bring to a boil, and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.

If using fresh corn, cut the kernels off the cob and blanch them for 3 minutes in boiling salted water.  Drain.  (If using frozen corn you can skip this step.)  Add the corn to the soup, then add the half-and-half and cheddar.  Cook for 5 more minutes, until the cheese is melted.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Serve hot with a garnish of bacon.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------

Assembling a stunning fruit and cheese platter requires no cooking.  I follow a few key principles to be sure it looks festive and is easy for guests to help themselves.  First, I choose an interesting assortment of cheeses ó hard sharp cheeses, soft creamy ones, and pungent blue cheeses.  I look for an interesting mix of flavors, textures, and colors.  For example: French Camembert, Le Chevrot (a sharp goat cheese), Rondin with herbs (a creamy goat cheese), and Montagnolo (a creamy blue cheese).

Go to the best cheese shop in town and ask the person at the counter which cheeses are ready to serve.  Taste everything; they expect you to.  We all know that the Brie may look terrific, but it can be underripe and tough or overripe and ammoniated.  You want only the freshest cheeses that are perfectly ripened.  Take them home, refrigerate them, and then bring them to room temperature a few hours before serving.

Second, be sure to have a platter or wooden board that is flat and large enough to hold the cheeses without crowding them.  Arrange the cheeses with the cut sides facing out, and with several small cheese knives, maybe one for each type of cheese.

Third, to finish the platter, add sliced breads or crackers, and green leaves.  I use either lemon or galax leaves, which you can get from your florist.  If you have a garden, any large flat leaf like hydrangea looks beautiful, but be sure they aren't poisonous and are pesticide-free!

Overall, the simpler the design, the better the platter looks.  Group each kind of cheese together and add one large bunch of green or red grapes in the center to create a visual focal point.  Fill in the spaces with lots of crackers or small slices of bread.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     sheets frozen puff pastry - (1 box) -- defrosted overnight
                        = (such as Pepperidge Farm)
                        Flour -- for dusting
  1                     extra-large egg
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1                cup  finely-grated GruyËre cheese
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme leaves
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Roll out each sheet of puff pastry on a lightly floured board until it is 10- by 12-inches.  Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon of water and brush the surface of the pastry.  Sprinkle each sheet evenly with 1/4 cup of the Parmesan, 1/2 cup of the GruyËre, 1/2 teaspoon of the thyme, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and some pepper.

With the rolling pin, lightly press the flavorings into the puff pastry.  Cut each sheet crosswise with a floured knife or pizza wheel into 11 or 12 strips.  Twist each strip and lay on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.

Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned and puffed.  Turn each straw and bake for another 2 minutes.  Don't over bake or the cheese will burn.  Cool and serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 22 straws.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              whole  bone-in skin-on chicken breasts -- (6 split)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- as needed
  5               cups  chicken stock -- preferably homemade
  2                     chicken bouillon cubes
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
  2               cups  chopped yellow onions - (2 onions)
     3/4           cup  flour
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  2               cups  medium-diced carrots - (4 carrots) -- blanched 2 minutes
  1            package  frozen peas - (10 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  frozen small whole onions
     1/2           cup  minced fresh parsley
                        === BISCUITS ===
  2               cups  flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4         pound  cold unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- diced
     3/4           cup  half-and-half
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  1                     egg -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for egg wash

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place the chicken breasts on a sheet pan and rub them with olive oil.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.  Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, or until cooked through.  Set aside until cool enough to handle, then remove the meat from the bones and discard the skin.  Cut the chicken into large dice.  You will have 4 to 6 cups of cubed chicken.

In a small saucepan, heat the chicken stock and dissolve the bouillon cubes in the stock.  In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter and saute the onions over medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, until translucent.  Add the flour and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes.  Add the hot chicken stock to the sauce.  Simmer over low heat for 1 more minute, stirring, until thick.  Add 2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and the heavy cream.  Add the cubed chicken, carrots, peas, onions, and parsley.  Mix well.  Place the stew in a 10- by 13- by 2-inch oval or rectangular baking dish.  Place the baking dish on a sheet pan lined with parchment or wax paper.  Bake for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the biscuits.  Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Add the butter and mix on low speed until the butter is the size of peas.  Add the half-and-half and combine on low speed.  Mix in the parsley.  Dump the dough out on a well-floured board and, with a rolling pin, roll out to 3/8-inch thick.  Cut out twelve circles with a 2 1/2-inch round cutter.

Remove the stew from the oven and arrange the biscuits on top of the filling.  Brush them with egg wash, and return the dish to the oven.  Bake for another 20 to 30 minutes, until the biscuits are brown and the stew is bubbly.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  To make in advance, refrigerate the chicken stew and biscuits separately.  Bake the stew for 25 minutes, then place the biscuits on top, and bake for another 30 minutes, until done.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the chicken breasts on a sheet pan and rub them with olive oil.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.  Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, or until cooked through.  Set aside until cool enough to handle, then remove the meat from the bones and discard the skin.  Cut the chicken into large dice.  You will have 4 to 6 cups of cubed chicken.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small saucepan, heat the chicken stock and dissolve the bouillon cubes in the stock.  In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter and saute the onions over medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, until translucent.  Add the flour and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes.  Add the hot chicken stock to the sauce.  Simmer over low heat for 1 more minute, stirring, until thick.  Add 2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and the heavy cream.  Add the cubed chicken, carrots, peas, onions, and parsley.  Mix well.  Place the stew in a 10- by 13- by 2-inch oval or rectangular baking dish.  Place the baking dish on a sheet pan lined with parchment or wax paper.  Bake for 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, make the biscuits.  Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Add the butter and mix on low speed until the butter is the size of peas.  Add the half-and-half and combine on low speed.  Mix in the parsley.  Dump the dough out on a well-floured board and, with a rolling pin, roll out to 3/8-inch thick.  Cut out twelve circles with a 2 1/2-inch round cutter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the stew from the oven and arrange the biscuits on top of the filling.  Brush them with egg wash, and return the dish to the oven.  Bake for another 20 to 30 minutes, until the biscuits are brown and the stew is bubbly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  To make in advance, refrigerate the chicken stew and biscuits separately.  Bake the stew for 25 minutes, then place the biscuits on top, and bake for another 30 minutes, until done.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  dried morels -- soaked for 30
                        minutes in 3 cups very hot water
  6                     boneless skinless chicken breasts
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        All-purpose flour -- for dredging
     1/4           cup  clarified butter
     1/3           cup  chopped shallots - (2 large)
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic - (3 cloves)
  1                cup  Madeira wine
  1                cup  creme fraiche - (8 oz)
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Lift the morels carefully from the hot water in order to leave any grit behind in the liquid.  Rinse a few times to be sure all the grittiness is gone.  Discard the liquid and dry the morels lightly with paper towels.  Set aside.

Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.  Dredge them in flour and shake off the excess.  Heat half the clarified butter in a large saute pan and cook the chicken in 2 batches over medium-low heat until browned on both sides, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove to an ovenproof casserole.

Add the rest of the clarified butter to the pan along with the shallots, drained morels, and garlic.  Saute over medium heat for 2 minutes, tossing and stirring constantly.  Pour the Madeira into the pan and reduce the liquid by half over high heat, 2 to 4 minutes.

Add the creme fraiche, cream, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt, and 3/4 teaspoon pepper.  Boil until the mixture starts to thicken, 5 to 10 minutes.  Pour the sauce over the chicken and bake for 12 minutes, or until the chicken is heated through.

To make ahead, refrigerate the chicken and sauce in the casserole and reheat slowly on top of the stove.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1                cup  bulghur wheat
  1 1/2           cups  boiling water
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice -- (2 lemons)
     1/4           cup  good olive oil
  3 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
  1              whole  bone-in skin-on chicken breast -- (2 split)
  1                cup  minced scallions, white and green parts -- (1 bunch)
  1                cup  chopped fresh mint leaves -- (1 bunch)
  1                cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley -- (1 bunch)
  1                     hothouse cucumber -- unpeeled, seeded,
                        and medium-diced
  2               cups  cherry tomatoes -- cut in half
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Place the bulghur in a large bowl, pour in the boiling water, and add the lemon juice, olive oil, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.  Stir, then allow to stand at room temperature for about 1 hour.

Place the chicken breast on a baking sheet and rub it with olive oil.  Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper.  Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, until just cooked.  Set aside until cool enough to handle.

Add the scallions, mint, parsley, cucumber, tomatoes, 2 teaspoons salt, and the pepper; mix well.  Season, to taste, and serve or cover and refrigerate.  The flavor will improve if the tabbouleh sits for a few hours.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     split chicken breasts (bone-in, skin-on)
                        Good olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- as needed
     1/2         pound  asparagus -- ends removed, and
                        cut in thirds diagonally
  1                     red bell pepper -- cored, seeded
  2                     scallions (white and green parts) -- sliced diagonally
  1         tablespoon  white sesame seeds -- toasted
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  good apple cider vinegar
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  dark sesame oil
     1/2    tablespoon  honey
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  grated peeled fresh ginger
     1/2    tablespoon  sesame seeds -- toasted
     1/4           cup  smooth peanut butter
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the chicken breasts on a sheet pan and rub with the skin with olive oil.  Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper.  Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is just cooked.  Set aside until cool enough to handle.  Remove the meat from the bones, discard the skin, and shred the chicken in large bite-sized pieces.

Blanch the asparagus in a pot of boiling salted water for 3 to 5 minutes until crisp-tender.  Plunge into ice water to stop the cooking.  Drain.  Cut the peppers in strips about the size of the asparagus pieces.  Combine the cut chicken, asparagus, and peppers in a large bowl.

Whisk together all of the ingredients for the dressing and pour over the chicken and vegetables.  Add the scallions and sesame seeds and season to taste.  Serve cold or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  unsalted butter - (3 sticks) -- room temperature
  2               cups  sugar
  5                     extra-large eggs -- room temperature
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure almond extract
  3               cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1                cup  buttermilk
  14            ounces  sweetened shredded coconut
                        === FROSTING ===
  1              pound  cream cheese -- room temperature
     3/4         pound  unsalted butter - (3 sticks) -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  pure almond extract
  1 1/2         pounds  confectioners' sugar -- sifted

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.  With the mixer on low speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time, scraping down the bowl after each addition.  Add the vanilla and almond extracts and mix well.

In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  In 3 parts, alternately add the dry ingredients and the buttermilk to the batter, beginning and ending with the dry.  Mix until just combined.  Fold in 7 ounces of coconut.

Line a muffin pan with paper liners.  Fill each liner to the top with batter.  Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until the tops are brown and a toothpick comes out clean.  Allow to cool in the pan for 15 minutes.  Remove to a baking rack and cool completely.

Meanwhile, make the frosting.  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, on low speed, cream together the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla and almond extracts.  Add the confectioners' sugar and mix until smooth.

Frost the cupcakes and sprinkle with the remaining coconut.

This recipe yields 18 cupcakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, quartered,
                        and cored
  1                     lemon -- zested
  1                     orange -- zested
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed orange juice
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  sugar -- to sprinkle on top
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  ground allspice
                        === PERFECT PIE CRUST ===
  12       tablespoons  very cold unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/3           cup  very cold vegetable shortening
  6        tablespoons  ice water - (to 8)
                        === EGG WASH ===
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cut each apple quarter in thirds crosswise and combine in a bowl with the zests, juices, 1/2 cup sugar, flour, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.

Roll out half the pie dough and drape it over a 9- or 10-inch pie pan to extend about 1/2-inch over the rim.  Don't stretch the dough; if it's too small, just put it back on the board and re-roll it.

Fill the pie with the apple mixture.  Brush the edge of the bottom pie crust with the egg wash so the top crust will adhere.  Top with the second crust and trim the edges to about 1-inch over the rim.  Tuck the edge of the top crust under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp the 2 together with your fingers or a fork.  Brush the entire top crust with the egg wash, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar, and cut 4 or 5 slits.

Place the pie on a sheet pan and bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until the crust is browned and the juices begin to bubble out.  Serve warm.

For The Crust:  Dice the butter and return it to the refrigerator while you prepare the flour mixture.  Place the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix.  Add the butter and shortening.  Pulse 8 to 12 times, until the butter is the size of peas.  With the machine running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball.  Dump out on a floured board and roll into a ball.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Cut the dough in half.  Roll each piece on a well-floured board into a circle, rolling from the center to the edge, turning and flouring the dough to make sure it doesn't stick to the board.  Fold the dough in half, place in a pie pan, and unfold to fit the pan.  Repeat with the top crust.  (Makes 2 (10-inch) crusts)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  good white chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  2 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  pure vanilla extract
  2 1/4         pounds  frozen mixed berries or frozen raspberries

Combine the chocolate, heavy cream, and the vanilla in a heat-proof bowl and set it over a pan of simmering water until the chocolate melts.

About 5 minutes before serving, remove the berries from the freezer and place them on individual serving plates.  Ladle the warm chocolate sauce over the berries and serve.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  plain yogurt (regular or low-fat) -- (2 pints)
     1/2           cup  good olive oil -- plus
                        more for brushing grill
  1                     lemon -- zested

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     roasting chicken - (5 to 6 lbs)
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- as needed
  1              bunch  fresh thyme
  4                     lemons
  3              heads  garlic -- halved crosswise
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
     1/2         pound  sliced bacon
  1                cup  white wine
     1/2           cup  chicken stock

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Remove the chicken giblets.  Rinse the chicken inside and out.  Remove any excess fat and leftover pinfeathers and pat the outside dry.  Place the chicken in a large roasting pan.  Liberally salt and pepper the inside of the chicken.  Stuff the cavity with the thyme, reserving enough thyme to garnish the chicken dish, 1 lemon, halved, and 2 halves of the garlic.

Brush the outside of the chicken with the butter and sprinkle again with salt and pepper.  Tie the legs together with kitchen string and tuck the wing tips under the body of the chicken.  Cut 2 of the lemons in quarters and scatter the quarters and remaining garlic around the chicken.  Lay the bacon slices over the chicken to cover.

Roast the chicken for 1 hour.  Remove the bacon slices from the top of the chicken and set aside.  Continue roasting the chicken for an additional 1/2 hour, or until the juices run clear when you cut between a leg and thigh.  Remove to a platter and cover with aluminum foil while you prepare the gravy.

Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the bottom of the pan.  Add the wine and chicken stock and bring it to a boil.  Reduce the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes, or until reduced by half.

Slice the chicken on a platter.  Garnish the chicken platter with the bacon slices, roasted garlic, reserved thyme and 1 lemon, sliced.  Serve with the gravy.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Remove the chicken giblets.  Rinse the chicken inside and out.  Remove any excess fat and leftover pinfeathers and pat the outside dry.  Place the chicken in a large roasting pan.  Liberally salt and pepper the inside of the chicken.  Stuff the cavity with the thyme, reserving enough thyme to garnish the chicken dish, 1 lemon, halved, and 2 halves of the garlic.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush the outside of the chicken with the butter and sprinkle again with salt and pepper.  Tie the legs together with kitchen string and tuck the wing tips under the body of the chicken.  Cut 2 of the lemons in quarters and scatter the quarters and remaining garlic around the chicken.  Lay the bacon slices over the chicken to cover.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast the chicken for 1 hour.  Remove the bacon slices from the top of the chicken and set aside.  Continue roasting the chicken for an additional 1/2 hour, or until the juices run clear when you cut between a leg and thigh.  Remove to a platter and cover with aluminum foil while you prepare the gravy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the bottom of the pan.  Add the wine and chicken stock and bring it to a boil.  Reduce the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes, or until reduced by half.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Slice the chicken on a platter.  Garnish the chicken platter with the bacon slices, roasted garlic, reserved thyme and 1 lemon, sliced.  Serve with the gravy.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2               cups  flour
     1/8      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        === FILLING ===
  6                     extra-large eggs -- room temperature
  3               cups  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  grated lemon zest - (4 to 6 lemons)
  1                cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1                cup  flour
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

For the crust, cream the butter and sugar until light in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Combine the flour and salt and, with the mixer on low, add to the butter until just mixed.  Dump the dough onto a well-floured board and gather into a ball.  Flatten the dough with floured hands and press it into a 9- by 13- by 2-inch baking sheet, building up a 1/2-inch edge on all sides.  Chill.

Bake the crust for 15 to 20 minutes, until very lightly browned.  Let cool on a wire rack.  Leave the oven on.

For the filling, whisk together the eggs, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and flour.  Pour over the crust and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the filling is set.  Let cool to room temperature.

Cut into triangles and dust with confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields 20 pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  2 1/2           cups  granulated sugar -- divided
  4                     extra-large eggs -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  grated lemon zest - (6 to 8 large lemons)
  3               cups  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     3/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice -- divided
     3/4           cup  buttermilk -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        === GLAZE ===
  2               cups  confectioners' sugar -- sifted
  3 1/2    tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour 2 (8 1/2- by 4 1/4- by 2 1/2-inch) loaf pans.  You may also line the bottom with parchment paper, if desired.

Cream the butter and 2 cups granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.  With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time, and the lemon zest.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.  In another bowl, combine 1/4 cup lemon juice, the buttermilk, and vanilla.  Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately to the batter, beginning and ending with the flour.  Divide the batter evenly between the pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester comes out clean.

Combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar with 1/2 cup lemon juice in a small saucepan and cook over low heat until the sugar dissolves.  When the cakes are done, allow to cool for 10 minutes.  Remove the cakes from the pans and set them on a rack set over a tray or sheet pan; spoon the lemon syrup over them.  Allow the cakes to cool completely.

For the glaze, combine the confectioners' sugar and the lemon juice in a bowl, mixing with a wire whisk until smooth.  Pour over the tops of the cakes and allow the glaze to drizzle down the sides.

This recipe yields 2 cakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest - (1 orange)
  5                     extra-large egg yolks -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  sifted cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  Grand Marnier liqueur
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream

Combine the milk and orange zest in a medium stainless steel saucepan over medium heat and bring almost to a boil.  Remove from the heat.

Beat the egg yolks and sugar on medium-high speed in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until pale and thick, about 5 minutes.  With the mixer on low speed, sprinkle on the cornstarch.  Beat on medium-low speed until combined, scraping down the bowl with a rubber spatula.

With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture.  Pour the mixture back into the pan.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 5 to 7 minutes.  (Pay attention because it will thicken and then quickly become orange scrambled eggs!)

Immediately, pour the mixture through a fine sieve into a large bowl.  Stir in the vanilla, Grand Marnier, butter, and heavy cream.  Place plastic wrap directly on the custard and refrigerate until cold.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  2 1/2           cups  granulated sugar -- divided
  4                     extra-large eggs -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  grated orange zest - (6 oranges)
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     3/4           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice -- divided
     3/4           cup  buttermilk -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        === GLAZE === -- (optional)
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar -- sifted
  1 1/2    tablespoons  freshly-squeezed orange juice

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour two 8 1/2- by 4 1/2- by 2 1/2-inch loaf pans.  Line the bottoms with parchment paper.

Cream the butter and 2 cups of the granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment for about 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy.  With the mixer on medium speed, beat in the eggs, one at a time, and the orange zest.

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  In another bowl, combine 1/4 cup of the orange juice, the buttermilk, and vanilla.  Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately to the batter, beginning and ending with the flour.  Divide the batter evenly between the pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester comes out clean.

While the cakes bake, cook the remaining 1/2 cup of granulated sugar with the remaining 1/2 cup orange juice in a small saucepan over low heat until the sugar dissolves.  When the cakes are done, let them cool for 10 minutes.  Take them out of the pans and place them on a baking rack set over a tray.  Spoon the orange syrup over the cakes and allow the cakes to cool completely.

To glaze, combine the confectioners' sugar and orange juice in a bowl, mixing with a wire whisk until smooth.  Add a few more drops of juice, if necessary, to make it pour easily.  Pour over the top of one cake and allow the glaze to dry.  Wrap well, and store in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields 2 cakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     chickens - (3 lbs ea) -- cut 8 serving pieces
  1              quart  buttermilk
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Vegetable oil or vegetable shortening -- as needed

Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl and pour the buttermilk over them.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Combine the flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.  Take the chicken out of the buttermilk and coat each piece thoroughly with the flour mixture.  Pour the oil into a large heavy-bottomed stockpot to a depth of 1-inch and heat to 360 degrees on a thermometer.

Working in batches, carefully place several pieces of chicken in the oil and fry for about 3 minutes on each side until the coating is a light golden brown (it will continue to brown in the oven).  Don't crowd the pieces.  Remove the chicken from the oil and place each piece on a metal baking rack set on a sheet pan.  Allow the oil to return to 360 degrees before frying the next batch.  When all the chicken is fried, bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is no longer pink inside.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  granulated sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  kosher salt
  2                     sheets puff pastry -- defrosted
                        = (Pepperidge Farm recommended)

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Combine the sugar and kosher salt.  Pour 1 cup of the sugar/salt mixture on a flat surface such as wooden board or marble.  Unfold each sheet of puff pastry onto the sugar and pour 1/2 cup of the sugar mixture on top, spreading it evenly on the puff pastry.  This is not about sprinkling, it's about an even covering of sugar.  With a rolling pin, roll the dough until it's 13- by 13-inches square and the sugar is pressed into the puff pastry on top and bottom.

Fold the sides of the square towards the center so they go halfway to the middle.  Fold them again so the two folds meet exactly at the middle of the dough.  Then fold 1 half over the other half as though closing a book.  You will have 6 layers.  Slice the dough into 3/8-inch slices and place the slices, cut-side up, on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.

Place the second sheet of pastry on the sugared board, sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar mixture, and continue as above.  (There will be quite a bit of sugar left over on the board.)  Slice and arrange on baking sheets lined with parchment.

Bake the cookies for 6 minutes until caramelized and brown on the bottom, then turn with a spatula and bake another 3 to 5 minutes, until caramelized on the other side.  Transfer to a baking rack to cool.

This recipe yields 40 cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  red potatoes -- unpeeled
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt -- plus
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1 1/2           cups  half-and-half
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Place the potatoes and 1 tablespoon of salt in a 4-quart saucepan with cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer covered for 25 to 35 minutes, until the potatoes are completely tender.  Drain.

In a small saucepan, heat the half-and-half and butter.  Transfer the potatoes to an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix them for a few seconds on low speed to break them up.  Slowly add the hot cream and butter to the potatoes, mixing on the lowest speed (the last quarter of cream and butter should be folded in by hand).  Fold in the sour cream, Parmesan, the remaining salt, and pepper; season, to taste, and serve immediately.  If the potatoes are too thick, add more hot cream and butter.

Keep the smashed potatoes hot in a heat-proof bowl set over simmering water.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh rosemary leaves
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  2                     racks lamb -- "frenched"

In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, process the salt, rosemary, and garlic until they're as finely minced as possible.  Add the mustard and balsamic vinegar and process for 1 minute.  Place the lamb in a roasting or sheet pan with the ribs curving down, and coat the tops with the mustard mixture.  Allow to stand for 1 hour at room temperature.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Roast the lamb for exactly 20 minutes for rare or 25 minutes for medium-rare.  Remove from the oven and cover with aluminum foil.  Allow to sit for 15 minutes, then cut into individual ribs and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "Frenching" refers to scraping the meat off the tips of the bones.  Ask your butcher to leave 1/8 inch of fat on the meat.

Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              small  red onions
     1/4           cup  good balsamic vinegar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  good balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  good olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6        tablespoons  minced shallots - (2 large)
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  good red wine vinegar
  2              heads  red-leaf lettuce -- washed, spun dry,
                        and torn into pieces

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Cut the onions in 1/2 and slice 1/4-inch thick, place on a baking sheet and toss with: 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.

Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the onions are tender.

Remove from oven and toss with 2 more tablespoons balsamic vinegar and cool to room temperature.

Whisk together the shallots, mustard, red wine vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl.  While whisking, add 3/4 cup olive oil until emulsified.

To assemble, toss enough lettuce for 6 people with dressing, to taste.  Place the lettuce on 6 plates and arrange the onions on top.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve.

Comments:  This salad is inspired by one that's made at Nick & Toni's in East Hampton.  They add blue cheese which is incredibly delicious too.

To make ahead, mix the dressing in the bottom of the bowl and gently place the lettuce on top.  Add the onions and place into the refridgerator without tossing until ready to serve.  When ready, toss.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     ducks - (5 to 5 1/2 lbs ea) -- innards, and
                        wing tips removed
  6             quarts  chicken broth
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Unwrap the ducks and allow them to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.  With a fork, prick the skin without piercing the meat.  This will allow the fat to drain off while the ducks cook.

Meanwhile, in a very large stock pot which can hold the 2 ducks, heat the chicken broth with 1 tablespoon of kosher salt until it boils.  Add the ducks very carefully and bring the stock back to a boil.  If there isn't enough stock to cover the ducks, add the hottest tap water to cover.  If the ducks float to the top, place a plate on top to keep them immersed.  When the stock comes back to a boil, lower the heat and simmer the ducks in the stock for 45 minutes.

When the ducks are finished simmering, skim off enough duck fat from the top of the stock to pour a film on the bottom of a 14- by 18- by 3-inch roasting pan.  This will keep the ducks from sticking when they roast.  Carefully take the ducks out of the stock, holding them over the pot to drain.  Place them in the roasting pan, pat the skin dry with paper towels, and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of salt and the pepper.  If you have time, allow the ducks to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow the skin to dry.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 500 degrees.  (Be sure your oven is very clean or it will smoke!)  Roast the ducks for 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow them to rest, covered with aluminum foil, for 20 minutes.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Unwrap the ducks and allow them to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.  With a fork, prick the skin without piercing the meat.  This will allow the fat to drain off while the ducks cook.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, in a very large stock pot which can hold the 2 ducks, heat the chicken broth with 1 tablespoon of kosher salt until it boils.  Add the ducks very carefully and bring the stock back to a boil.  If there isn&apos;t enough stock to cover the ducks, add the hottest tap water to cover.  If the ducks float to the top, place a plate on top to keep them immersed.  When the stock comes back to a boil, lower the heat and simmer the ducks in the stock for 45 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the ducks are finished simmering, skim off enough duck fat from the top of the stock to pour a film on the bottom of a 14- by 18- by 3-inch roasting pan.  This will keep the ducks from sticking when they roast.  Carefully take the ducks out of the stock, holding them over the pot to drain.  Place them in the roasting pan, pat the skin dry with paper towels, and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of salt and the pepper.  If you have time, allow the ducks to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow the skin to dry.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  Brussels sprouts
  3        tablespoons  good olive oil
     3/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Cut off the ends of the Brussels sprouts and pull off any yellow outer leaves.  Mix them in a bowl with the olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Transfer them to a sheet pan and roast for 35 to 40 minutes, until crisp outside and tender inside.  Shake the pan from time to time to brown the Brussels sprouts evenly.  Sprinkle with more kosher salt (I like these salty like French fries) and serve hot.

  12                    carrots

  2        tablespoons  minced fresh dill or parsley

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

If the carrots are thick, cut them in half lengthwise; if not, leave whole.  Slice the carrots diagonally in 1 1/2-inch-thick slices.  (The carrots will shrink while cooking so make the slices big.)  Toss them in a bowl with the olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Transfer to a sheet pan in 1 layer and roast in the oven for 20 minutes, until browned and tender.

Toss the carrots with minced dill or parsley, season to taste, and serve.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic - (3 cloves)
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh rosemary leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3               cups  chicken stock -- preferably homemade
  2               cups  half-and-half
  2               cups  milk
  2               cups  cornmeal
     1/2           cup  good grated Parmesan
                        Flour, olive oil, and butter -- for frying

Heat the butter and olive oil in a large saucepan.  Add the garlic, red pepper flakes, rosemary, salt, and pepper and saute for 1 minute.  Add the chicken stock, half-and-half, and milk and bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat and slowly sprinkle the cornmeal into the hot milk while stirring constantly with a whisk.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, for a few minutes, until thickened and bubbly.  Off the heat, stir in the Parmesan.  Pour into a 9- by 13- by 2-inch pan, smooth the top, and refrigerate until firm and cold.

Cut the chilled polenta into 12 squares, as you would with brownies.  Lift each one out with a spatula and cut diagonally into triangles.  Dust each triangle lightly in flour.

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large saute pan and cook the triangles in batches over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes, turning once, until browned on the outside and heated inside.  Add more butter and oil, as needed.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

                            Salmon With Fennel

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 15    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fresh salmon - (abt 10 lbs)
  5               cups  yellow onions in 1/4" thk slices - -- (3 lbs)
  5               cups  fennel bulbs in 1/4" thk slices - (3 lbs)
     1/2           cup  good olive oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped fennel fronds
  1                     orange -- zested
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Have the fishmonger cut the head and tail off the salmon and butterfly it, removing all the bones.  You should have about 7 pounds of salmon.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Saute the onions and fennel in the olive oil for 10 minutes on medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.  Add the thyme leaves, fennel fronds, orange zest, orange juice, salt, and pepper and saute for 5 more minutes, until the onions and fennel are tender.  Taste for salt and pepper.

Lay the salmon, skin-side down, on a cutting board and sprinkle both sides generously with salt and pepper.  Spread the fennel filling over half of the salmon.  Pull the other half up and over the filling, enclosing it.  Tie the salmon every 2 inches with kitchen string to secure the stuffing.

Place a sheet pan lined with parchment paper in the oven for 5 minutes to heat it.  Carefully transfer the salmon to the hot sheet pan and bake it for exactly 30 minutes (10 minutes for each 1-inch of thickness).  Do not overbake!

Allow to cool slightly, then remove the strings.  To serve, cut into thick slices with a very sharp knife.  This salmon is delicious hot or at room temperature.

Use leftovers for Salmon Salad (see recipe) the next day.

This recipe yields 10 to 15 servings.

Comments:  If you're making this in advance, be sure to cool the filling before stuffing the salmon.  Refrigerate until ready to roast.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               ears  corn on the cob - (to 10)
                        = (yellow or white corn)
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Remove the husks and the silk from the corn and cut the kernels off as close to the husk as possible without removing any of the husk.  You should have about 7 cups of kernels.

Melt the butter in a large, heavy saute pan.  Add the corn, salt, and pepper and saute uncovered on medium-low heat for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until all the starchiness in the corn is gone.  Taste, for salt and pepper, and serve.  Some chopped basil makes a nice addition.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  You can mix 1 1/2 tablespoons butter with 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil to get the flavor of butter and the high burning point of olive oil.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  boiling potatoes -- peeled
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Cut the potatoes into 1-inch cubes and place them in a large pot.  Cover the potatoes with cold water and add enough salt so the water tastes quite salty.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 10 to 12 minutes, until the potatoes fall apart easily when pierced with a fork.

Meanwhile, heat the milk and butter in a small saucepan, making sure it doesn't boil.  Set aside until the potatoes are done.

As soon as the potatoes are tender, drain them in a colander.  Place a food mill fitted with a small disc/blade over a glass bowl.  Process the potatoes through the food mill, turning the handle back and forth to force the potatoes through the disc.  As soon as the potatoes are mashed, slowly whisk in enough of the hot milk/butter mixture to make the potatoes very creamy.  Add 2 teaspoons of salt and the sour cream and pepper and whisk to combine.  Taste for seasoning and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1              bunch  chopped scallions (white and green parts)
  2                     boxes frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz ea) -- defrosted
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
  3                     extra-large eggs -- lightly beaten
  7             ounces  feta cheese -- crumbled
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  40                    sheets frozen phyllo dough - (1 box) -- defrosted overnight
                        = (such as Pepperidge Farm)
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- melted
     1/2           cup  plain dry breadcrumbs

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan and add the scallions.  Cook for 5 minutes or until soft. Meanwhile, squeeze most of the water out of the spinach and place it in a bowl.  Add the scallions, dill, eggs, feta, salt, and pepper and mix together.

Keep the phyllo dough sheets covered with a damp kitchen towel.  Unfold 1 sheet of the phyllo dough.  Brush the sheet with melted butter and sprinkle with breadcrumbs.  Repeat the process by laying a second sheet of phyllo dough over the first sheet, brush it with melted butter and sprinkle with breadcrumbs until all 10 sheets have been used.

Spoon 3/4 cup of the spinach mixture into a sausage shape along one edge of the phyllo dough.  Roll it up.  Brush the top with butter and score the roll into 1-inch rounds.  Place it on an oiled baking sheet.  Repeat until all the pastry and filling have been used.

Place in the oven and bake for 12 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
  2               cups  sugar
  4                     extra-large eggs -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  sour cream -- room temperature
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  grated orange zest
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
                        === FILLING FOR EACH CAKE ===
  1                cup  heavy cream - (1/2 pint) -- chilled
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1               pint  fresh strawberries -- hulled and sliced

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Butter the bottom of two 8-inch cake pans.  Then line them with parchment paper and butter and flour the lined pans.

Cream the butter and sugar on high speed in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy.  On medium speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time, then the sour cream, zests, and vanilla, scraping down the bowl as needed.  Mix well.  Sift together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda.  On low speed, slowly add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and combine just until smooth.

Pour the batter evenly into the pans, smooth the tops, and bake in the center of the oven for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean.  Let cool in the pans for 30 minutes, then remove to wire racks and let cool to room temperature.  If using 1 cake, wrap the second well and freeze.

To make the filling for one cake, whip the cream, sugar, and vanilla in a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until firm.  Slice one of the cakes in half with a long, sharp knife.  Place the bottom slice of the cake on a serving platter, spread with 1/2 the whipped cream and scatter with sliced strawberries.  Cover with the top slice of the cake and spread with the remaining cream.  Decorate with strawberries.

This recipe yields 2 (8-inch) cakes.

  1                cup  cold heavy cream - (1/2 pint)
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  dark rum

Combine the strawberries, sugar, and 1/4 cup of water in a medium saucepan and cook uncovered over medium-low heat for 5 minutes.  Add 2 half-pints of raspberries and all the blueberries and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reaches a simmer.  Cook for one minute.  Off the heat, stir in the remaining raspberries and the framboise.

Slice the bread in 1/2-inch-thick slices and remove the crusts.  In the bottom of a 7 1/2-inch round by 3-inch high souffle or baking dish, ladle about 1/2 cup of the cooked berry mixture.  Arrange slices of bread in a pattern (this will become the top when it's unmolded) and then add more berry mixture to saturate.  Continue adding bread, cutting it to fit the mold, and berries.  Finish with bread and cooked berries, using all of the fruit and syrup.

Place a sheet of plastic wrap loosely over the pudding.  Find a plate approximately the same diameter as the inside of the mold and place it on top.  Weight the mold with a heavy can and refrigerate.  Remove the weight after 6 to 8 hours.  Cover the pudding with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Just before serving, run a knife around the outside of the pudding and unmold it upside down onto a serving plate.  Serve in wedges with rum whipped cream.

Rum Whipped Cream:  Whip the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.  When it starts to thicken, add the sugar, vanilla, and rum.  Continue to whip until it forms stiff peaks.  Serve cold.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped yellow onion - (1 onion)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2         pounds  sweet Italian turkey sausage -- casings removed
  1                can  crushed tomatoes in tomato puree - (28 oz)
  1                can  tomato paste - (6 oz)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley -- divided
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- as needed
     1/2         pound  lasagna noodles
  15            ounces  ricotta cheese
  3             ounces  creamy goat cheese - (to 4) -- crumbled
  1                cup  grated Parmesan -- plus
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan -- for sprinkling
  1                     extra-large egg -- lightly beaten
  1              pound  fresh mozzarella -- thinly sliced

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Heat the olive oil in a large (10- to 12-inch) skillet.  Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes over medium-low heat, until translucent.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.  Add the sausage and cook over medium-low heat, breaking it up with a fork, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until no longer pink.  Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons of the parsley, the basil, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Simmer, uncovered, over medium-low heat, for 15 to 20 minutes, until thickened.

Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with the hottest tap water.  Add the noodles and allow them to sit in the water for 20 minutes.  Drain.

In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, goat cheese, 1 cup of Parmesan, the egg, the remaining 2 tablespoons of parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Set aside.

Ladle 1/3 of the sauce into a 9- by 12- by 2-inch rectangular baking dish, spreading the sauce over the bottom of the dish.  Then add the layers as follows: half the pasta, half the mozzarella, half the ricotta, and one third of the sauce.  Add the rest of the pasta, mozzarella, ricotta, and finally, sauce.  Sprinkle with 1/4 cup of Parmesan.  Bake for 30 minutes, until the sauce is bubbling.

Heat the olive oil in a large (10- to 12-inch) skillet.  Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes over medium-low heat, until translucent.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.  Add the sausage and cook over medium-low heat, breaking it up with a fork, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until no longer pink.  Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons of the parsley, the basil, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Simmer, uncovered, over medium-low heat, for 15 to 20 minutes, until thickened.

Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with the hottest tap water.  Add the noodles and allow them to sit in the water for 20 minutes.  Drain.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, goat cheese, 1 cup of Parmesan, the egg, the remaining 2 tablespoons of parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Ladle 1/3 of the sauce into a 9- by 12- by 2-inch rectangular baking dish, spreading the sauce over the bottom of the dish.  Then add the layers as follows: half the pasta, half the mozzarella, half the ricotta, and one third of the sauce.  Add the rest of the pasta, mozzarella, ricotta, and finally, sauce.  Sprinkle with 1/4 cup of Parmesan.  Bake for 30 minutes, until the sauce is bubbling.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  chopped yellow onions - (2 large onions)
  2        tablespoons  good olive oil
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme leaves
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried thyme)
     1/3           cup  Worcestershire sauce
     3/4           cup  chicken stock
  1 1/2      teaspoons  tomato paste
  5             pounds  ground turkey breast
  1 1/2           cups  plain dry bread crumbs
  3                     extra-large eggs -- beaten
     3/4           cup  ketchup

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

In a medium saute pan, over medium-low heat, cook the onions, olive oil, salt, pepper, and thyme until translucent, but not browned, approximately 15 minutes.  Add the Worcestershire sauce, chicken stock, and tomato paste and mix well.  Allow to cool to room temperature.

Combine the ground turkey, bread crumbs, eggs, and onion mixture in a large bowl.  Mix well and shape into a rectangular loaf on an ungreased sheet pan.  Spread the ketchup evenly on top.  Bake for 1 1/2 hours until the internal temperature is 160 degrees and the meatloaf is cooked through.  (A pan of hot water in the oven under the meatloaf will keep the top from cracking.)  Serve hot, at room temperature, or cold in a sandwich.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                          Zucchini With Parmesan

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:10
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             medium  zucchini
                        Good olive oil -- as needed
  2              large  yellow onions -- cut in half and
                        sliced 1/2" thick
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- as needed
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Remove the ends of the zucchini and, if they are large, cut in half lengthwise.  Slice the zucchini diagonally in 1/2-inch slices.

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large (12-inch) saute pan and add the onions.  Cook for 10 minutes on medium-low heat, until they start to brown.  Add half the zucchini, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to the pan and cook, tossing occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes, until just cooked through.  Sprinkle with Parmesan and cook for 30 seconds more.  Remove to a serving platter and repeat with the rest of the zucchini.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  If you cook too much zucchini in one pan, you end up steaming rather than sauteing it.  I prefer to cook it in 2 batches.
