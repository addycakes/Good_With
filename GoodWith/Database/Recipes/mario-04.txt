        Anchovies (Or Sardines Or Mackerel), Fried Genovese Style

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Fish (Ocean)
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             quarts  virgin olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh anchovies
                        = (or sardines or mackerel)
  3                     eggs
  3                     garlic cloves -- very finely chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped italian parsley
  4               cups  fresh bread crumbs -- very finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     lemons -- in wedges

Heat oil to 375 degrees and maintain heat.  Scale and gut anchovies, leaving heads and tails intact (or have your fish monger do this for you).

In a large mixing bowl, mix eggs, garlic and parsley until well blended.  Dip fish 3 or 4 at a time into egg mixture and then into bread crumbs.  Shake well to remove excess egg-crumb coating and fry fish 3 to 4 at a time until crisp and golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove and drain on a paper towel.

Serve immediately with salt, pepper and lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings as antipasto.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     extra-large eggs
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil

Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil and any other flavoring you may choose.

Using a fork, beat together the eggs, oil and flavorings and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.  As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when 1/2 of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands primarily.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits.

Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

This recipe yields 1 pound of pasta.

Comments:  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are essential for a light pasta.

Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- for dusting
  4                     extra-large eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil
  1              ounce  squid ink
                        = (available in speciality food shops)

Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil and squid ink.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs, oil and squid ink and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when 1/2 of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands primarily.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrap up any left over crusty bits.

Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes, the dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are essential for a light pasta.

This recipe yields 1 pound of pasta.

                        === FILLING ===
  3             pounds  buttermilk squash
  2                     eggs
  1 1/4           cups  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- divided

  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
                        === CONDIMENT ===
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4                     sage leaves

Bake squash 1 hour at 350 degrees.  Scoop out, with seeds and skin removed.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  5                     Spanish onions -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/4" thick
  4                     anchovy fillets
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped thyme leaves
  2               cups  flour -- plus board flour
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  milk -- barely warmed
  2                     eggs
  4        tablespoons  cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     magret of duck - (3 double breasts)
     1/2         pound  pork butt -- chopped 1/2" pieces
  4        tablespoons  duck fat
  1                     turnip -- chopped 1/4" dice
  8                     shallots -- roughly chopped
  1                     carrot -- chopped 1/4" dice
  10                    prunes -- soaked 4 hours in
  8        tablespoons  armagnac
  5                     eggs
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  roughly-ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Remove fat from magret, chop into 1/4-inch dice and set aside.  Hand cut magret meat into 1-inch cubes and place in food processor with pork butt.  Grind until rough, barely pulsing to bind.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat duck fat until smoking.  Add turnip, shallots and carrot and saute until deep golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Add prunes and Armagnac and cook until liquid is reduced to 4 tablespoons.  Remove from heat and cool.

In a mixing bowl, stir together duck fat, duck and pork mixture, turnip mixture, eggs, cream and cinnamon and season with 2 tablespoons salt and 1 tablespoon black pepper, roughly ground.

Spoon firmly into a 2-quart terrine mold or loaf pan and pack in.  Cover with foil and place in roasting pan.  Fill roasting pan half full with cold water, place in oven and bake 1 3/4 hours.  Remove and cool.

Place 2 soup cans lengthwise over the terrine and refrigerate overnight.  Serve cool with frisee salad and cornichons.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     ducks - (abt 4 1/2 lbs ea) -- with necks, gizzards
                        = (or 4 pair duck legs with thighs attache
  3        tablespoons  coarse (kosher) salt - (to 6)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  coarsely-chopped shallots
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  2          teaspoons  black peppercorns -- lightly crushed
  1                     bay leaf -- crumbled
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-chopped garlic
  1              pinch  dried thyme -- crumbled
                        = (or 1 sprig fresh thyme, chopped)
  4               cups  good quality lard or rendered goose fat - -- (to 6 cups)
                        = (not commercial, available at fancy
                        butchers)
  1              whole  garlic head
  2                     whole cloves
                        peanut oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt - (to 3/4)
                        Good quality lard

1.  1 DAY IN ADVANCE:  Trim loose flaps of skin from duck and pull out all loose fat from cavity; reserve.  Remove any skin from necks; reserve.  Peel off and discard outer covering of gizzards.

2.  Using poultry shears or large, sharp, heavy knife, cut up ducks to produce pieces for confit:  4 legs (thigh with drumstick attached), 4 wings, and 4 breast pieces.  Remove wing tips; reserve backs and wing tips for soup or other purpose.  Remove skin from backs; add to reserved pieces of skin and fat.

3.  Weigh the trimmed pieces.  For every pound, use 4 1/3 teaspoons salt for longterm ripening (more than 1 week).  Combine salt with shallots, parsley, peppercorns, bay leaf, minced garlic, and thyme in large bowl.  Toss duck pieces, necks, and gizzards with the mixture.  Cover with kitchen towel or plastic wrap and refrigerate 18 to 24 hours.

4.  Meanwhile, cut reserved pieces of fat and skin into small pieces (1/4-inch or less) and render out most of the fat by either oven or stovetop method as follows:  For oven method, heat oven to 300 degrees; cook duck fat and skin in deep ovenproof bowl for about 1 hour, or until fat turns clear and bits of skin have floated to the surface and are pale golden.  Strain rendered fat into heatproof container.  If not using fat immediately, cool, uncovered, to room temperature; store, tightly covered, in refrigerator.

5.  THE FOLLOWING DAY:  Place rendered duck fat in CrockPot or large, very heavy pot such as enameled cast-iron casserole.  Add 4 to 6 cups rendered poultry fat or lard exact amount will vary depending on size and shape of your cooking vessel.  Slowly melt the fat.

6.  Remove marinated duck pieces from bowl and rinse under cold running water.  Let drain briefly (it is not necessary to dry surface completely).

7.  As soon as fat has melted, slip in pieces of duck.  Fat should cover duck; if there is not enough fat, work in batches.  Split head of garlic in half crosswise and stick a whole clove in each half.  Add garlic to melted fat.

8.  In CrockPot or over very low heat, uncovered, bring fat to temperature of 190 degrees; this should take about 1 hour in covered CrockPot or partially covered casserole (faster heating will result in a stringy-textured confit).  Hold temperature at 190, adjusting setting as necessary, until gizzards, neck, wings, and breasts are tender enough to be pierced easily with wooden pick, about 1 hour; CrockPot should be partially covered.  Skin will be pale in color.  Remove these pieces with slotted spoon as they are done; keep pieces covered with foil to prevent drying out.  Maintain 190 degree temperature another 30 minutes, or until thickest part of thigh tests done.  Remove from heat, let duck legs cool in fat 1 hour.  Remove duck thighs and garlic with slotted spoon.

9.  Ladle fat to large, very heavy pot.  Heat, uncovered, over medium-high heat to almost boiling, skimming off foam that rises to surface.  Let bubble 5 to 10 minutes, or until spattering stops and surface of fat is nearly undisturbed.  Watch carefully and adjust heat if necessary to avoid burning or smoking; fat that is allowed to reach smoking point will be ruined for reuse.  Remove from heat; let cool a few minutes.

10.  Have ready a clean, dry container or several containers chosen according to how long you plan to keep the confit.

11.  Confit to be kept longer than a week and up to 4 months requires a somewhat different procedure.  For this amount, use three 1-quart or two 1 1/2-quart crocks or jars.  (Since pieces will be embedded in solidified fat and cannot be casually removed, it is necessary to use more than 1 vessel in order to separate larger pieces that will be served whole, or in attractive slices, from smaller and bonier ones that are best added to soups or stews.)  Heavy, glazed earthenware crocks, taller than they are wide, are excellent.  Remember that the narrower the vessel, the less fat will be needed to cover duck pieces; however, pieces should not be crowded against the sides.  Line up containers and prepare to fill them.  Pour boiling water into each; swirl and discard.  Thoroughly dry the containers.  Immediately place 1/2 teaspoon salt in bottom of each crock; this prevents meat juices (salarque) that may seep from duck during ripening process from turning sour.  Examine cooked duck pieces.  Bones may have come loose from some pieces; if so, use loose bones to make crisscross platform on bottom of one or all vessels.  Reheat fat.  Ladle bubbling clear top fat through fine-mesh strainer into each container; be sure not to use the more perishable cloudy fat and meat juices at the bottom (see Note 5).  Fill about halfway, slip in still-warm confit pieces without crowding.  Ladle in additional clear fat as necessary to cover confit and leave a generous inch of air space between surface of fat and rim of vessel.  Rap containers gently on work surface to tamp out any air pockets.  Let cool, uncovered, to room temperature.  Store, covered, overnight in refrigerator or in cold cellar or other cool storage area.

12.  THE NEXT DAY:  Seal confit by spooning a 1-inch layer of melted lard over surface; since lard is more impenetrable to air than duck fat, this protects against spoilage.  (Amount of lard necessary will vary with dimensions of your vessels.)  Cover with kitchen parchment secured with rubber band; this is sufficient protection with or without lid placed on top.  Store in refrigerator.  Do not freeze; freezing inhibits the ripening process and dries out the meat.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  dry yeast
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1 3/4           cups  lukewarm water
     1/2           cup  extra virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/4           cup  extra virgin olive oil
  5 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour

     1/4           cup  grated hard goat's milk cheese
  3        tablespoons  sea salt
  3        tablespoons  roughly-cracked black pepper
  1                cup  Tapenade (Black Olive Paste) -- (see recipe)

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5              large  eggs -- removed from
                        refrigerator one hour before using
     2/3           cup  sugar
  4        tablespoons  clarified butter -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  fromage blanc or ricotta
     1/2           cup  honey
  1               pint  fresh berries

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter one 9-inch by 3-inch full round cake pan and line bottom with parchment.  Butter pan and liner again and dust with flour.

Set mixer (preferably an electric mixer) near bain marie with hot (not boiling) water over low heat.

Put eggs and sugar in mixing bowl and beat one minute.  Place bowl over bain marie and beat on high speed until egg mixture is just warm, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from bain marie and beat egg mixture until it begins to thicken.

Slice cake in half horizontally and spread top and bottom layer with fromage blanc or sweetened ricotta.  (To create sweetened ricotta, stir ricotta together with honey and let stand 5 minutes).  Sprinkle with berries and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh anchovies
                        = (or sardines or mackerel)
  2                     garlic heads -- wrapped in foil,
                        and baked at 350 degrees for one hour
  2                     eggs
  4                     garlic cloves
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  2                     lemons -- in wedges
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil from Provence
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  lukewarm water - (to 2)
  4             pieces  French bread

Preheat grill or broiler.

Scale and gut anchovies (or sardines or mackerel), leaving heads and tails intact (or have your fish monger do this for you).  Squeeze roasted garlic heads carefully to remove paste and set aside.

To make aioli, place eggs and garlic cloves in a blender with lemon juice and blend to mix.  With blender running, add oil in a thin drizzle to form a thick emulsion.  Remove, season with salt and pepper and thin to desired consistency with 1 to 2 tablespoons lukewarm water.

Place anchovies on grill and cook through, about 1 to 2 minutes per side, and then remove to plates.  Grill bread and smear with garlic puree.  Place 1 slice of bread on each plate and serve with lemon wedges and aioli in center.

This recipe yields 4 servings as an appetizer.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  Prince Edward Island mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
  1                cup  dry white wine
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1                     celery rib -- julienned
  1             medium  leek -- split, cleaned,
                        and julienned
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, cored,
                        and julienned
     1/2      teaspoon  saffron threads
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  Pommery mustard
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     scallions -- cut thin julienne
  4             slices  bread -- grilled

Place mussels in a large pot with white wine and cook covered until all the mussels are open, about 5 to 8 minutes (those that are still closed after 8 minutes are dead and should be discarded).  Remove mussels and allow to cool.  Strain liquid and reserve.  Finely julienne the vegetables.  Carefully shuck mussels, leaving whole.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat oil until smoking.  Add celery, leek, red pepper and saffron and cook until softened, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Add cream and mustard and bring to a boil.  Add mussels and strained cooking liquid and return to boil.  Season with salt and pepper, sprinkle with scallions and serve in soup bowls with grilled bread on the bottom of each bowl.

This recipe yields 4 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  water
  2               cups  sugar
     1/4                orange -- including peel
  4                     quince -- peeled, cored,
                        and quartered
  2               cups  flour
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  butter -- room temperature,
                        cut into 1/2" dice
                        Zest of 1 orange -- grated
     1/4           cup  orange flower water
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  egg -- plus
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Creme fraiche -- for serving

In a large saucepan, combine water, sugar and orange and bring to a boil.  Add quince, return to boil, lower heat to simmer and cook until just tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Place flour and sugar onto cutting board.  Place butter onto flour mixture and work to form bread crumb-like texture.  Form into a well (like for pasta) and place zest, orange flower water, olive oil and 1 egg into center.  Using a fork, work wet ingredients into dry to form a dough and bring together into a ball.  Let rest 20 minutes in refrigerator wrapped in a towel.

Remove dough from refrigerator and cut in half on a floured cutting board.  Roll each half into 1/2-inch thick sheet and cut into 4-inch by 1/2-inch rectangles.  Form into little barquettes and slash centers lengthwise with the top of a knife.  Brush with beaten egg and bake on cookie sheet for 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove, cool and serve with quince in cooking liquid and creme fraiche.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CREPES ===
     3/4           cup  flour
  2                     eggs
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     3/4           cup  milk
  5        tablespoons  melted butter
                        Zest of 1 orange
     1/4           cup  pine nuts -- toasted 2 minutes
                        under broiler, plus an additional
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts -- toasted 2 minutes
                        under the broiler
                        === SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  6        tablespoons  honey
  1           teaspoon  pernod

In a mixing bowl, stir together flour, eggs and sugar and blend until smooth.  Whisk in milk to form smooth batter and add orange zest and 1/4 cup pine nuts.  Allow to stand 20 minutes.

  2                     egg whites
  2               cups  mascarpone cheese
                        = (or substitute ricotta or cream cheese)
  30             small  Savoiaridi
                        = (or 15 large broken in half)
  3             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- broken 1/4" pieces
  3             ounces  milk chocolate -- shaved or grated
  6              large  wine goblets

Mix coffee and brandy together and set aside.

Over a double-boiler, beat egg yolks and sugar until mixture lightens in color and forms ribbons (i.e. halfway to zabaglione).  Allow to cool 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, beat egg whites to stiff peaks.  Fold mascarpone into egg yolk mixture one quarter at a time.  Fold mascarpone mixture into egg whites and set aside.

Lay savoiardi along edges of wine goblets all the way to the bottom, lining the entire glass (while keeping 6 savoiardi for later use).  Using a pastry brush, paint the cookies with the espresso/brandy mixture.  Fill each goblet one-third full with mascarpone mixture and sprinkle with broken chocolate.  Lay one savoiardi across center and and paint with coffee mixture.  Fill each goblet with remaining mascarpone mixture, topping each with shaved chocolate.  Lay one savoiardi in each of the remaining 5 goblets and and paint with espresso mixture.

Can be served at room temperature.  Tiramisu was served chilled in the 1980s.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1              whole  egg -- pus
  2                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  sweet butter -- melted together with
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
  2               cups  fresh ricotta
                        = (sheep's milk ricotta is best)
     1/2           cup  pine nuts
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        Juice and zest of 1 lemon
  3                     eggs

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

To make the pastry, make a well of the flour, place egg, yolks, sugar, butter and olive oil mixture in center and proceed as you would with fresh pasta, i.e. bring flour in bit by bit until liquid in well is thick enough to bring together with hands.  Knead until dough is smooth and then allow to rest 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the filling by mixing together the ricotta, pine nuts, sugar, lemon zest, juice and eggs in a bowl until creamy.

To assemble, roll out the pastry to form two 12-inch circles.  Place one circle down to line the bottom and sides of the pan.  Spread the ricotta mixture evenly over this layer.  Place the remaining circle of dough over the top and pinch together the edges.  Place in oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove and serve warm or at room temperature with vin santo from Cappezzana.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Drop tortelloni into boiling water and cook until tender, about 8 to 9 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt butter and sage together in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan over medium heat, being careful not to brown.  Drain cooked tortelloni and gently pour into pan with butter and remaining cheese and toss gently over medium heat.  Place in warm serving bowl and serve immediately.
