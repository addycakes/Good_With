"The granola at breakfast is terrific.  I would be grateful if you could get the recipe from their chef so that I can surprise my husband by making the granola at home."

This granola can also be enjoyed as a snack with the addition of chocolate chips.  You could sprinkle it over ice cream, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Grand Marnier
                        = (or other orange liqueur)
     1/4           cup  water
  5               cups  whipping cream
  6              large  eggs
  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  8                     croissants - (abt 16 oz) -- cubed
  1                cup  dried apricots -- diced
                        Cider-Caramel Sauce -- (see recipe)

Simmer Grand Marnier and 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan 5 minutes.  Cool mixture completely.  Whisk Grand Marnier-water mixture, cream, eggs, sugar, vanilla and nutmeg in large bowl to blend.

Place croissant pieces in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish; add apricots and toss to combine.  Pour custard over croissant-apricot mixture, pressing down gently with rubber spatula so that croissant and apricot pieces are evenly covered.  Let stand 20 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.  Place dish in larger roasting pan.  Add enough hot water to roasting pan to come 1 inch up sides of baking dish.  Bake 1 hour.

Remove aluminum foil and continue baking until bread pudding is golden brown on top and firm to touch, about 30 minutes longer.  Carefully remove bread pudding from oven and from water bath; cool slightly.  Drizzle bread pudding with Cider-Caramel Sauce, if desired, and serve warm.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  "I had never been especially fond of bread pudding, but I changed my mind when I tried the one served at The Winchester Country Inn in Ashland, Oregon," says Sandra Miller of Cherry Hill, New Jersey.  "Their version is outstanding; it's studded with apricots and topped with a rich caramel sauce."

Croissants and a Grand Marnier custard make this bread pudding super-decadent.  It's great with or without the Cider-Caramel Sauce; if youíre short on time, substitute a purchased sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
  2               cups  hot water
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
  1 3/4           cups  finely-chopped onions
  8             ounces  fresh button mushrooms -- chopped
  6             ounces  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, sliced
  2 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2 1/2           cups  whole milk
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh chives
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12            ounces  penne pasta
     1/2           cup  fresh breadcrumbs made from French bread

Place porcini in small bowl.  Add 2 cups hot water and let soften 20 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, remove porcini.  Reserve liquid.  Coarsely chop porcini.

Melt 3 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and sautÈ until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add button and shiitake mushrooms and sautÈ 5 minutes.  Mix in porcini and reserved soaking liquid, leaving any sediment behind in bowl.  Simmer over medium-high heat 10 minutes.

Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add flour and stir constantly until golden, about 2 minutes.  Gradually whisk in milk.  Stir until sauce thickens and boils, about 3 minutes.  Stir into mushroom mixture.  Simmer 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and chives.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Set aside.  (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm over medium-low heat before continuing.)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite.  Drain well.  Return to pot.  Add mushroom sauce and toss well to coat.

Transfer to prepared baking dish.  Sprinkle breadcrumbs and remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan over.  Bake casserole until heated through and light golden, about 25 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  fresh blood orange juice
                        = (or regular orange juice)
  9        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  grated blood orange peel
                        = (or regular orange peel)

Stir all ingredients in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil until syrup is reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 20 minutes.  Refrigerate until cold.  Cover and keep refrigerated up to 2 days.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 cups.

Comments:  Blood oranges have red flesh and sweet-tart juice.  They're available at farmers' markets and, increasingly, at supermarkets.  This syrup would also be good over waffles.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  6        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
     1/3           cup  sugar
  4                     Anjou pears -- peeled, cored,

     1/2    tablespoon  fresh lemon juice - (about)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === OPTIONAL ===
     1/2         bunch  fresh chives -- cut into 2" pieces

Bring large pot of salted water to boil.  Add pearl onions and cook 1 minute.  Using slotted spoon, remove onions from pot.  Trim ends and peel.  Add veal to pot and cook 4 minutes.  Drain veal; rinse with cold water.

Rinse pot and return veal to pot.  Add 8 cups chicken stock and bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes.  Add thyme and bay leaves and simmer until veal is tender, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes longer.

Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in another heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add pearl onions, celery root, carrots, turnips, mushrooms and 1 cup chicken stock.  Cover and cook until vegetables are tender and almost all liquid has evaporated, about 15 minutes.  Add haricots verts and cook until just tender, about 2 minutes.  Drain veal, reserving 2 cups liquid (if less than 2 cups cooking liquid remains, add enough stock to measure 2 cups).  Mix veal into vegetables.

Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Mix in 3 tablespoons flour.  Cook until butter mixture turns golden brown, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes.  Whisk in 2 cups reserved cooking liquid.  Cook until thickened, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.  Stir in whipping cream.  Season sauce to taste with fresh lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Pour cream sauce over cooked veal and vegetables.  Garnish with fresh chives, if desired, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  "I recently had lunch at CafÈ Boulud here in New York." says Shelli Rafkin of New York, New York.  "My entrÈe, blanquette de veau, had the most incredible sauce Iíve ever tasted.  The whole dish, in fact, was sensational."

In this variation on the classic stew, the veal and the vegetables are cooked separately and combined at the end, when they're topped with a rich white sauce.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Puddings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  crustless French bread in 1" cubes
                        = (abt 3/4 of a 1-lb loaf of French bread)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
  1 3/4           cups  whole milk
  1                cup  whipping cream
  4             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped
  1                cup  sugar
  4              large  egg yolks
                        Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream -- (optional)

Butter 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Place bread cubes in large bowl; drizzle with butter and toss to coat.  Transfer bread to prepared dish.  Bring milk and cream just to simmer in heavy large saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate; whisk until melted and smooth.

Whisk sugar and yolks in medium bowl to blend.  Whisk chocolate mixture into sugar mixture.  Pour custard over bread.  Cover with plastic and let stand 1 hour (some custard will not be absorbed).  (Can be prepared up to 2 hours ahead.  Refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake pudding until just set but center moves slightly when dish is shaken, about 35 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature with whipped cream, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  "I recently was in Waxhaw, outside of Charlotte, and discovered a great restaurant -- Dearstyneís Bistro," writes Suzanne Hoover of New Hill, North Carolina.  "I would love to know how to make the chocolate bread pudding."

This version of the classic dessert has more custard and less bread than usual, giving the pudding a softer texture.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2           cups  milk (do not use low-fat or nonfat)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
  5              large  egg yolks
  6             ounces  milk chocolate -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === CAKE ===
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  strong fresh-brewed coffee
     3/4           cup  buttermilk
  6        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2              large  eggs -- beaten to blend
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Chocolate Glaze II -- (see recipe)

For Filling:  Bring milk to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Combine sugar and cornstarch in large bowl.  Beat egg yolks into sugar mixture.  Gradually whisk hot milk into yolk mixture.  Return mixture to saucepan.  Whisk over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat; add chocolate, butter and vanilla and whisk until mixture is smooth.  Transfer filling to medium bowl.  Cool, stirring occasionally.  Gently press plastic wrap directly onto surface of filling; cover and chill until cold, at least 3 hours.

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Butter 17 1/4- by 11 1/2- by 1-inch jelly roll pan.  Line pan with parchment paper.

Sift first 6 ingredients into large bowl.  Whisk coffee, buttermilk, oil, eggs and vanilla in medium bowl.  Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients; mix just until combined.  Transfer batter to prepared pan, spreading evenly.

Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.  Cool cake completely in pan on rack.  Using small knife, cut around edges of pan.  Turn cake out onto work surface.  Peel off parchment.  Trim tough edges.  Cut cake crosswise into three 5- by 10 1/2-inch pieces.  (Filling and cake can be made ahead.  Keep filling refrigerated up to 2 days.  Wrap cake layers in plastic and refrigerate up to 1 day.)

Place 1 cake layer on platter.  Spread half of filling over top.  Top with second cake layer.  Spread remaining filling over.  Top with third cake layer.  Pour lukewarm Chocolate Glaze over top and sides of cake, covering completely.  Smooth sides with spatula.  Refrigerate 2 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead; cover and keep refrigerated.)

This recipe yields 1 cake.

  2 1/4           cups  whole milk
  1 1/4      teaspoons  unflavored gelatin
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1              large  egg
  2              large  egg yolks
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled whipping cream
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  chilled whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Blend graham crackers and sugar in processor until finely ground.  Add butter and blend until moist clumps form.  Press crumb mixture firmly onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Bake until golden, about 10 minutes.  Cool completely.  Maintain oven temperature.

For Filling:  Spread coconut on rimmed baking sheet.  Bake until golden, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Place 1/4 cup milk in small bowl.  Sprinkle gelatin over and let stand 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, whisk sugar and cornstarch in medium saucepan to blend.  Gradually add 1/4 cup milk, whisking until smooth.  Add remaining 1 3/4 cups milk, egg and egg yolks, whisking to blend.

Reserve 2 tablespoons toasted coconut for topping; add remaining toasted coconut, butter, vanilla and salt to egg mixture.  Cook over medium heat until filling thickens and boils, stirring constantly, about 12 minutes.

Remove from heat.  Immediately add gelatin mixture and stir until gelatin dissolves.  Transfer to large bowl.  Place plastic wrap directly on surface of filling and refrigerate until cool, about 30 minutes.

Beat 1/2 cup cream in medium bowl to soft peaks; fold into cooled filling.  Refrigerate until filling is cold and begins to set, about 30 minutes.  Transfer filling to prepared crust.  Refrigerate while preparing topping.

For Topping:  Beat cream and sugar in medium bowl to firm peaks.  Pipe or spoon evenly over top of filling. Sprinkle with reserved 2 tablespoons toasted coconut.  Refrigerate pie at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.  Serve chilled.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  "Last spring I went to New Orleans for the Crescent City Classic, an annual road race.  One night I had dinner at Andrew Jaeger's House of Seafood in the French Quarter," says Gina Squires of St. Louis, Missouri.  "The coconut cream pie was great."

A toasted coconut topping adds texture and flavor to this old-fashioned dessert.

Comments:  "Years ago, when we were dating, my husband took me to Park Bistro in Manhattan," writes Therese Tetzel of Dallas, Texas.  "To this day, we return to the restaurant every time we go to New York.  Its version of coq au vin is the best Iíve had in the United States -- similar to one we tried in Burgundy."

Comments:  &quot;Years ago, when we were dating, my husband took me to Park Bistro in Manhattan,&quot; writes Therese Tetzel of Dallas, Texas.  &quot;To this day, we return to the restaurant every time we go to New York.  Its version of coq au vin is the best Iíve had in the United States -- similar to one we tried in Burgundy.&quot;

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRITS ===
  4 1/4           cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
     3/4           cup  whipping cream
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                cup  corn grits, such as Arrowhead Mills -- see * Note
                        === SHRIMP ===
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped shallots
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  2             pounds  uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (14 1/2 oz) -- drained, with
                        juices reserved
  4             ounces  prosciutto -- cut thin strips
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh chives
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Corn grits, also known as polenta, are available at Italian markets, natural foods stores and some supermarkets.  If unavailable, substitute 1 cup regular yellow cornmeal and cook about 8 minutes.

For Grits:  Bring chicken stock, whipping cream, butter and garlic to boil in heavy large saucepan.  Gradually whisk in corn grits.  Return to boil, whisking constantly.  Reduce heat to low.  Simmer uncovered until grits thicken, whisking often, about 15 minutes.

For Shrimp:  Melt 1/4 cup butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shallots and garlic and sautÈ until tender, about 4 minutes.  Add shrimp and sautÈ 2 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to large bowl.  Add white wine to skillet and boil until reduced to glaze, about 5 minutes.  Add drained diced tomatoes and half of prosciutto and simmer until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.  Add parsley, chives and sautÈed shrimp and simmer until shrimp are warmed through, about 2 minutes.  Thin sauce with some of reserved tomato juices, if desired.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Spoon corn grits into shallow bowls.  Top each serving with shrimp-prosciutto-tomato mixture, dividing equally.  Garnish with remaining prosciutto strips and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 (first-course) or 4 (main-course servings).

Comments:  "During a recent business trip to Birmingham, Alabama, I had dinner at the Hot and Hot Fish Club," writes Shelia Murray of Paradise, California.  "Every bite of chef Chris Hasting's shrimp and grits was packed with flavor.  I'd love to prepare this stand-out dish at home."

For Lemon Glaze:  Whisk powdered sugar and lemon juice in small bowl until smooth.  Spoon lemon glaze over tops of warm muffins, using about 1 tablespoon glaze for each.

Serve muffins warm with whipped cream, if desired, or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 16 gingerbread muffins.

Comments:  "I love cooking with the new recipes every month when Bon AppÈtit arrives," writes Gabriella Hughes of Windham, Maine.  "One dish Iíd really like to make is the gingerbread with lemon icing from Standard Baking Co. in Portland, Maine.  Could you request it?"

Serve these tender gingerbread muffins with whipped cream for teatime or dessert.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 2/3           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  2              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel - (packed)
     1/2           cup  whole milk
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly butter 8 1/2- by 4 1/2- by x2 1/2-inch loaf pan

Stir flour, baking powder and salt in medium bowl to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat 1 cup sugar and butter in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time.  Add grated lemon peel.  Mix in dry ingredients alternately with milk.

Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.  Bake until tester inserted into center of bread comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Meanwhile, combine remaining 1/2 cup sugar and fresh lemon juice in small heavy saucepan and stir over low heat until sugar dissolves.

Transfer lemon bread to rack.  Gradually spoon lemon glaze over hot bread, adding more as glaze is absorbed.  Cool lemon bread completely in pan on rack.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Turn bread out onto rack.  Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  "Whenever we're in the area, my husband and I stop at the Thompson House Eatery in Jackson, New Hampshire," says Sandra L. Michaud of Newtown, Connecticut.  "Iím crazy about the freshly baked lemon bread that sometimes comes with meals there."

This sweet quick bread would make a nice breakfast treat, too.

Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  dried tart cherries
     1/2           cup  tawny Port
  5             ounces  pancetta or bacon -- chopped
  2                     shallots -- minced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/3           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5 1/2         ounces  soft fresh goat cheese log -- cut 1/2"-thk slices
                        = (such as Montrachet)
  1                     bag mixed salad greens - (5 oz)
     1/2           cup  pine nuts -- toasted

Combine cherries and Port in heavy small saucepan.  Bring to simmer over medium heat.  Remove from heat; let stand until cherries swell, about 15 minutes.

SautÈ pancetta in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat until crisp, about 8 minutes.  Add shallots and garlic; cook 2 minutes.  Add oil, then vinegar and sugar; stir until sugar dissolves.  Stir in cherry mixture.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Dressing can be made 2 hours ahead.  Set aside in skillet at room temperature.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place goat cheese slices on rimmed baking sheet.  Bake until warm, about 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, combine salad greens and pine nuts in bowl.  Rewarm dressing and pour over salad; toss to blend.  Top with warm goat cheese and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Gay Koenemann of Bonn, Germany, had dinner at 300 East Boulevard on a recent trip to Charlotte, North Carolina.  There he was treated to the most exquisite salad he'd ever had.  Although the restaurant calls it Fall Salad on the menu, it's enjoyable year-round.

Dried cranberries would make a good alternative to the dried cherries.

  2 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil (preferably extra-virgin) -- plus
     1/4           cup  olive oil (preferably extra-virgin)
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place garlic cloves in small baking dish.  Drizzle 2 tablespoons oil over.  Cover and bake garlic until tender, about 20 minutes.  Uncover; bake until garlic is golden brown, about 10 minutes longer.  Cool.  Peel garlic.

Transfer garlic and oil to processor.  Process until smooth paste forms.  Add vinegar; process until well blended.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Gradually add 1/4 cup oil, whisking until dressing is thick and smooth.  Stir in basil.  Season dressing with salt and pepper.

Cook beans in large pot of boiling salted water until just crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.  Drain; transfer beans to large bowl of ice water.  Drain; pat dry with paper towels.  Toss beans in large bowl with remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Dressing and beans can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and refrigerate.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler.  Grill or broil beans until beginning to brown, turning frequently, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to large bowl.  Add onions and tomatoes.  Toss with enough dressing to coat.  Serve salad at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LEMON CREAM ===
     3/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  unflavored gelatin
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick)
  2        tablespoons  grated lemon peel -- plus
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  3              large  eggs
  3              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
                        === MERINGUES ===
  7              large  egg whites
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  hazelnuts -- toasted, husked,
                        and coarsely chopped
                        === SERVING ===
                        Powdered sugar
                        Blood Orange Syrup -- (see recipe)

For Lemon Cream:  Place 1 tablespoon lemon juice in small bowl; sprinkle gelatin over.  Let stand until gelatin softens, about 10 minutes.  Stir butter, lemon peel and remaining lemon juice in small saucepan over low heat until butter melts.

Whisk eggs, yolks and sugar in medium metal bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in butter mixture.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not let bottom of bowl touch water).  Whisk constantly until mixture is thick and thermometer registers 140 degrees for 3 minutes, about 8 minutes total.  Remove from over water.  Add gelatin mixture to hot lemon curd; whisk until gelatin dissolves.  Chill until curd cools to room temperature, stirring often, about 30 minutes.

Beat cream in large bowl until medium peaks form.  Fold whipped cream into curd.  Cover; chill lemon cream until cold, at least 4 hours and up to 2 days.

For Meringues:  Preheat oven to 275 degrees Line 17- by 11- by 1-inch baking sheet with parchment paper, leaving 1-inch overhang at short ends.  Using electric mixer, beat whites in large bowl to soft peaks.  Gradually add 1 1/4 cups sugar, beating until stiff and glossy.  Fold in nuts.  Spread meringue in prepared pan.

Bake meringue until firm and dry to touch and pale golden, about 1 hour 25 minutes.  Immediately cut around pan sides to loosen.  Pull parchment with meringue onto work surface.  Trim meringue to 14- by 10 1/2-inch rectangle.  Run knife under meringue to loosen from parchment.  Cut meringue lengthwise into three 3 1/2-inch-wide strips.  Cut crosswise into twelve 3 1/2-inch squares.  Cut each square on diagonal, forming total of 24 triangles.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Store in airtight container in single layers between sheets of waxed paper.)

Place 12 meringue triangles on work surface.  Top each with 1/4 cup lemon cream.  Place second triangle on each, pressing slightly to adhere.  Run edge of spatula around assembled meringues to smooth filling at edges.  Sift powdered sugar over.  Transfer each dessert to plate.  Drizzle with Blood Orange Syrup.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  "To celebrate my recent promotion, my sister treated me to dinner at Radius here in Boston," says Jill Thompson, Boston, Massachusetts.  The dessert we shared was unforgettable -- a hazelnut meringue concoction made by pastry chef Paul Connors.  As we polished it off, my sister and I agreed that we had found the cityís best new restaurant."

Each component can be made ahead.

               Individual Maple And Mascarpone Cheesecakes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheesecake                      Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  raw sugar - (about) -- see * Note
  2               cups  pure maple syrup
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  12            ounces  cream cheese -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  4              large  eggs
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/2         pounds  mascarpone cheese -- see * Note
                        Fresh berries -- (optional)
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- (optional)

* Note:  Raw sugar, also called turbinado or demerara sugar, is available at natural foods stores and most supermarkets.  Mascarpone cheese is an Italian cream cheese sold at Italian markets and many supermarkets nationwide.

Butter twelve 3/4-cup custard cups.  Sprinkle raw sugar in each buttered cup, turning to coat bottom and sides and tapping out excess raw sugar.  Arrange prepared custard cups in large roasting pan.

Bring maple syrup to boil in heavy large deep saucepan over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and boil gently until maple syrup is reduced to 1 cup, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes (syrup will bubble vigorously).  Remove saucepan from heat and stir in whipping cream (mixture will bubble up high).  Return saucepan to medium heat and simmer until any crystallized bits dissolve and mixture is reduced to 1 cup, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes.  Cool completely.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar in large bowl until smooth.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time, then beat in vanilla extract.  Add mascarpone cheese and beat just until blended and smooth.  Add cooled maple syrup mixture to cheese mixture and beat until well blended.

Pour batter into prepared custard cups, dividing equally.  Add enough hot water to roasting pan to come halfway up sides of custard cups.  Bake until cheesecakes are light golden on top and centers move slightly when custard cups are gently shaken, about 1 hour.  Cool in water bath 15 minutes.  Remove custard cups from water bath.  Refrigerate uncovered overnight.  (Cheesecakes can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover with plastic wrap and keep refrigerated.)

Run small sharp knife around sides of cheesecakes to loosen.  Place dessert plate atop 1 cheesecake.  Invert cheesecake onto plate; shake gently to release.  Repeat with remaining cheesecakes.  Garnish each with fresh berries and fresh mint sprigs, if desired.  Serve cold.

This recipe yields 12 cakes.

Comments:  "My husband and I recently visited New York with some friends," says Helene M. Strassman of Gaithersburg, Maryland.  "One evening, we had dinner at Babbo.  The whole meal was fantastic, but the best part was the maple and mascarpone cheesecake.  I asked our waiter for the recipe, but he politely refused.  Maybe Bon AppÈtit could persuade pastry chef Gina DePalma to part with it."

Be careful when boiling down the maple syrup for this recipe.  It gets very hot, as a caramel syrup does.  Use a heavy, large, deep saucepan because the syrup bubbles up high and vigorously when boiled.  Let the syrup settle before measuring it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  1 3/4           cups  chilled buttermilk
  9        tablespoons  raspberry, cherry or apricot jam

Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in large bowl to blend.  Freeze flour mixture 1 hour.  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.

Transfer flour mixture to processor.  Add butter and cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Return mixture to large bowl.  Make well in center of mixture.  Add chilled buttermilk and stir just until blended and moist clumps form.  Turn dough out onto floured work surface.

Gather dough together and pat into 1-inch-thick round (do not knead).  Using 2 3/4-inch-diameter biscuit cutter, cut out biscuits.  Transfer buttermilk biscuits to large ungreased baking sheet, spacing 1 1/2 inches apart.  Gather scraps and re-pat to 1-inch thickness, then cut out additional biscuits, for a total of 9.

Insert thumb into center of 1 biscuit, making deep indentation that almost reaches bottom, then push toward sides of biscuit to form 1-inch-diameter hole.  Repeat with remaining biscuits.  Spoon 1 tablespoon jam into each hole.  Bake jam-filled biscuits until golden brown, about 25 minutes.  Serve biscuits warm.

This recipe yields 9 biscuits.

Comments:  "There's a terrific place called Grand Central Cafe and Bakery in Portland, Oregon.  I tried their Jammers, which are luscious buttermilk biscuits filled with jam," says Lori Stiffler of Butte, Montana.

These home-style biscuits look like giant thumbprint cookies.  Freezing the dry ingredients contributes to the biscuits' flakiness.

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly coat 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan with nonstick spray.  Blend flour, sugar and salt in processor to combine.  Cut in butter, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add egg yolks and blend until moist clumps form.  Press mixture onto bottom of prepared pan.  Bake until just beginning to turn golden brown around edges, about 10 minutes.  Remove crust from oven; reduce temperature to 325 degrees.

Meanwhile, prepare Lemon Filling:  Whisk eggs and sugar in large bowl to blend.  Whisk flour and baking powder in medium bowl to blend.  Add flour mixture to egg mixture, whisking to blend.  Whisk in lemon juice and peel.  Immediately pour lemon filling over hot crust; bake until filling is set, about 30 minutes.  Maintain oven temperature.

For Streusel:  Blend flour, 1/2 cup sugar and salt in processor to combine.  Cut in butter, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Sprinkle topping over hot lemon bars; continue to bake until just golden, about 25 minutes longer.  Cool completely.  Sprinkle powdered sugar over.  Cut into bars.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 16 bars.

Comments:  "Here in Seattle, there's a place called 60th Street Desserts that makes fabulous lemon shortbread bars; the cookies are both sweet and tart," says Lucille van der Hagen of Seattle, WA.  "Could you ask Joan Williams, the owner, for the recipe?"

A crumb topping makes a nice addition to the classic bar cookie.  Prepare the filling while the crust is baking; if the crust cools before the lemon filling is poured over it, the filling might seep beneath the crust.

              Lemon-Poppy Seed Waffles With Blueberry Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BLUBERRY SAUCE ===
  1              pound  frozen blueberries -- thawed, undrained
     1/2           cup  apple juice -- plus
  2        tablespoons  apple juice
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
                        === LEMON-POPPY SEED WAFFLES ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  poppy seeds
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/4           cups  buttermilk
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel

For Blueberry Sauce:  Bring blueberries, 1/2 cup apple juice and sugar to boil in heavy medium saucepan.  Simmer over medium heat until reduced to 2 cups, about 15 minutes.  Dissolve 1 tablespoon cornstarch in remaining 2 tablespoons apple juice and add to blueberry mixture.  Add lemon juice.  Bring to boil, stirring constantly; simmer until thick, about 1 minute.  Cool slightly.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm over medium-low heat before serving.)

For Lemon-Poppy Seed Waffles:  Whisk first 6 ingredients in large bowl to blend.  Whisk eggs, buttermilk, melted butter and lemon peel in small bowl to blend.  Add buttermilk mixture all at once to flour mixture and whisk until just blended.  Let mixture stand 15 minutes.

Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturerís instructions.  Spoon batter onto waffle iron.  Cover and cook until golden and cooked through, about 7 minutes (cooking time will vary, depending on waffle iron).  Repeat with remaining batter.  Serve immediately with warm blueberry sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  There are only five employees at The Little Rooster Cafe, a small breakfast and lunch spot, but its terrific food and friendly service make it popular with locals and tourists (especially those who come to browse the townís outlet stores).  Chef and co-owner Hub Poelmann features a different waffle every day.  "We have an open kitchen," he says.  "People smell the waffles cooking, and then order them."  Poelmann credits his cooks with this lemon-poppy seed recipe, which was the happy result of "playing around in the kitchen."

These light waffles would also be good with maple syrup, if you prefer.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3            bottles  clam juice - (8 oz ea)
  1              pound  russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  3             slices  bacon -- finely chopped
  2               cups  chopped onions
  1 1/4           cups  chopped celery with leaves
                        = (abt 2 large stalks)
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  6               cans  chopped clams - (6 1/2 oz ea) -- drained, and
                        juices reserved
  1 1/4           cups  half-and-half
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring bottled clam juice and potatoes to boil in heavy large saucepan over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add bacon and cook until bacon begins to brown, about 8 minutes.  Add onions, celery, garlic and bay leaf and sautÈ until vegetables soften, about 6 minutes.  Stir in flour and cook 2 minutes (do not allow flour to brown).  Gradually whisk in reserved juices from clams.  Add potato mixture, clams, half-and-half and hot pepper sauce.  Simmer chowder 5 minutes to blend flavors, stirring frequently.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.  Bring to simmer before serving.)

This recipe yields 8 (first-course) or 4 (main-course) servings.

Comments:  "Iíve been to Boston many times over the past few years.  During those trips, my mission was to find the best clam chowder in the city," writes Debra Doyle of Avon Lake, Ohio.  "I think I found it at Skipjackís restaurant.  Theirs is rich and creamy, with just the right amount of potatoes."

Skipjackís calls for shucked fresh clams in their chowder; weíve substituted canned clams, which are easier to use.  Serve with oyster crackers, if desired.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whipping cream
  1                cup  milk (do not use low-fat or nonfat)
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  6              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1              pinch  salt

Combine cream, milk and brown sugar in heavy medium saucepan.  Whisk over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves.  Set aside.

Combine 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy large saucepan.  Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; boil without stirring until mixture turns deep amber color, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 10 minutes.

Slowly pour cream mixture into caramel (mixture will bubble vigorously).  Bring to boil, whisking frequently to dissolve any caramel bits.  Remove from heat.

Beat yolks in large bowl.  Whisk in caramel mixture.  Stir in vanilla and salt.  Strain custard.  Skim any air bubbles from surface.  Refrigerate custard until cold, about 3 hours.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Divide custard among six 3/4-cup custard cups.  Place cups in roasting pan.  Add enough hot water to pan to come halfway up sides of cups.  Bake pudding until set in center, about 45 minutes.  Remove cups from pan.  Cool at room temperature 2 hours.  Cover; chill overnight.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep chilled.)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10       tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh thyme
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  1           teaspoon  crushed black pepper
  6                     boneless chicken breast halves with skin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  3            bunches  arugula -- stem ends trimmed
                        Goat Cheese Mashed Potatoes -- (see recipe)

Whisk 6 tablespoons olive oil, thyme, rosemary and pepper in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Add chicken breast halves and turn to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Scrape herb coating off chicken and sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.  Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large ovenproof skillet over high heat.  Place marinated chicken breasts, skin-side down, in skillet.  Sear chicken until crisp and golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Turn chicken and sear 4 minutes on second side.  Transfer skillet to oven and bake until chicken is cooked through, about 6 minutes.

Whisk lemon juice and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in large bowl to blend.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.  Add arugula to dressing in bowl and toss to coat.  Divide Goat Cheese Mashed Potatoes among 6 plates.  Top mashed potatoes with arugula salad, then with chicken breasts.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "For our anniversary, my husband and I went to Fiddle Heads in nearby Buffalo -- a restaurant thatís always our first choice for special occasions," says Noreen Flynn of Kenmore, New York.  "The chicken with mashed potatoes and greens I had last time was terrific; it would even be good enough to serve to guests during the holidays."

Marinate the chicken overnight to make the most of the fresh herbs -- their flavors will infuse the meat, with delicious results.

Comments:  &quot;For our anniversary, my husband and I went to Fiddle Heads in nearby Buffalo -- a restaurant thatís always our first choice for special occasions,&quot; says Noreen Flynn of Kenmore, New York.  &quot;The chicken with mashed potatoes and greens I had last time was terrific; it would even be good enough to serve to guests during the holidays.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
Marinate the chicken overnight to make the most of the fresh herbs -- their flavors will infuse the meat, with delicious results.

                         Polenta With Gorgonzola

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : First Course

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  milk
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  1                cup  polenta (coarse yellow cornmeal) -- see * Note
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  crumbled Gorgonzola cheese -- (abt 6 1/2 oz)
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped lightly-toasted walnuts

* Note:  Polenta (coarse yellow cornmeal) is available at Italian markets, natural foods stores and some supermarkets.  If unavailable, substitute 1 cup regular yellow cornmeal, and cook mixture for about 12 minutes rather than 20 minutes.

Bring milk and whipping cream to boil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Gradually whisk polenta into milk mixture in slow steady stream.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cook polenta until creamy and tender, stirring frequently, about 20 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Preheat broiler.  Transfer cooked polenta to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Sprinkle Gorgonzola cheese over polenta.  Broil until cheese melts.  Sprinkle with chopped toasted walnuts and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 first-course or 6 side-dish servings

Comments:  "We lived in New York for several months, long enough to learn to love the creamy polenta at Union Square Cafe," says Ross and Karen Martin of Pasadena, California.  "If you canít get their recipe, we might need to fly across the country to have the dish again."

This polenta gets its richness from being cooked in a milk-cream mixture instead of the usual water or broth.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PORK ===
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  dried thyme
  2                     pork tenderloins - (3/4 lb ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GORGONZOLA SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  canned low-salt chicken broth
  1                cup  crumbled Gorgonzola cheese - (abt 4 oz)

For Pork:  Oil large rimmed baking sheet.  Whisk Dijon mustard, olive oil and thyme in small bowl to blend.  Sprinkle pork tenderloins with salt and pepper.  Heat heavy large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add pork and sear until brown all over, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Transfer seared pork to prepared baking sheet.  Spread Dijon mustard mixture over all sides of pork.  (Can be prepared up to 2 hours ahead.  Refrigerate pork uncovered.)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Roast pork until thermometer inserted into thickest part of meat registers 150 degrees, about 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and let stand 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare Sauce:  Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat.  Add 1 tablespoon flour and whisk 1 minute.  Gradually whisk in whipping cream, white wine and chicken broth.  Boil until mixture is thick enough to coat spoon, whisking frequently, about 1 minute.  Add crumbled Gorgonzola and whisk until cheese is melted and smooth and sauce is reduced to desired consistency, about 5 minutes.

Slice pork and transfer to plates.  Ladle some sauce over pork.  Serve, passing additional sauce separately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "On a visit to Key West, Florida, I had a superb dinner at Camilleís restaurant," writes Patrick Wessels of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  "I was especially impressed by the creamy Gorgonzola cheese sauce they served over roast pork tenderloin."

For Pork:  Oil large rimmed baking sheet.  Whisk Dijon mustard, olive oil and thyme in small bowl to blend.  Sprinkle pork tenderloins with salt and pepper.  Heat heavy large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add pork and sear until brown all over, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Transfer seared pork to prepared baking sheet.  Spread Dijon mustard mixture over all sides of pork.  (Can be prepared up to 2 hours ahead.  Refrigerate pork uncovered.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Roast pork until thermometer inserted into thickest part of meat registers 150 degrees, about 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and let stand 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, prepare Sauce:  Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat.  Add 1 tablespoon flour and whisk 1 minute.  Gradually whisk in whipping cream, white wine and chicken broth.  Boil until mixture is thick enough to coat spoon, whisking frequently, about 1 minute.  Add crumbled Gorgonzola and whisk until cheese is melted and smooth and sauce is reduced to desired consistency, about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Slice pork and transfer to plates.  Ladle some sauce over pork.  Serve, passing additional sauce separately.

Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  balsamic vinegar
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  6                     portobello mushrooms - (4" dia ea) -- stemmed, and
                        dark gills removed
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     red onions -- sliced (abt 6 cups)
  2              large  red bell peppers
  3        tablespoons  thinly-sliced green onion
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                     sourdough or French-bread baguette -- 3 1/2" dia,
                        cut into 24 slices
                        Additional olive oil
  3                     large bunche arugula - (abt 5 oz) -- coarsely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Rosemary Aioli -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Mix vinegar, honey, brown sugar and thyme in medium bowl.  Transfer 1/2 cup marinade to small bowl; set aside.  Place mushrooms in 15- by 10-inch glass baking dish.  Pour remaining marinade over mushrooms.  Cover baking dish with foil and bake until mushrooms are tender, about 40 minutes.  Transfer mushrooms to work surface; cool.  Cut mushrooms into 1/2-inch-wide slices.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add red onions and sautÈ until very tender and beginning to brown, about 25 minutes.  Pour in reserved 1/2 cup marinade and cook until liquid is absorbed and onions are glazed, about 6 minutes.  Set onions aside.

Char bell peppers over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag and let stand 10 minutes.  Peel, seed and chop peppers.  Place peppers in medium bowl.  Add green onion, basil, garlic and 1 tablespoon oil and toss to combine.  (Mushrooms, onion mixture and bell pepper mixture can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Place bread slices on baking sheet.  Brush bread with additional olive oil.  Bake until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes.

Layer portobello mushroom slices, arugula, onions and then bell pepper mixture atop bread slices.  Bake until heated through, about 3 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Drizzle bruschetta with Rosemary Aioli.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 24.

Comments:  "The bruschetta topped with portobello mushrooms and caramelized onions at Tapas 177 is one of the best things Iíve eaten in this town," writes Laurence Schacht of Rochester, New York.  "Iíd like to re-create this dish at home for my friends."

The restaurant-style results of this recipe are worth the effort.  Use roasted red peppers from a jar instead of roasting fresh ones, if desired, and note the do-ahead steps.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  butternut squash - (abt 2 lbs) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into 1/2" pieces
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6               cups  chicken stock - (about) -- (about)
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  3              large  leeks, white and pale green parts only -- thinly sliced
  2               cups  arborio rice or medium-grain rice
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh sage

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place squash on large rimmed baking sheet.  Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss to coat.  Roast until tender and beginning to brown, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes.

Bring stock to simmer in heavy large saucepan.  Reduce heat to very low; cover and keep stock warm.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in another heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add leeks and sautÈ until soft but not brown, about 10 minutes.  Add rice; stir 1 minute.  Add wine and simmer until absorbed, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes.  Add 1/2 cup hot stock; simmer until absorbed, stirring frequently.  Add remaining stock 1/2 cup at a time, allowing stock to be absorbed before adding more and stirring frequently, until rice is tender and mixture is creamy, about 25 minutes longer.

Add roasted squash, cream, Parmesan cheese and sage; stir until heated through.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 first-course or 4 main-course servings.

Comments:  "I visit Portland, Oregon, frequently because my son is in college there," says Shelly Pearlman of Fairfax, California.  "Of the restaurants we've tried, Bread and Ink Cafe is one of the best.  It's located in a funky part of town not far from the school.  The squash and leek risotto I had for lunch was superb."

Some shaved Parmesan and fresh sage leaves would make an attractive garnish.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  pitted prunes - (1 1/3 cups)
  1 1/3           cups  water
     2/3           cup  Sherry wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  sugar

  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  2          teaspoons  cracked black pepper
  1 1/2         pounds  pork tenderloins

Transfer pork to work surface and slice.  Mix any pan juices from pork into prunes and bring to simmer.  Divide escarole among 6 plates.  Top with pork slices, then prunes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "I had the pleasure of dining at Bacco restaurant during one of my many visits to New Orleans," writes Scott J. Grande of Ormond Beach, Florida.  "Itís run by Ralph Brennan, who is a gracious and accommodating host.  The pork tenderloin on escarole that I had for dinner was delicious; I hope youíll be able to get the recipe for my collection."

Bacco is one of eight New Orleans restaurants run by members of the Brennan family.  At Bacco, this pork tenderloin is served with garlicky mashed potatoes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     garlic cloves
  3                     anchovy fillets
  2        tablespoons  drained capers
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  Cognac
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  6                     salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Blend first 7 ingredients in food processor.  Add butter and process until well blended.  Season to taste with salt.  Lay sheet of plastic wrap on work surface.  Transfer butter mixture to plastic wrap and roll to form 9-inch-long log.  Freeze until firm, about 1 hour.  (Caper-anchovy butter can be prepared 1 week ahead.  Keep frozen.  Let butter soften slightly before using.)

Position oven rack about 6 inches below broiler; preheat broiler.  Place salmon fillets on broiler pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Broil salmon until just cooked through, about 8 minutes.  Transfer to plates.

Cut caper-anchovy butter into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Top each salmon fillet with 2 slices butter (reserve any remaining butter for another use).  Serve salmon fillets hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "I'm addicted to the salmon with caper butter served at Marcello's Ristorante in Suffern, New York," says Anne Bergamo of Harriman, New York.  "I'd love to be able to make the dish for a party -- or just to add a little flair to a weeknight dinner."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  catfish - (1 1/2 to 1 3/4 lbs ea) -- cleaned, gutted
  24                    thin slices peeled fresh ginger (abt 2 oz)
     3/4           cup  rice flour
  1 1/2           cups  peanut oil
                        Black Bean-Soy Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1              large  tomato -- seeded, diced
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  2                     limes -- cut into wedges

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Using knife, make 6 diagonal slits on 1 side of each fish, spacing evenly and cutting to the bone.  Insert 1 ginger slice into each slit.  Turn fish over.  Make 6 diagonal slits on second side of each fish; insert remaining sliced ginger.  Sprinkle catfish with enough rice flour to coat on all sides.

Heat 1 1/2 cups peanut oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until thermometer registers 375 degrees.  Gently slide 1 catfish into skillet and fry until golden and almost cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer to rimmed baking sheet.  Repeat frying with second catfish.

Bake catfish in oven until cooked through and opaque in center, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to platter.  Pour Black Bean-Soy Sauce over.  Garnish platter with tomato, green onions and lime wedges.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Bente Birkedal-Hansen of Bethesda, Maryland, says that Azalea Restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama, does a great job with catfish, serving the whole fish with an Asian-style black bean sauce.  It would make an impressive main course at a dinner party.

If whole catfish are difficult to get at your local supermarket, order them from the fishmonger and have the fish cleaned.  Rice flour is available at Asian markets, specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  green hot pepper sauce
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1                     shallot -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  1                cup  whipping cream
  5               cups  water
  3               cups  whole milk
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  2               cups  corn grits
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  8             ounces  smoked andouille sausage -- sliced
  1                     red bell pepper -- chopped
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- chopped
     1/2           cup  minced onion
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  30                    uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  4                     plum tomatoes -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  Cajun seasoning
  1           teaspoon  Old Bay seasoning
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Corn grits, also known as polenta, are available at Italian markets, natural foods stores and some supermarkets.  If unavailable, substitute 2 cups regular yellow cornmeal, and cook about 30 minutes.  Smoked andouille sausage is a smoked pork-and-beef sausage available at specialty foods stores.  Smoked bratwurst, kielbasa or smoked Hungarian sausage can be substituted.

Combine hot pepper sauce, wine, shallot, lemon juice and vinegar in heavy medium saucepan.  Boil over medium heat until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 15 minutes.  Stir in 1/2 cup cream.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Bring 1/2 cup cream, 5 cups water, milk and butter to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Gradually whisk in grits.  Simmer until grits are very soft and thickened, stirring frequently, about 1 hour.

Meanwhile, heat olive oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add sausage, both bell peppers, onion and garlic; sautÈ until vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes.  Add shrimp, tomatoes, Cajun seasoning and Old Bay seasoning and sautÈ until shrimp are opaque in center, about 6 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Bring hot pepper-cream sauce to simmer.  Spoon grits onto 6 plates, dividing equally.  Spoon shrimp mixture over grits.  Drizzle hot pepper-cream sauce over and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "On a tour of the South, I had dinner at The Boathouse, an outstanding restaurant in Charleston, South Carolina," says Marion Hunt of Valhalla, New York.  "Their spicy shrimp and sausage with grits was my favorite meal of the entire trip."

The creamy grits and spicy sauce create a nice contrast.  Adjust the amount of hot pepper sauce to make the dish as hot as you like.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR SAUCE ===
  4               cups  whipping cream
  2               cups  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
                        === FOR CAKE ===
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1 1/4           cups  chopped pitted dates
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  sugar
  4              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract

Make Sauce:   Bring cream, brown sugar and butter to boil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring frequently.  Reduce heat and simmer sauce until reduced to 3 1/2 cups, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes.  Set aside.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, before using.)

Make Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 12-cup Bundt pan.  Whisk flour and baking powder in medium bowl to blend; set aside.  Combine 1 1/2 cups water, dates and baking soda in another heavy medium saucepan and bring to boil.  Remove from heat; cool completely.

Using electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time.  Mix in vanilla and half of flour mixture, then date mixture.  Blend in remaining flour mixture.  Pour batter into prepared pan.

Bake until cake rises and is golden on top, about 45 minutes.  Pour 3/4 cup caramel sauce over cake; continue baking until tester inserted near center of cake comes out with no crumbs (only caramel sauce) attached, about 15 minutes.  Cool in pan 10 minutes.  Invert cake onto platter.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cool completely.  Wrap cake airtight and store at room temperature.  Cover remaining caramel sauce and refrigerate.  Rewarm sauce over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, before using.)

Cut cake into slices; drizzle caramel sauce over each slice.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  This type of dish is common in England, where all desserts are called puddings.

               Sweet-Potato Ravioli With Sage Butter Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : First Course                    Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RAVIOLI ===
  2                     red-skinned sweet potatoes -- yams - (16 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick) -- room temperature
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1            package  wonton wrappers - (12 oz)
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
                        === FRIED SHALLOTS AND SAUCE ===
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  4              large  shallots -- cut crosswise
                        into thin rounds, separated into rings
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
  8              large  fresh sage leaves -- thinly sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
     1/3           cup  pine nuts -- toasted

For Ravioli:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Oil rimmed baking sheet.  Cut sweet potatoes in half lengthwise; place cut-side down on baking sheet.  Roast until tender, about 35 minutes; cool.  Scoop potato pulp out of skins into small bowl.  Spoon 1 1/3 cups pulp into medium bowl.  (Reserve any remaining potato pulp for another use.)  Add sugar and butter; mash well.  Season filling with salt and pepper.

Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Place wonton wrappers on work surface.  Using pastry brush, brush wrappers with beaten egg.  Place 1/2 tablespoon sweet-potato filling in center of each.  Fold each wrapper diagonally over filling, forming triangle.  Seal edges.  Transfer to parchment-lined baking sheet.  Let stand at room temperature while preparing fried shallots and sauce.  (Can be made up to 5 days ahead.  Freeze, then cover and keep frozen.  Do not thaw before cooking.)

For Fried Shallots And Sauce:  Heat vegetable oil in heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Working in 2 batches, fry shallots until crisp and dark brown, about 2 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer shallots to paper-towel-lined plate to drain.  Cook butter in large pot over medium heat until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Add sage and red pepper.

Meanwhile, working in batches, cook ravioli in pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain well.  Add ravioli to pot with butter sauce; toss to coat.  Transfer to plates, drizzling any sauce from pot over ravioli.  Top with fried shallots and pine nuts; serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 (first-course) or 4 (main-course) servings.

Comments:  At the restaurant, the ravioli dough is made in-house.  We used purchased wonton wrappers instead, making the recipe faster and easier.  Note that the ravioli can be assembled ahead of time and frozen.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  eggs
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
  5        tablespoons  brandy
  1 1/2         pounds  mascarpone cheese -- see * Note
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/2           cup  instant espresso powder
     3/4           cup  chilled whipping cream
  44                    crisp Italian ladyfinger cookies - (about) -- see * Note
                        = (from two 7-oz packages)
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
     1/4           cup  powdered sugar

* Note:  Mascarpone cheese is available at Italian markets and many supermarkets.  Ladyfinger cookies are available at Italian markets and some supermarkets.

Fill large bowl with ice water.  Whisk eggs and 1/3 cup sugar in medium metal bowl set over saucepan of simmering water.  Whisk constantly until thermometer registers 160 degrees, about 10 minutes.  Set custard over bowl of ice water and whisk until cool.  Mix in brandy.  Whisk mascarpone in another large bowl to loosen.  Fold in custard.

Bring 1 1/2 cups water to simmer in medium saucepan.  Add 1 cup sugar and espresso powder; whisk until sugar dissolves.  Mix in cream.  Refrigerate until cold.

Submerge 3 cookies in chilled espresso-cream mixture for 5 seconds.  Place cookies on bottom of 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish.  Working in batches, repeat with enough remaining cookies to just cover bottom of dish.  Spread half of mascarpone mixture over cookies.  Repeat soaking process with remaining cookies, placing them in single layer atop mascarpone mixture.  Spread remaining mascarpone mixture over cookies.  Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours.

Whisk cocoa and powdered sugar in small bowl to blend.  Sift sweetened cocoa over top of dessert.  Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  "During parents' weekend at Bowdoin College here in Brunswick, a group of us went to Rachel's Wood Grill, a restaurant in nearby Portland," says Jennifer Buechner of Brunswick, Maine.  "Dinner was great, but the tiramis˘ we had for dessert was out of this world.  I'd love to serve it for a graduation dinner."

Comments:  &quot;During parents&apos; weekend at Bowdoin College here in Brunswick, a group of us went to Rachel&apos;s Wood Grill, a restaurant in nearby Portland,&quot; says Jennifer Buechner of Brunswick, Maine.  &quot;Dinner was great, but the tiramis˘ we had for dessert was out of this world.  I&apos;d love to serve it for a graduation dinner.&quot;

To crush the toasted nuts, seal them in a plastic bag, and pound with a rolling pin.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dried Great Northern beans
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1                cup  chopped leek, white and pale green parts
  1              large  tomato -- seeded, chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped carrots
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
  8                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  3                     bacon slices -- chopped
  10 1/2          cups  chicken stock -- or more if needed
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        White truffle oil -- (optional)

Place beans in heavy large pot.  Add enough water to cover beans by 2 inches.  Soak overnight.  Drain beans.

Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onion, leek, tomato, carrots, celery, garlic and bacon and sautÈ until vegetables are tender, about 6 minutes.  Add beans, 10 1/2 cups chicken stock, chopped thyme and rosemary.  Bring soup to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until beans are very tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.

Working in batches, puree soup in blender until smooth.  Return soup to pot.  Add 1/2 cup whipping cream.  Add more chicken stock by 1/4 cupfuls to thin soup, if desired.  Season soup to taste with salt and pepper.

Ladle soup into 8 bowls.  Lightly drizzle top of each with white truffle oil, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 first-course servings.

Comments:  "On my last birthday, I enjoyed a special dinner at Brasserie Le Coze in Atlanta," says Diane Sullivan of Alpharetta, Georgia.  "The entire meal was fabulous, but the white bean soup with truffle oil was absolutely divine."

White truffle oil, should you happen to have a bottle of it, is a delicious "garnish" for this rich and hearty soup.  White truffle oil is available at Italian markets, specialty foods stores and some supermarkets nationwide.
