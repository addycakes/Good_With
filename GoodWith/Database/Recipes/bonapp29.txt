  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  6        tablespoons  chilled pure vegetable shortening -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1                cup  coarsely-grated sharp cheddar cheese - -- (firmly packed)
  5        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
  6                     Jonathan, Jonagold, or Golden
                        Delicious apples - (6 to 7 oz ea) -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- diced

For Crust:  Place flour, sugar, and salt in processor; blend 5 seconds.  Add butter and shortening.  Using on/off turns, blend until mixture resembles fine meal.  Add cheese; mix in using 4 on/off turns.  Transfer dry ingredients to large bowl.  Sprinkle 5 tablespoons water over.  Using fork, toss until moist clumps form, adding more water by tablespoonfuls if mixture is dry.  Gather dough into ball; divide in half.  Shape each half into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Mix sugar and cornstarch in large bowl.  Mix in apples, lemon juice, and salt.

Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer dough to 9-inch-diameter deep-dish glass pie dish; brush overhang with water.  Transfer filling to dough-lined dish; dot with butter.  Roll out second dough disk on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round.  Place dough atop filling.  Press overhang of bottom and top dough pieces together to seal.  Trim overhang to 1/2 inch.  Fold overhang under; crimp decoratively, forming high-standing rim.  Cut several small slits in top crust to allow steam to escape.

Bake pie until golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Cover crust edge with foil.  Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees.  Bake pie until filling bubbles thickly in center, about 30 minutes.  Cool pie on rack 1 hour.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1 1/2           cups  pitted dates -- sliced
  1                cup  Caramelized Walnuts -- (see recipe)
  4              large  shallots -- minced

Boil balsamic vinegar in small saucepan over medium-high heat until syrupy and reduced to 1/4 cup, about 4 minutes.

Whisk oil and Champagne vinegar in bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Keep at room temperature.  Rewarm balsamic syrup before using.  Rewhisk vinaigrette before using.)

Toss arugula, apples, half of cheese, dates, walnuts, and shallots in large bowl with enough vinaigrette to coat.  Season salad with salt and pepper.

Mound salad in center of each plate.  Drizzle balsamic syrup around salads.  Sprinkle remaining cheese atop salads.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Linda Forst of Mukilteo, Washington, writes: "I attended a conference in Anaheim, California, and went to dinner at Catal Restaurant & Uva Bar in Downtown Disney.  The whole meal was outstanding, especially the 'compressed salad.'"

For a "compressed" presentation, the chef uses a three-inch ring mold to mound the salad in the center of each plate.  You can use a cleaned-out can, with top and bottom removed, as a mold.

  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
     1/3           cup  dried Bing cherries - (packed)
     1/3           cup  pitted prunes - (packed) -- halved
  1 1/4         pounds  Braeburn apples -- peeled, cored,
                        andcut into 1/2" cubes
     1/3           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
                        === STRUDEL ===
     2/3           cup  hazelnuts -- toasted, husked
     1/2           cup  graham cracker crumbs
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  9                     sheets fresh phyllo pastry (17" by 12") or -- thawed
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- melted
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

* Brown star-shaped seedpods sold at Asian markets and specialty foods stores and in the spice section of some supermarkets.

For Sauce:  Boil juice in small saucepan until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 6 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and let stand 1 minute; whisk until melted and smooth.  Stir in brandy and vanilla.  (Sauce can be prepared 4 days ahead.  Cover and chill.  Rewarm before serving.)

For Filling:  Combine 1 cup juice, wine, star anise, and cinnamon in large saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Bring to simmer.  Remove from heat.  Cover; let stand 10 minutes.  Add cherries and prunes.  Cover and simmer until fruit is plump, about 5 minutes.  Discard star anise, cinnamon, and vanilla bean.  Mix in apples and sugar; simmer until apples are tender but hold shape and liquid is reduced to 3 tablespoons, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.

Mix cornstarch and 2 tablespoons apple juice.  Add to filling; stir over medium-high heat until filling thickens and boils, about 3 minutes.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cool slightly, cover, and chill.)

For Strudel:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly butter heavy large baking sheet.  Blend first 3 ingredients in processor until nuts are finely ground.

Place dry kitchen towel on work surface.  Place 1 phyllo sheet on towel (cover remaining phyllo with plastic wrap and damp towel).  Brush phyllo lightly with melted butter.  Top with second phyllo sheet; brush with butter.  Sprinkle with scant 3 tablespoons nut mixture.  Continue with 6 more phyllo sheets, brushing each with butter and sprinkling with scant 3 tablespoons nut mixture.  Top with remaining phyllo sheet.  Brush with butter.  Spoon filling atop phyllo stack in 12- by 3-inch log, starting 2 inches from 1 long side and 2 1/2 inches from each short side.  Fold short edges over filling.  Using towel as aid and beginning at edge close to filling, roll up strudel jelly-roll style.  Place strudel, seam-side down, on prepared baking sheet.  Brush strudel with butter.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Chill.)

Bake strudel uncovered until golden, about 45 minutes.  Let cool at least 30 minutes.  Cut warm or room-temperature strudel into slices; place on plates.  Serve with ice cream and warm chocolate sauce.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                    Beef Short Ribs With Asian Flavors

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped onions
  1                cup  beef broth
  12                    meaty 2" to 3"-long beef short ribs - -- (abt 4 lbs)
  3        tablespoons  hoisin sauce
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  oriental sesame oil
  1                cup  pitted large prunes - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        Chopped green onions
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Pressure cooker

Combine onions and broth in 6- to 8-quart pressure cooker.  Place ribs in large bowl.  Add hoisin sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil; toss to coat evenly.  Transfer ribs and all juices from bowl to cooker.  Scatter prunes over.  Lock lid in place.  Bring to high pressure over high heat.  Cook 35 minutes, adjusting heat as necessary to maintain high pressure.  Remove from heat.  Let pressure come down naturally, about 20 minutes.

Slowly release lid, standing back and allowing steam to escape.  If ribs are not tender, lock on lid, return cooker to high pressure, and cook 5 minutes longer.  Remove from heat.  Let pressure come down naturally.

Using slotted spoon, transfer ribs and prunes to large shallow bowl.  Tent with foil to keep warm.  Tilt cooker; spoon 1 tablespoon fat into small bowl and reserve.  Spoon off remaining fat and discard.  Mix flour into reserved 1 tablespoon fat to form smooth paste.  Bring sauce in cooker to boil; whisk in flour paste.  Boil until sauce thickens, whisking often, about 1 minute.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour sauce over ribs; sprinkle with green onions and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Look for hoisin sauce and oriental sesame oil in the Asian foods section of the supermarket.  Steamed rice is the perfect side.

Slowly release lid, standing back and allowing steam to escape.  If ribs are not tender, lock on lid, return cooker to high pressure, and cook 5 minutes longer.  Remove from heat.  Let pressure come down naturally.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using slotted spoon, transfer ribs and prunes to large shallow bowl.  Tent with foil to keep warm.  Tilt cooker; spoon 1 tablespoon fat into small bowl and reserve.  Spoon off remaining fat and discard.  Mix flour into reserved 1 tablespoon fat to form smooth paste.  Bring sauce in cooker to boil; whisk in flour paste.  Boil until sauce thickens, whisking often, about 1 minute.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour sauce over ribs; sprinkle with green onions and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  Look for hoisin sauce and oriental sesame oil in the Asian foods section of the supermarket.  Steamed rice is the perfect side.

  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1                cup  water
  1 1/2         pounds  frozen unsweetened blackberries -- thawed, and

     1/2         small  watermelon
  16                    fresh blackberries

Stir sugar and 1 cup water in small saucepan.  Bring to boil over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Boil 1 minute.  Transfer syrup to large bowl.  Chill until syrup is cold, about 3 hours.

Working in batches, puree blackberries with juices and cold syrup in blender until smooth.  Strain into another large bowl; discard seeds.  Stir in lemon juice.

Process berry mixture in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer sorbet to container; cover and freeze until firm, about 6 hours.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Keep frozen.)

Using large spoon, scoop out flesh from watermelon, leaving rind intact and forming bowl (reserve melon for another use or serve alongside sorbet, if desired).  Drain excess juice from watermelon bowl.  Cover and chill watermelon bowl until cold.

Comments:  Berries are cultivated near the small colonial town of Valle de Bravo, outside Mexico City.  Sorbets and ice creams are enormously popular throughout Mexico.

                    Broiled Tuna With Rosemary Butter

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  country-style Dijon mustard
  4                     ahi tuna fillets, abt 1 1/2" thick - -- (6 oz ea)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  4                     diagonal 1/2"-thick slices sourdough
                        baguette

Mix butter, rosemary, and mustard in small dish.  Season with salt and pepper.

Preheat broiler.  Brush tuna on both sides with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Spread some rosemary butter on 1 side of each baguette slice.  Broil tuna to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium.  Broil baguette slices until beginning to brown, about 1 minute per side.  Top each tuna fillet with dollop of rosemary butter.  Serve with baguette slices.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serve With:  Couscous with lentils.  Dessert:  Purchased lemon cheesecake.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  Tuna dries out if it is overcooked, so many people prefer this meaty fish still slightly pink in the center.  Check doneness by using a sharp knife to make a small cut in the center of the fillets.

Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MAPLE SYRUP APPLES ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  3              large  Golden Delicious apples - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2"-thick slices
  1         tablespoon  pure maple syrup -- plus
     1/2           cup  pure maple syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        === PANCAKES ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  yellow cornmeal
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  buttermilk
  1                cup  plain whole-milk yogurt
  1              large  egg
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        Additional unsalted butter
                        Additional pure maple syrup

For Maple Syrup Apples:  Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add apples and 1 tablespoon maple syrup; sautÈ until apples are tender, about 5 minutes.  Mix in remaining 1/2 cup maple syrup and cinnamon.

For Pancakes:  Combine first 6 ingredients in large bowl; whisk to blend.  Whisk buttermilk, yogurt, and egg in medium bowl to blend; add to dry ingredients and stir until just blended but still lumpy.  Gently mix in 1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter.

Heat griddle or large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Spread thin coating of butter over griddle and let melt.  Working in batches, drop batter by 1/3 cupfuls onto griddle, spacing apart.  Cook pancakes until brown on bottom and bubbles form on top, about 3 minutes.  Turn pancakes over and cook until bottoms are brown and pancakes are barely firm to touch.  Transfer to plates.  Repeat with remaining batter, adding more butter to griddle as needed.

Spoon apples over pancakes.  Serve, passing additional maple syrup.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  These delicious pancakes are light and moist; the texture is a cross between a crepe and a pancake.  Avoid overmixing the batter (it's okay if there are lumps) to ensure that the pancakes will be airy.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Antoinette writes; "My business partner and I own a company that makes costumes for the film industry.  When we are involved in a huge project ó as we were with Minority Report and X2 ó we work very long days, and sometimes even on weekends.  So I don't have much time to cook or even to go out for lunch or dinner.  That's when my no-fiddling cooking style comes in handy.  I cut corners when I can ó without sacrificing flavor.  I prepare all-vegetarian meals, using the freshest ingredients from the farmers' market, and I really get a kick out of seeing people come over to my house and not miss the meat one bit."

                         Butterscotch Drop Scones

Recipe By     :Toni Cascio of Owings Mills, MD
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- diced
  1                cup  butterscotch chips - (abt 6 oz)
     1/2           cup  chilled whipping cream -- or more if needed
  1              large  egg

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Sift all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into medium bowl.  Add chilled butter; using fingertips, rub in until coarse meal forms.  Mix in chips.

Whisk 1/2 cup cream and egg in small bowl to blend.  Gradually add cream mixture to dry ingredients, tossing with fork until dough comes together in moist clumps.  Add more cream by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.

Drop dough by 1/4 cupfuls onto large rimmed baking sheet, spacing apart.  Bake scones until golden brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 14 scones.

Comments:  Toni writes; "Cooking and traveling are two of my greatest pleasures.  I went to Ireland several years ago and had such marvelous scones that I just had to re-create them at home."

This is a great scone recipe, and it works even without the butterscotch chips.  One cup of dried berries, chocolate chips, shredded coconut, or dried cherries can be substituted, if you like.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  powdered sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt - (scant)
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
  10       tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
  2        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  whipping cream
                        = (do not use heavy whipping cream)
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  forest honey or other honey
     3/4           cup  coarsely-chopped walnuts - (scant 4 oz) -- toasted
     3/4           cup  sliced almonds - (abt 3 oz) -- toasted
     3/4           cup  shelled unsalted natural pistachios -- toasted
                        = (a scant 4 oz)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  rose water*

* Available at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and Middle Eastern markets.

For Crust:  Blend flour, powdered sugar, salt, and ground cloves in processor.  Add butter and orange peel.  Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 2 tablespoons ice water and process until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if mixture is dry.  Transfer dough to 10- to 10 1/2-inch tart pan with removable bottom.  Press dough evenly onto bottom and up sides of pan.  Freeze crust 25 minutes.

Meanwhile, Prepare Filling:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine cream, both sugars, and honey in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Continue to boil until mixture darkens and thickens slightly, about 4 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in all nuts and rose water.  Spoon filling evenly into crust.

Bake tart until filling is caramel brown and bubbling thickly and crust is golden, about 38 minutes.  Transfer tart to rack and cool completely in pan.  Carefully remove pan sides from tart.  Place tart on platter.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Cover and store at room temperature.)  Cut tart into wedges and serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  This candy-like tart with hints of rose, orange, and cloves was inspired by the delicate flavor of baklava.  Serve it on its own or with honey-sweetened strained plain yogurt.

Bring to simmer before continuing.)  Add chicken, 1 cup green onions, and 1/2 cup cilantro; simmer 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Ladle chowder into bowls; sprinkle with remaining 1 cup green onions and 2 tablespoons cilantro.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  Purchased roast chicken and frozen corn kernels simplify the preparation.  Serve the chowder first, then a variety of grilled sausages with the mixed-greens salad and corn bread alongside.  Kids will likely prefer the Pastry-Wrapped Sausages (see recipe) over plain grilled ones.

              Chicken Shiraz With Porcini And Whole Shallots

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  low-salt chicken broth - (14 oz)
  1              ounce  dried porcini mushrooms*
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  3             ounces  pancetta** -- chopped
  4              large  chicken breast halves with skin and bones -- halved crosswise
  3                     chicken thighs with skin and bones
  3                     chicken drumsticks with skin and bones
  6              whole  shallots
  10            ounces  crimini (baby bella) mushrooms -- halved
     1/3           cup  chopped shallots
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  Shiraz
                        = (or other hearty dry red wine)
                        Chopped fresh Italian parsley

* Available in the produce section of many supermarkets and at specialty foods stores and Italian markets.

** An Italian bacon cured in salt; available in the refrigerated deli case of many supermarkets and at Italian markets.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Bring broth and porcini mushrooms to boil in small saucepan.  Remove from heat and let stand at room temperature until mushrooms soften, about 25 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to cutting board and chop coarsely.  Pour mushroom broth into medium bowl, leaving sediment behind.  Reserve broth.

Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large ovenproof pot over medium heat.  Add pancetta and cook until crisp and brown, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to paper towels to drain.  Sprinkle all chicken pieces with salt and pepper.  Working in batches, add chicken to pot and cook over medium-high heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer chicken to platter.

Pour off all but 3 tablespoons drippings from pot.  Add whole shallots to pot.  Cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.  Add crimini mushrooms.  Cook until mushrooms begin to brown, stirring frequently, about 6 minutes.  Stir in chopped shallots, thyme, garlic, and reserved porcini mushrooms; cook until chopped shallots are soft, about 2 minutes.  Stir flour into shallot mixture and continue stirring 1 minute.  Stir in wine, reserved mushroom broth, and pancetta.  Add chicken thighs and drumsticks to pot.  Bring to boil.

Cover pot and transfer to oven.  Bake 25 minutes.  Add chicken breasts to pot.  Cover and bake until all chicken is cooked through, about 45 minutes longer.  Using slotted spoon, transfer chicken to platter; tent with foil to keep warm.

Boil sauce in pot until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.  Pour sauce over chicken on platter, sprinkle with parsley, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A rustic one-pot meal that's similar to the classic French coq au vin.  Two kinds of wild mushrooms add earthy flavor.

                Chicken With Truffles And Champagne Sauce

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1                     chicken - (3 3/4 lbs) -- cut into 8 pieces
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  minced shallots
  2               cups  Champagne
                        = (or sparkling white wine)
  1                     bay leaf
  8             ounces  green beans -- halved crosswise,
                        then lengthwise
  2               cups  matchstick-size pieces celery root - -- (abt 8 oz)
  1 1/4           cups  matchstick-size pieces carrots - -- (from 1 large)
  3              large  egg yolks
  1              small  black truffle -- (optional), cut
                        into matchstick-size pieces

Whisk flour, salt, and pepper in shallow bowl.  Coat chicken pieces in seasoned flour; transfer to rack.  Let stand 15 minutes.  Coat with flour again; return to rack.

Melt butter with oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Working in batches, add chicken and sautÈ until brown, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer chicken to plate.  Add shallots to skillet and sautÈ until golden, about 2 minutes.  Add Champagne and bay leaf and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Return chicken and any accumulated juices to skillet.  Cover and simmer until chicken is just cooked through, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook green beans in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to bowl of ice water.  Cool quickly, then transfer beans to paper towels to drain.  Return water to boil.  Add celery root and carrots and boil 1 minute.  Drain; transfer vegetables to ice water to cool quickly, then transfer to paper towels to drain.  Pat all vegetables dry.

Transfer chicken to platter; tent with foil to keep warm.  Place egg yolks in small bowl.  Gradually whisk in 3 tablespoons chicken cooking liquid.  Place same skillet over medium-low heat.  Whisk in yolk mixture.  Cook until sauce begins to thicken, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes (do not allow mixture to boil).  Add vegetables and truffle, if desired, to sauce and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes.  Spoon sauce with vegetables around and over chicken and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

What To Drink:  Champagne, of course.

Comments:  A dish that's refined yet spirited, much like the bubbly that has made the region so celebrated.  For a first course, serve steamed leeks bathed in a simple vinaigrette.

<DirT>
What To Drink:  Champagne, of course.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  A dish that&apos;s refined yet spirited, much like the bubbly that has made the region so celebrated.  For a first course, serve steamed leeks bathed in a simple vinaigrette.

                          Chocolate-Kahlua Flans

Recipe By     :Ana Garcia, Cuernavaca, Mexico
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  sweetened condensed milk - (14 oz)
  1                can  evaporated milk - (12 oz)
  3             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  cream cheese - (1 oz) -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  Kahl˙a
                        = (or other coffee liqueur)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              large  pinch salt
  3              large  eggs -- beaten to blend

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Arrange six 3/4-cup custard cups in 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan.  Combine condensed milk and evaporated milk in medium saucepan and bring to simmer, stirring often.  Remove from heat; add chocolate, cream cheese, Kahl˙a, cinnamon, and salt.  Whisk until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.  Whisk in eggs.

Divide flan mixture among custard cups.  Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of cups.  Bake flans until set in center, about 35 minutes.  Remove flans from water bath and chill uncovered until very cold and firm, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Ana writes; "My great-grandmother, Josefina, was a highly regarded butcher, and she taught me the communal style of cooking that Mexico is known for.  That's one of the reasons I opened my own cooking school, La Villa Bonita ó to show others how authentic Mexican cuisine is prepared, as opposed to the usual tacos, burritos, and Tex-Mex dishes.

"My husband, Robb, and I also run our own restaurant, Reposado.  He insisted that we open the place because he thought my recipes deserved a wider audience.  At the restaurant I like to experiment ó the menu at Reposado is nouvelle Mexican ó but at my cooking school I feature more traditional recipes.  Working at both places gives me the chance to show off both cooking styles. "

Unlike the classic delicate flans, these are made with condensed milk and cream cheese, which results in a rich texture.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/4           cup  frozen solid vegetable shortening -- cut 1/2" cubes
  3        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
     1/2      teaspoon  apple cider vinegar
                        === FILLING ===
  3 1/4         pounds  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced 1/4" thick
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === TOPPING ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

For Crust:  Mix flour, salt, and sugar in large bowl.  Add butter and shortening; rub in with fingertips until coarse meal forms.  Mix 3 tablespoons ice water and vinegar in small bowl to blend.  Drizzle over flour mixture; stir with fork until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic; refrigerate 30 minutes.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Trim overhang to 1/2 inch; turn edge under and crimp decoratively.  Refrigerate while preparing filling and topping.

For Filling:  Mix all ingredients in large bowl to coat apples.

For Topping:  Blend first 5 ingredients in processor.  Add chilled butter cubes; using on/off turns, cut in until mixture resembles wet sand.

Toss filling to redistribute juices; transfer to crust, mounding in center.  Pack topping over and around apples.  Bake pie on baking sheet until topping is golden, about 40 minutes (cover top with foil if browning too quickly).  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Bake until apples in center are tender when pierced and filling is bubbling thickly at edges, about 45 minutes longer.  Cool until warm, about 1 hour.  Serve with ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A thick layer of finely textured crumb topping crowns a tall mound of apple filling.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  water -- plus
     1/4           cup  water
  1 3/4           cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  sweetened flaked coconut
  1                can  unsweetened coconut milk - (13.5 oz)
  1                cup  whole milk
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  8              large  egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  triple sec

Whisk oil and 1 tablespoon water in small bowl to blend.  Brush inside of eight 3/4-cup custard cups or ramekins with oil mixture.  Combine 1 cup sugar and remaining 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling occasionally, about 9 minutes.  Immediately divide caramel among prepared custard cups.  Using oven mitts, tilt each custard cup to coat bottom with caramel.  Place cups in large roasting pan.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spread coconut on baking sheet.  Toast in oven until light golden, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Maintain oven temperature.

Combine coconut milk and milk in another medium saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Bring to boil.  Remove from heat.  Cover; steep 10 minutes.  Remove vanilla bean.  Using electric mixer, beat egg yolks and 3/4 cup sugar in large bowl until thick and pale, about 4 minutes.  Gradually whisk hot milk mixture into egg mixture.  Whisk in triple sec.  Stir in 1/2 cup toasted coconut.

Divide custard among caramel-lined custard cups.  Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of custard cups.  Bake until custards are almost set and move only slightly when cups are shaken gently, about 50 minutes.  Remove custards from water.  Cool slightly.  Chill uncovered overnight.

Run small sharp knife around custards to loosen.  To unmold each custard, place plate atop custard cup.  Firmly grasp custard cup and plate and invert, shaking gently and allowing custard to settle on plate.  Sprinkle custards with remaining 1/4 cup toasted coconut and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This classic Iberian dessert was introduced by the Spaniards.  In the version above, coconut, which thrives in the Pacific coast state of Colima, flavors the flans.  Begin making them one day ahead; they must chill overnight before serving.

  1              pound  fingerling or baby Dutch yellow potatoes -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/4"-thick rounds
     1/2           cup  water
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme

Using slotted spoon, transfer 1 cod fillet to each of 6 bowls.  Ladle chowder over fish and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This bouillabaisse-style chowder has a delicate broth and whole fish fillets.

                Coffee-Braised Short Ribs With Ancho Chile

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  5             pounds  flanken-style 1"-thick short ribs
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1              large  red bell pepper -- chopped
  1              large  jalapeÒo -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  ancho chile powder*
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
  1 1/4      teaspoons  ground cumin
  2               cups  strong freshly-brewed coffee
                        = (not espresso or dark roast)
  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (14 1/2 oz)
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
                        Chopped fresh cilantro

* Available in the spice section of most supermarkets and at Latin markets.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle short ribs with salt and pepper.  Working in batches, add ribs to pot and cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer to platter.

Add onion, red bell pepper, and jalapeÒo to drippings in pot.  Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until onion is tender, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes.  Stir in garlic and sautÈ uncovered 1 minute.  Add brown sugar, ancho chile powder, oregano, and cumin; stir 15 seconds.  Stir in coffee, tomatoes with juice, and tomato paste.  Bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Return ribs and any juices to pot; bring to boil.

Cover and bake until meat is very tender, about 1 hour 45 minutes.  Spoon fat from surface of sauce.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm, covered, over medium heat before continuing.)

Transfer ribs to platter.  Spoon sauce over and sprinkle with chopped cilantro.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Relish each step of preparing coffee- and chile-braised short ribs.  Searing a brown crust on the ribs before they bake adds a deep caramelized flavor; sautÈing the aromatics (onions, peppers, garlic) in the drippings makes the sauce base really fragrant.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  warm filtered or spring water -- (105 to 115 degrees)
     3/4           cup  Proto-Dough -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  buttermilk
     3/4      teaspoon  instant or rapid-rise yeast
  3 1/3           cups  bread flour - (or more) -- divided
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
                        Cornmeal -- as needed

Mix first 4 ingredients in bowl of heavy-duty mixer.  Add 2 cups flour; stir to blend.  Cover bowl with kitchen towel.  Let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.

Using dough hook, mix in 1 1/3 cups flour and salt at lowest setting.  Increase speed slightly; knead dough 5 minutes, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls if dough sticks to sides of bowl.  Let dough rest 15 minutes.  Knead on low 5 minutes.  Scrape dough from hook into bowl.  Remove bowl from stand.  Coat rubber spatula with nonstick spray.  Slide spatula under and around dough, coating dough lightly.  Cover bowl with kitchen towel.  Let dough rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Turn dough out onto floured surface and fold over on itself several times to flatten.  Divide in half.  Shape each half into 4- by 8-inch rectangle.  Make 1 shallow lengthwise slash down each.

Sprinkle large rimmed baking sheet with cornmeal.  Space loaves on sheet 3 inches apart.  Dust tops with flour.  Cover with plastic; let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Place 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan on bottom of oven.  Position rack at lowest level of oven; preheat to 500 degrees.  Place bread in oven.  Quickly pour 1/2 cup water into metal pan; close oven door.  Bake 5 minutes.  Add 1/2 cup water to pan.  Quickly close door; reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees.  Bake loaves until puffed and golden, about 20 minutes.  Transfer to rack; cool 15 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 2 loaves.

Comments:  The longer you wait to use the proto-dough, the tangier the bread will be.

                        Fig And Rosemary Pot Roast

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dry white wine
  1            package  dried Calimyrna figs - (8 oz) -- stemmed, and
                        halved lengthwise
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     blade-end or center-cut 6-rib
                        pork loin roast -- chine bone removed,
                        and ribs cracked
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1             medium  carrot -- peeled, chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                can  low-salt chicken broth - (14 oz)
  1         tablespoon  butter -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Bring wine and figs to boil in small saucepan.  Remove from heat and let stand until figs soften, about 15 minutes.  Drain figs, reserving wine and figs separately.

Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large ovenproof pot over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper.  Add pork to pot and cook until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes total.  Transfer pork to platter.

Add onion and carrot to same pot.  Cover and reduce heat to medium-low.  Cook until onion is golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Stir in rosemary and garlic; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add broth and reserved wine.

Return pork to pot, meat-side down.  Bring to boil.  Cover and transfer to oven.  Bake until thermometer inserted into center of roast registers 150 degrees, adding figs during last 10 minutes of roasting, about 1 1/2 hours.

Transfer pork to cutting board.  Using slotted spoon, transfer figs to small bowl.  Tent pork and figs with foil to keep warm.  Spoon fat from surface of sauce.  Bring sauce to boil.  Stir butter and flour in medium bowl to blend.  Whisk 1 cup sauce and mustard into butter mixture.  Whisk mustard-butter mixture into sauce in pot.  Boil sauce until thickened and slightly reduced, about 8 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Transfer pork to platter, surround with figs, and pour sauce over.  Carve pork between rib bones.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Market Tip:  You can use a center-cut pork loin roast (the most commonly available cut), but for more succulent meat, ask your butcher for a six-rib blade-end pork loin roast, which is fattier and a bit moister after braising.  This cut isn't stocked by many markets, so be sure to order it in advance.

Comments:  Bone-in cuts (like this pork loin roast) require a longer cooking time, but the payoff is big flavor and succulent meat.  The meat closest to the bone is always the juiciest, and bone marrow enriches the sauce as the roast cooks.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  gemelli or fusilli
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  2               cans  petite diced tomatoes in juice - -- (14 1/2 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil
  1                cup  grated pecorino Romano cheese

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite.  Drain, reserving 1/3 cup cooking water.

Meanwhile, heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add garlic and crushed red pepper and sautÈ 1 minute.  Add tomatoes with juices and wine; bring to boil.  Boil until sauce thickens, about 8 minutes.  Stir in basil.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Add pasta and 1/2 cup cheese to sauce and toss until cheese melts and sauce coats pasta, adding reserved water by tablespoonfuls to moisten if necessary, about 3 minutes.  Season pasta to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve, passing remaining 1/2 cup cheese separately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serve With:  Deli antipasti such as olives, roasted red peppers, and provolone atop a bed of arugula, and seeded semolina bread.  Dessert:  Purchased tiramis˘.

Comments:  This feisty sauce gets its name from one of its ingredients, dried crushed red pepper (arrabbiata is Italian for "angry").  Use extra red pepper for an even spicier result.

               Golden Pancakes With Pecorino And Prosciutto

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              large  egg
  1 1/2           cups  water -- or more if needed
  6          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  12       tablespoons  freshly-grated pecorino Romano cheese - -- (abt 3 oz)
  12                    thin slices prosciutto -- each cut crosswise
                        in half

Sift flour and salt into bowl.  Add egg, then gradually whisk in 1 1/2 cups water (batter will be thin).  Pour batter through strainer set over measuring cup.

Heat 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 1 teaspoon oil to skillet; brush over skillet.  Pour in 1/3 cup batter, immediately tilting skillet to allow batter to spread over bottom (if batter does not spread easily, thin with more water by teaspoonfuls).  Cook until pancake is light golden on bottom, about 2 minutes.  Turn pancake over and cook until bottom is light golden, about 1 minute.  Transfer to paper towels.  Repeat with remaining batter, adding 1 teaspoon oil to skillet for each pancake and stacking pancakes between paper towels.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Wrap layered with paper towels in foil and refrigerate.  Heat foil packet in 300 degrees oven for about 15 minutes.)

Sprinkle 2 tablespoons cheese over each pancake.  Top each with 4 half-slices prosciutto.  Sprinkle with pepper.  Fold pancakes in half and then in half again, forming triangles.  Transfer to plates.

This recipe yields 6 pancakes.

What To Drink:  The saltiness of the ham and cheese calls for a fruity white wine with thirst-quenching acidity, like Tuscany's Vernaccia di San Gimignano.

Comments:  These crepe-like pancakes also make a great brunch dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  1            package  dried corn husks - (8 oz)
  1              pound  tomatillos -- husked, rinsed
  4                     serrano chiles, 3" long -- stemmed, chopped
  4              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  4               cups  coarsely-shredded cooked chicken - -- (packed)
                        = (abt 1 lb, from purchased rotisserie
                        chicken)
     2/3           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/3           cups  lard or solid vegetable shortening
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt (omit if masa mixture contains salt)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder (omit if masa mixture
                        contains baking powder)
  4               cups  freshly-ground masa dough for
                        tamales - (34 to 36 oz)
                        = (or make masa dough with 3 1/2 cups
                        masa harina [corn tortilla mix; abt 17
                        oz] mixed with 2 1/4 cups warm water)
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth -- more or less

For Filling:  Place husks in large pot or large bowl; add water to cover.  Place heavy plate on husks to keep submerged.  Let stand until husks soften, turning occasionally, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.

Preheat broiler.  Line heavy baking sheet with foil.  Arrange tomatillos on prepared sheet.  Broil until tomatillos blacken in spots, turning once, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer tomatillos and any juices on sheet to processor and cool.  Add chiles and garlic to processor and blend until smooth puree forms.  Heat oil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add tomatillo puree and boil 5 minutes, stirring often.  Add broth.  Reduce heat to medium; simmer until sauce coats spoon thickly and is reduced to 1 cup, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes.  Season with salt.  Mix in chicken and cilantro.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

For Dough:  Using electric mixer, beat lard (with salt and baking powder, if using) in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in fresh masa or masa harina mixture in 4 additions.  Reduce speed to low and gradually beat in 1 1/2 cups broth, forming tender dough.  If dough seems firm, beat in enough broth, 2 tablespoons at a time, to soften.

Fill bottom of pot with steamer insert with enough water (about 2 inches) to reach bottom of insert.  Line bottom of insert with some softened corn husks.  Tear 3 large husks into 1/4-inch-wide strips to use as ties and set aside.  Open 2 large husks on work surface.  Spread 1/4 cup dough in 4-inch square in center of each, leaving 2- to 3-inch plain border at narrow end of husk.  Spoon heaping tablespoon filling in strip down center of each dough square.  Fold long sides of husk and dough over filling to cover.  Fold up narrow end of husk.  Tie folded portion with strip of husk to secure, leaving wide end of tamale open.  Stand tamales in steamer basket.  Repeat with more husks, dough, and filling until all filling has been used.  If necessary to keep tamales upright in steamer, insert pieces of crumpled foil between them.

Bring water in pot to boil.  Cover pot and steam tamales until dough is firm to touch and separates easily from husk, adding more water to pot as necessary, about 45 minutes.  Let stand 10 minutes.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cool 1 hour.  Cover and chill.  Before serving, re-steam tamales until hot, about 35 minutes.)

This recipe yields 26 tamales.

Comments:  Masa labeled "masa preparada para tamales" often contains baking powder and salt, so don't add either if it does.  Soak the husks three hours ahead or overnight.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     beef tenderloin steaks, 1" thick - -- (6 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     bay leaves
                        = (2 finely crushed; 1 whole)
     1/2           cup  brine-cured olives
                        = (such as Kalamata)
  1                cup  dry white wine
  3        tablespoons  canned tomato puree

Rub tenderloin steaks with 1 tablespoon olive oil; sprinkle with crushed bay leaves.  Place steaks in small glass baking dish in single layer; let stand at room temperature at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Bring small saucepan of water to boil over medium-high heat.  Add olives and return water to boil.  Drain olives.

Scrape most of bay leaves off steaks; sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper.  Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add steaks and sautÈ to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Transfer steaks to plate.

Add white wine to skillet and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Add tomato puree, whole bay leaf, and drained olives to skillet.  Cook until sauce is slightly thickened, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.

Return steaks and any accumulated juices to skillet; turn to coat.  Cook steaks until just heated through, turning once, about 2 minutes.  Transfer steaks to platter.  Discard bay leaf.  Spoon sauce and olives over steaks and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

What to drink:  A RhÙne red, such as a Gigondas, or Syrah.

Comments:  This dish is typically made with pitted, brine-cured black olives (Kalamata or NiÁois work well), but if olives cassÈes ó the green, fennel-brined olives of Provence ó can be found, try them here in equal quantity after draining them.  Accompany the steaks with mushrooms sautÈed with garlic and herbs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  orange juice
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  Jerusalem artichokes -- trimmed, peeled,
                        and thinly sliced
  1                     bag arugula - (5 oz)
  2             ounces  Parmesan cheese -- shaved

Whisk orange juice, vinegar, and mustard in small bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in oil.  Season vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Combine Jerusalem artichokes, arugula, and Parmesan in large bowl.  Drizzle with vinaigrette and toss to coat.  Divide among 6 plates and serve.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  Because Jerusalem artichokes discolor quickly, peel and slice them just before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

What To Drink:  Unoaked Chardonnay from France (think Chablis) or New Zealand.

Comments:  Also called sunchokes, Jerusalem artichokes are actually the roots of a variety of sunflower, but their sweet, nutty flavor is reminiscent of artichokes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     soft lavash bread
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  minced pitted Kalamata olives
  1                cup  grated Monterey Jack cheese
  1 3/4           cups  crumbled feta cheese
  1 1/2           cups  sliced mushrooms
  1                cup  diced green bell pepper
     1/2           cup  diced red onion
  1                cup  diced seeded plum tomatoes

Preheat broiler.  Place lavash on large baking sheet; brush with 1 1/2 tablespoons oil.  Broil until lavash just begins to crisp, about 1 minute.

Reduce oven temperature to 450 degrees.  Turn lavash over on baking sheet, broiled-side down.  Brush with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil.  Spread with olives; sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese and feta cheese, then mushrooms, onion, bell pepper, and tomatoes.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Bake until pizza is heated through and cheeses melt, about 10 minutes.  Cut into squares.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Antoinette writes; "My business partner and I own a company that makes costumes for the film industry.  When we are involved in a huge project ó as we were with Minority Report and X2 ó we work very long days, and sometimes even on weekends.  So I don't have much time to cook or even to go out for lunch or dinner.  That's when my no-fiddling cooking style comes in handy.  I cut corners when I can ó without sacrificing flavor.  I prepare all-vegetarian meals, using the freshest ingredients from the farmers' market, and I really get a kick out of seeing people come over to my house and not miss the meat one bit."

Look for soft lavash ó a large, thin rectangular bread (about 18 by 12 inches) ó in Middle Eastern markets or in the bread section of most supermarkets.  Two 11- to 12-inch- diameter flour tortillas can be substituted.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  garlic
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  2              large  shallots -- minced
  2               cups  whole milk
  2               cups  whipping cream
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/8      teaspoon  finely-grated lemon peel
  8             ounces  extra-sharp cheddar cheese -- shredded
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  1              pound  ditalini or conchiglie pasta
  8             ounces  Westphalian or Black Forest ham -- cut 1/4" pieces
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut top 1/4 inch off head of garlic to expose cloves.  Place garlic, cut-side up, on sheet of foil.  Drizzle with 1/2 tablespoon oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Wrap garlic with foil to enclose tightly.  Bake until skin is golden brown and cloves are tender, about 55 minutes.  Cool.  Squeeze cloves from skin.

Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in large saucepan over medium heat.  Add shallots; sautÈ until tender, about 4 minutes.  Whisk in milk, cream, thyme, lemon peel, and roasted garlic.  Simmer over medium heat until reduced to 2 3/4 cups, about 30 minutes.  Reduce heat to low.  Gradually stir in cheeses.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain.

Toss cheese sauce, pasta, ham, and parsley in large bowl.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Kim Massman of Santa Monica, California, writes; "Help me, please.  Since dining at The Federalist in the XV Beacon Hotel in Boston, I haven't been able to get the macaroni and cheese out of my mind.  It was made with pasta, ham, and a creamy cheese sauce."

The ham lends a salty flavor to this dish.  Wait until the sauce is combined with the pasta and ham before seasoning with salt.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STREUSEL ===
  1              large  egg white
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1 1/2           cups  chopped walnuts - (abt 6 oz)
                        === DOUGHNUTS ===
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1                cup  sugar
  2              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated orange peel - (packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/3           cup  melted unsalted butter -- cooled briefly
  1                cup  sour cream
                        === GLAZE ===
  2               cups  powdered sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  maple extract
  5        tablespoons  heavy whipping cream -- more or less
                        Canola oil -- for deep-frying

For Streusel:  Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.  Whisk egg white in bowl until frothy, about 1 minute.  Whisk in sugar and cinnamon.  Fold in nuts.  Spread mixture on prepared sheet.  Bake until beginning to dry, about 12 minutes.  Using metal spatula, stir to break up nuts.  Continue to bake until nuts and coating are dry and golden brown, about 10 minutes; cool on sheet.  Transfer streusel to work surface.  Chop nuts into small (rice-size) bits.  Transfer to shallow bowl.

For Doughnuts:  Whisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar and eggs in large bowl until very thick, about 3 minutes.  Beat in orange peel and vanilla.  Gradually beat in butter; beat in sour cream in 2 additions.  Gently fold in dry ingredients in 4 additions (dough will be slightly sticky).  Cover; set aside 1 hour.

For Glaze:  Combine powdered sugar and maple extract in medium bowl.  Add 4 tablespoons cream; whisk until smooth.  Whisk in additional cream, 1 teaspoon at a time, to form medium-thick glaze.  Cover and let stand up to 3 hours.

Sprinkle 2 rimmed baking sheets lightly with flour.  Press out 1/3 of dough on lightly floured surface to 1/2- to 2/3-inch thickness.  Using 2 1/2-inch-diameter round cutter, cut out dough rounds.  Arrange on floured sheets.  Repeat with remaining dough in 2 more batches.  Gather all dough scraps.  Press out dough; cut out more dough rounds until all dough is used.

Using 1-inch-diameter round cutter, cut out center of each dough round to make doughnuts and doughnut holes.

Line 2 baking sheets with several layers of paper towels.  Pour oil into large deep skillet to depth of 1 1/2 inches.  Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 365 to 370 degrees.  Fry doughnut holes in 2 batches until golden brown, turning once, about 2 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels.  Fry doughnuts, 3 or 4 at a time, until golden brown, about 1 minute per side.  Using slotted spoon, transfer doughnuts to paper towels.  Cool doughnuts and doughnut holes completely.

Working with 1 doughnut at a time, spread glaze over 1 side, then dip glazed side into streusel.  Arrange doughnuts, streusel-side up, on rack.  Let glaze set at least 30 minutes.  Coat doughnut holes with same glaze and dip into streusel.

This recipe yields about 24 doughnuts and 24 doughnut holes.

Comments:  The tender texture of these cake doughnuts comes from folding in the dry ingredients gently by hand, rather than beating them in with a mixer.

Use a clip-on deep-fry thermometer to gauge the oil temperature when frying these doughnuts: too low and theyll absorb oil, turning leaden and soggy; too high and they'll burn before the insides are cooked through.

  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (28 oz)
  2 1/4           cups  low-salt chicken broth

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  2 1/4         pounds  firm-but-ripe Anjou, Bosc, or Comice pears -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 3/4" dice
     1/2           cup  dried tart cherries
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped crystallized ginger
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped crystallized ginger
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  5        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/3           cup  mini semisweet chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  chilled buttermilk
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter four 1 1/4-cup custard cups or soufflÈ dishes; place on rimmed baking sheet.  Combine first 5 ingredients in large bowl; toss to coat.  Divide filling among prepared custard cups.  Dot with 2 tablespoons butter.  Bake until filling is hot and bubbling around edges, about 20 minutes.  Maintain oven temperature.

Meanwhile, Prepare Topping:  Combine sugar and ginger in processor; blend until ginger is finely chopped.  Transfer 1 tablespoon sugar-ginger mixture to small bowl; reserve.  Add flour, baking soda, and salt to remaining sugar-ginger mixture in processor; blend 20 seconds.  Add butter; using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Mix in chocolate chips, then buttermilk (mixture will be very moist).

Drop topping by heaping tablespoonfuls onto filling in custard cups (about 4 very generous tablespoons for each); sprinkle with reserved 1 tablespoon sugar-ginger mixture.  Bake until topping is golden brown and filling is bubbling thickly, about 20 minutes.  Cool 20 minutes.  Serve cobblers with ice cream.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  4             pounds  firm but ripe Bosc pears -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1" pieces
  1              pinch  salt
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  3                     fresh rosemary sprigs - (4" long)
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar

* Available at natural foods stores and many supermarkets.

Boil juice in heavy large pot until reduced to 1 cup, about 30 minutes.  Add pears and pinch of salt; return to boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until pears are very soft, stirring occasionally to immerse pears in juice, about 25 minutes.

Transfer mixture to processor and puree until smooth.  Return puree to same pot.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Cover partially; simmer over medium-low heat until puree is thick enough to mound slightly on spoon, stirring often and being careful when removing lid (puree will spatter vigorously), about 10 minutes.

Remove from heat.  Discard vanilla bean.  Stir in rosemary and vinegar.  Cover; let stand 30 minutes to infuse.  Discard rosemary.  Cool to room temperature.  Cover and chill until cold, about 4 hours.  (Can be prepared 2 weeks ahead.  Keep chilled.)

This recipe yields about 2 cups.

Serve With:  Toast (especially when cheddar omelets are on the menu), potato pancakes, waffles, pancakes, or French toast.  Combine With:  Crusty bread and blue cheese.

Use As:  A dessert topping for pound cake (serve with vanilla ice cream).

                     Pear, Pancetta, And Walnut Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4      teaspoon  whole coriander seeds
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2         small  shallot -- minced
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2         ounces  thinly-sliced pancetta -- chopped
  1              large  butter lettuce head - (abt 8 cups) -- torn bite size
  1              large  red Anjou pear -- unpeeled, quartered,
                        cored, and sliced
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped toasted walnuts

Toast coriander seeds in small skillet over medium heat until aromatic, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to mortar and grind coarsely with pestle.  Transfer to small bowl.  Mix in lemon juice and shallot.  Gradually whisk in olive oil.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.

Heat heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add pancetta and sautÈ until crisp, about 4 minutes.  Transfer to paper-towel-lined plate.  Place lettuce in large bowl.  (Dressing, pancetta, and lettuce can be prepared 2 hours ahead.  Let dressing and pancetta stand at room temperature.  Cover lettuce with damp kitchen towel and refrigerate.)

Toss lettuce with dressing.  Top with pear slices, then walnuts and pancetta.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Toasted crushed coriander seeds add great flavor and fragrance to the dressing.  Green Anjou or Comice pears would also work well here, but the red Anjou's rich maroon skin looks beautiful next to the lettuce.

Market Tip:  Choose firm, large pears and allow several days and up to a week for them to ripen (they're ripe when they yield to gentle pressure at the stem end).  To speed ripening, keep them closed in a brown paper bag.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FRUIT ===
  3               cups  water
  1                cup  imported sweet Marsala
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1                     strip lemon peel, 4" long -- (yellow part only)
  2               cups  pitted prunes
  2               cups  dried apricots
                        === CAKE ===
  3              large  egg yolks
  1              large  egg
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon peel - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  pine nuts - (abt 3 1/2 oz)
                        Powdered sugar

For Fruit:  Combine 3 cups water, Marsala, sugar, cinnamon stick, and lemon peel in heavy large saucepan.  Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Add prunes and apricots.  Reduce heat to medium; simmer until fruit is just soft but not mushy, stirring frequently, about 25 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer fruit to medium bowl.  Boil liquid until syrupy, about 5 minutes.  Pour syrup over fruit.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover; chill.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)

For Cake:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Butter and flour 10-inch-diameter springform pan.  Whisk egg yolks, egg, lemon peel, vanilla, and salt in small bowl to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat butter and 1 cup sugar in medium bowl until pale and creamy.  Gradually add flour, beating until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Using rubber spatula, gently stir egg mixture into butter mixture (batter will be thick).  Spoon batter into prepared pan; smooth top (cake will be thin).  Sprinkle pine nuts over top; press lightly to adhere.

Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Transfer cake to rack.  Run small knife around cake edges to loosen.  Remove pan sides.  Cool cake completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and store at room temperature.)

Sprinkle cake with powdered sugar.  Serve with poached fruit.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

What To Drink:  Tuscany's famous Vin Santo, a dessert wine made from raisined grapes.

Comments:  Tuscan sweets tend to be simple and rustic, like this deliciously buttery, moist cake, similar in texture to marzipan.

For Crust:  Blend flour and hazelnuts in processor until nuts are finely ground.  Add brown sugar and salt; blend 20 seconds.  Add butter and lard; using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Transfer mixture to bowl.  Add 4 tablespoons ice water; stir until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough together; divide into 2 equal pieces.  Form each into ball; flatten each into disk.  Wrap each in plastic wrap and chill 1 hour.

For Filling:  Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Toss apples, 1/2 cup sugar, brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon in large bowl.  Roll out 1 dough disk on generously floured surface to 12-inch round, rotating crust often to prevent sticking.  Generously flour 11- or 12-inch tart pan bottom.  Slide tart pan bottom under dough round.  Carefully slide dough round into 9-inch pie dish.  Press crust onto bottom and up sides of dish; pinch and press to seal any cracks.  Spoon filling into crust; drizzle with melted butter.

Roll out second dough disk on generously floured surface to 13-inch round.  Slide same floured tart pan bottom under dough round.  Carefully allow dough round to slide off tart pan bottom onto pie filling; pinch to seal any cracks in crust.  Press top crust and bottom crust together at edge.  Fold edge under; crimp decoratively.  Cut X in center of top crust.  Brush top crust lightly with milk.  Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.

Transfer pie to rimmed baking sheet.  Bake pie 30 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Bake pie 25 minutes.  Cover crust edges with foil collar to prevent overbrowning; continue baking until crust is golden, apples are tender, and juices are bubbling thickly in center, about 20 minutes longer.

Transfer pie to rack and cool.  Serve with ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Discovered on Long Island in 1759, Pippin apples are one of the oldest U.S. varieties.  Their bright tanginess and crisp texture make them excellent for baking.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
  1              ounce  dried porcini mushrooms*
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  arborio rice - (abt 9 1/2 oz)
                        = (or medium-grain white rice)
  3              large  shallots -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - -- (abt 3 oz)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Pressure cooker

* Dried porcini mushrooms are available at Italian markets, specialty foods stores, and many supermarkets.

Bring 2 cups water to boil in heavy small saucepan.  Add mushrooms.  Cover; let stand until mushrooms soften, about 10 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to work surface; reserve soaking liquid.  Chop mushrooms coarsely.

Melt butter with oil in pressure cooker over medium-high heat.  Add rice, shallots, and fennel seeds; stir 1 minute.  Add wine and cook until almost evaporated, stirring frequently, about 1 minute.  Mix in 2 cups broth and salt, then mushrooms and reserved mushroom soaking liquid, leaving any sediment behind in pan.  Lock lid in place.  Bring to high pressure over high heat.  Cook rice 4 minutes, adjusting heat as necessary to maintain high pressure.  Quick-release pressure.

Slowly release lid, standing back and allowing steam to escape.  Cook rice over medium-high heat until creamy and tender but still firm to bite, stirring often and adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if thinner consistency is desired, about 2 minutes.  Mix in cheese and parsley.  Season risotto to taste with pepper.

This recipe yields 6 first-course or 4 main-course servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  6                     pork loin 1"-thick rib chops - -- (abt 12 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  water
  1              large  shallot -- minced

  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley

* Cornichons are tiny brine-packed French pickles, available at specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in each of 2 heavy large skillets over medium heat.  Sprinkle chops with salt and pepper.  Add 3 chops to each skillet and sautÈ until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side.  Cover skillets and cook until thermometer inserted into center of chops registers 145 degrees, about 9 minutes.  Transfer chops to warm platter; tent with foil to keep warm.

Add half of water, shallot, and garlic to each skillet.  Cook until shallot is soft, scraping up any browned bits, about 2 minutes.  Add any juices from chops.  Whisk in cornichons and mustard.  Season with salt and pepper.  Pour over chops.  Sprinkle chops with parsley.

What To Drink:  Red Burgundy or a Burgundian Pinot Noir.

Comments:  Known in France as CÙtes de Porc Vigneronnes (Grape Growers' Pork Chops), this provincial dish is typical of the simple yet substantial fare served after a hard day of harvesting grapes.  Serve with wilted spinach in cream.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  tapenade*
  4          teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  2                     porterhouse steaks, 2"-thick - -- (abt 2 lbs ea)
  4          teaspoons  olive oil
  4        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar

* Look for tapenade (an earthy, thick paste or spread made from brine-cured olives, olive oil, capers, anchovies, lemon juice, and seasonings) at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and Italian markets.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Mix tapenade and rosemary in small bowl to blend.  Sprinkle steaks with salt and generously with cracked black pepper.

Divide olive oil between 2 heavy medium ovenproof skillets set over high heat.  Add 1 steak to each skillet and cook until both are browned, about 3 minutes per side.  Spread half of tapenade mixture atop each steak.

Transfer skillets with steaks to oven.  Cook both steaks until thermometer inserted into center of steaks registers 125 degrees for medium-rare, about 20 minutes.  Transfer both steaks to platter.

Pour 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar into each skillet and cook over medium heat until liquid is slightly reduced, scraping up browned bits, about 1 minute.  Drizzle hot skillet juices over each steak and serve.

Comments:  A butcher may have to cut these impressive, extra-thick steaks for you.

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 2/3           cups  bread flour
  1           teaspoon  instant or rapid-rise yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2                vitamin C 500-mg pill (not chewable) -- crushed
  2               cups  warm filtered or spring water -- (105 to 115 degrees)

Sift first 4 ingredients into medium bowl.  Place 2 cups warm water in large clean sealable container.  Add dry ingredients; whisk vigorously to combine.  Cover container with lid slightly ajar; let stand in warm draft-free area 24 hours.

This recipe yields about 1 quart.

Alton Brown's tips for using proto-dough:  Afer 24 hours, you can use the proto-dough in a recipe.  Or you can develop with flavor by adding a cup each of warm water and bread flour, letting it stand, uncovered, at room temperature until foamy (about 2 hours) and stashing it, covered, in the fridge for at least 3 weeks.  An alcohol-rich liquid will rise to the surface every few days; just whisk it back in.  "Feed" the proto-dough every time you take some to use in a recipe.  For every cup taken add a cup each of water and bread flour, let foam, and return to the fridge.  Proto-dough can last for years, as long as you keep taking and feeding.  To use proto-dough in a regulr yeast recipe, replace the dry yeast and every cup of liquid (including dissolving liquid) with 1/2 cup of proto-dough, 5 ounces liquid, and 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast.

Comments:  Extra vitamin C enhances the yeast.  This recipe is an accompaniment for Country-Style Sourdough Bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPICED SUGAR ===
  1                cup  sugar
  4          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  2          teaspoons  ground nutmeg
                        === DOUGHNUTS ===
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1                cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1              large  egg
  2              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  buttermilk -- plus
  1         tablespoon  buttermilk
  1                cup  canned pure pumpkin
                        Canola oil -- for deep-frying
                        === POWDERED SUGAR GLAZE ===
  2               cups  powdered sugar
                        Whipping cream

For Spiced Sugar:  Whisk all ingredients in medium bowl to blend.

For Doughnuts:  Whisk first 8 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in large bowl until blended (mixture will be grainy).  Beat in egg, then yolks and vanilla.  Gradually beat in buttermilk; beat in pumpkin in 4 additions.  Using rubber spatula, fold in dry ingredients in 4 additions, blending gently after each addition. Cover with plastic; chill 3 hours.

Sprinkle 2 rimmed baking sheets lightly with flour.  Press out 1/3 of dough on floured surface to 1/2- to 2/3-inch thickness.  Using 2 1/2-inch-diameter round cutter, cut out dough rounds.  Arrange on sheets.  Repeat with remaining dough in 2 more batches.  Gather dough scraps.  Press out dough and cut out more dough rounds until all dough is used.

Using 1-inch-diameter round cutter, cut out center of each dough round to make doughnuts and doughnut holes.

Line 2 baking sheets with several layers of paper towels.  Pour oil into large deep skillet to depth of 1 1/2 inches.  Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 365 to 370 degrees.  Fry doughnut holes in 2 batches until golden brown, turning occasionally, about 2 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain.  Fry doughnuts, 3 or 4 at a time, until golden brown, adjusting heat to maintain temperature, about 1 minute per side.  Using slotted spoon, transfer doughnuts to paper towels to drain.  Cool completely.

For Powdered Sugar Glaze:  Whisk powdered sugar and 4 tablespoons whipping cream to blend.  Whisk in additional cream, 1 teaspoon at a time, to form medium thick glaze.  Can be made up to 3 hours ahead.  Add doughnut holes to bowl of spiced sugar and toss to coat.  Spread doughnuts on 1 side with Powdered Sugar Glaze.  Arrange doughnuts, glazed-side up, on racks.  Let stand until glaze sets, at least 30 minutes.

This recipe yields about 24 doughnuts and 24 doughnut holes.

Comments:  Use a clip-on deep-fry thermometer to gauge the oil temperature when frying these doughnuts: too low and theyll absorb oil, turning leaden and soggy; too high and they'll burn before the insides are cooked through.

Using 1-inch-diameter round cutter, cut out center of each dough round to make doughnuts and doughnut holes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Line 2 baking sheets with several layers of paper towels.  Pour oil into large deep skillet to depth of 1 1/2 inches.  Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 365 to 370 degrees.  Fry doughnut holes in 2 batches until golden brown, turning occasionally, about 2 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain.  Fry doughnuts, 3 or 4 at a time, until golden brown, adjusting heat to maintain temperature, about 1 minute per side.  Using slotted spoon, transfer doughnuts to paper towels to drain.  Cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Powdered Sugar Glaze:  Whisk powdered sugar and 4 tablespoons whipping cream to blend.  Whisk in additional cream, 1 teaspoon at a time, to form medium thick glaze.  Can be made up to 3 hours ahead.  Add doughnut holes to bowl of spiced sugar and toss to coat.  Spread doughnuts on 1 side with Powdered Sugar Glaze.  Arrange doughnuts, glazed-side up, on racks.  Let stand until glaze sets, at least 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 24 doughnuts and 24 doughnut holes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Use a clip-on deep-fry thermometer to gauge the oil temperature when frying these doughnuts: too low and theyll absorb oil, turning leaden and soggy; too high and they&apos;ll burn before the insides are cooked through.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  apple cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  3              large  quinces - (abt 21 oz) -- peeled, quartered,
                        cored, cut into 1/2" dice
  2              large  Granny Smith apples - (abt 24 oz) -- peeled, quartered,
                        cored, cut into 1/2" dice
     1/2           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  ground cardamom
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     cinnamon stick -- broken in half
  1           teaspoon  minced serrano chile with seeds
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped pitted Medjool dates - -- (abt 7 oz)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice

Combine vinegar and brown sugar in heavy large saucepan.  Bring to boil over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Add quinces; cover and simmer until quinces are tender and liquid is absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.

Add apples, 1/2 cup water, ginger, coriander, cardamom, salt, cinnamon stick, and chile; bring to simmer over medium heat.  Cover and simmer until apples are tender, about 10 minutes.  Stir in dates and lime juice.

Transfer chutney to bowl and cool.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.  (Can be prepared 2 weeks ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields about 4 cups.

Serve With:  Indian dishes (such as basmati rice and curries), lamb, duck, pork chops, or sharp cheeses.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  The hard core of a quince must be carefully removed with a paring knife after each fruit is peeled and quartered.  If the core is too hard to safely remove with a knife, try trimming off pieces around it, then cut them into a dice and discard the core.

Comments:  The flavor of this chutney improves if made at least one day ahead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
  6        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  instant espresso powder
  2               cups  whole milk
  5              large  egg yolks
  1              Pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === DOUGHNUTS ===
  2 1/4      teaspoons  dry yeast
                        = (measured from 2 envelopes)
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar -- plus
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  warm whole milk -- plus
  2        tablespoons  warm whole milk -- (105 to 115 degrees)
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- melted, and
                        cooled to lukewarm
  2              large  eggs
                        Canola oil -- for deep-frying

For Topping:  Blend sugar,cocoa powder, and cinnamon in small bowl.

For Filling:  Whisk sugar, flour, and espresso powder in heavy medium saucepan to blend.  Gradually add milk, whisking until smooth.  Whisk in yolks and salt.  Add butter.  Cook over medium-high heat until pastry cream thickens and boils, whisking constantly, about 6 minutes.  Whisk in vanilla.  Transfer to small bowl.  Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of filling.  Chill until cold, at least 4 hours and up to 2 days.

For Doughnuts:  Combine yeast and 1/4 teaspoon sugar in large bowl of heavy-duty mixer.  Pour warm milk over and stir to blend.  Let stand until yeast dissolves and mixture bubbles, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, whisk flour, cinnamon, salt, and 1/4 cup sugar in medium bowl to blend.  Whisk butter and eggs in another medium bowl to blend.

Butter large bowl.  Using dough-hook attachment, beat butter-egg mixture into yeast mixture on medium-low speed until well blended, stopping occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl, about 4 minutes.  Beat in flour mixture by 1/4 cupfuls, then beat dough until smooth and beginning to pull away from sides of bowl, about 5 minutes.  Scrape dough from hook into bowl.  Let dough rest 5 minutes.  Scrape dough into buttered bowl (dough will be sticky).  Turn dough to coat with butter.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough overnight.

Sprinkle 2 baking sheets lightly with flour.  Gently press dough to deflate.  Roll out chilled dough on lightly floured surface to 1/3-inch thickness.  Using 2 3/4- to 3-inch-diameter round cutter, cut out dough rounds.  Transfer rounds to floured sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.  Gather dough scraps.  Roll out to 1/3-inch thickness; cut out more rounds.  Repeat until all dough is used.  Cover dough rounds on sheets with towels.  Let rise in draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Line 2 baking sheets with several layers of paper towels.  Pour oil into large deep skillet to depth of 1 1/2 inches.  Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 360 degrees to 370 degrees.  Fry 3 dough rounds at a time until golden brown, adjusting heat to maintain temperature, about 1 1/2 minutes per side.  Using slotted spoon, transfer doughnuts to paper towels to drain.  Dip both sides of warm doughnuts into topping.  Transfer to rack and cool completely.

Spoon filling into pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch plain round tip.  Push blade of small sharp knife into side of 1 doughnut about 3/4 of the way to opposite side; remove knife.  Insert tip of pastry bag into slit and press in filling until center of doughnut bulges.  Return doughnut to rack.  Repeat with remaining doughnuts.  (Doughnuts can be filled up to 2 hours before serving.  Let stand at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 24 doughnuts.

Comments:  While any yeast dough can be kneaded by hand, this one is done in a heavy-duty mixer with a dough-hook attachment ó it's the fastest, easiest way to get the best texture.

Use a clip-on deep-fry thermometer to gauge the oil temperature when frying these doughnuts: too low and theyll absorb oil, turning leaden and soggy; too high and they'll burn before the insides are cooked through.

Line 2 baking sheets with several layers of paper towels.  Pour oil into large deep skillet to depth of 1 1/2 inches.  Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 360 degrees to 370 degrees.  Fry 3 dough rounds at a time until golden brown, adjusting heat to maintain temperature, about 1 1/2 minutes per side.  Using slotted spoon, transfer doughnuts to paper towels to drain.  Dip both sides of warm doughnuts into topping.  Transfer to rack and cool completely.

<DirT>
Spoon filling into pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch plain round tip.  Push blade of small sharp knife into side of 1 doughnut about 3/4 of the way to opposite side; remove knife.  Insert tip of pastry bag into slit and press in filling until center of doughnut bulges.  Return doughnut to rack.  Repeat with remaining doughnuts.  (Doughnuts can be filled up to 2 hours before serving.  Let stand at room temperature.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 24 doughnuts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  While any yeast dough can be kneaded by hand, this one is done in a heavy-duty mixer with a dough-hook attachment ó it&apos;s the fastest, easiest way to get the best texture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Use a clip-on deep-fry thermometer to gauge the oil temperature when frying these doughnuts: too low and theyll absorb oil, turning leaden and soggy; too high and they&apos;ll burn before the insides are cooked through.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  red curry paste
  1                can  unsweetened coconut milk - (13.5 oz)
  1             bottle  clam juice - (8 oz)
  1 1/4         pounds  uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  1                     lime -- cut into 8 wedges

Stir red curry paste in large skillet over medium-high heat until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add coconut milk and clam juice and bring to boil, whisking until paste dissolves.  Boil until sauce is thick enough to coat spoon, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes.

Add shrimp to sauce.  Cook until shrimp turn pink and are just opaque in center, turning occasionally, about 4 minutes.  Stir in cilantro.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Divide shrimp and sauce among 4 shallow bowls.  Garnish with lime wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serve With:  Steamed jasmine rice and a cucumber and snow pea salad.  Dessert:  Sliced tropical fruits such as pineapple, kiwi, and mango.

Market Tip:  Our test-kitchen experts found that curry paste packaged in jars has a fresher flavor than dry curry powder.

Comments:  Instead of ordering Thai takeout, whip up this easy classic.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  water
  30                    juniper berries -- slightly crushed
  1                     duck - (abt 5 lbs) -- heart, liver,
                        gizzard, and neck reserved
  5              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  1                     bay leaf
  16             large  pitted prunes - (abt 10 oz)
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar

Bring 3 cups water, 20 juniper berries, and pinch of salt to boil in large saucepan.  Reduce heat to medium; cover and simmer 10 minutes.  Set juniper broth aside.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Cut wing tips from duck; reserve.  Sprinkle cavity of duck with salt and pepper.  Place heart, liver, and gizzard in cavity, then 10 juniper berries, 4 thyme sprigs, and bay leaf.  Tie legs together to hold shape.  Place duck, breast-side up, in roasting pan.  Add wing tips and neck to pan.  Pour 1 cup juniper broth over duck.  Roast duck in center of oven until beginning to brown, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring remaining juniper broth to boil.  Add prunes; cover, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until prunes are soft, about 5 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer prunes to small bowl.

Tilt roasting pan; spoon off 1/2 cup fat from top of liquid.  Pour 1/2 cup prune poaching liquid over duck.  Turn duck, breast-side down.  Pour 1/2 cup prune poaching liquid over duck.  Return to oven; roast 15 minutes.  Turn duck, breast-side up.  Arrange prunes around duck; spoon pan juices over prunes.  Drizzle vinegar over duck.  Return to oven and roast duck until skin is crisp and juices run clear when thigh is pierced, about 20 minutes longer.  Transfer to cutting board, breast-side down; let stand 20 minutes.

Discard wing tips and neck.  Using slotted spoon, transfer prunes to bowl.  Pour pan juices into medium saucepan; spoon off fat.  Add thyme sprig.  Boil until juices are reduced to 1 1/4 cups and thickened slightly, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Return prunes to juices to rewarm; season with salt and pepper.  Turn duck, breast-side up.  Cut legs from duck.  Cut off wings with some breast attached.  Cut breasts from duck; thinly slice crosswise.  Arrange duck on platter.  Spoon juices with prunes over and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

What To Drink:  Red Bordeaux or a varietal blend of Cabernet and Merlot.

Comments:  The juniper berries are an earthy contrast to the sweet prunes ó a prized regional product ó in this dish.  Serve roasted sliced potatoes and sautÈed mushrooms alongside.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  dry red wine
                        = (such as Syrah or Zinfandel)
     3/4           cup  pomegranate juice
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                     cinnamon stick
  2          teaspoons  grated orange peel
  6                     Bosc pears with stems -- peeled
                        Vanilla ice cream
                        Purchased biscotti

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Stir wine, pomegranate juice, sugar, cinnamon stick, and orange peel in medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes.

Using small melon baller, core pears from bottom of wide end.  Trim bottoms flat and stand upright in 8- by 8- by 2-inch baking dish.  Pour pomegranate-wine sauce over pears.  Roast pears until tender when pierced with knife, basting pears with sauce every 20 minutes, about 1 hour.

Using spatula, transfer roasted pears to serving platter.  Transfer pan juices to small saucepan.  Simmer until reduced to 2/3 cup, about 5 minutes.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Let sauce and pears stand at room temperature.  Rewarm sauce before continuing.)

Spoon glaze over pears.  Serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream and biscotti.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

What to drink:  Late-harvest Sauvignon Blanc.

Comments:  Bosc pears are distinguished by russet skins and elegantly elongated necks and stems.  They are an ideal dessert pear because they hold their shape when roasted or poached.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1                     shallot -- chopped
     1/2           cup  coarse fresh breadcrumbs made from
                        crustless French bread
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  2             pounds  broccoli -- stems removed,
                        tops cut into 2"-long florets
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shallot; sautÈ until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes.  Add breadcrumbs; toast until golden, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes.  Transfer mixture to small bowl.  Mix in lemon peel.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Gremolata can be made 4 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Toss broccoli with remaining 3 tablespoons oil in large bowl to coat.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Toss to coat.  Spread out onto large rimmed baking sheet.  Roast until stems are crisp-tender and lightly browned, about 20 minutes.  Sprinkle with lemon juice.  Transfer to serving bowl.  Sprinkle gremolata over and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Gremolata is the classic osso buco garnish of minced lemon peel, garlic, and parsley.  In this version, lemon peel and shallots perfume a simple breadcrumb topping.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     sheets frozen puff pastry - (17.3-oz pkg) -- thawed
  1 2/3           cups  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  water -- or more if needed
  2                     vanilla beans -- split lengthwise
     1/4           cup  dark rum
  1              large  banana
  2        tablespoons  chopped peeled fresh ginger
  2                     dried chiles de ·rbol*
  1              large  pineapple - (4 1/2 lbs) -- trimmed, peeled,
                        and left whole
  1              large  egg yolk -- blended with
  1         tablespoon  milk -- for glaze
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

* Available at Latin American markets and some specialty foods stores.

Roll out pastry on floured surface to 11-inch squares.  Using small plate as guide, cut four 5- to 5 1/2-inch rounds from each square.  Transfer rounds to 2 heavy baking sheets.  Cover; chill.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.)

Mix sugar and 1/2 cup water in heavy medium saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla beans.  Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush.  Increase heat; boil until syrup is deep amber color, swirling pan occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Add 1 cup water (syrup will bubble vigorously), then rum.  Stir over very low heat until caramel bits dissolve.  Simmer 2 minutes.  Cool syrup 15 minutes.  Pour into blender.  Add banana, ginger, and chiles de ·rbol; puree until sauce is smooth.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place pineapple in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Pour sauce over; turn pineapple to coat.  Roast until tender, basting often with sauce and adding more water by tablespoonfuls if sauce becomes thick, about 1 hour 15 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Chill until cold, then cover and keep chilled.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Transfer pineapple to work surface, scraping any sauce back into dish.  Cut pineapple crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick rounds.  Cut out core from each round.  Place 1 pineapple round in center of each pastry round.  Brush pineapple with sauce.  Brush pastry edges with egg glaze.

Bake tartlets until pastry is brown, about 25 minutes.  Rewarm sauce.  Top each tartlet with scoop of vanilla ice cream; drizzle with warm sauce and serve.

This recipe yields 8 tartlets.

Comments:  Lee Schmidt of Wichita, Kansas, writes: "My wife and I just returned from our honeymoon in Mexico.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the elegant Mahakua Hacienda de San Antonio in Colima.  Our last night there, we dined on the rooftop terrace and shared an amazing pineapple tartlet."

Dice any leftover pineapple and use it, with its caramel syrup, as an ice cream topping.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Mushrooms

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  2 1/2         pounds  portobello mushrooms - (abt 10) -- stems trimmed
  1                cup  chopped prosciutto - (abt 6 oz)
     2/3           cup  chopped shallots - (abt 2 large)
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        === SAUCE ===
  4               cups  whole milk
  1                can  low-salt chicken broth - (14 oz)
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick)
     2/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  shredded GruyËre cheese - (abt 8 oz)
     1/3           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        === LASAGNA ===
  1              pound  lasagna noodles
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cut 1/2" pieces

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Brush rimmed baking sheet with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Toss mushrooms with 2 tablespoons olive oil in large bowl to coat.  Arrange mushrooms, gill-side up, in single layer on prepared baking sheet.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast until tender, about 45 minutes.  Cool.  Cut mushrooms into 1/3-inch-thick slices.

Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add prosciutto; sautÈ until browned, about 3 minutes.  Add shallots, rosemary, and thyme.  Cook until shallots are tender, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.  (Mushrooms and prosciutto-shallot mixture can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and chill).

For Sauce:  Bring milk, broth, and bay leaf to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Remove from heat.  Let stand 10 minutes; discard bay leaf.

Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Whisk in flour; stir 2 minutes.  Whisk in hot milk mixture; bring to boil, whisking frequently.  Reduce heat to low; simmer 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Remove from heat; stir in GruyËre, Parmesan, and nutmeg.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

For Lasagna:  Cook noodles in large pot of boiling salted water until almost tender but slightly undercooked (noodles will finish cooking in oven).  Drain and rinse with cold water.  Drain again; pat dry.

Butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Spread 1 cup sauce over bottom of prepared dish.  Arrange 1/3 of noodles over sauce, overlapping to fit.  Spread about 1 2/3 cups sauce over noodles.  Arrange 1/2 of mushrooms over sauce.  Scatter 1/2 of prosciutto mixture over mushrooms.  Arrange 1/2 of remaining noodles over mushrooms, overlapping to fit.  Spread 1 2/3 cups sauce over noodles.  Arrange remaining mushrooms over sauce, sprinkle with remaining prosciutto, and top with remaining noodles.  Spread remaining sauce over noodles, sprinkle Parmesan cheese over, and dot with butter.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake lasagna until top is golden brown and sauce is bubbling, about 45 minutes (about 1 hour if refrigerated).  Let stand 20 to 30 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Get the most out of every ingredient by layering flavors.  Roasting portobello mushrooms before adding them to the lasagna lends a meaty smokiness.  Creamy bÈchamel sauce makes this lasagna even more luxurious.

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Brush rimmed baking sheet with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Toss mushrooms with 2 tablespoons olive oil in large bowl to coat.  Arrange mushrooms, gill-side up, in single layer on prepared baking sheet.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast until tender, about 45 minutes.  Cool.  Cut mushrooms into 1/3-inch-thick slices.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add prosciutto; sautÈ until browned, about 3 minutes.  Add shallots, rosemary, and thyme.  Cook until shallots are tender, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.  (Mushrooms and prosciutto-shallot mixture can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and chill).
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Sauce:  Bring milk, broth, and bay leaf to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Remove from heat.  Let stand 10 minutes; discard bay leaf.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Whisk in flour; stir 2 minutes.  Whisk in hot milk mixture; bring to boil, whisking frequently.  Reduce heat to low; simmer 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Remove from heat; stir in GruyËre, Parmesan, and nutmeg.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Lasagna:  Cook noodles in large pot of boiling salted water until almost tender but slightly undercooked (noodles will finish cooking in oven).  Drain and rinse with cold water.  Drain again; pat dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Spread 1 cup sauce over bottom of prepared dish.  Arrange 1/3 of noodles over sauce, overlapping to fit.  Spread about 1 2/3 cups sauce over noodles.  Arrange 1/2 of mushrooms over sauce.  Scatter 1/2 of prosciutto mixture over mushrooms.  Arrange 1/2 of remaining noodles over mushrooms, overlapping to fit.  Spread 1 2/3 cups sauce over noodles.  Arrange remaining mushrooms over sauce, sprinkle with remaining prosciutto, and top with remaining noodles.  Spread remaining sauce over noodles, sprinkle Parmesan cheese over, and dot with butter.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake lasagna until top is golden brown and sauce is bubbling, about 45 minutes (about 1 hour if refrigerated).  Let stand 20 to 30 minutes before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
  2 1/2           cups  chopped onions
  1                cup  dry white wine
  12                    parsley sprigs -- plus
     1/2           cup  chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  2               cups  finely-chopped leeks
                        = (white and pale green parts only)
  2               cups  diced trimmed fennel bulb
  4            bottles  clam juice - (8 oz ea)
  4              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  2                     bay leaves
  1 3/4         pounds  thick halibut fillets -- cut 1 1/2" pieces
  10            ounces  sea scallops
  1                cup  crËme fraÓche*
  2              large  egg yolks

* CrËme fraÓche is sold at some supermarkets.  If unavailable, heat 1 cup whipping cream to lukewarm (85 degrees).  Remove from heat and mix in 2 tablespoons buttermilk.  Cover and let stand in warm, draft-free area until slightly thickened, 24 to 48 hours, depending on temperature of room.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

Combine mussels, 1 1/4 cups onions, wine, and 8 parsley sprigs in large pot; bring to boil.  Cover and cook until mussels open, shaking pot often, about 5 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer mussels to large bowl to cool (discard any mussels that do not open).  Strain cooking liquid into large measuring cup; discard vegetables in strainer.  Add enough water to cooking liquid to measure 2 cups total.  Remove mussels from shells if desired.

Melt butter in same large pot over medium heat.  Add remaining 1 1/4 cups onions, leeks, and fennel and sautÈ until leeks are soft, stirring frequently, about 7 minutes.  Add reserved mussel cooking liquid, 4 parsley sprigs, clam juice, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves.  Simmer uncovered until vegetables are tender and liquid has reduced by 1/3, about 25 minutes.  Add halibut and scallops to broth and simmer until just opaque in center, about 4 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer halibut and scallops to bowl.  Discard parsley sprigs, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves.

Whisk crËme fraÓche and egg yolks in medium bowl to blend.  Whisk in 1/2 cup hot cooking liquid from pot.  Gradually stir yolk mixture into stew.  Cook over medium heat until liquid thickens slightly, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes (do not allow mixture to boil).  Return halibut, scallops, and mussels to pan.  Cook until halibut is heated through, stirring often, about 5 minutes.  Stir in 1/2 cup chopped parsley.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve in warmed shallow bowls.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

What To Drink:  Muscadet, Chablis, or unoaked Chardonnay.

Comments:  In Normandy, this richly flavored stew would be served with a composed salad of watercress, shallots, and roasted beets.

* CrËme fraÓche is sold at some supermarkets.  If unavailable, heat 1 cup whipping cream to lukewarm (85 degrees).  Remove from heat and mix in 2 tablespoons buttermilk.  Cover and let stand in warm, draft-free area until slightly thickened, 24 to 48 hours, depending on temperature of room.  Refrigerate until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine mussels, 1 1/4 cups onions, wine, and 8 parsley sprigs in large pot; bring to boil.  Cover and cook until mussels open, shaking pot often, about 5 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer mussels to large bowl to cool (discard any mussels that do not open).  Strain cooking liquid into large measuring cup; discard vegetables in strainer.  Add enough water to cooking liquid to measure 2 cups total.  Remove mussels from shells if desired.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt butter in same large pot over medium heat.  Add remaining 1 1/4 cups onions, leeks, and fennel and sautÈ until leeks are soft, stirring frequently, about 7 minutes.  Add reserved mussel cooking liquid, 4 parsley sprigs, clam juice, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves.  Simmer uncovered until vegetables are tender and liquid has reduced by 1/3, about 25 minutes.  Add halibut and scallops to broth and simmer until just opaque in center, about 4 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer halibut and scallops to bowl.  Discard parsley sprigs, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk crËme fraÓche and egg yolks in medium bowl to blend.  Whisk in 1/2 cup hot cooking liquid from pot.  Gradually stir yolk mixture into stew.  Cook over medium heat until liquid thickens slightly, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes (do not allow mixture to boil).  Return halibut, scallops, and mussels to pan.  Cook until halibut is heated through, stirring often, about 5 minutes.  Stir in 1/2 cup chopped parsley.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve in warmed shallow bowls.

<DirT>
Comments:  In Normandy, this richly flavored stew would be served with a composed salad of watercress, shallots, and roasted beets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4           cups  very warm whole milk -- (120 degrees)
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- cut 1/2" pieces,
                        and at room temperature
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/4           cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  2          envelopes  active dry yeast
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
  6 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- more or less
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped walnuts
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
                        Vegetable oil
  1              large  egg yolk -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  whole milk -- for glaze

Pour milk into large bowl.  Mix in sugar, butter, and salt; cool to lukewarm.  Place 1/4 cup warm water in small bowl; mix in yeast.  Let stand 6 minutes.

Stir yeast mixture and 1 egg into lukewarm milk mixture.  Mix in 4 cups flour.  Beat with wooden spoon until mixture is smooth.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sponge stand until bubbles appear at edge, about 15 minutes.

Mix nuts and rosemary into sponge.  Mix in flour, 1/3 cupful at a time, until soft, slightly sticky dough forms.  Turn dough out onto floured surface and knead until smooth and no longer sticky, sprinkling with flour as needed, about 10 minutes.  Brush clean large bowl with oil.  Add dough; turn to coat.  Cover bowl with plastic.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Brush two 8 1/2- by 4 1/2- by 2 1/2-inch nonstick loaf pans with oil.  Punch dough down and turn out onto work surface; shape into two 8-inch-long loaves.  Place in pans.  Let rise, uncovered, until almost doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.

Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Using serrated knife, make shallow cut down center of each loaf.  Brush loaves with glaze.  Bake until golden and crusty, about 35 minutes.  Turn breads out of pans.  Cool on racks.

This recipe yields 2 loaves.

Comments:  The Shakers, who once had a number of active communities in New England, were known for their creative use of fresh herbs in cooking and baking.  This savory yeast bread is a typical example.  It is delicious freshly baked or toasted the following day.

Comments:  Kathy writes; "Having lived in one of America's major food cities most of my life, I am no stranger to good eating.  As much as my husband, Paul, and I love dining out, we particularly like making meals together at home.  Some of our greatest hits have been the easiest and quickest dishes.  It seems that the more I cook, the more I realize that big flavor comes not from the time spent in the kitchen, but from the quality of the ingredients."

Look for oriental sesame oil in the Asian foods section of the supermarket.  Pasta or crusty bread are good accompaniments.

Comments:  MarÌa writes; "I came to the United States as an exchange student, after spending the first 18 years of my life in MÈrida, Yucat·n.  On school vacations I would go home and cook with my mother and sisters so that I wouldn't lose my touch.  My mother was a skilled cook, and I was lucky to have learned at her side.  Her food was so popular in our neighborhood that she sold portions of our daily meals to other families.  With nine well-fed kids, she said we were her best advertisement.

"I still take great pride in the food of my homeland.  Yucatecan cuisine is known for its Mayan influence, and the essential ingredients we use ó limes, spices, avocados, tomatoes, peppers ó make for wonderful flavors.  Now that ground spices are readily available and vegetables can be quickly chopped in a food processor, preparing traditional Mexican dishes is easier than ever."

Fresh and lively, like a cooked ceviche.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  5 1/2         pounds  boneless pork shoulder -- trimmed, and
                        tied to hold shape
     3/4           cup  hoisin sauce
  3            bunches  green onions -- cut on diagonal
                        into 1" pieces - (abt 6 cups)
  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
     1/4           cup  Scotch whisky
     3/4           cup  water -- or more if needed
                        Sliced green onions -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Heat oil in heavy large ovenproof pot over high heat.  Add pork shoulder, fat-side down; brown on all sides, turning often, about 12 minutes.  Remove pot from heat.

Spread hoisin sauce over pork; sprinkle with green onion pieces and peppercorns.  Cover pot and place in oven.  Cook until pork is very tender when pierced with fork, about 2 3/4 hours, adding water to pot by 1/4 cupfuls if mixture is dry.

Remove pot from oven.  Transfer pork to cutting board and tent with foil.  Let pork stand 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, spoon off fat from pan juices.  Stir whisky and 3/4 cup water into juices; boil 2 minutes.  Add more water by tablespoonfuls if sauce is too thick, or boil to reduce sauce if too thin.

Cut pork crosswise on slight diagonal into 1-inch-thick slices.  Garnish with sliced green onions.  Pour pan sauce over pork and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

What To Drink:  Uncork an Australian Merlot or a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.

Comments:  Hoisin sauce ó a combination of soybeans, garlic, chiles, and spices ó lends a sweet-spicy flavor to this pork roast.  Look for it at Asian markets and well-stocked supermarkets.

  1                     butternut squash - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, halved
                        lengthwise, seeded, halved crosswise,

Pour dressing over and toss to coat, adding more broth by tablespoonfuls if dressing is too thick.  Season salad to taste with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 main-course or 8 side-dish servings.

Comments:  Pam writes; "I'm originally from California, but my husband and I moved to Wisconsin so we could live in the country.  We raise animals and grow most of our own fruits and vegetables.  I like being able to just walk outside and pick fresh ingredients that don't take a lot of time to prepare.  Serious grocery shopping is a long drive away, but thanks to the Internet, I can order just about any specialty food I want."

Thin slices of cooked roast beef can stand in for the chicken.

                   Sweet And Spicy Chipotle-Glazed Ribs

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              pound  baby back pork rib rack
     1/4           cup  canned chipotle chiles*
     3/4           cup  red currant jelly
  5        tablespoons  pomegranate molasses**
     1/4           cup  low-salt chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice

* Chipotle chiles canned in a spicy tomato sauce, often called adobo, are available at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and Latin markets.

** Pomegranate molasses is a sweet-tart syrup made from reduced pomegranate juice.  It can be found at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and Middle Eastern markets.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line rimmed baking sheet with foil; place metal rack on sheet.  Sprinkle ribs all over with salt and pepper; place, meat-side down, on rack.

Press chiles through sieve into heavy small saucepan (discard solids in sieve).  Add remaining ingredients to pan.  Stir to blend over medium heat until sauce comes to boil.  Season sauce to taste with salt.  Transfer 1/2 cup sauce to small bowl and reserve.

Brush ribs with 2 tablespoons sauce from pan.  Turn ribs over; brush with 2 tablespoons sauce.  Roast ribs until very tender, brushing with 2 tablespoons sauce every 15 minutes, about 1 1/2 hours.  Cut rack into individual ribs.  Serve ribs with reserved sauce.

To puree canned chipotle chiles: Place chiles and adobo sauce in a small strainer set over a small bowl or saucepan.  Because canned chipotles are soft, you can simply use a rubber spatula to mash them through the strainer into the bowl, leaving the skins and seeds behind.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Look for meaty ribs that aren't over-trimmed; the bones on top shouldn't show through.  This recipe doubles or triples easily.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried black beans -- rinsed
  1                cup  chopped white onion
  4              large  fresh epazote sprigs
                        = (or marjoram sprigs)
  2        tablespoons  lard or corn oil

                        crushed in plastic bag or in mortar with
                        pestle
     1/2           cup  corn oil -- for frying
  18                    white corn tortillas - (5" to 6" dia)
  1 1/2           cups  crumbled queso fresco) - (abt 6 oz)
                        = (or feta cheese
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  6        tablespoons  crema mexicana*
                        = (or sour cream)
  3                     pickled jalapeÒo chiles -- halved lengthwise

* Cultured Mexican cream with a slightly nutty flavor and consistency of thin sour cream.

Place beans in heavy large pot.  Add enough cold water to cover by 2 inches.  Add 1/2 cup onion, epazote, lard, garlic, and aniseed; bring to boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until beans are just tender, adding more boiling water by cupfuls if less than 1 inch of water covers beans, and stirring occasionally, about 1 hour (beans should have soupy consistency).  Season beans generously with salt; continue to simmer until very tender, about 15 minutes longer.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cool slightly, cover, and chill.  Rewarm beans before continuing.)

Drain beans, reserving bean cooking liquid.  Place 3 cups beans (about half) and 1 1/2 cups bean cooking liquid in blender.  Puree until smooth.  Transfer sauce to large saucepan.  Repeat with remaining beans and bean cooking liquid (supplementing with water if necessary).  Season sauce with salt and pepper.  Bring sauce to simmer; reduce heat and keep warm over low heat.

Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add 1 tortilla and heat 20 seconds.  Using tongs, turn tortilla over and cook until beginning to bubble and soften, about 20 seconds longer.  Dip tortilla into warm bean sauce to coat.  Place tortilla on plate; fold into quarters.  Repeat with remaining tortillas and sauce, arranging 3 folded tortillas in center of each of 6 plates.  Spoon additional bean sauce over.  Top with cheese, remaining 1/2 cup onion, cilantro, and crema, then pickled jalapeÒo chile half.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Enchiladas, entomatadas, and enfrijoladas are all different preparations that take a corn tortilla and bathe it in a sauce of chiles, tomatoes, thick cream, or ó as they prefer in Oaxaca ó long-simmered black beans.  While it is traditional to fold them into quarters or thirds, you can also fold them over once.  Wait to season the beans with salt until they are just soft.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     beets - (2 1/2" dia) -- trimmed, scrubbed
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             medium  leeks, white and pale green parts only -- trimmed, halved
                        lengthwise, and thinly sliced - -- (abt 3 cups)
  2               cups  Chianti
                        = (or other dry red wine)
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Toss beets with 2 tablespoons oil in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Roast beets uncovered until tender when pierced with knife, about 1 hour.  Cool beets slightly, then slip off peel.  Cut beets into quarters.

Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add leeks and sautÈ until translucent and tender, about 12 minutes.  Add beets to skillet; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  SautÈ 5 minutes.

Add Chianti and bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until wine almost evaporates and glaze coats beets, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Add butter and stir until melted.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer to bowl and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The wine glaze both balances the natural sweetness of the beets and intensifies the savory beet flavor.  In Tuscany, this is a favorite side dish for game and fowl.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Toss beets with 2 tablespoons oil in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Roast beets uncovered until tender when pierced with knife, about 1 hour.  Cool beets slightly, then slip off peel.  Cut beets into quarters.

<DirT>
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add leeks and sautÈ until translucent and tender, about 12 minutes.  Add beets to skillet; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  SautÈ 5 minutes.
</DirT>

Add Chianti and bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until wine almost evaporates and glaze coats beets, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Add butter and stir until melted.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer to bowl and serve.

Comments:  The wine glaze both balances the natural sweetness of the beets and intensifies the savory beet flavor.  In Tuscany, this is a favorite side dish for game and fowl.

                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     kabocha squash - (2 3/4 to 3 lbs) -- halved crosswise,
                        and seeded
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1                cup  low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley -- divided

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray.  Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil inside each kabocha squash half and brush to coat.

Scoop out squash flesh into bowl and mash until almost smooth.

Melt butter in skillet over medium-high heat until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes.  Add garlic and thyme and stir 1 minute.  Add butter mixture and 1 cup broth to squash and mash until smooth.  Season generously with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.  Add more broth if desired and rewarm in microwave before continuing.)

Stir 2 tablespoons parsley into squash.  Sprinkle squash with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and serve.
