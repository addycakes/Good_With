  1         tablespoon  freshly-grated ginger root
  8             ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed,

  4             ounces  uncooked whole-wheat spaghetti -- broken in half
     3/4           cup  sliced carrot

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  water
     1/4           cup  uncooked couscous
  1              ounce  fat-free sugar-free instant
                        banana pudding and pie filling mix
  2               cups  fat-free skim milk -- cold
  1              large  ripe bananas -- sliced

Bring water to a boil in a microwave-safe bowl in microwave.  Carefully remove from microwave and stir in couscous.  Cover with plastic wrap and let stand 5 minutes until couscous is tender.

Meanwhile, prepare pudding according to package directions using fat-free milk.  Stir in couscous (it is okay if couscous is still warm).  Let stand 5 minutes until pudding is set.

To make parfaits, layer about 2 tablespoons of pudding, then 2 tablespoons of bananas, 2 tablespoons of pudding, then 2 tablespoons of strawberries in each of 4 tall parfait or other tall thin glasses.  Repeat layers once.  Garnish with mint sprigs if desired.  Serve immediately.

     2/3          cups  strawberries
     2/3           cup  blueberries
     2/3          cups  raspberries

  3          teaspoons  Splenda No Calorie Sweetener

Preheat broiler to high.

Place berries in a medium bowl; toss with 3 teaspoons of Splenda and lemon juice.  Spoon into a shallow, ovenproof baking dish large enough to hold all berries in a single layer.  Place dish three to four inches from broiler and cook until fruit just starts to burst, about 5 minutes.  Remove from oven and set aside.

Combine tofu, milk, vanilla extract and remaining 3 teaspoons of Splenda in a blender or bowl of a food processor and blend until smooth, about 2 to 3 minutes.

To serve, divide berries between 4 shallow bowls and top with vanilla sauce.  (Note: Custard sauce can be stored, covered, up to 5 days in refrigerator.)

  4             medium  carrots -- finely grated
     1/2         small  onion -- finely grated
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh oregano
  1                cup  fat-free egg substitute
     1/2           cup  whole-wheat matzo meal
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste

                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/2           cup  canned tomato sauce -- heated

Stir together carrots, onion, oregano, egg substitute and matzo meal in a medium bowl; season to taste with salt and pepper.  If batter is too dry to mold together, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons of water.

Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and warm over medium heat.

Spoon batter into skillet by heaping tablespoonfuls and flatten with a spatula.  Cook until nicely browned, about 4 to 5 minutes per side.  Remove from pan and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm; repeat with remaining batter.  Serve hot with tomato sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings; two 3-inch pancakes and about 1 1/3 tablespoons of tomato sauce per serving.

Comments:  We forgo tradition with this potato-free version of latkes.  Make a batch in advance of your Hannukah celebration, then simply warm them in the oven before serving.

  1             medium  celery -- stalk, chopped
  1              small  green peppers -- chopped

  2               cups  fat-free chicken broth
  1                cup  uncooked long-grain white rice

Coat a large, nonstick saucepan with cooking spray.  Over high heat, sautÈ sausage until crispy on edges.  Add onion, celery and green pepper; sautÈ until tender.

Reduce heat and stir in cayenne, thyme, salt, pepper and garlic; sautÈ until garlic is fragrant.

Stir in chicken, tomatoes, broth and rice.  Bring to a simmer, cover and let cook until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1 1/4 cups per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 7

Flavor Booster:  Popcorn rice, a specialty of Louisiana, is a delicious substitute for long-grain rice.  The rice, which has a mild nutty taste like basmati rice, is available through gourmet food stores and Internet specialty shops.

Comments:  This New Orleans specialty is a great choice for feeding your Mardi Gras crowd.  Make it in advance and reheat before your guests arrive.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1              small  onion -- chopped
     1/4           cup  sweet red pepper -- chopped
  1                     average red jalapeÒo pepper or
                        other hot chile -- cored, seeded,
                        and minced (do not touch seeds with bare
                        hands)
  1              pound  snapper or cod fillets -- skinned, and
                        cut into bite-size pieces
  2             medium  tomatoes -- cored, chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  fat-free chicken broth
     1/2           cup  cooked pearl-variety couscous
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh chives
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice

Coat a medium nonstick pot with cooking spray.  Add onion, red pepper and chile; sautÈ, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes.  Add fish and cook 1 minute.

Add tomatoes, thyme, salt, pepper and broth.  Simmer until fish is cooked through, about 5 minutes.

Stir in couscous, chives and lemon juice; heat through.

Freezing and thawing instructions:  Prepare stew recipe and place cooled product in a freezer-safe container, cover tightly and freeze.  When ready to eat, thaw in the refrigerator and then reheat in covered saucepan over medium heat, about 5 minutes, or in microwave on medium power until hot.  Or, remove frozen stew from container and place in a saucepan.  Cover and heat over medium heat, breaking up stew with a spoon as it softens, about 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1 1/4 cup per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  Red snapper lends excellent flavor to this hearty stew.  You could use cod to save a few dollars if you don't mind a softer texture.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     3/4           cup  butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  2              large  eggs
  2 1/2           cups  uncooked oatmeal
     1/2           cup  dried cherries

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt together in a small bowl; set aside.

Place room temperature butter into bowl of a mixer and mix with a paddle attachment until smooth, or beat with an electric mixer.  Slowly pour granulated sugar in an even stream into butter and mix on high speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Pour in brown sugar, mix until incorporated and then scrape mixture down from sides of bowl.

Slowly beat in each egg one at a time until incorporated.  Slowly beat in flour mixture until incorporated.

Scrape mixture down from sides of bowl and stir in oatmeal and then dried cherries.  (Note: Freeze dough at this point or continue to step 6 for baking.)

Scoop rounded teaspoonfuls of dough onto a nonstick sheet pan, a pan lined with parchment paper or a silicon baking mat about 1 1/2 inches apart.

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until edges are set.  Cool completely.  Either serve cookies or stack between sheets of waxed paper in an air-tight container and freeze for up to two weeks before serving.

This recipe yields 36 servings; about 1 cookie per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 2

Comments:  Moist and chewy, chocolate and cherries make these cookies sinfully rich.  Make the cookie dough ahead of time, freeze it and then bake anytime for that fresh-out-of-the-oven taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  reduced-sodium fat-free chicken broth
                        = (or vegetable broth)
  1             medium  baked potato - (abt 8 oz) -- peeled, diced
  1                cup  chopped onion
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper -- or to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh asparagus -- ends trimmed,
                        cut into small pieces
  7             ounces  jarred roasted red peppers in water -- drained
  8             ounces  lite silken tofu

In medium saucepan, bring broth, potato, onion, garlic, salt and cayenne pepper to a boil over medium-high heat.  Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 3 minutes.  Add asparagus; cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool slightly.

Meanwhile, puree roasted peppers in blender until smooth.  Spoon pureed peppers into small bowl and set aside.  Rinse blender.

Puree asparagus mixture and tofu in blender until smooth (or use an immersion blender in saucepan).

Ladle soup into bowls and drizzle pepper puree over top; swirl into soup with a knife.  Serve hot or cold.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1 1/2 cups of soup and 1 1/2 tablespoons of pepper puree per serving.

Comments:  A cream soup without cream?  Sure!  Pureed silken tofu helps yield a smooth texture without imparting any taste.  The roasted pepper puree boosts flavor and does wonders for eye-appeal.

  6              whole  reduced-fat cinnamon graham crackers
  2        tablespoons  butter
  11            ounces  fat-free sweetened condensed milk

Melt butter on stove top or in microwave and pour over graham cracker crumbs, mixing with a fork until completely moistened.  Press crumbs evenly onto bottom of a 9-inch pie pan; place crust in refrigerator while preparing lemon filling.

Place condensed milk and eggs into a bowl and mix until smooth.  Add lemon juice and zest and stir until incorporated.  Pour milk mixture into prepared crust.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  baking-variety potatoes -- cooked, quartered
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
                        = (or chipotle chili powder)
     1/4      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  6             slices  cooked Canadian-style bacon -- finely chopped
     3/4           cup  Kraft Free Shredded Cheddar Cheese -- or other brand
  2             medium  tomatoes -- diced
  3             medium  scallions -- finely chopped
     3/4           cup  fat-free sour cream

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Scoop out flesh of potatoes, leaving about an 1/8-inch of potato flesh in potato.  (Note: Reserve remaining potato flesh for another use such as mashed potatoes.)

In a small bowl, combine oil, chili powder and hot pepper sauce.  Using a pastry brush, brush inside potato wedges with oil mixture.  Place potato wedges in a single layer on a large nonstick baking sheet.  Sprinkle with bacon and cheese.

Bake until cheese melts and potatoes are heated through, about 15 minutes.  Sprinkle with tomatoes and scallions and serve with sour cream on the side.

This recipe yields 8 servings; 2 potato skins and about 1 1/2 tablespoons of sour cream per serving.

PointsÆ Value:  4

Comments:  Make these sensational spuds as is, or milder and sweeter by using fat-free mozzarella instead of cheddar and pineapple tidbits instead of tomato.  Super Bowl fans will love them!

Place room temperature butter into bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix until smooth, or beat with an electric mixer.  Add sugar in a slow steam and mix on high speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Slowly beat in each egg one at a time until incorporated and then mix in applesauce.  Scrape down sides of bowl.

Slowly beat flour mixture into butter mixture until incorporated.  Mix in coffee.  Scrape down sides of bowl again and stir in chocolate chips.

Scrape batter into prepared pan, spread evenly throughout and smooth top.  Bake until center springs back when pressed lightly, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Cool completely, cut into 16 pieces and serve.  Or, freeze whole in an air-tight container for up to two weeks before cutting and serving.

     1/2           cup  sweetened frozen whole strawberries
     3/4           cup  Egg Beaters Refrigerated Egg Whites
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2       teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4             medium  strawberries -- sliced

Line a large loaf pan with plastic wrap, making sure to leave extra wrap hanging over edges.  (Note: To get the wrap completely into the edges, place the plastic wrap into the pan and fill the pan with water.  Press the wrap into the corners and then pour out the water.)

Puree frozen, sweetened berries in a food processor or blender.

Place egg whites and cream of tartar in a medium bowl and beat with an electric mixer until frothy.  Slowly add in sugar and beat to soft peaks; set aside.  (Note: Since this dessert is not cooked, please make sure you only use pasteurized egg whites as recommended above.)

Place half of whipped topping in a medium bowl.  Fold in berry puree and then fold in half of meringue (egg mixture).  Pour strawberry mixture into loaf pan and place in freezer for 5 minutes.

Place remaining whipped topping into a medium bowl.  Fold in vanilla and then fold in remaining meringue (egg mixture).

Remove loaf pan from freezer.  Top strawberry mousse with sliced fresh berries and then top berries with vanilla mousse.  Smooth with back of a spoon, cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm.  Keep frozen for up to 1 month.

To serve, remove mousse from pan by grabbing onto plastic wrap.  Flip onto a chilled plate and remove plastic wrap completely.  Slice into 10 pieces and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  table salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     2/3           cup  unsweetened applesauce
  1                cup  canned pumpkin
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  fat-free egg substitute
     2/3           cup  fat-free skim milk

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Coat a 12-hole muffin tin with cooking spray.  Line with cupcake wrappers if desired.  (Note: We use both cooking spray and muffin wrappers to prevent any batter from sticking to the top of the pan.  Or, use nonstick pans instead.)

Combine flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg in a large bowl.

Combine applesauce, pumpkin, sugar, egg substitute and milk in medium bowl; mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon.

Add applesauce mixture into flour mixture and mix until completely incorporated.

Pour batter into muffin tins so each hole is about 2/3 full.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  Nothing says fall like the spice trinity of pumpkin, nutmeg and cloves.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3           servings  olive oil cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  2             medium  eggplants -- peeled, and
                        cut lengthwise into 1/4"-thick slices
     3/4      teaspoon  table salt
  1              pound  uncooked ground chicken breast
  1                cup  sliced onions
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
     1/3      teaspoon  dried parsley
     1/3      teaspoon  dried chives
     1/3      teaspoon  dried tarragon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  28            ounces  canned diced tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  canned tomato paste
     3/4           cup  Kraft Non-Fat Grated Cheese Topping
                        = (or other brand)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat an 9- by 13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.

Lay eggplant slices on paper towels and cover top with 3/4 teaspoon of salt.  Let stand 20 minutes to draw moisture out.

Meanwhile, coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and set pan over medium-high heat.  Add chicken and cook until browned, breaking up meat as it cooks, about 5 minutes.  Add onion and garlic and cook until onion is soft, about 3 minutes more.  Add fresh parsley, dried herbs, cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper, and stir to coat.  Cook 1 minute, until herbs and spices are fragrant.  (Note: You can replace the dried parsley, dried chives and dried tarragon with 1 teaspoon total of 'fines herbes,' if desired.)

Add tomatoes and tomato paste and bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until sauce thickens, about 15 minutes.  Transfer mixture to a large bowl and set aside.

Coat surface of same skillet with cooking spray (off heat) and set pan over medium-high heat.  Wipe salt from eggplant slices with paper towel and add eggplant to hot skillet.  Cook, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.

Arrange half of eggplant slices in bottom of prepared baking pan, slightly overlapping pieces to cover entire surface of pan.  Top eggplant with chicken mixture and then top chicken with 1/4 cup of grated topping.  Top with remaining eggplant slices and remaining grated topping.

Bake until top is golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 45 minutes.  Let stand 10 minutes, slice into 6 pieces and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  We put a spin on moussaka with this mouth-watering casserole, using chicken instead of lamb or beef, and a zesty tomato sauce instead of bÈchamel.  You won't miss all that fat for a second!

</DirT>
<DirT>
Lay eggplant slices on paper towels and cover top with 3/4 teaspoon of salt.  Let stand 20 minutes to draw moisture out.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and set pan over medium-high heat.  Add chicken and cook until browned, breaking up meat as it cooks, about 5 minutes.  Add onion and garlic and cook until onion is soft, about 3 minutes more.  Add fresh parsley, dried herbs, cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper, and stir to coat.  Cook 1 minute, until herbs and spices are fragrant.  (Note: You can replace the dried parsley, dried chives and dried tarragon with 1 teaspoon total of &apos;fines herbes,&apos; if desired.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add tomatoes and tomato paste and bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until sauce thickens, about 15 minutes.  Transfer mixture to a large bowl and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Coat surface of same skillet with cooking spray (off heat) and set pan over medium-high heat.  Wipe salt from eggplant slices with paper towel and add eggplant to hot skillet.  Cook, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange half of eggplant slices in bottom of prepared baking pan, slightly overlapping pieces to cover entire surface of pan.  Top eggplant with chicken mixture and then top chicken with 1/4 cup of grated topping.  Top with remaining eggplant slices and remaining grated topping.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake until top is golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 45 minutes.  Let stand 10 minutes, slice into 6 pieces and serve.

Comments:  We put a spin on moussaka with this mouth-watering casserole, using chicken instead of lamb or beef, and a zesty tomato sauce instead of bÈchamel.  You won&apos;t miss all that fat for a second!

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice from Key limes
  1              pound  raw boneless skinless chicken breasts -- four 4-oz pieces
  3             medium  oranges -- sectioned, white
                        pith and seeds removed
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice from Key limes
  2        tablespoons  chopped scallions
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro
  1           teaspoon  chopped green chilies -- or more to taste

Combine Worcestershire sauce, 3 tablespoons of lime juice and chicken in a ziptop plastic bag.  Refrigerate up to 4 hours.

Meanwhile, combine remaining ingredients in a medium bowl to make salsa.  Refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hour.

Preheat grill or broiler.  Grill or broil chicken until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes per side.  Serve chicken with salsa.

Comments:  Take advantage of fresh citrus flavors with this lime and orange-infused recipe.  If you can't find Key limes, regular limes will do the trick, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            serving  olive oil cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  3             medium  potatoes -- peeled, diced
     1/2           cup  diced extra-lean ham, approx 11% fat
  1 1/2           cups  fat-free egg substitute
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh oregano
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste

Preheat broiler.

Coat a 10-inch, nonstick, ovenproof skillet with olive oil cooking spray.  Add potatoes and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and tender, about 10 minutes.  Note: Add water by the tablespoon to prevent sticking, if necessary.

Add ham, egg substitute, herbs, salt and pepper, and cook until almost firm, about 10 minutes.  Transfer skillet to broiler and broil until browned on top, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Cut into 4 wedges and serve.

Comments:  Make use of leftover Chistmas ham with this flavorful frittata.  If you don't happen to have the herbs we've chosen, give thyme, basil or others a try.

                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  spaghetti squash
     1/2         pound  lean ground turkey
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1             medium  garlic clove -- minced
  29            ounces  canned diced tomatoes -- undrained
  1           teaspoon  dried Italian seasoning
  6             ounces  fat-free ricotta cheese
  1              large  egg
  1            serving  nonstick cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/2           cup  Kraft Free Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
                        = (or other brand)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Halve squash lengthwise; scoop out seeds.  Place squash, cut sides down, in a large baking dish and prick skin all over with a fork.  Bake until tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook turkey in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until brown, about 5 minutes.  Drain, remove from skillet and set aside.

In same skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add onion and garlic and stir-fry for 5 minutes, or until tender.  Stir in diced tomatoes and Italian seasoning; bring to boil.  Reduce heat; add cooked turkey and simmer uncovered, 5 minutes, or until desired consistency, stirring often.

Place ricotta cheese and egg in food processor or blender and puree until smooth.

Coat a 9-inch glass pie plate with cooking spray.  Remove squash from oven and increase oven temperature to 375 degrees.

Using a fork, carefully rake stringy squash pulp from shell, separating it into strands that look like spaghetti.  Arrange spaghetti squash strands in bottom and up sides of pie plate to form a crust.

Add ricotta cheese mixture and gently spread over squash.  Pour tomato-turkey sauce over cheese mixture and sprinkle with mozzarella.  Bake for 20 minutes.  Remove from oven and let stand 5 minutes before slicing into 6 pieces.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  Cooked spaghetti squash makes an excellent substitute for regular pasta.  It's filling comfort food, and kids will love it, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  frozen mixed vegetables
     1/8      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  16            ounces  fat-free egg substitute
  2              large  eggs
  1            serving  butter-flavor cooking spray
     3/4           cup  bottled marinara or
                        basil-flavored pasta sauce
  3        tablespoons  shredded Parmesan cheese

Preheat broiler.

Place vegetables, thyme, salt and pepper in a small pot.  Cook over medium heat until vegetables are hot and any water from the frozen vegetables evaporates, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Cover and set aside.

Beat egg substitute and whole eggs together in a medium bowl.

Coat a large nonstick, oven-proof skillet with cooking spray.  Pour in half of egg mixture.  Cook over medium heat until eggs are partially set, about 3 minutes.  Spoon half of vegetable mixture over egg mixture and heat until cooked through, about 2 minutes more.

Using a spatula, gently fold omelet in half.  Spread a heaping 1/3 cup of marinara sauce over folded omelet and sprinkle with 1 1/2 tablespoons of shredded cheese.  Place 4 inches from broiler heat and broil until cheese melts and turns golden, about 1 minute.  Cover to keep warm and set aside.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.  Cut each omelet in half and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  Omelet's aren't just for breakfast anymore!  This combination of vegetables and marinara sauce turns your basic egg dish into a delicious, waistline-friendly meal, suitable for any time of day.

Preheat broiler.

<DirT>
Place vegetables, thyme, salt and pepper in a small pot.  Cook over medium heat until vegetables are hot and any water from the frozen vegetables evaporates, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Cover and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat egg substitute and whole eggs together in a medium bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Coat a large nonstick, oven-proof skillet with cooking spray.  Pour in half of egg mixture.  Cook over medium heat until eggs are partially set, about 3 minutes.  Spoon half of vegetable mixture over egg mixture and heat until cooked through, about 2 minutes more.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a spatula, gently fold omelet in half.  Spread a heaping 1/3 cup of marinara sauce over folded omelet and sprinkle with 1 1/2 tablespoons of shredded cheese.  Place 4 inches from broiler heat and broil until cheese melts and turns golden, about 1 minute.  Cover to keep warm and set aside.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.  Cut each omelet in half and serve.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  plain fat-free yogurt
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic salt
  1         tablespoon  dried dill weed
  1              pound  raw boneless skinless chicken breasts

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Combine mustard, yogurt, garlic salt and dill in a small bowl.  Thoroughly coat chicken with mustard sauce.

Cut 4 sheets of aluminum foil large enough to wrap each chicken breast individually.  Place a prepared chicken breast on each piece of foil.  Gather foil loosely around chicken and fold over to seal.

Place foil packs on a nonstick baking sheet.  Bake for 20 minutes.  Using oven mitts and keeping your face away from steam, open foil.  Broil chicken on foil until lightly browned and cooked through, about 3 to 5 minutes more.

Freezing and thawing instructions:  If freezing, bake chicken for 20 minutes only.  When foil packs are cool to the touch, place in plastic freezer bags and freeze.  When ready to use, thaw chicken in the refrigerator, remove foil and cook at 350 degrees until chicken is golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  Cooking this dish in foil helps steam the chicken so it stays moist.  Not a fan of dill?  Try another spice, such as curry or hot paprika.

                        into 1/8"-thick slices
  1             medium  yellow summer squash -- sliced crosswise
                        into 1/8"-thick slices
  2              small  sweet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        sliced crosswise into 1/8"-thick slices
  2              large  carrots -- peeled, and
                        sliced diagonally into 1/8"-thick slices
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  fresh oregano -- or to taste

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Coat 2 large baking sheets with cooking spray.

Place zucchini and squash in a single layer on one baking sheet.  Place potato and carrots on other sheet in single layer.  Coat vegetables with cooking spray and season tops of vegetables with salt and oregano.  (Note: Use a mandolin to evenly slice vegetables if you have one.)

Roast for 1 hour and then rotate trays.  Roast for 1 1/2 to 2 hours total, or until vegetables are crisp and dry.  (Note: To keep vegetables crisp, store in an airtight container or zip-top bag for 3 days.  To re-crisp already cooked vegetables that have gone soft, cook on a baking sheet for 10 minutes at 250 degrees.)

This recipe yields 6 servings; about 1/3 cup per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 1

Comments:  Roasting brings out the natural sweetness of the vegetables.  Try substituting in red potatoes, turnips or rutabagas for a delicious change of pace.

  1            serving  butter-flavor cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  9              small  plums -- unpeeled, sliced
     1/3           cup  dark brown sugar
     1/2           cup  reduced-calorie margarine
  1              large  egg
  1              large  egg white
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  Splenda No Calorie Sweetener
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground ginger
  1         tablespoon  powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Coat a 9-inch square pan with cooking spray.  Spread plums in pan, sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and set aside.

With an electric mixer, beat together remaining brown sugar and margarine until creamy.  Beat in egg, egg white and vanilla, scraping down sides of bowl, for 1 minute.  Beat in Splenda at medium speed for 1 minute.

In another bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and ginger.  Stir into egg batter and beat at low speed for 30 seconds to mix (batter will be thick); gently spoon batter over plums, spreading with back of spoon.

Bake cake until sides begin to pull away from pan and cake is light golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and set aside 30 minutes.

Place a large platter over pan and invert cake onto platter.  Dust with powdered sugar and cut into 9 squares.

This recipe yields 9 servings.

  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  9              whole  reduced-fat cinnamon graham crackers
  3        tablespoons  butter
  16            ounces  fat-free cream cheese
  1                cup  sugar
  2               cups  fat-free sour cream
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  canned pumpkin

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Coat a 9- by 13-inch baking pan with cooking spray or line bottom of pan with parchment paper.  Alternatively, you can use a 9- by 13-inch nonstick pan.

Grind graham crackers until fine in a food processor or place crackers in a resealable plastic bag and crush with rolling pin.  Place crumbs in a small bowl.

Melt butter on stove top or in microwave and pour over graham cracker crumbs.  Mix with a fork until completely moistened.

Press crumbs evenly into bottom of prepared pan and place in refrigerator while preparing pumpkin filling.

Place cream cheese in bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or beat with an electric mixer until smooth.  Add sugar and mix until incorporated.

Mix in 1 cup of sour cream until just combined and then add cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves.  Add remaining sour cream and mix until just combined.

Slowly beat in each egg one at a time until incorporated, and then mix in pumpkin.  (Note: For best results, all ingredients should be at room temperature and mixed as little as possible, until each ingredient is just combined.)

Pour pumpkin mixture into prepared pan, spread evenly throughout and smooth top.

Bake until set at edges, about 30 minutes.  (Note: The very center will be a little loose.)  Cool completely and refrigerate overnight before cutting into 18 pieces and serving.

This recipe yields 18 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  Serve these rich, creamy bars with a hot cup of mulled cider for a perfect holiday treat.  Bake and refrigerate for up to three days before serving.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  eggplants - (do not peel) -- sliced lengthwise
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1              large  onion -- chopped 1/4" pieces
  1              large  carrot -- chopped 1/4" pieces
  2             medium  sweet red peppers -- chopped 1/4" pieces
  3              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  3             medium  portobello mushroom caps -- chopped 1/2" dice
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme
                        = (or 1 tspn dried thyme)
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  15            ounces  canned tomato sauce
                        = (or 2 cups homemade tomato sauce)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Rub cut sides of eggplants with oil.  Place on a nonstick baking sheet cut-sides up.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes (eggplant should not be cooked entirely through).  Remove from oven and flip over with a spatula; let cool on baking sheet.  Leave oven on.

Meanwhile, coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat.  Add onions, carrot and peppers.  SautÈ until soft and slightly browned, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Add garlic and mushrooms.  Increase heat to high and continue to sautÈ until mushrooms soften and release their juices, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in parsley and thyme; season to taste with salt and pepper.

Scoop out flesh of cooled eggplant with a soup spoon, leaving about a 1/4-inch of eggplant flesh in skin.  Coarsely chop flesh and add to mushroom mixture; mix well.

Fill each eggplant shell with about 1 1/2 cups of filling.  Place stuffed eggplant shells in a nonstick 9- by 13-inch pan.  Spoon 1/2 cup of tomato sauce over each stuffed eggplant shell.  Bake for 15 minutes, remove from oven and let cool.

Freezing and thawing instructions:  Freeze each cooled eggplant half, topped with sauce, in individual containers.  When ready to eat, thaw and microwave.  Or, thaw and reheat for about 15 to 20 minutes in a 350 degrees oven.

This recipe yields 4 servings; one stuffed eggplant half per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  This delicious vegetarian casserole comes ready in four portion-controlled packages.  Freeze them individually for sensational single meals.

  1              large  red onion
  1             medium  eggplant -- peeled
  1             medium  zucchini
  1             medium  yellow pepper
  1             medium  sweet red pepper
  1              pound  extra-firm tofu
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  3              large  garlic cloves
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- extra virgin
     1/8           cup  fresh lemon juice
                        = (abt the juice from one lemon)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Coat 2 baking sheets with cooking spray.

Slice onion in half and then cut each half into quarters.  Slice eggplant, zucchini (slice diagonally), and peppers into 1/4-inch slices.  Slice tofu across into 8 slices, about 1/4-inch thick.

Place onions on one half of a baking sheet and peppers on other half.  Place eggplant and zucchini separately on second baking sheet.  Coat tops of vegetables with cooking spray.  Roast 15 minutes and then rotate baking sheets; roast 15 minutes more.  Turn off oven and leave vegetables in oven to keep warm.

Place rosemary, parsley and garlic in bowl of food processor; add oil and lemon juice and blend until smooth, about 3 to 4 minutes; set aside.

Spread about one heaping tablespoon of herb mixture onto both sides of each tofu slice.  Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat.  Place tofu in heated pan and brown both sides of tofu, about 2 to 4 minutes per side.

To serve, place one slice of tofu on a plate.  On top of tofu, stack one slice of eggplant, one slice of red pepper and one wedge of red onion; top with an other slice of tofu and then top that with one slice each of yellow pepper and zucchini, and another piece of red onion.  Drizzle with remaining herb mixture.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.

                  Rosemary And Garlic Grilled Pork Loin

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3             medium  garlic cloves -- crushed
  2        tablespoons  fresh rosemary
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pound  lean pork tenderloin
                        = (use one whole loin)
  4               cups  arugula
     1/2           cup  fat-free red wine vinaigrette

Prepare grill for medium-hot, indirect cooking, or preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Mix together oil, garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper, crushing rosemary slightly with a spoon as you mix.  Spread mixture over pork, covering entire surface.  Wrap loin tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour (and up to overnight).

Remove plastic wrap and place pork on grill.  Grill outdoors over indirect heat, turning occasionally, until a meat thermometer measures an internal temperature of 155 to 160 degrees, about 25 minutes.  Or, indoors, place tenderloin in a shallow roasting pan and roast until internal temperature measured with a meat thermometer reads 155 to 160 degrees, about 20 minutes.  (Note: Pork loin can be pink and juicy inside and be fully cooked, but it is important that the temperature be no less than 160 degrees.)

Remove pork from grill or oven and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.  Serve with arugula tossed with vinaigrette.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 3 ounces of pork and 1 cup of arugula per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  The intense flavors of garlic and rosemary complement tender pork loin in this recipe.  It's easy enough to make last minute but elegant enough for a special occasion.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16            ounces  fat-free egg substitute
     1/2           cup  fat-free sour cream
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4             ounces  smoked salmon -- diced
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives -- fresh, chopped
  1            serving  olive oil cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)

Whisk together egg substitute, sour cream, salt and pepper in a large bowl; stir in salmon, capers and chives.

Coat a large ovenproof skillet with cooking spray and set pan over medium heat.  When pan is hot, add egg mixture and cook until mostly set but still runny on the surface, about 5 to 6 minutes.  (Note: Using a spatula, frequently lift the mixture from the sides of pan to allow uncooked eggs to run to the bottom.)

Place skillet under broiler until golden on top, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Slice into quarters and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  low-sodium soy sauce
  2             ounces  mirin (Japanese wine) - (abt 1/4 cup)
     1/4           cup  unpacked brown sugar
  4             pieces  ginger root - (1" each) -- thinly sliced
  4             medium  scallions -- chopped
  1              pound  sea bass fillets (black bass), cut several
  2                cup  cooked white rice

In a large soup pot, stir together soy sauce, mirin, sugar, ginger and 3 scallions.  Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.

Carefully place fish in pot and simmer for 5 minutes.  Reduce heat to very low and cook for 5 minutes more.

Spoon rice onto each of four plates.  Lift fish out of poaching liquid and divide amongst plates.  Spoon a little poaching liquid over each serving and sprinkle with remaining scallions.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 3 ounces of fish and 1/2 cup of rice per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 6

Comments:  Our bass is infused with the spicy taste of fresh ginger.  Look for an unwrinkled, smooth-skinned piece of ginger for the most optimal flavor.

  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1             medium  carrot -- finely chopped
  3             medium  garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  uncooked lean ground beef (with 7% fat)

Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion, carrot and garlic.  Cook, stirring frequently, until onion is translucent, about 6 minutes.

Add ground beef to skillet.  Cook, breaking up clumps with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 4 minutes.

Stir in tomatoes and puree, salt, red pepper flakes and basil and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes for flavors to blend and for sauce to thicken slightly.  Spoon over spaghetti.  (Note: Refrigerate extra sauce for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 2 months.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  uncooked whole-wheat spaghetti
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- minced
  1             medium  green pepper -- diced
  1                cup  sliced mushrooms
  1              pound  raw boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut into 2" pieces
  2          teaspoons  dried basil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  28            ounces  canned diced tomatoes
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley

Cook spaghetti according to package directions.  Drain, run under warm water and cover with foil to keep warm.

Meanwhile, heat oil in a large saucepan or stock pot over medium-high heat.  Add onion, garlic, green pepper and mushrooms.  SautÈ until vegetables are tender and mushrooms release juice, about 4 minutes.  Add chicken and sautÈ until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Add basil, curry powder, salt and black pepper; stir to coat.

Add tomatoes and bring mixture to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, partially cover and simmer 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in parsley.

Transfer spaghetti to four shallow bowls and spoon chicken mixture over top.

PointsÆ Value: 8

Comments:  Simmered in a rich tomato sauce with peppers, mushrooms and whole-wheat pasta, this dish truly satisfies.  A touch of curry powder gives it just the right kick.

  1            serving  cooking spray

  1             medium  onions -- finely chopped
  4             medium  garlic cloves -- minced
  45            ounces  canned black beans -- undrained
                        = (three 15-oz cans)
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  14 1/2        ounces  fat-free chicken broth

                        = (such as Rotel Tomatoes)
  11            ounces  canned yellow corn -- drained

Coat bottom of a large stockpot with cooking spray.  Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are soft but not brown, about 5 minutes.

Place one can of beans in blender; add sautÈed onion mixture, red pepper flakes and cumin.  Cover and blend on high until smooth, about 30 seconds.  Pour mixture back into stockpot.

Place second can of beans and broth in blender and puree until smooth; add to stockpot.

Stir third can of beans (do not puree first), tomatoes and green chilies, and corn into stockpot.  Bring to a boil, lower heat to medium and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings; about 1 1/2 cups of soup per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  The key to thickening up this soup without flour?  Pureeing some of the beans before cooking it.  You'll love the stick-to-your-ribs texture that results.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  baking potatoes -- scrubbed
  1                     garlic bulb
     1/2           cup  low-sodium chicken broth
     1/2           cup  nonfat sour cream
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
                        Paprika

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Pierce the potatoes several times with a fork; place on a baking sheet.  Wrap the garlic in foil and place alongside the potatoes.  Bake until the potatoes are tender and the garlic is browned and softened, 50 to 60 minutes.  Let the potatoes and garlic cool until comfortable to handle, about 15 minutes.

Halve the potatoes lengthwise; scoop the pulp into a large bowl, leaving the skins intact.  Cut the garlic bulb in half; squeeze out the pulp and add to the potato.  Add the broth, sour cream and pepper; stir and mash with a fork to the desired texture.  Spoon the stuffing back into the potato skins; sprinkle with the cheese and paprika.

Return the potatoes to the baking sheet and bake until heated through and lightly browned, about 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  uncooked lean ground beef (with 7% fat)
  1             medium  onions -- chopped
  14 1/2        ounces  canned Mexican-style stewed tomatoes -- undrained
  1 1/4            cup  canned tomato sauce
  2        tablespoons  canned green chili peppers -- diced, drained
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1                cup  dry whole-wheat elbow macaroni
  15            ounces  canned kidney beans -- drained, rinsed
     1/2           cup  Kraft Non-Fat Grated Cheese Topping -- or other brand

In a large skillet, cook beef and onion until meat is browned, about 10 minutes; drain off fat.  Stir in undrained stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce, chili peppers, chili powder and cumin; bring to a boil.

Stir in uncooked macaroni and kidney beans.  Return to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer until macaroni is tender, about 15 minutes.

To serve, spoon into bowls and sprinkle with grated topping.

This recipe yields 4 servings (about 1 1/4 cups of chili and 2 tablespoons of topping per serving).

Comments:  This one-pot hearty meal can easily be altered to meet your family's tastes.  Try subbing ground turkey breast for the beef and whole-wheat spirals or wagon wheels for the macaroni.
