  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice - (1 large lime)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- plus
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  4              small  tomatoes -- cut into 3/4" dice
  2             medium  ripe avocados -- cut 3/4" dice
  3                     scallions, white and light green parts -- thinly sliced
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  1         tablespoon  olive oil or vegetable oil
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1              large  Boston lettuce head -- torn large pieces
  1             medium  cucumber -- peeled, quartered
                        lengthwise, seeded, sliced thin diagonally
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped cilantro

In medium nonmetallic bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons lime juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Add tomatoes, avocados, scallions and garlic.  Using rubber spatula, gently fold to combine.  Season to taste with pepper.

In large bowl, whisk together oil, cumin, remaining tablespoon lime juice and 1/8 teaspoon salt.  Add lettuce and toss.  Season to taste with pepper.

Comments:  Avocado adds wonderful substance to this refreshing salad flavored with lime and a hint of cumin.  If desired, substitute jicama, peeled and cut into sticks, for the cucumber slices.

Pick up a variety of grilled vegetables in the deli section of your supermarket.  Heat the vegetables and serve with warmed flour tortillas, salsa, shredded Monterey Jack cheese if desired, and lime wedges to make fajitas to serve alongside the salad.

Meanwhile, in medium bowl, mix spinach, cottage cheese, scallions, blue cheese and 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper until well blended.  Gently stir in beans.  Set aside.

With small, sharp knife, score an "x" in base of each tomato.  Carefully drop tomatoes into boiling water and cook 20 seconds.  Remove from water with slotted spoon.  When cool enough to handle, peel tomatoes with small sharp knife and cut out cores.  Cut each tomato in half through equator.  With spoon, scoop out and discard seeds, then remove and discard about half of the flesh from each tomato half.

Stuff tomato halves with spinachñcheese mixture, then place in shallow casserole just large enough to hold tomatoes.  Bake until soft and beginning to exude juices, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, arrange salad greens in ring on each plate.  Carefully transfer one tomato half to center of each ring.  Serve with toasted bread slices.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 389 Cal; 25g Prot; 7g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 58g Carb.; 11mg Chol; 770mg Sod.; 13g Fiber.

Comments:  Lateñseason tomatoes are perfect for baking.  They're firm and sturdy, but more important, baking brings out the flavor that hasn't fully matured because the sunshine has diminished in the last month.  If you don't like blue cheese, substitute any creamy soft cheese, such as St. HonorÈ or explorateur.  Be sure to squeeze spinach as dry as possible to avoid a soggy filling.

Prepare four servings of quickñcooking brown rice.  Transfer to a serving bowl and toss with some chopped toasted walnuts, plenty of chopped fresh flatñleaf parsley and a little olive oil.

                          Best French Onion Soup

Categories    : Egg Free                        Soups/Stews
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  7               cups  halved and thinly-sliced onions - (to 8)
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  6               cups  low-sodium vegetable broth
     1/3           cup  dry sherry
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        = (or 1/2 tepn dried thyme)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     French bread loaf -- cut 1/2"-thk slices
  10            ounces  shredded Jarlsberg or Gruyere cheese - -- (to 12)

In large, heavy pot, melt 2 tablespoons butter with oil over medium heat.  Stir in onions, sugar, and salt.  Cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute.  Reduce heat, cover and cook 10 minutes.  Remove lid and cook 15 minutes more, stirring occasionally.  Add remaining butter to pot.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are caramelized and very soft, about 15 minutes.

Stir in flour and cook 3 to 4 minutes.  Stir in broth, sherry, thyme, salt to taste and pepper.  Cover and simmer 15 minutes, adding more salt if needed.

Preheat broiler.  Lightly toast bread slices.  Ladle soup into 6 ovenproof bowls or crocks and arrange on baking sheet.  Put enough bread on top of each serving -- cutting and fitting if necessary -- to cover soup.  Sprinkle bread with shredded cheese.  Broil until cheese is bubbly and golden.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The key to great onion soup is to cook the onions until they are completely caramelized: sweet, soft and dark golden brown.  Traditional recipes call for beef or chicken stock, but you can make an excellent onion soup using well-seasoned vegetable broth (if using cubes, use 6 cubes with 6 cups water).  Finish with a flourish of bubbly cheese, floating on a layer of French bread, and you'll have a soup that's rich and hearty enough to be a meal.

In large, heavy pot, melt 2 tablespoons butter with oil over medium heat.  Stir in onions, sugar, and salt.  Cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute.  Reduce heat, cover and cook 10 minutes.  Remove lid and cook 15 minutes more, stirring occasionally.  Add remaining butter to pot.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are caramelized and very soft, about 15 minutes.

Stir in flour and cook 3 to 4 minutes.  Stir in broth, sherry, thyme, salt to taste and pepper.  Cover and simmer 15 minutes, adding more salt if needed.

Preheat broiler.  Lightly toast bread slices.  Ladle soup into 6 ovenproof bowls or crocks and arrange on baking sheet.  Put enough bread on top of each serving -- cutting and fitting if necessary -- to cover soup.  Sprinkle bread with shredded cheese.  Broil until cheese is bubbly and golden.  Serve hot.

Comments:  The key to great onion soup is to cook the onions until they are completely caramelized: sweet, soft and dark golden brown.  Traditional recipes call for beef or chicken stock, but you can make an excellent onion soup using well-seasoned vegetable broth (if using cubes, use 6 cubes with 6 cups water).  Finish with a flourish of bubbly cheese, floating on a layer of French bread, and you&apos;ll have a soup that&apos;s rich and hearty enough to be a meal.

  5             medium  leeks
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     bay leaf
  2              large  carrots -- peeled, halved

Add carrots, squash, potatoes, 1/3 cup of broth and salt and pepper to taste.  Cover and cook over medium heat 15 minutes.  Add remaining broth in two stages, as liquid cooks off.  (You want to end up with a saucy glaze.  If there's too much liquid in pan when almost done, remove lid to reduce glaze.  If there's too little, add a tablespoon or so of water.)

After 12 to 15 minutes, all vegetables should be tender.  Remove bay leaf and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  small white potatoes -- unpeeled, and
                        cut into 1" dice
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  yellow onion -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     bell peppers -- chopped - (2 cups)
                        = (preferably red or yellow)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
  8              small  soy "sausages" -- thinly sliced
  4             ounces  fresh baby spinach -- coarsely chopped
  4              large  eggs
                        Chipotle powder -- (optional)

In large pot, place potatoes, and add enough cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil; then reduce heat, and simmer until potatoes are almost tender, 10 to 12 minutes.  Drain and cool.

In very large heavy skillet (see Comments), heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add onion, and cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften, 5 minutes.  Add potatoes, and cook, stirring occasionally, until crispy and brown, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic, bell peppers, rosemary and "sausages."  Cook, stirring occasionally, until peppers soften, about 10 minutes.  Stir in spinach, and cook, stirring often, just until spinach wilts.

Break eggs over hash, and cook until eggs are set.  Quickly flip eggs over to briefly cook on other side, about 1 minute.  Add salt and pepper to taste, and garnish with dash of chipotle powder if desired.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  If you do not have a large skillet, use two 10-inch skillets.  Cook onions and potatoes in one skillet and garlic, peppers, rosemary and breakfast links in another.  Add sausage mixture to potatoes just before adding eggs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR LEMON ANGLAISE ===
  1                cup  soy milk
     1/4           cup  coconut milk
     1/4           cup  light agave nectar
                        Grated zest of 1 lemon
     1/4      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  lemon extract
  2          teaspoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  arrowroot
  1              pinch  turmeric
  1              pinch  salt
                        === FOR FIG CAKE ===
  3        tablespoons  canola oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  canola oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Sucanat
  3               cups  fresh black Mission figs - (abt 18 figs) -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  blanched sliced almonds
  1                cup  unbleached white flour
     1/4           cup  whole-wheat pastry flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  egg replacer
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  almond milk
  5        tablespoons  light agave nectar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
  1 1/2    tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  dry sherry
                        Finely-chopped zest of 1 lemon

For Lemon Anglaise:  Whisk all of the ingredients together in a small saucepan until the arrowroot is dissolved.  Place over medium heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 7 minutes.  The mixture does not need to boil.

Remove from heat and let the lemon zest steep for 10 minutes.  Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer.  Let it cool, uncovered, in the refrigerator.  You can store it, covered, in the refrigerator for up to one week.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

For Fig Cake:  Brush a 9-inch round cake pan with 1 teaspoon of the canola oil, and line it with parchment paper.  Sprinkle the Sucanat onto the parchment and top with the sliced figs, fanning them out decoratively.

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Using a spice grinder or food processor, grind the almonds to a meal.  Place in a bowl.  Sift the white flour, pastry flour, baking powder, baking soda, egg replacer and salt into the bowl.

In a separate bowl, whisk the almond milk, agave, remaining 3 tablespoons of canola oil, vanilla extract, almond extract, lemon juice, sherry and lemon zest.  Pour the wet ingredients into the almond mixture and whisk just until smooth.

Pour the mixture on top of the figs in the prepared pan.  Carefully smooth out the batter with a spatula (being careful not to disturb the fan of figs on the bottom of the pan).  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick or small knife inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.  Let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes and then invert it onto a serving plate.  Remove parchment paper.  (You can store it, wrapped tightly, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.  After 2 days, you will need to rewarm it for the best flavor.)

To serve, cut the cake into 8 pieces.  Spoon some of the Lemon Anglaise on each plate and place a slice of warm cake on top.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Sucanat is a brand-name, unrefined, granulated sugar, and a powdered egg substitute is used instead of eggs; both, along with almond milk, are available in natural foods stores.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  carrots -- peeled
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- coarsely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced, plus
  2              whole  garlic cloves
  4               cups  low-sodium vegetable broth
  1                cup  apple juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried dill
  12            slices  thinly-sliced baguette
  1                cup  plain soy milk

Process carrots in food processor until finely chopped.

In large saucepan, heat 1 teaspoon oil over medium-high heat.  Add onion and minced garlic and cook, stirring often, until softened, 5 minutes.  Add chopped carrots and cook 3 minutes.  Stir in broth, apple juice and dill.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer until carrots are tender, 15 minutes.

Meanwhile make croutons: In heavy medium skillet, heat remaining oil.  In batches, cook baguette slices until toasted, 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Remove croutons from skillet and rub each slice with whole garlic.

Season soup to taste with salt and white pepper.  Remove pan from heat and stir in soy milk.

In blender or food processor, puree soup, in batches if necessary, until smooth.  Serve with croutons.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 231 Cal; 8g Prot; 4g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 32g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 289mg Sod.; 5g Fiber.

Comments:  The creamy texture of this colorful soup does not come from heavy cream, but rather from a combination of pureed vegetables and soy milk that thickens the soup without adding fat.  This soup can be served hot or cold.

Complete this meal with a chopped vegetable salad made of yellow or orange bell pepper, cucumber and tomato (or veggies of your choice) served in whole wheat pita pockets topped with your favorite dressing.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  raisins
                        = (or dried cranberries)
     1/3           cup  walnut halves or pieces -- (optional)
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  whole-wheat flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1                cup  old-fashioned rolled oats
     1/2           cup  toasted wheat germ
     1/2           cup  low-fat silken tofu
  1              large  egg
                        = (or equivalent egg substitute)
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
     1/3           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly coat 13- by 9-inch glass baking dish with cooking spray.

Place raisins (or dried cranberries) in small bowl.  Cover with boiling water and set aside to plump for 10 to 15 minutes.

If using walnuts, spread in small baking pan and toast in oven until fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes.

In medium bowl, combine both flours, baking soda, salt and cinnamon.  Stir in oats and wheat germ.  Drain raisins (or dried cranberries).  Coarsely chop walnuts if using.  Set aside.

In food processor, process tofu until smooth.  Add egg, oil, both sugars and vanilla.  Process until mixture is smooth, stopping once or twice to scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula.  Add reserved flour mixture, raisins (or dried cranberries) and walnuts; pulse on/off several times just until dry ingredients are moistened.  Using a spatula, scrape batter into prepared pan and spread into an even layer.

Bake until light golden and firm to the touch, 20 to 25 minutes.  Let cool completely in pan on wire rack.  Cut into bars.  (Bars will keep, well-wrapped at room temperature, for up to 3 days, or in freezer for up to 4 months.)

This recipe yields 24 bars.

Per Bar: 104 Cal; 28g Prot; 5g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 14g Carb.; 9mg Chol; 55mg Sod.; 1g Fiber.

Comments:  These bars are similar to old-fashioned, chewy oatmeal cookies, but they are more healthful than traditional recipes because they include tofu, rather than butter, plus whole wheat flour and nutty wheat germ.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped (1 cup)
  4             pounds  ripe tomatoes -- quartered
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        === PESTO ===
  1                cup  cilantro leaves - (packed)
     1/2           cup  fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves - (packed)
  1             medium  garlic clove -- crushed
  1         tablespoon  toasted sliced almonds*
  1 1/2    tablespoons  low-sodium vegetable broth
  1         tablespoon  Parmesan cheese
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice

* Note:  Toast almonds in small, dry skillet over medium heat, frequently shaking pan, until almonds are lightly browned, about 4 minutes.

In large nonstick saucepan, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, 7 to 8 minutes.  Add tomatoes and 2 cups water and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until tomatoes are completely softened, about 25 minutes.

In food processor or blender, process mixture, in batches if necessary, until smooth.  Strain through fine-mesh sieve into large bowl, using a rubber spatula to press mixture through mesh.  Add sugar and salt to taste.  Cover and chill soup at least 4 hours or overnight.

Make Pesto:  In blender or food processor, combine cilantro, parsley, garlic, almonds, cheese, lemon juice and broth.  Process until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl when necessary.  With motor running, gradually add oil through feed tube and process until well blended.  Transfer pesto to small bowl.

Ladle soup into shallow bowls.  Garnish each serving with pesto lightly swirled into soup.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 120 Cal; 4g Prot; 6g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 17g Carb.; 1mg Chol; 48mg Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Comments:  Perfectly ripe tomatoes reign supreme in this refreshing soup.  Prepare it several hours in advance so it has time to chill completely.  The cilantro pesto makes a flavorful addition.  It can also be used on pasta or grilled vegetables.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1                cup  finely-chopped onion
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     green or yellow bell pepper -- chopped
  1                cup  frozen corn
     1/4      teaspoon  chipotle chile powder -- or to taste
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  3               cans  black beans - (15 oz ea) -- rinsed, drained
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)

In large saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring often, 2 minutes.  Add bell pepper and corn and cook, stirring often, 2 minutes.  Stir in chipotle powder, chili powder, cumin and oregano and cook 1 minute.  Stir in beans, tomatoes and 3/4 cup water.

Reduce heat, partially cover pan and simmer, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes.  If chili becomes too thick, add 1/4 cup hot water.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  If desired, sprinkle chili with shredded cheese before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 341 Cal; 21g Prot; 2g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 63g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 25mg Sod.; 21g Fiber.

Comments:  This spicy chili really warms the bones on a cold evening. Chipotle powder is made from smoked jalapeÒo peppers.  Look for it in specialty gourmet stores.  To make the chili milder, omit the chipotle powder and reduce the chili powder to two teaspoons.

Delicious with cornbread.  Add a tossed green salad with low-fat bottled cilantro dressing.

Comments:  This spicy chili really warms the bones on a cold evening. Chipotle powder is made from smoked jalapeÒo peppers.  Look for it in specialty gourmet stores.  To make the chili milder, omit the chipotle powder and reduce the chili powder to two teaspoons.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Delicious with cornbread.  Add a tossed green salad with low-fat bottled cilantro dressing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  5        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  1              large  egg -- beaten
     1/3           cup  water
  10            ounces  smoked mozzarella cheese -- finely diced
  2               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying

Prepare dough:  In food processor, combine flour, salt and sugar. Add shortening and pulse on/off until mixture resembles cornmeal.  Add egg and water and pulse just until dough comes together in a ball.  Dough should be pliable; if necessary, add 1 teaspoon or so more water.

On lightly floured surface, roll out dough 1/8-inch thick.  Using a 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut out dough.  Gather up scraps into a ball, roll out and cut, until all dough is used.

Lightly brush top of each circle with water.  Place spoonful of diced cheese in center and fold circle to form half moon.  Seal edges by pleating with fingertips or pinching with fork.

Just before serving, pour oil to depth of 1 inch in heavy skillet or electric frying pan and heat to 350 degrees.  Working in batches, fry empanadas, turning with slotted spoon, until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes.  Drain empanadas on paper towels and serve.

This recipe yields about 20 empanadas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  walnut oil
  3        tablespoons  ice water - (to 6)
                        === FILLING ===
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  2          teaspoons  grated orange peel
  6               cups  coarsely-grated peeled Golden
                        Delicious apples - (abt 3 lbs)
  3        tablespoons  honey

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Coat baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.

In medium bowl, combine flour, sugar and salt.  Using fork, slowly stir oil into flour mixture until crumbly.  Stir in enough ice water so dough will hold together.  Turn dough out onto work surface and flatten into disk.

Roll dough between sheets of wax paper into a circle, 14 to 15 inches in diameter and approximately 1/16-inch thick, patching where necessary.  Remove top sheet and invert dough onto prepared baking sheet.  Cover and refrigerate while preparing filling.

In large, heavy saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.  Add sugar and stir until mixture turns deep gold, about 8 minutes.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean and orange peel.  Stir 1 minute.  Add apples.  Reduce heat to medium-low; cook until mixture is thick, golden and reduced to 2 1/4 cups, stirring often, about 40 minutes.  Stir in honey.  Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.  Discard vanilla bean.

Spread apple mixture over pastry, leaving 1 1/2-inch border around edge.  Fold pastry border over apples.  Bake 15 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees and bake until crust is golden and juices are bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes.

Using long spatula, loosen tart from baking sheet and slide onto serving platter.  Let cool slightly before serving.  Garnish with slivered almonds and curled lemon peel if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 417 Cal; 3g Prot; 16g Total Fat (5 Sat. Fat); 70g Carb.; 16mg Chol; 135mg Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Comments:  The pastry crust can be made up to one week ahead.  Cover it tightly and refrigerate.  The delicious apple filling can be made up to one day ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  medium shell pasta
  2 1/2           cups  diced ripe firm tomatoes - (2 large)
  1             medium  green bell pepper -- cut into short,
                        narrow strips  - (1 cup)
     1/2        medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  4             ounces  feta cheese -- crumbled
     1/3           cup  Greek black olives -- pitted if desired
     1/3           cup  low-fat vinaigrette -- or to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh dill
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon - (2 tbspns)

Bring large pot of water to a boil.  Add 1 tablespoon salt and pasta, stirring to prevent sticking.  Cook pasta until just tender.  Drain; rinse under cold running water and drain well.

Transfer pasta to large bowl.  Add remaining ingredients and toss gently until well combined.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 154 Cal; 6g Prot; 6g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 19g Carb.; 18mg Chol; 372mg Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Comments:  Using pasta in place of the usual lettuce turns Greek salad into a substantial and lively main dish.  Feel free to try other types of short pasta instead of the ones suggested here.

Serve with warm pita bread and hummus or baba ganouj (garlicky eggplant dip).  For an extra treat, pick up some rice-stuffed grape leaves.

  2               cups  low-sodium vegetable broth
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt or plain soy yogurt

Prepare charcoal grill, preheat gas grill to medium or see variation at end of recipe and skip to step 4.

Grill bell peppers, skin-side down, until skins are charred, about 10 minutes.  Place in large bowl and cover with plate; let stand 20 minutes.  (Alternatively, place peppers in small paper bag.  Close securely and let steam.)  When cool enough to handle, peel off charred skins and discard.  Set peppers aside.

Cut eggplant into 1/2-inch rounds.  Grill until flesh is tender, about 4 minutes per side.

Transfer peppers and eggplant to food processor.  Add tomato and broth and process until smooth.  Strain through fine-mesh sieve into large saucepan.  Add salt and pepper to taste.

Serve warm or chilled.  Ladle soup into shallow bowls and swirl or spoon yogurt over each serving.

Variation: To make this soup without firing up the grill, preheat oven to 400 degrees and roast quartered bell peppers, skin-side up, until skins are wrinkled and lightly colored, about 30 minutes.  Place in large bowl and cover with plate; let steam 20 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, peel off charred skins and discard; transfer peppers to blender or food processor.  Meanwhile, pierce whole, unpeeled eggplant in several places and roast until flesh is tender and skin is shriveled, about 40 to 50 minutes.  Slice in half and scoop out flesh into blender or food processor.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 127 Cal; 5g Prot; 2g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 17g Carb.; 4mg Chol; 117mg Sod.; 6g Fiber.

Comments:  For a more exotic appearance, instead of putting a dollop of yogurt on top of the soup, try making a swirl.  Spoon yogurt into small plastic bag, seal and snip off bottom corner.  Squeeze bag to swirl yogurt over soup.  Cut through swirl with a toothpick or sharp knife to create a ripple effect.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  small red potatoes -- halved
  1                cup  thin green beans or haricot verts -- cut 3" pieces,
                        and blanched
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh dill
     1/2           cup  crumbled goat cheese -- (optional)
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/3           cup  apple cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped shallots
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
     2/3           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Place potatoes in steamer basket that has been set in large saucepan.  Steam over boiling water until just tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove steamer basket from water.

Prepare charcoal grill or preheat gas grill to medium-high heat.  (Using a vegetable grilling rack will help keep potatoes from slipping through grates.)  Brush potatoes with a little olive oil and grill until tender and tinged with brown, turning often, about 6 minutes.

Meanwhile, make dressing:  In small bowl, whisk together vinegar, mustard, shallots and lemon peel.  Slowly whisk in oil until blended.  Stir in parsley.

Transfer potatoes to shallow serving bowl.  Add green beans, dill and cheese if using.  Pour 3/4 cup dressing over salad and toss to coat.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Per Serving: 227 Cal; 4g Prot; 8g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 38g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 55mg Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Comments:  If you've never grilled potatoes before, you're in for a real treat.  It is easier than you think and worth the effort.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === EGGPLANT TAPENADE ===
  1              small  eggplant
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  finely-chopped onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  thinly-sliced fennel
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
                        === SANDWICHES ===
  1            package  tempeh - (8 oz)
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce)
  2        tablespoons  mirin
     1/4      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne -- or to taste
  1              large  red or yellow bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  red wine vinegar
  2             medium  portobello mushrooms -- stems removed
  1                     French baguette
     1/4         pound  fresh spinach

Make Eggplant Tapenade:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Peel and dice eggplant.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and place on paper towels to drain.

In Dutch oven or large ovenproof skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, 1 minute.  Add garlic, fennel, remaining teaspoon salt, basil, oregano and thyme; cook, stirring often, 1 minute.  Stir in eggplant and tomato paste.  Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until eggplant begins to soften, about 3 minutes.  Transfer to oven and bake, uncovered, 35 minutes, stirring once or twice.

Prepare hot charcoal fire or preheat gas grill to medium-high.  Meanwhile, cut tempeh in half crosswise.  Cut again in half lengthwise to yield four pieces.  Steam tempeh over simmering water 20 minutes.  In shallow bowl, combine lemon juice, tamari, mirin, garlic and cayenne.  Add tempeh and let stand while you cook tapenade.

Cut bell peppers in half and remove seeds and ribs.  In small bowl, mix oil and vinegar.  Place tempeh, peppers and mushrooms on grill, brush with oil and cook until golden brown on both sides.  Alternatively, broil tempeh and vegetables, 5 to 10 minutes per side.

Cut mushrooms into thick slices.  Cut grilled bell pepper into 4 strips.  Trim ends from baguette.  Cut loaf in half lengthwise.  Spread 5 to 6 tablespoons tapenade onto bottom half (reserve remaining tapenade for another use), top with tempeh, mushrooms, bell pepper and greens.  Cover with top half of bread and cut into 4 equal pieces.  Serve right away.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Tapenade is a condiment hailing from Provence.  In its classic form, this thick paste is made from capers, anchovies, ripe olives, olive oil, lemon juice, seasonings and sometimes tuna.  This delectable sandwich combination can be served on French baguette or slices of whole grain bread.

Comments:  Tapenade is a condiment hailing from Provence.  In its classic form, this thick paste is made from capers, anchovies, ripe olives, olive oil, lemon juice, seasonings and sometimes tuna.  This delectable sandwich combination can be served on French baguette or slices of whole grain bread.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  sweet potatoes - (1 3/4 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened
  2              large  eggs -- beaten lightly
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped leeks

  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried thyme)
  1                     container part-skim ricotta - (15 oz)
  3           packages  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz ea) -- thawed, squeezed dry
  3              large  egg whites
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh dill or parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1            package  frozen puff pastry - (17 1/4 oz) -- thawed
                        === EGG WASH ===
  1                     egg -- beaten, mixed with
  1           teaspoon  water
                        Fresh herb sprigs -- for garnish

Peel and quarter sweet potatoes.  Place in large pot, cover potatoes by 1 inch with salted cold water and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain potatoes, transfer to medium bowl and, while still warm, coarsely mash.  Using electric mixer, beat in butter, eggs, salt and pepper to taste until smooth.

In large skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Add leeks and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 10 minutes.  Add mushrooms and garlic and cook, stirring often, until mushrooms release their liquid; allow to evaporate.  Stir in thyme and season to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper.  Remove pan from heat and let cool.

In medium bowl, mix ricotta cheese, spinach, egg whites, dill, red pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon salt until blended.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Unfold one puff pastry sheet and place on lightly floured surface.  Roll out to a 14-inch square, then cut dough into a 14-inch circle.  Transfer circle to ungreased 8 1/2- or 9-inch springform pan and press gently to fit into bottom and side (there will be some overhang for folding over top of pie).

Spoon sweet potato mixture into pastry and pat into even layer.  Spoon mushroom mixture over potatoes and spread evenly.  Top with spinach mixture (filling may come slightly over top of pan).  Carefully fold pastry overhang on top of the filling.  Brush edges with egg wash and seal.

Unfold second puff pastry sheet on lightly floured surface.  Roll out slightly, then cut into an 8 1/2- or 9-inch circle.  Place circle of dough over top and press edges into pan to seal.  Brush top with egg wash and, using a small sharp knife or razor blade, slash top in a cross-hatch pattern.

Bake 35 to 40 minutes.  When well browned, loosely cover top with foil.  Reduce heat to 350 degrees.  Carefully remove side of pan and brush sides with egg wash.  Bake until sides are golden, about 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove from oven and let cool slightly before cutting into wedges and serving.  Garnish each serving with fresh herb sprigs.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  whole wheat flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  low-fat firm silken tofu
  1              large  egg
                        = (or equivalent egg substitute)
  1                cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1              batch  Royal Icing or No-Egg Icing -- (see recipes)

In medium bowl, combine both flours, baking powder and salt.  Set aside.

In food processor, process tofu until smooth.  Add egg, sugar, oil and vanilla; process until smooth, stopping once or twice to scrape down sides of work bowl.  Add flour mixture and pulse on/off several times just until dough clumps together.  Transfer to lightly floured surface and knead several times.  Divide dough in half and press each piece into shape of a disk.  Dust each with flour and wrap in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line several baking sheets with parchment paper or coat with cooking spray.

Working with 1 disk at a time, on lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/8-inch thickness.  Using cookie cutter, cut out shapes.  Place cookies about 1/2-inch apart on prepared baking sheets.  Gather scraps, re-roll and cut.

Bake cookies, one sheet at a time, until light golden around edges, 10 to 15 minutes.  Transfer cookies to wire rack and cool completely.  (Cookies will keep in airtight container for up to 1 week.)  Decorate with Royal Icing or No-Egg Icing.  Let stand until icing has hardened, 30 to 45 minutes.

This recipe yields 32 cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  sweet potatoes
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)

     1/2           cup  evaporated milk
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  1                     unbaked 9" pie crust
                        === PRALINE LAYER ===
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
     1/4           cup  pecan pieces - (1 oz)
                        === PECAN TOPPING ===
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
  1         tablespoon  light brown sugar
     1/2           cup  pecan halves - (2 oz)

Bring medium saucepan of water to boil.  Add unpeeled sweet potatoes, reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, 30 to 40 minutes.  Drain and let cool slightly.

When cool enough to handle, peel sweet potatoes and transfer to medium bowl.  Coarsely mash potatoes (you should have about 2 cups).  Add eggs, brown sugar, butter, evaporated milk, spices and 1/4 teaspoon salt and mash thoroughly.  Set aside.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Make Praline Layer:  In small saucepan, melt butter with 2 tablespoons brown sugar over medium-low heat, stirring often, until mixture is smooth.  Stir in pecans.  Spread praline mixture over bottom of pie crust.  Spoon filling over praline layer.

Bake pie 10 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and bake until filling is set, about 45 minutes.  Set pie on wire rack to cool.

Meanwhile, make Topping:  In small saucepan, melt butter with 1 tablespoon brown sugar over medium-low heat, stirring often, until mixture is smooth.  Add pecans and cook, stirring often, until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

Arrange pecan halves decoratively over top of cooled pie.

Comments:  "This is an old family recipe that we make every Thanksgiving holiday," says Linda.  "My family lives in Oklahoma and when I was a child, we would pick up the pecans that had fallen off the trees after the first frost to use in this pie as well as other delicious treats."  It's wonderful served warm or at room temperature.

Comments:  &quot;This is an old family recipe that we make every Thanksgiving holiday,&quot; says Linda.  &quot;My family lives in Oklahoma and when I was a child, we would pick up the pecans that had fallen off the trees after the first frost to use in this pie as well as other delicious treats.&quot;  It&apos;s wonderful served warm or at room temperature.

     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
                        === CHOCOLATE FROSTING ===
     1/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
     1/4           cup  semi-sweet chocolate chips
                        = (dairy-free if preferred)
  1         tablespoon  dark corn syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line 12 muffin cups with paper baking liners or coat with cooking spray.

In medium bowl, combine both flours, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  Sift in cocoa and whisk to blend.  In 2-cup measure, combine buttermilk, oil and vanilla.  Set aside.

In large mixing bowl, combine eggs and both sugars.  Beat with electric mixer at high speed until pale and thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.  With rubber spatula, alternately fold in flour mixture and buttermilk mixture, making 3 additions flour mixture and 2 additions buttermilk mixture.  Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.  (Cups will be quite full.)

Bake cupcakes until tops spring back when touched lightly, 20 minutes.  Loosen edges and turn cupcakes onto rack.  Cool completely.

Meanwhile, make Frosting:  In medium bowl, combine cocoa, chocolate chips and corn syrup.  Add 1/4 cup boiling water and stir until chocolate has melted and mixture is smooth.  Stir in vanilla.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.

Using an electric mixer, gradually beat confectioners' sugar into cocoa mixture.  Beat slowly at first then gradually increase speed until frosting is smooth and creamy.

Spread frosting over tops of cupcakes.  Let stand until frosting has set, about 30 minutes before storing.

This recipe yields 12 cupcakes.

     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
                        === SANDWICHES ===
     1/2         pound  button or cremini mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped onion
     1/2           cup  chopped red bell pepper
  2               cups  Seasoned Soybeans -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce)
  1                cup  dry bread crumbs
     1/3           cup  whole-wheat flour
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  6                     whole-wheat hero rolls
  2               cups  prepared pasta sauce

Make Seasoning:  In small bowl, mix seasoning ingredients.  Set aside.

Place mushrooms in food processor and pulse on/off until finely chopped.

In large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, 1 minute.  Stir in seasoning mix, bell pepper and mushrooms.  Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring often, 3 minutes.  Transfer mixture to large bowl.

In food processor, puree half of soybeans.  Add to vegetables in bowl.  Add remaining soybeans to food processor and pulse on/off until almost smooth.  Add beans, lemon juice, balsamic vinegar and tamari to ingredients in bowl and mix well.

Stir in 1/3 cup bread crumbs and flour.  Form slightly rounded tablespoonfuls of mixture into balls.  (If it doesn't hold its shape, add equal parts of bread crumbs and flour as needed.)  Roll "meatballs" in remaining bread crumbs until evenly coated.

Fill medium skillet with 1/2-inch of vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add "meatballs," in batches if necessary, and cook until deep golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Turn and brown other side.  Transfer to paper towels to drain.

Brush insides of rolls with olive oil.  Lightly toast on griddle or in broiler.

Heat tomato sauce and spoon into roll.  Fill each with 5 or 6 "meatballs" and top with additional sauce.  Serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/4           cups  1% fat vanilla soy milk
     3/4           cup  nonfat egg substitute
  2             ounces  low-fat silken tofu
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  lime juice, preferably from Key limes
  1         tablespoon  grated lime peel
  1         tablespoon  tapioca flour
                        = (or cornstarch)
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === MERINGUE ===
  4                     egg whites -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Make Mrust:  In food processor, process graham crackers into fine crumbs (you should have about 2 cups).  Add sugar and soy milk and process until mixture is texture of sand, about 30 seconds.

Lightly coat 10-inch pie plate with cooking spray.  Press crumb mixture into bottom and sides.  Bake crust for 5 minutes.  Let cool for 10 minutes before filling.

In food processor or blender, combine filling ingredients and process until smooth.  If mixture is lumpy, press it through sieve.  Pour filling into crust.

Bake pie until custard is firm, about 40 minutes.  Let cool.

Make Meringue:  Fill large saucepan halfway with water and bring to a boil.  In metal bowl that will sit securely on top of saucepan, combine egg whites, sugar and pinch of salt.  Place bowl over hot water.  Stir constantly until egg whites are warm to the touch.

Remove bowl from pan and beat with electric mixer at high speed until stiff peaks form, about 12 minutes.  Transfer meringue to pastry bag fitted with large star tip.  Preheat broiler.

In lattice pattern, pipe meringue onto pie.  Broil 5 inches from heat source until lightly browned.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  The smaller, yellower Key lime has a flavor that's less harsh yet more intense than the common Persian lime.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  couscous
  3          teaspoons  olive oil
  4             medium  bell peppers (any color) -- halved lengthwise,
                        and seeded
  1             medium  red onion -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1                can  garbanzo beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
     1/2           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
                        = (or sprigs of cilantro)

In medium bowl, combine couscous and 1 1/4 cups boiling water.  Cover bowl and let stand 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, in large nonstick skillet, heat 1 teaspoon oil over medium-high heat.  Add bell pepper halves and cook, turning once, until starting to soften, 6 minutes.  Remove peppers and set aside.  Heat another 1/2 teaspoon oil in skillet.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, 6 to 7 minutes.  If pan is dry, add 1/2 teaspoon oil.  Add garlic, raisins, cumin and cinnamon and cook, stirring often, 2 minutes.

Transfer onion mixture to large bowl.  Add couscous, beans, parsley, lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste.  Spoon about 2/3 cup mixture into bell pepper halves, pressing gently to pack.

Heat remaining 1 teaspoon oil in skillet.  Add stuffed peppers skin-side down and cook until skins start to blister and brown, about 5 minutes.  Gently turn peppers over to brown couscous mixture, about 2 minutes.

Transfer peppers to individual plates, sprinkle with chopped cilantro or cilantro sprigs and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Tired of traditional stuffed peppers?  Try this quick and easy version instead.  The spiced couscous filling can also be served on its own, either warm or at room temperature.

Serve with prepackaged baked, marinated tofu slices.  End the meal with strawberry sorbet.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              pints  coffee ice cream -- softened slightly
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              large  egg yolk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  Dutch-processed cocoa powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Drop six 1/2-cup mounds of ice cream onto waxed paperñlined baking sheet.  Using metal spatula, shape each mound into 3- to 3 1/2-inch square.  Freeze squares while preparing dough.

In large bowl, beat butter and sugar using electric mixer until smooth.  Beat in egg yolk and vanilla.  In medium bowl, mix flour, cocoa and salt.  Add to butter mixture and beat until soft dough forms.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into rectangle.  Roll out dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper to 13- by 10-inch rectangle.  Place dough, still between waxed paper sheets, on baking sheet.  Chill until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Peel top sheet of waxed paper off dough; discard.  Trim dough to 12- by 9-inch rectangle; then cut dough into twelve 3-inch squares.  Transfer squares to parchment-lined baking sheet, discarding waxed paper and spacing them about 1 inch apart.  Bake until cookies are firm, about 20 minutes.  Cool cookies completely on baking sheet.

Arrange 6 cookies, flat-side up, on work surface.  Top each with frozen ice cream square, then another cookie, flat-side down, pressing slightly to adhere.  Cover and freeze sandwiches until ready to serve.  Ice cream sandwiches can be made up to 4 days ahead.  Store, wrapped in plastic, in the freezer.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  French lentils
  2                     bay leaves
  4                     black peppercorns
  1 1/2           cups  walnuts
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  finely-chopped onion - (1 large)
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  2        tablespoons  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce)
  2        tablespoons  prepared mustard -- plus
                        extra for serving
  1         tablespoon  prepared horseradish
  1         tablespoon  umeboshi vinegar -- (optional)
                        = (or red wine vinegar)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  16                    thin slices pumpernickel
  1                cup  sauerkraut
                        Lettuce -- as needed
                        Tomatoes -- as needed

Place lentils in large pot with water to cover by 2 inches (about 4 cups), bay leaves and peppercorns.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until lentils are tender, about 25 minutes.  Remove bay leaves and peppercorns and drain excess liquid.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spread walnuts on baking sheet and bake until golden and fragrant, about 10 minutes.  In food processor, grind nuts while still warm to very fine powder.  Leave in processor.

In large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, 2 minutes.  Add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring often, until onion is softened, about 2 minutes.

Scrape sides of processor bowl with rubber spatula to loosen ground walnuts.  Add lentils, onion mixture, tamari, mustard, horseradish, vinegar, lemon juice, hot pepper sauce and salt and pepper to taste.  Pulse on/off several times to blend, then process until mixture is smooth, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.

Spread lentil mixture (about 1/4 cup) on half of bread slices.  Top each with 2 tablespoons sauerkraut.  Add desired amount of lettuce and tomato and cover with remaining bread slices.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  whole-wheat flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  anise seeds
     3/4           cup  buttermilk
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  freshly-grated lemon peel
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2         medium  firm Anjou pears -- unpeeled
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2              large  eggs
                        = (or equivalent egg substitute)
     3/4           cup  sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat 9- by 5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.

In medium bowl, combine both flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt and anise seeds.  In 2-cup measure, combine buttermilk, oil, lemon peel and vanilla.  Set both aside.  Cut whole pear in half and grate halves coarsely, discarding cores (you should have 1 cup).  Transfer to small bowl.  Toss with lemon juice.  Set aside.

In large bowl, combine eggs and sugar.  Beat with electric mixer at high speed until pale and thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.  With rubber spatula, alternately fold in flour mixture and buttermilk mixture, making 3 flour additions and 2 buttermilk additions.  Drain grated pear, then gently fold into mixture.  Scrape batter into prepared loaf pan and spread evenly.

Bake loaf until light golden and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 50 minutes.  If loaf is too brown after 45 minutes, cover lightly with foil for last 5 minutes.  Let cool in pan on wire rack 10 minutes.  Loosen edges and turn out onto wire rack to cool completely.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Per Serving: 249 Cal; 5g Prot; 7g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 42g Carb.; 43mg Chol; 203mg Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  Be sure to choose firm pears; if they are too soft, the loaf will be gummy.

Bake sale tip:  You can also divide batter among three 6- by 3-inch mini loaf pans; bake for 30 to 35 minutes.  For an attractive presentation, wrap loaf or loaves in clear cellophane and tie with a colorful ribbon.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     seasonal pears -- peeled, cut in
                        half and cored
  8               cups  white wine
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
                        Peel from 1 lemon
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1                     star anise
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === SABAYON SAUCE ===
  6                     egg yolks
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  brandy
     1/4           cup  pear brandy
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- for garnish

In large saucepan, combine pear halves, wine, sugar, lemon peel, cinnamon, star anise and vanilla.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Cook until sugar dissolves, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium.  Cook pears gently until fork-tender, 10 to 20 minutes, depending on firmness of pears.  Using slotted spoon, remove pears and set on plate to cool.

Preheat broiler.  When pears are cool enough to handle, cut each pear into a fan: Leaving the top intact, cut pear in 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Place two fans at a time in an ovenproof dish.  Set aside.

Make Sabayon Sauce:  In medium metal bowl, combine egg yolks, sugar, brandies, vanilla and cinnamon.  Whisk until very smooth.  Set bowl over medium saucepan of simmering (not boiling) water and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is very thick, 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove bowl from water.

Spoon sauce over each pear fan.  Place under broiler and cook until sabayon just turns brown, 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer to serving plates and garnish with fresh mint.  Repeat with remaining pears and sauce.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 381 Cal; 2g Prot; 3g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 71g Carb.; 106mg Chol; 6mg Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Comments:  A sabayon sauce is the classic, irresistable Italian dessert sauce.  This version is scented with pear brandy and cinnamon.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  broccoli flowerets
     1/2           cup  pitted ripe olives
     1/2           can  anchovy fillets - (2-oz can) -- drained, and
                        finely chopped (optional)
  2        tablespoons  snipped fresh oregano
                        = (or Italian flat-leaf parsley)
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  5                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  1               dash  salt

In a large saucepan bring a small amount of water to boiling; add broccoli.  Simmer, covered, for 2 minutes; drain.  In a medium bowl combine broccoli and olives.  For marinade, in a small bowl whisk together anchovies (if desired), oregano, vinegar, oil, garlic, red pepper, and salt.  Pour over broccoli and olives; toss to coat.  Marinate at room temperature for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, lightly grease the rack of an indoor electric grill or lightly coat with cooking spray.  Preheat grill.  Drain broccoli and olives, discarding marinade.  On 6-inch skewers, alternately thread broccoli and olives, leaving 1/4-inch between pieces.

Place kabobs on the grill rack.  If using a covered grill, close lid.  Grill until broccoli is light brown and tender.  (For a covered grill, allow 3 to 4 minutes, giving kabobs a quarter turn once halfway through grilling.  For an uncovered grill, allow 6 to 8 minutes, turning occasionally to cook evenly.)  Remove broccoli and olives from skewers.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  whole-wheat flour

  1                cup  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2              large  eggs
                        = (or equivalent egg substitute)
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  8                     to 16 walnuts -- garnish (optional)
                        === ORANGE GLAZE ===
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  orange juice - (to 2)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat 10-inch Bundt pan (12-cup capacity) with cooking spray.

In medium bowl, combine both flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Set aside.  Put pumpkin in medium bowl.  Gradually whisk in buttermilk, oil and vanilla.  Set aside.

In large bowl, combine eggs and both sugars.  Beat with electric mixer at high speed until pale in color and thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.  With rubber spatula, alternately fold in flour mixture and pumpkin mixture, making 3 flour additions and 2 pumpkin additions.  Scrape into prepared pan.  Smooth surface with spatula.

Bake cake until top springs back lightly when touched and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.  Let cool in pan on wire rack 10 minutes.  Loosen edges and turn cake out onto rack to cool completely.

Make Glaze:  Sift confectioners' sugar into medium bowl.  Add vanilla and 1 tablespoon orange juice; whisk to blend.  Gradually add just enough additional orange juice until glaze is smooth and thick yet pourable.  Slowly spoon glaze over cake, letting it drip down sides.  Decorate cake with walnuts if desired.  Let stand until glaze has set, about 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  canned pumpkin
  2        tablespoons  maple syrup
  3        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  pumpkin pie spice

                        Granulated sugar -- for dusting
                        Ground cinnamon -- for dusting

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  In medium bowl, mix pumpkin, maple syrup, brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice.

Place one wonton wrapper flat on work surface.  Spoon 1 tablespoon filling into center.  Moisten edges of wonton with water and fold in half to form triangle.  Press edges to seal.  Repeat with remaining filling and wontons.

Arrange filled wontons on ungreased baking sheet.  Lightly coat wontons with nonstick cooking spray and sprinkle each with sugar and cinnamon.

Bake until golden, about 16 minutes.  Turn and bake 2 more minutes.  Set baking sheet on wire rack to cool.

This recipe yields 16 wontons.

Comments:  "I like to experiment with cooking," says Kayla Capper.  "I came up with the idea for these dessert wontons as a way to serve pumpkin pie individually."  Look for packaged wonton wrappers in the refrigerated produce section of most large supermarkets.

Comments:  &quot;I like to experiment with cooking,&quot; says Kayla Capper.  &quot;I came up with the idea for these dessert wontons as a way to serve pumpkin pie individually.&quot;  Look for packaged wonton wrappers in the refrigerated produce section of most large supermarkets.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ONION-CRANBERRY SALSA ===
  1 1/2           cups  finely-chopped onion
  1         tablespoon  sugar

  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1                cup  canned whole berry cranberry sauce
                        === QUESADILLAS ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1             medium  green bell pepper -- cut long strips
  1                cup  frozen corn kernels
  1                cup  peeled winter squash in 3/4" cubes

  2                     soy "sausage" links - (to 3) -- sliced 1/4" thick
  1           teaspoon  cumin
  1           teaspoon  chili powder

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  eggplants - (2 1/2 lbs) -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1/2"-thick slices
     1/3           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  jarred tapenade (black olive paste)
  3             medium  red bell peppers -- roasted, and
                        cut lengthwise into 3 sections
  7             ounces  soft mild goat cheese -- sliced thin
                        === FRESH HERB SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1              small  garlic clove -- sliced
  4          teaspoons  balsamic vinegar
  6        tablespoons  olive oil

Preheat broiler.  Arrange eggplant slices in single layer on baking sheets; brush both sides of eggplant with oil and sprinkle with salt to taste.  Broil eggplant in batches until golden and tender, 4 to 5 minutes per side.  Transfer eggplant to paper towels to drain.

Line an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving a 3-inch overhang.  Layer eggplant, olive paste, bell peppers and cheese in pan, beginning and ending with eggplant.  Cover with plastic overhang and place 3- to 4-pound weight (such as another loaf pan filled with canned goods) on top.  Chill 24 hours.

Make Fresh Herb Sauce:  In food processor or blender, combine basil, parsley, garlic, vinegar, oil, 2 tablespoons water and salt and pepper to taste.  Process until smooth.

To serve, remove weight, invert terrine onto cutting board, and discard plastic wrap.  Cut terrine into 3/4-inch-thick slices.  Pour a little basil sauce onto serving plates, tilting to spread sauce.  Arrange terrine slices on sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 339 Cal; 8g Prot; 28g Total Fat (7 Sat. Fat); 15g Carb.; 15mg Chol; 170mg Sod.; 6g Fiber.

Comments:  The terrine may be made up to three days ahead.  Cover it tightly in the pan and refrigerate.  Unmold and bring to room temperature before serving.  The sauce can be made up to three days ahead and refrigerated.  Simply bring to room temperature before using.

TIP:  To roast peppers, place under broiler, turning every 5 minutes until skins blister and char, 10 to 15 minutes.  Transfer peppers to paper bag, close and let steam until cool enough to handle.  Use a small sharp knife to peel off charred skin; discard seeds and ribs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fresh Anaheim chile pepper
  4               ears  fresh corn -- husked,
                        = (or 2 cups frozen kernels)
  3               cups  low-sodium vegetable broth
  4             ounces  firm tofu -- drained, and
                        cut into 1/4" cubes
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
  2                     limes - (optional) -- cut into wedges

Using tongs, hold chile directly over flame of gas burner, turning frequently, until entire surface is blistered.  (Alternatively, roast chile under broiler.)  Place roasted chile in medium bowl.  Cover with plate and let steam 20 minutes.  (Alternatively, place chile in small paper bag.  Close securely and let steam.)  When cool enough to handle, peel off charred skin and discard.  Remove and discard seeds.  Finely chop chile flesh; set aside.

Using a sharp knife, cut corn off cobs; reserve cobs.  Heat small cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium heat.  Add corn and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned, 10 to 12 minutes.  Set aside.

Break reserved cobs in half.  In large saucepan, combine broth and cobs.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer 15 minutes.  Discard cobs.

In food processor or blender, combine reserved corn kernels and broth and process, in batches if necessary, until very smooth.  Strain through fine-mesh sieve back into saucepan, using a rubber spatula to press mixture through mesh.  Stir in tofu, reserved chopped chile, and salt and pepper to taste.  Rewarm over low heat, stirring occasionally.

Ladle soup into bowls and garnish each serving with cilantro.  Serve with lime wedges if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 143 Cal; 6g Prot; 2g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 15g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 162mg Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Comments:  Simmering ears of corn in broth enhances the soup's sweet flavor.  (When using frozen corn, skip this step.)  To add more "heat," double the number of green chilies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  onions -- halved and peeled
  1 1/2         pounds  red potatoes -- scrubbed
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        partially crushed
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  2        tablespoons  low-sodium vegetable broth
                        = (or water)
  4               cups  spinach - (5 oz) -- rinsed, chopped

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly oil large roasting pan.

Trim off ends of onions.  Cut into wedges, slicing end to end.  Place in large bowl and separate somewhat, leaving a couple of onion layers attached with each wedge.

Cut potatoes into large wedges; add to onions in bowl.  Add garlic, oil, vinegar, bay leaf, rosemary and salt and pepper to taste; toss to coat.  Transfer vegetables to prepared pan and spread in single layer.  Sprinkle with vegetable broth.

Roast vegetables 30 minutes, stirring once or twice and adding water, if necessary.  Add spinach and mix.  Roast 10 minutes.  Vegetables will be tender and golden when done.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 195 Cal; 4g Prot; 7g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 30g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 41mg Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Comments:  Roasting is one of the best ways to bring out the sweet side of onions.  The seasoning is simple ó just salt, pepper, herbs, garlic and balsamic vinegar ó but the dish delivers big flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  chopped walnuts
  2             pounds  ripe plums
     1/4           cup  unbleached flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  red currant jelly
                        === PASTRY CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  walnut oil
  3        tablespoons  ice water - (to 6)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Lightly coat baking sheet with cooking spray.

Make crust:  In medium bowl, mix flour, sugar and salt.  Using fork, slowly stir oil into flour until mixture is crumbly.  Stir in enough ice water so dough will hold together.  Press dough into flattened disk.

Roll dough between sheets of wax paper into rough circle, 14 to 15 inches in diameter and approximately 1/16-inch thick, patching where necessary.  Remove top sheet and invert dough onto prepared baking sheet.  Cover and refrigerate while preparing filling.

Spread nuts in pie pan and toast in oven until lightly golden, about 5 minutes.  Let cool.

Meanwhile, quarter plums, discarding pits.  In food processor, combine walnuts, flour and 1/4 cup sugar.  Process until finely ground.

Spread flour-nut mixture over pastry, leaving 1 1/2-inch border around edge.  Arrange plums, resting on their sides, in concentric circles, over nut mixture.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup sugar.  Fold pastry border over plums.

Bake 15 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees and bake until crust is golden and juices are bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes.

Using long spatula, loosen warm tart from baking sheet and slide onto serving platter.  Let cool.

Heat jelly in small saucepan over low heat until melted, then brush sauce over plums before serving.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Per Serving: 275 Cal; 3g Prot; 10g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 45g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 109mg Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  Take advantage of another fruit in peak season: Substitute unpeeled nectarines for the plums.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  4               cups  chopped onions - (abt 2 large)
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  9             slices  fresh white sandwich bread
  1 1/2           cups  grated sharp cheddar cheese - (to 2)

In large skillet, melt butter with oil over medium heat.  Add onion, sugar and 1/8 teaspoon salt.  Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes.  Remove cover and continue cooking, stirring often, until golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Oil or butter 6 large custard cups or small crocks of about 1-cup capacity.

In large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, mustard, thyme, remaining salt and pepper to taste.  Trim crusts from bread and cut into 1/2-inch cubes.  Fill each cup one-third of the way with bread.  Sprinkle with some cheese, then add a little onion.  Repeat layeringóbread, cheese, onion -- until cups are nearly filled.  Ladle egg mixture over bread, dividing equally.  Press down on bread, if necessary, to submerge.  Top with a spoonful of milk, if necessary, to cover completely.  Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and bring small pot of water to a boil.

In shallow baking pan large enough to hold cups in single layer, pour enough boiling water to fill by about one-third.  Arrange cups in pan, leaving a little space between them.  Cover loosely with tented foil and bake 30 minutes.  Remove foil and bake until puddings have risen and a knife inserted into center shows no trace of uncooked egg.  Remove cups from water and transfer to wire rack to cool slightly.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 271 Cal; 14g Prot; 20g Total Fat (10 Sat. Fat); 9g Carb.; 185mg Chol; 278mg Sod.; 1g Fiber.

Comments:  This bread pudding makes a great dish for entertaining, especially when served in individual custard cups or small crocks.  It can be served hot or warm.  Although we call for sharp cheddar, feel free to use other types of cheese.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh ginger
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  10                    scallions -- trimmed
  1           teaspoon  honey
  1 1/2    tablespoons  tamari
                        = (or low-sodium soy sauce)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  vinegar
     1/4           cup  crunchy peanut butter
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame oil
     1/2         pound  thin spaghetti or vermicelli

Bring large pot of water to a boil.  Add 1 tablespoon salt and spaghetti, stirring to prevent sticking.  Cook spaghetti until just tender, about 8 minutes.  Drain well.  Transfer to large bowl.  Add 1 tablespoon sesame oil and toss well.

In small bowl, combine peanut butter, vinegar, tamari, honey and 1 tablespoon water and whisk until thickened and smooth.  Thin with a little extra water if necessary.  Set aside.

Thinly slice 5 scallions.  In small saucepan, heat remaining tablespoon sesame oil and stir sliced scallions into oil.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 minutes.  Stir in garlic, ginger and pepper flakes and cook 30 seconds, then remove from heat.  Add mixture to spaghetti and toss to coat.

Pour peanut butter mixture over spaghetti and toss to coat.  Just before serving, mince remaining scallions.  Toss noodles again, transfer to serving bowl and scatter minced scallions over top.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 250 Cal; 7g Prot; 15g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 23g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 202mg Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Comments:  Served warm or cold, these noodles make a great side dish with other Asian fare, and they travel well in brown-bag lunches.  To freshen noodles the next day or sharpen flavors, toss with a bit more vinegar and/or soy sauce.

                Vegetarian                      Wraps

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  sweet potato - (5 oz)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              pound  firm tofu -- well-drained, and
                        cut into 3" by 1/2" strips
  12                    rice paper triangles -- (optional)
  1             medium  cucumber -- peeled, quartered
                        lengthwise, seeded, cut long thin
                        diagonal pieces
                        Chopped fresh herbs
                        = (such as chives, cilantro or
                        mint leaves)
  1              large  Boston lettuce head - (optional) -- separated into
                        leaves
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped unsalted dry-roasted peanuts

Make Dipping Sauce:  In small saucepan, combine hoisin sauce, oil and 1/3 cup water.  Bring to boil over high heat, stirring until smooth.  Remove from heat and stir in peanuts.  Pour into small serving bowl and set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, in medium saucepan, place sweet potato and enough cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce heat and simmer until just fork-tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain, cool slightly and cut in half lengthwise.  Peel and cut into 12 lengthwise sticks (like fat french fries).  Set aside.

In large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add tofu sticks in batches if necessary, and cook until golden, turning on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.

If using triangle wrappers, brush well with water and arrange, overlapping, on large plate; they soften after they stand a few minutes.  Place remaining ingredients on individual plates.

To make individual rolls, place softened triangle on work surface, pointed end toward you.  Arrange 1 piece each of tofu and sweet potato vertically in center.  Top with a few pieces of cucumber and some chopped herbs.  Roll up from one side.  If desired, distribute some bean sprouts on 1 lettuce leaf.  Place wrap on top and roll lettuce around.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.  Serve with dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 146 Cal; 6g Prot; 9g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 12g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 34mg Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  You can use almost any combination of vegetables in these wraps.  When you have all the elements ready, set the ingredients out on individual platters and let diners make their own.  If you can't find rice paper wrappers, which add a nice chewy texture, roll the ingredients in lettuce leaves.

These wraps are great with a simple cold noodle salad (use linguine or soba noodles) tossed with a store-bought Thai peanut dressing and some chopped red bell pepper.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2           packages  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz ea) -- thawed
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  crumbled feta - (3 oz)
     1/2           cup  pine nuts - (3 oz)
  1         tablespoon  fine dry bread crumbs
  7                     sheets phyllo - (17" by 12")
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  6        tablespoons  grated Parmesan

In large heavy skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, 5 minutes.  Squeeze spinach to remove as much liquid as possible.  Stir spinach and 1/2 teaspoon salt into onion.  Cook mixture, stirring occasionally, until any liquid is evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

In large bowl, whisk eggs until blended.  Stir in spinach mixture, feta, pine nuts and bread crumbs.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Stack phyllo sheets and cover with 2 overlapping sheets plastic wrap and then dampened kitchen towel.  In small saucepan, melt butter and cool slightly.  Lightly brush a 9-inch pie pan with butter.

On work surface, lightly brush 1 phyllo sheet with butter.  Evenly sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Parmesan.  Repeat layering with phyllo, butter, and 5 tablespoons Parmesan, ending with phyllo; lightly brush with butter.

Transfer phyllo stack to pie pan, letting excess hang over edge.  Spoon filling into phyllo, spreading evenly.  Fold edges of pastry over filling.  Lightly brush top of phyllo with butter.  Bake until golden, 25 to 30 minutes.  Serve pie warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Per Serving: 332 Cal; 11g Prot; 26g Total Fat (10 Sat. Fat); 17g Carb.; 90mg Chol; 549mg Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  There are probably as many spinach pie recipes in Greece as there are villages.  Every region and almost every homecook claims one.  The addition of pine nuts and Parmesan makes this version especially flavorful.  Look for phyllo pastry in the frozen foods section of large supermarkets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  coarsely-chopped macadamia nuts
  4                     blood oranges
  5               cups  baby spinach leaves -- washed, stemmed,
                        dried and torn into bite-size pieces
  1                cup  cooked corn
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/2                garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sherry vinegar
  3        tablespoons  hazelnut oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh blood orange juice
                        = (reserved from sectioning fruit)

In small dry skillet, toast macadamia nuts over medium heat until light golden brown and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Peel and section oranges over small bowl to catch juice.  Cut segments into 1/2-inch dice.  Reserve juice for dressing.

In large bowl, combine toasted nuts, oranges, spinach and corn.

Make Dressing:  In small bowl, combine garlic, mustard and salt and pepper to taste.  With fork, mash to smooth paste.  Add vinegar and whisk until smooth.  Whisk in oil in thin stream until dressing has thickened.  Whisk in reserved orange juice.  Correct seasonings, adding salt or orange juice to taste.

Just before serving, pour dressing over salad and toss until spinach is lightly coated.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 379 Cal; 7g Prot; 30g Total Fat (4 Sat. Fat); 29g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 69mg Sod.; 7g Fiber.

Comments:  Blood oranges look like juice oranges only smaller.  Many have darkish red patches on the outside.  If blood oranges are unavailable, this salad can be prepared with regular oranges.  For best results, use fresh baby spinach instead of cellophane-packed, and, if possible, grill or roast the corn.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     baby pumpkins
     1/3           cup  low-sodium vegetable broth
                        = (or water)
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  dried sage leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1                cup  whole-wheat bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  grated part-skim mozzarella cheese -- (optional)
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/4           cup  toasted pine nuts -- (optional)
     1/4           cup  chopped dried apricots
                        Low-sodium soy sauce or salt -- to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Slice off top 1/2 inch of each pumpkin and scoop out seeds.  On ungreased cookie sheet, bake pumpkins for 15 minutes.

In large skillet, heat broth or water to simmering over medium-high heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until onion has softened but not browned, about 8 minutes.  Add garlic, sage, thyme and bread crumbs.  Cook, stirring, 1 minute, then remove from heat and stir in remaining ingredients.

Lightly fill pumpkins with stuffing.  (Any remaining stuffing may be baked separately in a lightly oiled baking dish.)

Bake until stuffing is lightly browned and heated through, about 15 minutes.  Be careful not to overbake pumpkins because they will split.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 54 Cal; 3g Prot; 1g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 7g Carb.; 4mg Chol; 78mg Sod.; 1g Fiber.

Comments:  Look for baby pumpkins from late October through December.  Hollowed out, they make charming tureens for individual servings of soup or this delicious herb and vegetable stuffing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  quinoa -- rinsed, drained
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped - (2/3 cup)
  3               cups  low-sodium vegetable broth
  4               cups  shelled fresh or frozen peas
                        = (abt 4 lbs unshelled)
  6             ounces  plain soy yogurt
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  shredded fresh mint leaves -- (optional)

In medium saucepan, combine quinoa and 1 cup cold water.  Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to low, cover and cook until water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.  Fluff with fork; set aside.

Meanwhile, in large saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add broth, cover and bring to a boil.  Add peas and reduce heat to medium.  Simmer until peas are tender, about 5 minutes.

Reserve 1/2 cup peas.  In food processor or blender, process mixture, in batches if necessary, until smooth.  Strain through fine-mesh sieve back into saucepan, using a rubber spatula to press mixture through mesh.  Stir in reserved quinoa and peas, yogurt, salt and pepper.

Reheat over low heat, stirring occasionally.  Ladle soup into bowls and garnish each serving with mint.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 207 Cal; 9g Prot; 3g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 28g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 281mg Sod.; 6g Fiber.

Comments:  Translucent quinoa adds a pearly texture to this vibrant green soup.  Make sure to pick out any discolored quinoa before cooking, as they will show up as dark specks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/4      teaspoons  sweet curry powder
  1              pound  firm tofu -- drained, and
                        cut into 32 one-inch cubes
     1/4           cup  apricot jam
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped onion

Place 8 wooden skewers in shallow bowl and add water to cover (to keep skewers from burning).

While skewers soak, mix sugar, 1 teaspoon curry powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt in small bowl.  Rub spice mixture over tofu cubes to coat.  Drain skewers.  Thread tofu onto damp skewers.

Lightly coat nonstick pan with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat.  Cook skewers, turning as necessary, until golden brown on each side, about 4 minutes.

Meanwhile, in small bowl, mix apricot jam, remaining 1/4 teaspoon curry powder, onion and salt to taste.

Place 2 skewers on each plate and serve with apricot chutney.

Comments:  This recipe makes enough for four people as a main meal (or enough for eight appetizers, in which case divide the tofu among 16 skewers).

This tandoori is delicious with cooked quinoa and a simple salad of shredded carrots and cabbage, sprinkled with golden raisins.

Comments:  Tempeh has an almost meaty texture and a strong flavor.  The fried tempeh can be made ahead.  It will keep up to three days in the refrigerator.

Pop some frozen hors d'oeuvreñsize spring rolls in the oven to serve on the side.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALSA VERDE ===
  8                     tomatillos -- papery husks removed
  1              small  onion -- quartered
  1              small  ripe avocado -- peeled, pitted
                        === FAJITAS ===
  4          teaspoons  vegetable oil -- divided
  4                     portobello mushrooms - (1 lb) -- stemmed, and
                        thinly sliced
  1              large  onion -- halved, and
                        thinly sliced
  2                     fresh poblano chilies -- seeded, and
                        cut into very fine strips
  12                    corn tortillas - (8" dia) -- warmed

Make Salsa Verde:  In small saucepan, combine tomatillos and enough cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce heat to low and simmer 5 minutes.  Drain, rinse under cold running water until cool, then drain again.  Transfer to food processor along with onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Process until pureed.

In medium serving bowl, mash avocado with fork.  Stir in tomatillo mixture until blended.  Set salsa aside.

In large castñiron skillet, heat 2 teaspoons oil over medium heat.  Add mushrooms, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and softened, about 5 to 8 minutes.  Transfer to plate.

In same pan, heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil over medium heat.  Add onion and chilies and cook, stirring often, until lightly caramelized and crispñtender, about 10 minutes.  Add mushrooms to pan with onions; add 1 teaspoon salt and heat through.

Place warmed tortillas on serving plate.  Place skillet on a heatñproof trivet and let each diner assemble his or her own fajitas.  Pass Salsa Verde separately to spoon on top.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 242 Cal; 6g Prot; 9g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 39g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 105mg Sod.; 6g Fiber.

Comments:  Poblano chilies add zip and portobello mushrooms lend substance to this Mexicanñstyle favorite.  Tomatillos, which resemble small green tomatoes, have a lemonyñherb flavor.  To warm tortillas, wrap tortilla stack in foil and heat in a 300 degree oven for about 10 minutes.

Serve with a black bean salad made with rinsed and drained canned black beans, diced red bell pepper, chopped fresh cilantro and a lowñfat vinaigrette dressing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              large  onion -- halved, and
                        sliced thin - (2 cups)

  1                cup  egg whites - (abt 10 to 12 large)
                        = (or nonfat egg substitute)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        = (or 1/4 cup umeboshi plum vinegar)
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
                        = (or 1 tbspn dried basil)
  4             medium  zucchini -- shredded - (4 cups)
  12            ounces  soy cheese or cheddar -- grated
                        === ROASTED TOMATO SALSA ===
  4                     ripe large tomatoes -- cored
  1              large  onion -- peeled
  2                     shallots -- peeled
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh chives

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In medium skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onion and pepper and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 5 minutes.

Add mushrooms and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 5 minutes.  Remove skillet from heat.

In food processor, process tofu until smooth.  Add egg whites, vinegar and basil and process until blended.

In large bowl, combine mushroom mixture, tofu mixture, zucchini and soy cheese and mix with rubber spatula.

Lightly coat inside of 9-inch deep-dish quiche pan with cooking spray.  Spread mixture in prepared pan.

Bake until frittata is firm and top is lightly golden, about 1 1/2 hours.

Meanwhile, make salsa:  Lightly coat baking sheet with cooking spray.  Arrange tomatoes, onion and shallots on prepared sheet.  Place in oven with frittata.  Bake until tomato skins brown and blister, about 45 minutes.

In food processor or blender, process roasted vegetables and 1/4 teaspoon salt until smooth.

Pour sauce into medium saucepan.  Heat over low heat until simmering.  Pour into serving bowl and sprinkle with chives.  Serve hot with frittata.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 244 Cal; 20g Prot; 9g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 22g Carb.; 8mg Chol; 610mg Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Comments:  Serve this dish with a salad of baby greens dressed in a raspberry vinaigrette.  Be sure to shred the soy cheese by hand ó fat-free soy cheese is too rubbery for the food processor and can crack the work bowl.  Washing the mushrooms after they're sliced adds moisture needed during the sauteing process for fat-free cooking.

Comments:  Serve this dish with a salad of baby greens dressed in a raspberry vinaigrette.  Be sure to shred the soy cheese by hand ó fat-free soy cheese is too rubbery for the food processor and can crack the work bowl.  Washing the mushrooms after they&apos;re sliced adds moisture needed during the sauteing process for fat-free cooking.
