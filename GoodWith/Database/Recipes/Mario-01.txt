Categories    : Main Dish                       Rice
                Sardines

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1                     red onion -- chopped 1/8" dice
  1              pinch  saffron
  2               cups  arborio rice
  3               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  grated pecorino
  2                     eggs -- plus
  2                     eggs -- separated
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  8             ounces  salted sardines -- rinsed, beheaded,
                        and roughly chopped
  2             sprigs  mint
     1/4           cup  flour -- for dusting
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs -- for coating
                        Olive oil -- for frying

For the rice:  In a 4- to 6-quart saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil until just smoking.  Add half the chopped red onion and saffron and cook until softened, about 7 to 9 minutes.

Add rice and chicken stock and bring to boil, uncovered.  Cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 25 minutes.

Spread rice out to cool on a large cookie sheet, about 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thick.  When rice is cool, mix with Pecorino, 2 eggs and 2 egg yolks and set aside.

For the stuffing:  In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, cook remaining chopped onion in 2 tablespoons olive oil until light golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Add tomato sauce, chopped sardines and mint and cook 5 to 7 minutes until reduced by one-third and quite thick.  Set aside and allow to cool.

To assemble:  Place dusting flour, egg whites and bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls and lightly beat egg whites.  To form arancine, place 3 tablespoons rice mixture in palm of hand and make an indentation with the back of a spoon.  Spoon 2 tablespoons sardine mixture into indentation and form an open bowl out of the rice in your hand.  Cover filled portion with another tablespoon of rice mixture and using both hands, shape the rice into a ball.  Continue with remaining rice mixture and stuffing until done.

Roll each ball in flour, then egg whites, then bread crumbs and refrigerate 1 hour, uncovered.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  cipolline
                        = (or small [1 1/2"] onions)
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  sweet butter
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/2           cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  water
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves

Peel the onions, leaving and washing any root strand you may find.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan over a medium-high flame, heat virgin olive oil until just smoking.  Add butter and cook until foam subsides.  Add onions and saute until light golden-brown on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add sugar, vinegar, tomato sauce and water and bring to a boil.

Cook onions uncovered, until just al dente, about 10 minutes.  If liquid dissipates too quickly, add more water, a 1/4 cup at a time, realizing that it is essential not to overcook the onions.  The sauce should just adhere to the onions.

Remove from saute pan to an earthenware dish and hold in a warm place, or allow to cool if you are serving them later or as an antipasto.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                     octopus - (3 to 5 lbs) -- with sac, eyes, and
                        red skin removed
     1/2           cup  virgin olive oil
                        Juice and zest of 1 lemon
  1         tablespoon  crushed red pepper flakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  warm water
  3          teaspoons  yeast (dry)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  4               cups  high-gluten flour
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Place warm water in a warm mixing bowl and add yeast.  Stir to dissolve and let stand 3 minutes.  Add salt and sugar and stir through.  Add flour and olive oil and mix, using hands until you can knead the dough without it sticking to your fingers.

Wash and dry hands and remove ball to cutting board.  Knead the dough, occasionally dusting with 1 teaspoon flour, until a firm, smooth homogenous ball is formed, about 15 minutes.

Place ball of dough in a lightly-oiled mixing bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow to rise in a warm place until its size is doubled, about 2 hours.

                          Basic Fresh Egg Pasta

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     extra-large eggs
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil

Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil and any other flavoring you may choose.

Using a fork, beat together the eggs, oil and flavorings and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.  As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when 1/2 of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands primarily.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits.  Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

This recipe yields 1 pound of pasta.

Comments:  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are essential for a light pasta.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  whole wheat flour and bench flour
  4                     eggs
     1/2           cup  warm milk -- with
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted into it

To make pasta:  Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and milk mixture.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and milk mixture and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any leftover crusty bits.  Discard these bits.

Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.

Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe.  They are essential for a light pasta.

To make bigoli:  Knead dough until smooth and tight and let rest 20 minutes.  Cut dough into 6 and run through a meat grinder set to smallest extrusion size.  As pasta exits, cut it into 12-inch pieces and immediately dust with flour.  Lay out on a cookie sheet dusted with cornmeal, being careful to keep the strands separate.  Finish all 6 pieces the same way.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
     1/2           cup  flour -- for dusting
  4                     jumbo eggs
  1         tablespoon  virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  finely-ground fresh black pepper
                        = (grind in a coffee grinder)

Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil and pepper.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs, oil and pepper and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any leftover crusty bits.  Discard these bits.

Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

This recipe yields 1 pound.

Comments:  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe.  They are essential for a light pasta.

                   Borlenghe With Lardo And Prosciutto

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Pasta flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg -- beaten
  5 1/2           cups  water
     1/4         pound  lardo -- plus
  2        tablespoons  lardo
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- minced finely
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped rosemary leaves
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

Combine the flour, salt and egg in a large mixing bowl.  Add 2 cups water and beat with a whisk for 5 minutes or until very smooth.  Quickly stir in remaining water.  Allow to stand 1 hour.  (The batter will appear very thin, almost milk-like, but do not worry.)

Stir together 1/4 cup lardo, prosciutto, rosemary, garlic and black pepper in a mixing bowl until smooth and set aside.

To cook borlenghe, heat a 14- to 16-inch non-stick pan over medium heat and brush with a 1/4 teaspoon of remaining lardo.  Pour enough batter to coat pan (just like a crespella) and return to heat.  Cook 4 minutes on the first side and turn carefully.  (The texture will not be like a crespella, or anything else, for this is an original and distinct delicacy.  It may crack, but keep going.)  Continue until all the batter is finished, or about 10 to 12 borlenghe.

To serve, reheat borlenghe quickly in same pan, spread with 1 tablespoon prosciutto mixture, sprinkle with grated cheese and serve warm, folded into quarters.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     large head green cabbage
  1 1/2         pounds  ground turkey
     3/4           cup  fresh bread crumbs -- divided
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
     1/2        medium  red onion -- finely chopped
  10                    sage leaves -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  3                     eggs
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  dry white wine

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Remove whole leaves from cabbage to yield 20 large leaves and plunge into boiling water.  Cook until soft enough to fold, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Drain and rinse with cool water and lay out on a clean kitchen towel to continue cooling.

Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, place ground turkey, 1/2 cup bread crumbs, 1/4 cup parsley, red onion, sage, salt, pepper and eggs and mix well with hands.  Lay out cabbage leaves on cutting board or counter and place a medium handful of turkey mixture in lower center of each leaf.  Fold lateral sides inward and roll from base to form a closed pocket out of each stuffed leaf.

In an oven-proof casserole, large enough to just hold all cabbage rolls, place half the tomato sauce and all the white wine.  Lay cabbage rolls on top of sauce until covered with one layer.  Spoon remaining sauce over and bake 1 hour.  Remove and sprinkle with remaining bread crumbs and parsley.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHELLS ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2        tablespoons  butter -- unsalted
  3        tablespoons  marsala
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  sheep's milk ricotta
                        = (may substitute cow's milk ricotta)
     1/2           cup  superfine sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  4        tablespoons  orange zest
     1/4           cup  tiny chocolate chips
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten
  2             quarts  canola oil -- for frying
                        Powdered sugar -- for dusting

Mix together dry ingredients and cut in butter with 2 knives.  Add Marsala and shape dough into a ball.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate.

Heat 2 quarts canola oil in 3 1/2 quart pot to 350 degrees.

In a mixing bowl, stir together ricotta, sugar, vanilla, orange zest and chocolate chips until well mixed.  Spoon into a pastry bag with an open tip and place in refrigerator.

Remove dough from refrigerator and divide into 4 pieces.  Roll one piece onto flat surface with rolling pin until 1/16-inch thick.  Cut in 4-inch circles.  Using a rolling pin, elongate circles into ovals.  Wrap ovals lengthwise around metal forms and seal edge with egg whites.  Flare ends open with fingers and place in hot oil and fry until golden-brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove and allow to drain on paper towels.  When cool enough to touch, twist molds away from shells.  Shells may be made 1 day in advance and rest unfilled and uncovered.

When ready to eat, stuff cannoli with ricotta cream, dust with powdered sugar and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  To make this classic dessert, it is essential to have metal cannoli tubes.

  8                     anchovy fillets -- rinsed, patted dry
  2                     eggs -- plus
  4                     hard-boiled eggs
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped parsley
  1                     garlic clove
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts
  1                     thick slice country bread -- crust removed
                        = (take from first step and soak with)
  4        tablespoons  red wine vinegar

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Cut dome off of bread.  Remove bread from the base part, leaving a wall of crust.  Place base in oven and bake until quite hard, about 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, heat water, onion, bay leaf, peppercorns, and vinegar to boil and add cod.  Poach 3 to 4 minutes, or until just cooked through.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Set boiling water and ice bath up.  Blanch consecutively the beans, carrots, celery and artichokes, refreshing and maintaining each individually.  Place both beets and potato in boiling water and boil 20 minutes, or until they are done, and remove them to separate bowls.  Peel each and cut into festive slices.  Dress each of these 7 components separately with Ligurian oil and lemon juice and lightly season with salt and pepper.

Remove the cod and flake into large pieces.  Dress with Ligurian oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper.

Steam first the langostinos and then the lobsters over the court bouillon and allow them to cool.  To make the sauce, remove the pits from the 8 green olives and place the flesh in a food processor.  Add 1 tablespoon capers and anchovy fillets, 2 eggs, 1 bunch chopped parsley, garlic clove, 2 tablespoons pine nuts and the vinegar-soaked bread.  Blend in the processor until smooth and then slowly add remaining 3/4 cup olive oil until you have formed a thick, creamy mayonnaise.  It should still be quite sharp.

To assemble the dish, lay the bread disk in the center of large round plate.  Build a pyramidal structure using first the beans, then a dollop of sauce, then the cod, and so on, until all the ingredients have a layer on top of the bread.  Finish with the lobsters and nothing else on top.  Garnish the base of the structure with quartered hard-boiled eggs, anchovies, olives and capers.  Challenge your guests to be the first to consume your work!

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  5             pounds  cardoons
  10              cups  water
     1/2           cup  flour

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached flour -- divided
     3/4           cup  fine semolina -- divided
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              ounce  fresh yeast
                        = (or 2 packets dry yeast)
  1 3/4           cups  warm water -- divided

In a mixing bowl, stir 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup semolina and salt together.  In a measuring cup, mix yeast in 1 cup water and stir to dissolve.  Mix liquid with flour mixture to form doughy batter.  Let sit covered overnight in the warmest place in the kitchen.

Place baking tile in oven and preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Make a well on a work surface with 2 cups flour and 1/4 cup semolina.  Place doughy batter in center and stir in remaining warm water.  Mix well and incorporate flour from edges of well until a dough is formed.  Bring together and knead 10 minutes, until firm and elastic.  Place in a bowl, cover with a towel and let rest 1 hour.  Dough should double in size.

Cut dough into tennis ball-sized pieces and, using a rolling pin, roll out to 12- to 14-inch circles, about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thin.  Place on peel and slide onto oven tiles and bake 2 minutes.  Open oven door and turn over.  Cook 30 seconds more and remove to board.  Bread should be puffed up like a balloon.  Immediately cut around edges with a knife to separate top and bottom layers.  Stack the 2 pieces on a kitchen towel and put a box of cereal on top of them to weigh them down.

Continue this process until all the dough is cut, baked, separated and stacked.  Place each half back into the oven, one at a time, for 15 to 20 seconds, until very crisp.  Store wrapped in a brown paper bag.  They will last three to four weeks in a dry place.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTA ===
  4                     eggs, extra large
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- for dusting
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  baked potatoes -- peeled, mashed
  1                cup  fresh bread crumbs
  1              pound  leftover meat or sausage -- chopped or crumbled
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano cheese
     1/2           cup  milk - (to 1)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  cinnamon
                        === SAUCE ===
  6        tablespoons  butter
  6        tablespoons  veal stock

To make pasta:  Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and oil.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and the oil and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palm of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scape up any leftover crusty bits.

Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3 minutes remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in pastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe.  They are essential for a light pasta.

For the filling:  In a mixing bowl, place the potatoes, bread crumbs, meat and cheese and mix with a fork.  Add milk, little by little, until mass comes together and season with salt, pepper and a pinch of cinnamon.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Roll dough to thinnest setting on pasta machine and cut sheet horizontally.  Cut each strip into 4-inch strips to yield 4-inch long by 3-inch wide rectangles.  Place 1 tablespoon stuffing in center of each piece and fold in half lengthwise.  Press edges to seal and pull slightly forward on edges to create crescent shape.  Place in boiling water and cook until "al dente".

Meanwhile, melt the butter and veal stock.  Toss to coat with grated cheese and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  chestnut flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  walnut pieces
  2               cups  milk
  2        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  2               cups  seedless red grapes
  1                cup  sugar

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, place flour, sugar and walnuts.  Add 1/2 cup cold milk and slowly add rest of milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps to form in batter.

Grease pan with 1 tablespoon oil and pour in batter.  Drizzle top with remaining oil and distribute rosemary evenly over top.  Bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick pierced in the center comes out clean.

While castagnaccio is cooking, place grapes and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Cook until quite soft and bubbly, about 10 minutes.

Remove castagnaccio from the oven and serve either warm or cool with grape sauce.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1              pound  chicken livers -- rinsed, dried
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- seasoned with
                        Salt -- to taste, and

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RED ONION MARMALADE ===
  2             medium  red onions -- chopped 1/4" dice
  2               cups  Lambrusco wine
                        = (or other light-bodied fruity red wine)
  1                cup  orange juice
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  7             ounces  boneless skinless chicken breast
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  3             ounces  prosciutto -- cold from refrigerat
  5             ounces  mortadella -- cold from refrigerat
     3/4           cup  grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/4           cup  milk
  1                     egg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === ASSEMBLY & SERVICE ===
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
  2               cups  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

To make marmalade:  Place chopped red onions, Lambrusco, orange juice and sugar in a saucepan and place over medium-high heat.  Bring to a boil, lower heat to medium and reduce until thick like marmalade, about 30 minutes.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

To make filling:  In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, melt butter over medium heat until just starting to foam.  Slice raw chicken very thinly across the grain and place in pan with butter.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until very lightly browned.  Add wine, cover and cook for 5 minutes.  Remove cover and cook until liquid is gone, 2 to 3 more minutes.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Cut prosciutto and mortadella into 1/4-inch dice and place in food processor.  Add cooled contents of saute pan and pulse until just ground, like meat, not like a mousse.  Pour into a large mixing bowl and add 3/4 cup cheese, nutmeg, milk and egg, folding carefully.  Check for seasoning with salt only and refrigerate.

To assemble tortellini:  Lay out 1 sheet of pasta and cut into 2-inch rounds using a water glass or cookie cutter.  Cover cut rounds with a damp kitchen towel so that they do not dry out.  Working 5 at a time, place 1/2 teaspoon filling in center of each round.  Fold each round in half to form a half moon and pinch the edges tightly together to seal.  Take the two opposing corners and bring the tails of the half moon together, twisting one half turn so that the sealed half round edge curves around the outside of the filled soul of the tortellini.  Repeat with each round until all pasta is used up.  Leave formed pasta shapes uncovered to dry.

To serve:  Heat the chicken stock to boil in a large pasta pot and add onion marmalade.  Check broth for seasoning with salt.  Drop 48 tortellini into broth and return to boil.  Lower heat until just under boil and cook tortellini until tender and yet still possessing a discernible resistance to the bite, about 4 to 6 minutes.  Spoon 12 tortellini into each of 4 warm soup bowls and divide the broth among them.  Sprinkle with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and serve immediately.

Roll the dough into 3 logs each about 10 by 2 inches.  Place a piece of parchment onto a baking sheet and place logs on sheet.  Place in oven and bake 20 minutes until light golden-brown and remove.  Allow to cool 5 minutes and cut logs on a slight diagonal into pieces 1/2-inch thick

Lower heat to 300 degrees.  Return cut biscotti to baking sheet, just a little bit apart from each other, and place in oven.  Bake 20 minutes until crisp and dry.  Cool and serve.

This recipe yields about 60 biscotti.

  1               pint  blueberries
  1               pint  blackberries
  1               pint  raspberries
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  8        tablespoons  cold sweet butter -- cut 1/2" dice
  1         tablespoon  butter -- for greasing

  1           teaspoon  almond extract
     1/4           cup  cold milk

Remove and allow to cool to room temperature.  Cut into slices about 1-inch thick, top with 2 tablespoons of berry compote and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  flour
  1              pound  ricotta cheese
     1/4         pound  smoked ricotta -- finely grated
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  currants
     1/2      teaspoon  bitter chocolate
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest -- grated

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  flour
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  milk
  1              pinch  salt
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- finely chopped
  3                     Treviso radicchio heads -- chopped 1/2" pieces
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  8             ounces  goat cheese
                        = (preferably Coach Farm)
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped italian parsley
  4        tablespoons  butter

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

To make crespelle, sift flour into a bowl.  Crack eggs into bowl and beat, adding milk a little at a time until all is incorporated.  Allow to rest 30 minutes.

To make the filling, heat olive oil in a 8-inch saute pan until smoking.  Add onion and saute until soft, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Add radicchio.  Saute until soft, about 5 to 6 minutes, and pour mixture into a bowl.  Stir in goat cheese, balsamic vinegar and parsley and set aside.

Heat a 6-inch non-stick pan until hot and brush with olive oil.  Turn heat down to medium and pour 1 1/2 tablespoons batter into pan.  Cook until pale-golden, about one minute, and flip.  Continue the process until all the batter has been used, yielding between 8 to 10 crespelle.  Fill each crespella with 2 tablespoons goat cheese mixture and fold in half.  Continue filling all crepes until all crepes are full.  Be sure to leave 4 tablespoons goat cheese mixture for topping.

Butter bottom and all sides of 10-inch by 8-inch ceramic baking dish.  Lay filled crespelle overlapping in baking dish.  Smear remaining goat cheese mixture over top and place in oven until piping hot and crispy on top, about 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove and serve with a raw radicchio salad.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  duck livers or chicken livers
  2        tablespoons  capers -- rinsed, drained
  2                     anchovy fillets -- rinsed, patted dry
  4          teaspoons  crushed red pepper flakes
  1                cup  dry red wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  English cucumber
  2             ounces  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              ounce  red wine vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  12            slices  Italian country bread, 3/4" thick

In a 10-inch to 12-inch saute pan, heat oil slowly over medium heat.  Add onion and cook slowly until soft but not brown (about 10 minutes).  Add livers, capers, anchovy fillets and red pepper and cook until lightly browned (about 10 minutes).  Add wine and cook until only 3 to 4 tablespoons of liquid remain.

Pour liver mix into food processor and blend intermittently, leaving lumpy -- not smooth -- like a puree.  Season with salt and pepper and remove to a small mixing bowl.

Peel cucumber and remove seeds.  Slice into 1/8-inch half moons and dress with oil, vinegar, sugar and season with salt and pepper.

Grill or toast bread on both sides and spread 1 tablespoon duck liver mixture over each one.  Divide among 4 plates.  Place 2 tablespoons of cucumber mixture on each plate and serve immediately.

     1/2         pound  pancetta -- cut 1/4" dice
  1              large  Spanish onion -- chopped 1/4" dice
  2                     celery ribs -- cut 1/4" rounds
  1         tablespoon  fennel seeds
  2               cups  green olives from ascoli
  2               cups  sweet Aleatico di Puglia wine
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  2                     dried hot peppers from Puglia
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cut duck up into 10 pieces by splitting the breast and cutting each in half into 3 pieces, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks and 2 wings.  Save the liver and use it to thicken the sauce.

In an 8- to 10-quart heavy-bottomed braising pan or Dutch oven, heat 6 tablespoons virgin olive oil over medium flame until smoking.  Place duck pieces skin-side down and cook until golden-brown and most of the fat has been rendered.  Cooking 4 to 6 pieces at a time, this should take 20 to 30 minutes.

When done, drain pan of all but 2 tablespoons of fat and add pancetta.  Cook until lightly browned and add onion, celery, carrots and fennel seeds and cook until softened, about 10 minutes.

Add olives, sweet wine, Basic Tomato Sauce and hot peppers and bring to a boil.  Submerge duck pieces and liver and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer 1/2 hour, or until duck is falling off the bone.

Remove duck and liver to platter with tortiera.  Using a wooden spoon, chop liver to fine mush, return to pan and season sauce with salt and pepper.  Pour sauce over duck and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        recipe  Fresh Fettucine -- (listed below)
     1/2        recipe  Fresh Green Fettucine -- (listed below)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     shallots -- finely chopped
  1                     Treviso radicchio head -- chopped 1" pieces
  1 1/2           cups  cream
                        Zest of 4 lemons -- plus
                        Juice of 1 lemon
     1/2           cup  grated Asiago
                        === FRESH FETTUCINE ===
  4                     extra-large eggs
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- for dusting
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil
                        === FRESH GREEN FETTUCINE ===
  4                     extra-large eggs
  6             ounces  frozen chopped spinach -- defrosted, and
                        squeezed very dry
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- for dusting
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil

To Prepare Fresh Fettucine:  Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and oil.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.  As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any leftover crusty bits.  Discard these bits.  Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe.  They are essential for a light pasta.

Roll out pasta to thinnest setting on pasta machine.  Cut pasta into 1/4-inch thick noodles by hand or with machine and set aside under a moist towel.

To Prepare Green Fettucine:  Follow the regular fettucine instructions above.

To Prepare Dish:  Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat oil over the heat.  Add shallots and saute until light golden-brown, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Add radicchio and cook 30 seconds.  Add cream, reduce by half and remove from heat.  Drop pasta into boiling water and cook until tender yet al dente.  Drain pasta well and toss into pan with cream mixture.  Return to heat, add lemon zest and juice and toss to coat.  Add half the cheese and toss again.  Serve immediately in warm bowl, making extra cheese available on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     jumbo artichokes
  12                    garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  almonds -- thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  sea salt
  3        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     lemons -- zested, seeded,
                        peeled, chopped fine
  1 1/2           cups  fresh oregano leaves
  1 1/2           cups  extra-virgin olive oil

Pre-heat barbecue or grill.

Cut pointy tops and tips of jumbo artichokes off by about 1 1/2 inches.  In a mixing bowl, mix garlic, almonds, salt, pepper, chopped lemons and oregano leaves until well blended.  Spread artichokes apart, using fingers until they are open like flowers.  Divide the oregano mixture among artichokes and stuff it down between the leaves.

Drizzle 4 to 5 tablespoons olive oil over each artichoke and place flowers up into coals or on top of grill.  Cook, turning occasionally, for 1 hour.  Outer base will char and become inedible, but the inside will be fully cooked and amazing.
