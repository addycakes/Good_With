                            Blueberry Muffins

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Breakfast/Brunch
                Muffins

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  butter
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2                     eggs
  2               cups  King Arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  milk
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  1 1/2           cups  fresh or frozen blueberries - (to 2)
                        = (wild Maine berries preferred)
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- mixed with
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon -- (optional)

Preheat your oven to 375 degrees.  Grease 12 muffin cups generously; a vegetable oil pan spray works well.

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until they're light and fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.  Add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture, and beat well.  Stir in the milk and vanilla.  mixing only until smooth.  Quickly stir in the berries.

Fill the muffin cups 3/4 to almost full, using all of the batter.  Sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar.  Bake the muffins for 30 minutes, until they're light golden brown, remove them from the oven, and place the pan on a rack to cool for 10 minutes.

After 10 minutes, run a knife around the edge of one muffin, and try to lift it out of the pan.  (These muffins are very tender, and if they don't cool long enough, they'll crumble when you try to remove them from the pan.)  If the muffin lifts out of the pan without crumbling, remove all of the muffins and cool them completely on a wire rack.  If the muffin sticks or the top peels off, allow them to cool an additional 10 minutes, then try again.

This recipe yields 12 muffins.

Comments:  This is the ne plus ultra of blueberry muffins, the imaginary blue ribbon winner at the state fair, the top of the blueberry muffin heap.  Based on a "famous department store" recipe (remember the Famous Department Store Chocolate Chip Cookies?), this recipe produces meltingly tender muffins, chock-full of berries and gilded with a light cinnamon-sugar topping.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  sugar -- plus more for
                        sprinkling tops
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut into pieces
  1 1/2           cups  fresh blueberries -- picked over,
                        and rinsed
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/3           cup  heavy cream -- plus more for
                        brushing tops
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten

Adjust rack to center of oven, and heat to 400 degrees.  Place a Silpat on a baking sheet, and set aside.

In a large bowl, sift together flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Using a pastry blender, or two knives, cut in butter until the largest pieces are the size of small peas.  Stir in blueberries and zest.

Using a fork, whisk together the cream and the eggs in a liquid measuring cup.  Make a well in the center of dry ingredients, and pour in cream mixture.  Stir lightly with fork just until dough comes together.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead a few times to mix well.

Pat dough into a 6-inch square about 1 1/4 inches thick.  Using a floured knife, cut into four 3-inch squares.  Cut squares in half on the diagonal to form eight triangles.  Transfer to prepared baking sheet.  Brush tops with cream, and sprinkle with sugar.  Bake until golden brown, 20 to 22 minutes.  Transfer scones from baking sheet to wire racks to cool.

This recipe yields 8 scones.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Cooking spray -- as needed
  6                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
     2/3           cup  orange juice
  3        tablespoons  sugar -- divided
  3              pinch  salt -- (optional)
  1                cup  fresh or frozen blueberries -- thawed, and
                        drained, if frozen
  8             slices  Italian bread, 1 1/4" thick
     1/3           cup  sliced almonds
                        === BLUEBERRY ORANGE SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
     1/8      teaspoon  salt -- (optional)
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  1                cup  fresh or frozen blueberries
  1                cup  orange sections - (abt 2 oranges)

French Toast:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Spray a large baking sheet with cooking spray.

In a medium bowl beat eggs, peel, juice, 2 tablespoons of the sugar and the salt until well blended.  Pour into a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan; set aside.

In a small bowl combine blueberries and the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar; set aside.  With the tip of a sharp knife, cut a 1 1/2-inch wide pocket in the side of each bread slice.  Fill pockets with reserved blueberry mixture, dividing evenly.  Place filled slices in egg mixture.  Let stand, turning once, until egg mixture is absorbed, about 5 minutes on each side.

Arrange bread on prepared baking sheet; sprinkle with almonds.  Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes, turning slices after 10 minutes.  Serve with Blueberry Orange Sauce.

Blueberry Orange Sauce:  In a cup combine sugar, cornstarch and salt; set aside.  In a small saucepan bring orange juice and 1/4 cup water to a boil.  Add blueberries and orange sections.   Return to a boil; cook until liquid is released from fruit, about 2 minutes.   Stir in sugar mixture; cook, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens, 1 to 2 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Egg Tips

Buying Eggs: 
  ï Fresh eggs look rough and chalky.  Older eggs look smooth and shiny 
  ï Place an egg in cool salted water.  If it sinks to the bottom it is fresh.  It it rises to the surface it is spoiled.

Storing Eggs: 
  ï Refrigerate eggs.  One hour at room temperature is equal to a day in the refrigerator.  Refrigerated eggs will keep for 4 to 5 weeks. 
  ï Store eggs with the rounded end up. 
  ï Don't wash eggs, this removes a protective coating. 
  ï Eggs are porous so don't store them near strong smelling foods. 
  ï Store eggs in the carton rather than in the egg cups on the refrigerator shelf. 
  ï Whites will keep for 10 days in the refrigerator if stored in a covered jar. 
  ï Both whites and yolks can be frozen

Preparing Eggs: 
  ï Use a small funnel to separate whites and yolks. 
  ï To keep eggs from cracking when placed in boiling water, pierce one end with a pin.  Make sure eggs are at room temperature before boiling. 
  ï Use medium to large eggs for recipes.  Extra large eggs may throw the recipe off and, for example, cause cakes to fail. 
  ï For best results, use eggs at room temperature for baking. 
  ï Use egg whites at room temperature for greatest volume when beating.  Be sure to use totally clean bowls and beaters.  No grease.  No plastic.  Don't beat the whites until they are dry.  They should still be shiny. 
  ï When boiling or poaching eggs, heat on simmer.  High heat will toughen eggs. 
  ï Never cook an egg in its shell in a microwave oven.  It will explode.  Always prick the egg yolk to allow steam to escape or it is likely to explode.

They should still be shiny. &#013;&#010;  ï When boiling or poaching eggs, heat on simmer.  High heat will toughen eggs. &#013;&#010;  ï Never cook an egg in its shell in a microwave oven.  It will explode.  Always prick the egg yolk to allow steam to escape or it is likely to explode.

Just for fun, make French toast in a waffle iron.

Cut bread slices in half diagonally.

Cut each bread slice into several strips.

Cut bread with cookie cutters for variety.

To freeze, once bread has absorbed all of egg mixture, place pieces in a single layer on a cookie sheet and freeze until solid.  Wrap pieces individually and return to freezer.  To serve, place on a lightly greased cookie sheet and bake in a 500 degree oven for 5 minutes on each side.  Brush with melted butter before baking if desired.

Try different breads for a flavorful variety, challah bread, egg bread, raisin bread, French bread, Italian bread, whole wheat bread, oat bread, granola bread, or rye bread.

Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Cakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                jar  maraschino cherries - (10 oz)
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- softened
     1/2           cup  slivered almonds
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  2           packages  crescent rolls - (8 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar
  1           teaspoon  milk - (to 2)
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract

Drain maraschino cherries; discard juice or save for another use.  Reserve 8 to 10 maraschino cherries for garnish; chop remaining cherries.  Combine chopped cherries, cream cheese, almonds, sugar, and almond extract; mix well.

Separate each can of crescent roll dough into 2 rectangles; press firmly at edges and perforations to make one large rectangle.  Roll or pat into a rectangle about 15 by 13 inches.

Spread cream cheese mixture over dough.  Roll up dough starting at long side of rectangle.  Place seam-side down on greased baking sheet.  Form into a ring, firmly pressing ends together.

                        Muffin Tips

Do ahead!  Stir dry ingredients together in a medium bowl in the evening.  The next morning just combine with the liquid ingredients and bake.

For Perfect Muffins Every Time: 
  ï Stir all dry ingredients together in one bowl.  In another bowl, mix liquid ingredients.  Then make a well in the dry ingredients, add the liquid ingredients and stir just to moisten.
  ï Treat muffin batter gently.  Don't overmix.  Stir just 10 to 15 strokes, leaving the batter lumpy.  Overmixing makes muffins tough.
  ï Lightly grease muffin pans or cups or use a vegetable spray or paper liners.
  ï Fill muffin pans only 2/3 full.
  ï Always bake in a preheated oven.
  ï Allow muffins to rest in pans on a wire rack before removing so they don't break apart when taken out of pans.  But do remove muffins from pans within 5 to 10 minutes to avoid soggy bottoms.
  ï Cool muffins completely before storing in airtight containers.
  ï Most muffins freeze well.  Wrap cool muffins in plastic wrap and freeze for as long as 1 month.
  ï To reheat muffins, wrap muffins loosely in aluminum foil and heat in a 200 degree oven for 5 to 19 minutes.  Reheat frozen muffins at 325 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes.  Or heat in a microwave.

Streusel Topping: 
    1/2 cup chopped nuts 
    1/2 cup brown sugar 
    3 tablespoons flour 
    1 teaspoon cinnamon 
    2 tablespoons butter or margarine

In a small bowl, mix together and sprinkle on top of muffin batter before baking.  Tops 12 muffins.

In a small bowl, beat eggs, water, salt and pepper with a fork.

Heat a 7- or 8-inch skillet over medium heat.  Add butter and heat until sizzling.  Pour in egg mixture.  After about 5 seconds, with the side of a fork or with a pancake turner, carefully push cooked portions at edges to center to allow uncooked portions to flow to bottom, while shaking the pan and sliding it back and forth over the heat.  This will keep the egg mixture moving so that it won't stick or overcook.

While top is still moist and creamy-looking, add filling, if desired.  Fold in half or roll, turning onto plate quickly.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

                        Pancake Tips

Stir batter just until blended.  Don't overmix.

Test griddle by sprinkling a few drops of water on surface.  If the water bounces on the surface, the griddle is ready.

Pour batter by spoonfuls onto griddle; bake until bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 3 minutes, then turn and cook until underside is golden.

Turn pancakes only once.

If batter is too thick, thin with milk, juice or water.

If batter is too thin, add flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.

Pancakes are best served immediately.

To freeze, place on a cookie sheet until frozen.  Then wrap well and return to freezer.  Reheat in toaster, microwave or oven.

Use any prepared mix to save time.  Many variations can be added.

Pan-San:  Create a great breakfast sandwich, layering a pancake, egg, pancake, bacon or sausage and another pancake.  You may choose to top with butter and syrup.

Do Ahead Tip:  Mix dry ingredients together the night before.  Cover.  Add liquid ingredients when ready to cook.

  1                cup  powdered sugar
  2        tablespoons  hot water

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease 2 baking sheets.

Unfold one pastry sheet on lightly floured surface.  Roll out to make a 10-inch square.  Cut into 4 squares.  Place 2 tablespoons morsels in center of each square.  Brush edges lightly with beaten egg and fold squares to form triangles.  Press edges to seal.  Place on prepared baking sheet about 2 inches apart.  Repeat with remaining pastry sheet.  Brush top of each pastry with beaten egg.

Bake for 15 to 17 minutes or until puffed and golden.  Cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely.

Melt baking bar and butter in small, microwave-safe bowl on High (100%) power for 30 seconds; stir.  Microwave at additional 10 to 20 second intervals, stirring until smooth.  Stir in sugar.  Add water, stirring until icing is smooth, adding additional water, if necessary.  Drizzle icing over pastries.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ROLLS ===
  1            package  hot roll mix
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  hot water
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine
  1                     egg
                        === CINNAMON MIXTURE ===
  3        tablespoons  butter or margarine -- softened
     1/2      teaspoon  honey
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
     1/2           cup  raisins
                        === ICING === -- (optional)
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine -- softened
  2        tablespoons  milk or cream - (to)
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla

Lightly grease a 9- by 13-inch pan.

In a medium bowl, pour roll mix, mixing in the provided yeast.  Add sugar, stirring to mix.  Stir in water, butter or margarine and egg.  Stir until dough leaves side of bowl.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.   Form into a ball and knead for 5 minutes until dough is smooth.  Rinse a bowl in hot water, dry and turn upside down over dough.  Allow to rest 5 minutes.  Then, on a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 15- by 10-inch rectangle.   Mix butter or margarine with softened honey and spread on dough.

In a small bowl, mix cinnamon and sugar.  Sprinkle mixture evenly over buttered dough.  Sprinkle with raisins.  Beginning at shorter end, roll dough tightly.  Pinch edges together to seal.

Cut roll into 9 pieces.  Place in prepared pan.  Cover with clean towel.  Let rise 30 minutes.

Remove towel and bake at 350 for 20 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool 1 minute.  Remove from pan.  Cool 10 minutes.

In a small bowl, mix powdered sugar, butter, milk or cream and vanilla until smooth.  Spread over warm rolls to glaze.

This recipe yields 9 rolls.

Variations:  Use frozen bread dough, thawed, in place of hot roll mix.

Description:
  "This recipe is based on Davidson's famous cinnamon rolls.  Adding
  honey to the butter adds a special flavor.  A hot roll mix speeds up
  the process."

Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Breakfast/Brunch
                Muffins

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2           cups  King Arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  2               cups  dark brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2                     eggs
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1 1/4           cups  milk
  4                     peaches -- unpeeled, diced
                        = (or 3 cups small whole berries or
                        other fruit, diced)
                        Granulated sugar -- for sprinkling

Combine flour, salt, baking powder, brown sugar, allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon in a large bowl.  Stir in eggs, vegetable oil and milk, then gently stir in fruit.

Grease 16 muffin cups, and heap batter into cups; they'll be very full.  Sprinkle with granulated sugar.  Bake at 400 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes, or until muffins test done.

This recipe yields 16 muffins.

Comments:  These muffins are big, high-crowned affairs that seem to explode right out of the muffin cup.  We make them here with peaches, but they're also delightful made with blueberries, blackberries or raspberries.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  yellow corn meal
     1/2           cup  rolled oats
     1/2           cup  100% bran cereal
     1/4           cup  wheat germ
  2               cups  boiling water
  2           packages  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water -- 115 to 120 degrees
     1/3           cup  honey
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine -- melted
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  whole-wheat flour
  3               cups  unbleached flour

In a 1-quart glass measuring cup or bowl, combine corn meal, oats, bran and wheat germ.  Pour in 2 cups boiling water.  Stir thoroughly.  Set aside to cool.

Place yeast in large mixing bowl.  Add 1/2 cup warm water.  Stir to dissolve yeast.  Add honey, butter and salt.  Mix thoroughly.  Add cooled cornmeal mixture.  Stir until smooth.  Stir in whole wheat flour.  Gradually add unbleached flour, one cup at a time, until mixture is stiff enough to knead (about 2 1/2 cups).

Sprinkle remaining flour on board.  Knead dough for 10 to 12 minutes until smooth.  Add additional flour as necessary.  Shape dough into ball.  Lightly grease clean mixing bowl.  Place dough in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size (about 1 1/2 hours).

Punch down dough to remove air bubbles.  Turn out onto lightly floured board.  Divide dough in half.

Shape each half into a round loaf.  Place loaves on a large lightly greased cookie sheet or 2 pie plates.  Cover.  Place in warm, draft-free place until double in size (about 1 hour).

Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees 40 to 50 minutes or until bread sounds hollow when tapped.  Remove loaves from cookie sheet.  Cool on wire racks.

This recipe yields 2 loaves.
