--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  chicken stock
  10                    baby artichokes
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  virgin olive oil
  1              pound  arborio rice
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  grated Sicilian pecorino
  2         tablespoon  minced fresh Italian parsley
  1              sprig  thyme -- leaves removed
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Bring the chicken stock to a boil over high heat.

Clean the artichokes, leaving the tender inner leaves attached to the hearts, and halved.  Rub with 1/2 lemon.

Cook artichokes until tender, about 10 minutes.

In a saute pan over low heat, saute onions and garlic together in olive oil.  Add rice and toast to harden the outer starch.  Add wine and slowly add chicken stock, only adding as much as will evaporate in 1 minute, until rice is cooked and creamy.

When the rice is cooked, remove from heat and allow it to set for a few minutes to absorb any remaining liquid.  Just before serving, mix in the artichokes, cheese, chopped parsley, thyme leaves, and salt and pepper, to taste.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Recipe By     :Alex Garcia
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into small cubes, plus
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1                cup  ice water - (scant)
  1             medium  white onion -- small diced
  1              bunch  spinach -- cut chiffonade
  3               cups  coarsely-grated manchego cheese
  1                cup  chopped hazelnuts
  1                cup  dark raisins
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  2        tablespoons  water -- for egg wash

In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt.  With a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in the chilled butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the egg and vinegar.  Slowly add the water, as needed, mixing to form the dough, until well blended.  Turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and knead gently until the dough becomes smooth, only a few seconds.  Wrap well and chill for 30 minutes.

Saute onion in butter and add spinach over medium heat.  Cool and then combine with cheese, hazelnuts, and raisins.

On a lightly floured surface, roll half the chilled dough to 1/8-inch thick (keep the other half refrigerated until ready to use).  Cut out 3-inch circles.  Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling into the center of each circle.  Brush egg wash around the edges of the dough.  Fold the edges up forming a pouch, and seal.

Refrigerate the empanadas on greased or parchment lined baking sheets at least 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Brush the empanadas with egg wash and bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VARENIKE DOUGH ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1              large  egg
  1              large  egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  water
                        === EGG WASH ===
  1                     egg -- mixed with
  2        tablespoons  water
                        === FILLING ===
  4                     Granny Smith apples
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  rum
     1/4           cup  apple juice concentrate
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar
     1/3           cup  dried cherries
                        === BUTTER PECAN NIC ===
  1                     vanilla bean
     3/4           cup  milk
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (lightly-packed)
  3              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  toasted chopped pecans

For the Dough:  Put the flour in a mixing bowl, and make a well in the center.  Mix in the rest of the ingredients to form a soft dough.  Knead until elastic.  Form into a disk and wrap with plastic.  Refrigerate for 1 hour to relax.

For the Filling:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Peel and core the apples.  Cut into 1/2-inch pieces.  Whisk together the cornstarch, rum, apple juice, and sugar.  Mix in the apples and cherries.  Put the mixture in a baking dish a cover with foil.  Bake for 15 minutes.  Remove the foil and bake for 15 to 20 minutes more, occasionally stirring until juicy, gooey, and just tender.  Let cool.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.

Flour and roll the dough to 1/16- to 1/4-inch thick.  Cut out 3-inch rounds.  Paint with the egg wash.  Drop 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each round.  Fold over, then crimp with a fork, pressing closed from the outside-in.  Cook in small batches until tender but nice and chewy (about 3 minutes).

For the Butter Pecan Nic:  Split the vanilla bean lengthwise.  Scrape out the seeds.  Reserve all.

Put the seeds, pod halves, milk, cream and 1/4 cup brown sugar in a heavy-bottomed, medium saucepan.  Bring to a scald over low heat.

In the meantime, put the remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar, egg yolks and vanilla extract in a large bowl and whisk just to blend.

While gently whisking the yolks, drizzle the hot cream mixture into them so that they are gradually warmed up.  Return everything to the saucepan and cook while stirring with a wooden spoon.  Make sure that you are constantly scraping the spoon across the bottom of the pan so the custard does not scorch.  The custard is done when it has thickened slightly and can evenly coat the back of the spoon.  Do not let it come to a boil.

Strain the custard through a fine sieve.  Press out all the liquid in the vanilla beans and add to the custard.  Nestle the container holding the custard into a large bowl of ice.  Let cool, stirring occasionally.  When chilled, sprinkle with pecans.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

The custard is done when it has thickened slightly and can evenly coat the back of the spoon.  Do not let it come to a boil.

Strain the custard through a fine sieve.  Press out all the liquid in the vanilla beans and add to the custard.  Nestle the container holding the custard into a large bowl of ice.  Let cool, stirring occasionally.  When chilled, sprinkle with pecans.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CREPES ===
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  water
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  melted butter
                        Nonstick vegetable spray
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  dried cherries
     1/4         pound  cream cheese -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        = (or 1/2 scraped vanilla bean)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              large  egg
  1              pound  farmer's cheese, pot cheese, or
                        cottage cheese - (2 cups)
                        Canola oil and butter -- for frying
                        Sour cream or yogurt -- as accompaniment
                        === NECTARINES AND CHERRIES ===
  1            package  frozen sour cherries - (12 oz) -- thawed, drained,
                        reserving the juice
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2              large  nectarines -- sliced 1/3" wedges
     1/4           cup  shlivovitz or brandy
     1/2         pound  fresh bing cherries -- (optional), pitted

For the Crepes:  Put all of the ingredients except the butter into a food processor or blender and process until smooth, about 10 seconds.  If necessary, scrape down any solids that stick to the sides.  Add the butter and process for a few more seconds to blend.  Refrigerate, covered, for at least 2 hours or overnight.

Set a 10-inch, non-stick crepe pan over moderately-high heat, then spray with non-stick vegetable spray.  When nice and hot, remove the pan from the heat and add 2 tablespoons of batter, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan.  Cook for 1 1/2 minutes until lightly browned.  Set aside on a plate, cooked-side up, and continue with the remainder of the batter.

For the Filling:  In a small saucepan, cover the cherries with water and bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat and let rest.  In a bowl, mix the cream cheese, vanilla, sugar, and egg until blended.  Gently mix in the pot, farmer, or cottage cheese.  Drain the cherries and mix them in.

Place 2 tablespoons of filling in the lower center of the blintz.  Fold up once from the bottom, and then fold over the sides.  Roll up the rest of the way.  Repeat with the rest.

Heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan.  In small batches (4), fry the blintzes fold-side down until golden brown.  Gently flip to fry the other side.  Serve with sour cream, and Nectarines and Cherries, flambeed in Shlivoviz.

For the Nectarines and Cherries, flambeed in Shlivovitz:  In a bowl, whisk together the cherry juice and cornstarch.  In a hot saute pan, melt the butter.  Add the sugar, then the nectarines.  Carefully pour in the shlivovitz.  If it does not burst into flames spontaneously, ignite with a match.  Gently swirl the pan and baste the nectarines until the flames die out.  Add the cherry juice mixture and cook until bubbling for 10 seconds.  Take the sauce off the heat; add the thawed and fresh cherries.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     free range chicken - (3 lbs)
  2             quarts  water
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely diced
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     leek -- cleaned, quartered
  1                     carrot -- peeled, quartered
     2/3           cup  aborio rice
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Place the chicken in a large pot with 2 quarts cold water, enough to cover the chicken.  Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low, skimming when necessary.

In a separate pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and add the onions.  Sweat the onions until clear.  Set aside.

When chicken is cooked through, remove from the broth.  Let the chicken cool and pull the meat from the bones.  Dice into large cubes.  Set aside.

Add the onion, bay leaves, leek, and carrot to the broth and simmer for 1 hour.  When finished, remove the carrot and leek from the broth and add the rice.  Bring to a boil and then turn heat to medium-high to simmer until the rice is cooked to al dente, about 30 minutes.  Add the chicken back into the broth.  Add more water if needed.

In a small bowl beat the eggs and lemon juice together.  Pour 2 cups of broth slowly into the bowl of egg and lemon, whisking continuously.  Once all the broth is incorporated, add the mixture into the pot of chicken soup and stir to blend well throughout.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  goat cheese -- divided
                        into 4 round disks
     1/4                cascabel chile -- toasted in dry pan,
                        ground in a coffee grinder
     1/4           cup  pistachio nuts -- toasted in dry pan,
                        ground in a grinder or food processor
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs
                        = (Japanese panko, if available)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        === BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/2           cup  good olive oil
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2                     shallots -- minced
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

Crust the cheese with the chile, nuts, and bread crumbs and a little salt.  Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a nonstick pan (large enough to fit all 4 disks comfortably) on medium heat.  Place the crusted cheese in the pan.  Heat for 45 seconds, turn with a spatula, and heat for another 45 seconds.

For the Hot Candied Walnuts:  In a large saute pan on medium heat, place all ingredients.  Keep the pan moving until the sugar melts and the ingredients are all melted together.  (Be very cautious, can burn easily).  Pour mixture onto a greased sheet pan.  Leave out to cool.  When cool, chop into small pieces.  Set aside until needed.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried chick peas -- soaked overnight
  6                     chicken thighs
                        = (or 2 turkey thighs)
  2                     veal shoulder chops
                        = (or 1 1/2 lbs stew veal)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil - (to 2)
  1              large  Spanish onion -- coarsely chopped
  8                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  ground fenugreek*
  2           teaspoon  ground cumin*
  1           teaspoon  ground turmeric*
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  2                     carrots -- cut 2" pieces
  1 1/2         pounds  beef kielbasa or smoked bratwurst
                        === KNADLES (MATZO BALLS) ===
  1                cup  matzo meal
  3                     eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Skimmings from the cholent

* Note:  If fenugreek, cumin, tumeric, and cinnamon cannot be found, substitute 2 tablespoons curry powder instead of those spices.

Wash the chick peas, pick them over and soak overnight in cold water to cover by at least 2 inches.

Skin the chicken thighs.  Trim and cut the chops into 2-inch chunks.  Trim the meat of as much fat as possible.  Set aside.

In a hot saute pan, heat the olive oil, and brown the meat in batches.  Brown the onions, then the garlic.  Drain and place the chick peas, onions, and garlic in a Dutch oven.  Stir in the spices and sugar.  Add the veal and chicken.  Add water to cover.  Cook over low heat for 1 hour.

Skim off 2 tablespoons of fat and 1/2 cup of liquid from the cholent.  Let this cool a little and mix it with the matzo meal and eggs.  Form the dough into walnut sized balls and add to the pot.  Add the carrots and sausage.  Season the stew.  Cook for 2 hours on the stovetop or place in a 225 degree oven overnight.  At any rate, it's much better the next day.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Recipe By     :Aaron Sanchez
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  dried garbanzos (chickpeas)
  1 1/2           cups  panela (cane sugar) or piloncillo
  1                     four-inch stick canela (cinnamon)
  1                cup  roughly-chopped pineapple

Soak the garbanzo beans in 2 quarts of water for 12 hours, then drain.

Add 2 quarts fresh water to the pot with the garbanzos.  Bring to a boil and boil for 30 minutes.

To another pot, add 2 quarts of water.  Add the panela, canela, and pineapple, bring to a boil, and cook for 1 hour, stirring constantly.

Drain the beans when tender, and set aside to cool.  When cool, remove each individual skin from each bean, this process can be time consuming.

While the panela combination is still hot, fold in the garbanzos.  Serve hot on top of rice pudding, ice cream, or cake.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  seltzer
                        Melted butter -- as needed
  4             ounces  Armenian string cheese or mozzarella
                        === SPINACH-CHEESE FILLING ===
  4             ounces  cream cheese
     1/4           cup  minced roasted hazelnuts
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/4      teaspoon  ground coriander
  1              pinch  cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  fenugreek
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  cooked spinach
  4             ounces  feta cheese

For the Dough:  In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a paddle, mix the flour and the salt.  Add the egg, oil, and seltzer, and mix to form a soft dough.  Turn out the dough and knead, by hand, for 1 minute, until the dough is elastic.

Divide the dough into 4 pieces, form into balls, cover in plastic, and let rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

When chilled, roll the ball into a square.  Trim the edges, and brush with melted butter.  Fold the dough in half, and brush with butter.  Fold the dough in half again, to make a square.  Place 1/2 cup Spinach-Cheese Filling in the center.  Sprinkle with some string cheese.  Fold up the corners like a half open envelope.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.  Bake for 25 minutes.

For the Spinach-Cheese Filling:  Mix together the cream cheese, hazelnuts, garlic, cilantro, coriander, cayenne, fenugreek, salt, and black pepper.  Thoroughly drain the spinach and chop.  Mix into the mixture, then fold in the feta.  Set aside until ready to use.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  grape leaves
  8             ounces  goat cheese
  1         tablespoon  mixed herbs
                        = (thyme, basil, rosemary, and/or parsley)
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Arugula -- for a salad
  8             slices  Greek loaf bread
                        Marinated olives -- as accompaniment

Mix the goat cheese, herbs, salt, and pepper in a bowl.

Spread out the grape leaves, in sets of 2 overlapping pairs.  Scoop 2 ounces (ice cream scoop works best) of goat cheese mixture, and place in the middle of the pair of grape leaves.  Starting with 1 end, fold each side until goat cheese is covered, making a rectangular packet.  Repeat with remaining leaves.  Place stuffed leaves in a container and cover with extra-virgin olive oil.

Heat a grill.

Using tongs, place the packets onto the hot grill.  When marked, turn over, and mark on the other side.  Grill until cheese is soft.  When soft, remove from grill.

Place on a bed of arugula, and tear open the grape leaf.  Brush 8 pieces of bread with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and grill both sides.  Cut in half on a bias and serve with the goat cheese and marinated olives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

         Grilled Sausage, Fennel, And Baby Artichoke Spring Pasta

Recipe By     :Rocco DiSpirito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     sweet sausages
  2                     fennel bulbs -- quartered
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Olive oil -- for grilling
     1/2         pound  dry farfalle pasta
                        = (butterfly or bowtie pasta)
  1                     lemon -- halved
  1              small  onion -- diced
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  20                    baby artichokes -- trimmed
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     3/4           cup  walnut oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2         bunch  flat-leaf parsley -- leaves picked

Heat grill on medium-high.

Cook sausages for 10 minutes, making sure to turn to prevent burning.  Season fennel with salt and pepper, brush with olive oil, and grill until brown and tender, about 20 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, slice the sausages on the bias into 1/4-inch slices, and cut the fennel into similarly sized pieces.  Keep the sausage and fennel warm until ready to use.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta.  Cook the pasta al dente.

In another large pot of water, add lemon, onion, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil.  Add trimmed artichokes and top with a small plate to weight down artichokes.  Cook until hearts are almost tender, about 15 minutes.  Remove from pot and pat dry.  Season with salt and pepper, and place on grill to cook for 5 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, halve the artichokes.

In a medium-sized bowl, mix the vinegar and mustard.  Slowly whisk in oil until emulsified.  Mix in salt, sugar, and pepper.  Toss the sausage, fennel, artichokes, and pasta with walnut vinaigrette and plate, garnishing with the whole parsley leaves.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Cook sausages for 10 minutes, making sure to turn to prevent burning.  Season fennel with salt and pepper, brush with olive oil, and grill until brown and tender, about 20 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, slice the sausages on the bias into 1/4-inch slices, and cut the fennel into similarly sized pieces.  Keep the sausage and fennel warm until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta.  Cook the pasta al dente.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In another large pot of water, add lemon, onion, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil.  Add trimmed artichokes and top with a small plate to weight down artichokes.  Cook until hearts are almost tender, about 15 minutes.  Remove from pot and pat dry.  Season with salt and pepper, and place on grill to cook for 5 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, halve the artichokes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium-sized bowl, mix the vinegar and mustard.  Slowly whisk in oil until emulsified.  Mix in salt, sugar, and pepper.  Toss the sausage, fennel, artichokes, and pasta with walnut vinaigrette and plate, garnishing with the whole parsley leaves.  Serve immediately.

                        Grilled Sour Cherry Pizza

Recipe By     :Rocco DiSpirito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  3        tablespoons  cold butter
  3                     eggs -- lightly beaten with
  3        tablespoons  water
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  Champagne or vinegar
  1                cup  pitted Bing cherries
  3               cups  well-chilled thin Pastry Cream -- (listed below)
     3/4           cup  cherry preserves
                        === PASTRY CREAM ===
  1              quart  whole milk
  1                     vanilla bean -- split, seeds removed
  10             large  egg yolks
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     3/4           cup  cornstarch

In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine the flour, sugar, and baking powder.  Cut in the butter.  Pulse until butter is well distributed and the mixture resembles a coarse meal.  Add eggs and pulse again until dough clumps together.  Gather the dough into a ball.  Divide dough and wrap in waxed paper.  Chill for 1 hour.

Add water and vinegar to a medium pot.  Add cherries and cook until cherries are soft.  Drain.

Heat up grill.

Butter a 10-inch round cake pan.  Roll dough into a circle and transfer to cake pan.  Pinch edges to form a crust, like that of a pan pizza.  Fill dough with pastry cream.  Spread cherry preserves and cherries.  Place pie on pizza stone on grill.  Cook until dough is crispy and brown, about 1 hour.

For the Pastry Cream:  In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the milk and vanilla bean and bring to a boil.  Turn off heat immediately and keep warm while you whisk the yolks.

In a medium bowl, combine the yolks, sugar, and cornstarch and whisk until thoroughly combined.  While whisking, slowly add the warm milk mixture into the yolks and then transfer this back into the saucepan over medium heat.

Whisk constantly while you bring the custard to a boil; it should begin to thicken immediately.  Whisk until thickened completely, about 3 minutes.

Pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean bowl and use a rubber spatula to push everything through.  Place a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate until completely chilled.  (Makes 5 cups)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  chicken - (3 to 4 lbs)
  4             ounces  honey
  4             ounces  salt
  1              quart  water
  2                     bay leaves
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  6                     sage leaves
  6                     thin slices lemon -- seeds removed
  2             ounces  olive oil

Mix honey, salt, water, bay leaves, and garlic together.  Pull skin away from chicken just enough to place sage leaves and lemon slices under skin.  Truss the chicken and tie the other end of the butcher's twine to the pot handle for a quick retrieval of the brined chicken.  Place chicken in liquid and let sit in cooler for 12 hours.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Place chicken on roasting rack in oven and brush with olive oil.  Bake for about 45 to 50 minutes or until juices run clear.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Kalamata olives -- pitted
  1                     Calabrian chile -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- divided, sliced thin
  1         tablespoon  capers -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh oregano
     3/4           cup  olive oil -- divided
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper -- divided
  1                     leg of lamb - (5 to 6 lbs)
  8              small  rosemary sprigs
  1         tablespoon  dry crushed oregano
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  2          teaspoons  salt
  4                     pitas -- halved
     1/2           cup  goat cheese -- softened
  8             ounces  arugula

In a food processor, grind the olives, chile, 1 of the garlic cloves, capers, 1 teaspoon black pepper, fresh oregano, and 1/2 cup of the olive oil together.  Cover and set aside.

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.

Make sure the lamb leg is cleaned well and any hard fat is trimmed off.  Make 8 slits in the leg and stuff them with the rosemary sprigs and remaining sliced garlic.  Rub the leg with the remaining olive oil, dry oregano, lemon, salt, and pepper.

Roast for about 30 minutes.  Lower heat to 375 degrees.  Add water to the pan if needed.  Cook until the internal temperature of the lamb is 120 to 135 degrees, about 3 1/2 hours.

Remove from the pan and let rest for 10 minutes.  Skim the fat from the pan juices and pour into a bowl.  Use for another time, this juice can be frozen.  Slice the lamb as thinly as possible.

Toast the pita bread and spread the goat cheese on the inside of the pita.  Pile in about 4 to 5 slices of the lamb and top with the olive spread and arugula.  Serve room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Michelle Bernstein
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     flank steaks - (2 lbs ea)
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2         pound  fresh spinach -- washed, drained
  8                     carrots -- peeled, cut
                        into 2" pieces, cooked in
                        boiling salted water
  4                     hard-boiled eggs -- quartered lengthwise
  1              large  red onion -- sliced into rings
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  beef stock
  1                cup  cold water - (to 3)

Butterfly the steaks by slicing them horizontally from 1 long side to within 1/2-inch of the opposite side.  Pound the steaks between plastic wrap to flatten them further.  Trim off all the sinew and fat.

Lay 1 steak cut-side up on a jelly-roll pan.  Sprinkle the steaks with the vinegar, garlic, and thyme.  Cover and marinate, refrigerated, for 3 hours.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Lay the steaks end to end, in the direction of the grain of the meat, so that they overlap.  Pound the overlapping area to join them securely.  Spread the spinach leaves evenly over the meat and arrange the carrots across the grain of the meat in parallel rows about 3 inches apart.  Place the eggs between the carrots.  Scatter the onion rings over the meat, sprinkle with parsley, salt, and pepper.

Carefully roll the matambre with the grain, jelly roll style, into a thick long cylinder.  Tie with butcher's twine at 1-inch intervals.  Place the matambre in a large casserole or roasting pan along with the beef stock.  Add enough cold water to come a third of the way up the roll.  Cover tightly and bake 1 hour.

Serve warm or chilled, sliced into 2-inch thick slices.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  1                     chicken - (3 to 4 lbs)
  12                    garlic cloves -- chopped, divided

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Mushrooms

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive or corn oil
     1/2                white onion -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2                jalapeÒo -- minced
     1/2         pound  fresh mushrooms -- cleaned, chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped epazote
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     crepes -- (listed below)
  1                cup  grated Monterey Jack
  2               cups  Mexican crema
                        = (or 2 cups sour cream thinned
                        out with 1/2 cup milk)
                        Truffle oil -- for garnish
                        === CREPES ===
  1                cup  milk
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  melted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     3/4           cup  flour
                        Non-stick spray or cold butter

In a hot saute pan, add the oil.  Cook the onion, garlic, and jalapeÒo for 3 minutes, or until the onions have become translucent.  Add the huitlacoche, and cook for another 3 minutes.  Add the chopped epazote, and season with salt and pepper.  Set aside to cool.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Arrange the crepes and other ingredients in assembly-line fashion: crepes, filling, cheese, and crema.  Spread 1 tablespoon of sour cream on an open crepe, sprinkle a heaping tablespoon of the huitlacoche filling, cover with a sprinkle of cheese, and roll the crepe into a tube.  Repeat process with the remaining ingredients.

Spread a thin layer of sour cream on the bottom of an oblong 8- by 12-inch glass baking dish.  Place the rolled crepes, seam-side down, close, but not over lapping, in the bottom of the pan.  Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and crema.  Bake in the oven until the cheese is melted and crepes are heated through, about 30 minutes.  Drizzle with a little truffle oil.

For the Crepes:  In a large mixing bowl, whisk the milk, eggs, and melted butter.  Increase speed and whip for 1 minute.  In another bowl, sift the dry ingredients together, and slowly begin to add the dry ingredients to milk mixture.  When well mixed, strain the batter into a spouted measuring cup.

In a non-stick pan, spray a little non-stick spray or coat lightly with butter and pour in about 1/4 cup of batter.  Immediately start tilting pan, covering the bottom of the pan with batter.  Cook until the crepe turns pale brown, then flip with a spatula, cook for 20 seconds more, and remove from the pan onto a paper towel to cool.  Repeat the process with the remaining batter.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1              pound  dry bucatoni
  2                     fennel heads -- thinly sliced
  2             medium  sweet white onions -- thinly sliced

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPONGE ===
  1 1/2         ounces  fresh yeast
  1                cup  milk
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/2         pounds  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  cold water
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Semolina -- for sprinkling peel
                        === TOPPING ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2              large  yellow onions -- cut half-moons
  1                cup  crumbled feta
  1         tablespoon  chopped thyme
                        Olive oil -- for brushing dough

Warm the milk to 110 degrees and pour into a mixing bowl.  Dissolve the yeast in the milk in the bowl.  Add in the flour and the sugar and mix.  Let sit until the mixture (sponge) begins to bubble, about 6 to 8 minutes.

Add in the flour, salt, cold water, and olive oil to the sponge mixture.  Blend until a dough is formed.  When mixed well, the dough will begin to pull away from the bowl.  Knead lightly until a large ball is formed.  Cover with a towel and let sit.  When the dough has risen about 30 to 45 minutes, punch down, and begin to roll into 6-ounce pieces for folded pizzas and 4-ounce pieces for open flat bread.

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.

In a large saute pan, melt the butter and brown lightly on medium high heat.  Add in the onions, turn the heat to medium and slowly caramelize the onions.  When brown, set aside to cool.

Roll out a 6-ounce piece of dough into a long rectangular shape.  Place on a large pizza peel or baking sheet that has been sprinkled with semolina.  Brush the dough with olive oil and poke it several times with a fork to keep it from bubbling up.  Spread the caramelized onions evenly over the dough and sprinkle with the feta and thyme.

Place the pizza in the oven and turn heat down to 400 degrees and bake for 25 minutes or until the top is golden brown.  Cut into 8 pieces and serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  5                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  4        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1                cup  finely-chopped fresh chives
     1/2           cup  chopped rosemary
  1                cup  olive oil

Slather 1/2 of the herb mixture on the inside of the ham.  Roll and tie the ham.  Slather the remaining herb mixture on the outside of the ham.

Place the ham in a large roasting pan and cook in the oven for 1/2 hour.  Baste with some of the white wine and turn down the oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Baste the roast every 20 minutes for 1 hour.  When the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees, remove the ham from the oven.

Let the roast rest for 10 minutes before carving into thin slices.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SYRUP ===
  1 1/2            cup  granulated sugar
  1                cup  water
     1/8           cup  honey
  1              slice  lemon, 1/8" thick
  1                     cinnamon stick - (2" long)
  2                     whole cloves
                        === BAKLAVA ===
  1              pound  blanched almonds -- coarsely ground
  1              pound  walnuts -- coarsely ground
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1 1/2       teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
  4                     sheets phyllo dough
  1 1/4         pounds  unsalted butter -- melted

Combine all of the syrup ingredients in a saucepan; bring to a boil and simmer for 15 minutes.  Remove the lemon and spices.  Cool and set aside.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Combine the almonds, walnuts, sugar, cinnamon, and ground cloves together in a bowl.  Take 4 sheets of phyllo dough and brush each sheet with melted butter, layering the sheets as you go.

Once the 4 sheets are pressed together, sprinkle the nut mixture over the top sheet and roll, lengthwise, until you reach the end.  Keep the roll as tight as possible without breaking.  It should look like a long cylinder.

Cut the roll into 2-inch pieces, dip each into the melted butter and place on a baking sheet.  Place into the oven for about 30 minutes or until golden brown.

When finished remove each piece from the pan and dip in the cool syrup and place on a rack to drain.  Serve in small cup cake cups on a platter.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Heat cast-iron pan over high heat until very hot.  Season tuna with salt and pepper.  Brush lightly with olive oil.  Place steaks in pan and cook until bottom is brown and crusty, about 3 minutes.  Flip tuna and cook for 1 minute.  (Tuna will be just seared on the outside and raw in the middle.)

Remove to a plate.  Drizzle with basil oil and garnish with lemon juice and zest.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2      envelope  dry yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  cold water
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  salt -- divided
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced cleaned leeks
  1                cup  crumbled feta cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a mixing bowl, whisk together the yeast and warm water.  Let stand and bloom for about 20 minutes.

Mix on low speed, the flour, cold water, extra-virgin olive oil, and 1 teaspoon of the salt.  Beat in slowly at first and then increase the speed of the mixer as the flour in incorporated.  Turn the speed down and mix until the dough becomes soft and begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.

Pour it out on a floured board.  Knead the dough adding flour to dust as needed.  Shape the dough into a large ball and cover with a towel to let stand until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.

Heat a saute pan with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and add the leeks.  Turn the heat to medium-high and sweat the leeks until soft and translucent.  Set aside and let cool.

When ready, cut the dough into 6 ounce pieces.  Roll it out to about 1/2-inch thick circle a little smaller than the skillet.  Heat a large skillet with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Place the rolled dough into the skillet and flip it to brown on both sides.  Once browned, sprinkle the top with feta cheese, leeks, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper.  Bake in a preheat 350 degree oven just long enough for the cheese to melt.  Pull from the oven and cut into 6 pieces. Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Heat a saute pan with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and add the leeks.  Turn the heat to medium-high and sweat the leeks until soft and translucent.  Set aside and let cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready, cut the dough into 6 ounce pieces.  Roll it out to about 1/2-inch thick circle a little smaller than the skillet.  Heat a large skillet with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Place the rolled dough into the skillet and flip it to brown on both sides.  Once browned, sprinkle the top with feta cheese, leeks, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper.  Bake in a preheat 350 degree oven just long enough for the cheese to melt.  Pull from the oven and cut into 6 pieces. Serve warm.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  1                cup  champagne vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  saffron threads
  2               cups  pure olive oil
  1         tablespoon  small diced preserved lemon
  1                cup  oil-cured olives -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  cracked black pepper
                        === LAMB ===
  1                     leg of lamb - (5 to 6 lbs)
  8              small  rosemary sprigs
  3                     garlic cloves -- sliced thinly
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  dry oregano -- crumbled
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh oregano
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  2           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a small saute pan, bring the champagne vinegar and saffron to a boil for 1 minute.  Pour into a bowl and whisk in the olive oil slowly as to incorporate it.  Add the chopped preserved lemon and black olives.  Season with pepper.  I do not add salt to this because of the saltiness of the olives.  This recipe makes a quart and will last for at least a month.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Make sure the lamb leg is cleaned well and any hard fat is trimmed off.  Make 8 slits in the leg and stuff them with the rosemary sprigs and garlic cloves.  Rub the leg with the olive oil, dry and fresh oregano, lemon, salt, and pepper.  Roast at 500 degrees for about 30 minutes.  Lower heat to 375 degrees.  Add water to the pan if needed.  Cook for about 3 1/2 hours.

Remove the lamb from the pan and let rest.  Skim the fat from the pan juices and pour the juice onto the bottom of a platter.  Slice the lamb into thin slices and serve topped with the preserved lemon sauce.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Olive oil -- for cooking
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                     poblano pepper -- roasted, peeled,
                        seeded, and diced
  10                    individual fresh squash blossoms
                        = (or a 6-oz can)
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
  3             sprigs  fresh epazote -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     flour tortillas - (10" dia)
     1/4         pound  grated queso blanco -- grated

Heat a large saute pan with a little oil and saute the onion, garlic, and the roasted poblano pepper for 5 minutes, until the onions have become translucent.  Then, add the squash blossoms and deglaze with chicken stock.  Add the epazote, and cook for another 5 minutes until squash blossoms have wilted.  Season with salt and pepper, and set aside to cool.

To compose the quesadilla lay the 2 of the tortillas on a flat surface.  Distribute the cheese equally on both tortillas.  Then, spread 1/2 of the squash blossom filling over the cheese.  Cover with the other tortilla, place on heated griddle on nonstick saute pan with a little oil, and cook for 3 minutes on each side.  When nice and golden brown on each side and cheese has melted, remove and cut into quarters.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Heat a large saute pan with a little oil and saute the onion, garlic, and the roasted poblano pepper for 5 minutes, until the onions have become translucent.

To compose the quesadilla lay the 2 of the tortillas on a flat surface.  Distribute the cheese equally on both tortillas.  Then, spread 1/2 of the squash blossom filling over the cheese.  Cover with the other tortilla, place on heated griddle on nonstick saute pan with a little oil, and cook for 3 minutes on each side.

Recipe By     :Aaron Sanchez
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  instant corn flour
  4        tablespoons  flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  water
                        Corn oil -- for frying
  1                cup  shredded poached chicken breast
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced red cabbage
     1/4           cup  crumbled cotija cheese
                        === SALSA LIQUADA ===
  2                     tomatoes
  1                     jalapeÒo -- stemmed, seeded
     1/2    tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  dried Mexican oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Mix flours, baking powder, and salt and add the warm water.  Combine thoroughly to make a smooth dough.  Make balls the size of a walnut, a few at a time.  Set aside and keep covered.

Moisten a cloth napkin and spread out on a flat surface.  Roll each ball of dough in moistened palm of your hand until smooth, lay on the damp towel, cover with a plastic bag and press down to flatten.  To shape the patty, cut with a 2 to 2 1/4-inch diameter cookie cutter.  It should be about 1/4-inch thick.  Smooth the rough edges with your finger making ready to fry.

Heat a cast-iron skillet, filled half way with corn oil, to 375 degrees.  Slide the patties into hot oil and fry until the light golden brown and crispy about 1 minute on each side.  Drain on paper towels and make a slit on the side as soon as they cool enough to handle.  Push 1 teaspoon of shredded cheese, chicken, and cabbage, and drizzle entire packet with Salsa Liquida.

Salsa Liquida:  Submerge tomatoes in boiling water for 30 seconds and then plunge into ice bath.  Peel and seed the tomatoes.  Puree the tomatoes, jalapeÒo, garlic, and oregano.  Season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Bake the sweet potatoes for 45 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, skin potatoes, and mash together with the honey, butter, molasses, cinnamon, and pepper.  Transfer mixture to a 2-quart casserole.  Sprinkle on the pecans.

Make Marshmallows:  In a small bowl, soften the gelatin by stirring it into 1/4 cup of the water.  Set aside.

In a small saucepan, fitted with a candy thermometer, bring the remaining 1/4 cup of water, a 1/4 cup of corn syrup, and the sugar to 240 degrees (soft ball stage).

In the meantime, put the remaining 1/4 cup of corn syrup, vanilla, and rum in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.  Add the hot syrup to the bowl and whisk at high speed for 3 to 5 minutes until thickened.

Set the gelatin over simmering water to melt.  Add the gelatin to the syrup and continue whisking for 6 more minutes until white, fluffy and stiffened.

Top the casserole with a layer of marshmallow and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, until heated through and browned on top.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Got extra marshmallow?  This should be your biggest problem.  Spread a 1/8-inch coating of all-purpose flour on a baking sheet.  Pipe out 1-inch rounds of marshmallow onto the flour.  They will spread a little, so leave room.  The marshmallows will be set in 20 minutes.  Marshmallows are sticky.  Dip your fingers in flour before handling.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1              ounce  fresh yeast -- dissolved in
     3/4           cup  tepid water
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pinch  salt
     3/4        pounds  fresh tomatoes -- skinned, diced
  1              pound  sliced mozzarella
     1/4         pound  smoked ham
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated pecorino
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh oregano
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Mound flour on a table and make a well in the center.  Pour the dissolved yeast, oil, and salt into the center of the well.  Gently mix in flour with a fork.  Dough should be smooth and pliable.  Add warm water if dough is too dry.  Roll the dough into a ball and put in an oiled bowl.  Cover with a cloth and put in a warm place for 1 hour.

Divide the dough into 2 pieces and roll out 1 of the dough balls into a round shape, about 12 inches in diameter and 1/4-inch thick.  Lay in a greased 12-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.

Spread the tomatoes, mozzarella, ham, and pecorino on the dough.  Sprinkle with oregano, salt and pepper.  Roll out the other ball and lay it on top, folding the top and bottom layers of dough together around the edges.  Cut 3 small holes in top of the pie for steam to escape.  Bake in the oven until the crust is brown and the cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Mound flour on a table and make a well in the center.  Pour the dissolved yeast, oil, and salt into the center of the well.  Gently mix in flour with a fork.  Dough should be smooth and pliable.  Add warm water if dough is too dry.  Roll the dough into a ball and put in an oiled bowl.  Cover with a cloth and put in a warm place for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the dough into 2 pieces and roll out 1 of the dough balls into a round shape, about 12 inches in diameter and 1/4-inch thick.  Lay in a greased 12-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the tomatoes, mozzarella, ham, and pecorino on the dough.  Sprinkle with oregano, salt and pepper.  Roll out the other ball and lay it on top, folding the top and bottom layers of dough together around the edges.  Cut 3 small holes in top of the pie for steam to escape.  Bake in the oven until the crust is brown and the cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.

         Wild Mushroom Barley Soup With Flanken (Beef Short Ribs)

Recipe By     :Wayne Harley Brachman
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Mushrooms
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
  3             quarts  water
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  3             pounds  short ribs or flanken
  1              large  Spanish onion -- chopped
  6                     garlic cloves
  6             ounces  oyster mushrooms -- cut small bouquets
     1/2         pound  shiitakes -- stemmed
  3             ounces  enokis - (to 3 1/2)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  barley -- cooked in stock
                        === HORSERADISH MUSTARD SAUCE ===
  1                     serrano or jalapeÒo
     1/4           cup  prepared horseradish
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard

Simmer dried mushrooms in water for 15 minutes.  Let sit for 1/2 hour, then drain through coffee filter or fine mesh sieve, squeezing juice from mushrooms.  Reserve the liquid.

In a large, heavy-bottomed braising pan or Dutch oven, heat the oil to very hot.  In batches, brown the short ribs.  Remove them to a side platter.  Add the onions and cook until lightly colored.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.  Return the short ribs to the pan and add the mushroom reconstituting water.

On low flame, cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes, occasionally re-positioning the ribs for even cooking until very tender.

Remove the ribs and strain the stock.  Skim off most of the fat (you can do this by cooling it down, then setting it in the refrigerator).  Bring stock to slow boil in the pan.  Add all the mushrooms and meat.  Simmer and heat through.  Season with salt and pepper.

To serve, put soup into bowls.  Place 2 ribs in center, scoop of barley to the side, and mushrooms around.  Serve with Mustard-Horseradish Sauce.

For the Mustard-Horseradish Sauce:  Remove ribs and seeds from the chile and mince.  Mix into horseradish and mustard.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
