--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  firm white sandwich bread - (4" by 4") -- crusts trimmed
  2          teaspoons  butter
  2             medium  apples -- peeled, cored,

  8        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  dried currants or raisins
  2               cups  low-fat (1%) milk
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2 1/2           cups  cake flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  3        tablespoons  frozen orange juice concentrate -- thawed
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated orange peel
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4              large  eggs
  1                cup  whole milk
                        === FILLING ===
  2                     baskets blueberries - (1/2 pint ea)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
                        === FROSTING ===
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  3 1/4           cups  powdered sugar
  2        tablespoons  frozen orange juice concentrate -- thawed
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === TOPPING ===
  2                     baskets blueberries - (1/2 pint ea)

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides; line bottoms with rounds of parchment paper.

Sift first 3 ingredients into medium bowl.  Beat butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Gradually add sugar, beating until blended.  Beat in concentrate, peel, and vanilla.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time.  Beat in flour mixture in 4 additions alternately with milk in 3 additions.

Divide batter between prepared pans.  Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool in pans on rack.

For Filling:  Combine berries, sugar, and lemon juice in heavy small saucepan.  Bring to boil over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Boil until mixture is reduced to 3/4 cup, stirring occasionally and mashing berries coarsely with fork, about 8 minutes.  Chill filling uncovered until cold, about 30 minutes.

For Frosting:  Beat cream cheese and butter in bowl to blend.  Beat in powdered sugar in 4 additions, then orange concentrate, peel, and vanilla.  Chill until firm but spreadable, about 30 minutes.

Cut around cakes to loosen.  Turn cakes out.  Peel off parchment.  Place 1 layer, flat-side up, on platter.  Spread filling to within 1/2 inch of edges.  Chill 5 minutes.  Top with second layer, flat-side down.  Spread 1/2 cup frosting thinly all over cake to seal.  Spread remaining frosting over cake.  Mound remaining blueberries on top.  (Can be made 1 day ahead; chill. Serve at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides; line bottoms with rounds of parchment paper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sift first 3 ingredients into medium bowl.  Beat butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Gradually add sugar, beating until blended.  Beat in concentrate, peel, and vanilla.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time.  Beat in flour mixture in 4 additions alternately with milk in 3 additions.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide batter between prepared pans.  Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool in pans on rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Filling:  Combine berries, sugar, and lemon juice in heavy small saucepan.  Bring to boil over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Boil until mixture is reduced to 3/4 cup, stirring occasionally and mashing berries coarsely with fork, about 8 minutes.  Chill filling uncovered until cold, about 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Frosting:  Beat cream cheese and butter in bowl to blend.  Beat in powdered sugar in 4 additions, then orange concentrate, peel, and vanilla.  Chill until firm but spreadable, about 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut around cakes to loosen.  Turn cakes out.  Peel off parchment.  Place 1 layer, flat-side up, on platter.  Spread filling to within 1/2 inch of edges.  Chill 5 minutes.  Top with second layer, flat-side down.  Spread 1/2 cup frosting thinly all over cake to seal.  Spread remaining frosting over cake.  Mound remaining blueberries on top.  (Can be made 1 day ahead; chill. Serve at room temperature.)

     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/2           cup  whole milk
  1              large  egg
     1/4           cup  chopped crystallized ginger
                        === FILLING ===
  2             pounds  nectarines - (abt 8 med) -- peeled, pitted,
                        and sliced
     2/3           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)

  3               cups  sour cream - (24 oz)
     2/3           cup  sugar

For Biscuits:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line baking sheet with parchment paper.

Combine first 5 ingredients in processor; blend 10 seconds.  Add butter and blend until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Whisk milk and egg in small bowl.  Add milk mixture to processor; blend using 5 on/off turns.  Add crystallized ginger.  Using on/off turns, blend until dough just comes together.

Turn dough out onto work surface; knead gently 5 turns.  Shape dough into log; cut crosswise into 8 rounds.  Pat each round to 1-inch thickness; place on prepared baking sheet.

Bake biscuits until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.  Transfer to rack; cool at least 15 minutes and up to 2 hours.

For Filling:  Combine half of nectarines, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice in heavy large skillet.  Cook over high heat until fruit is just tender and juices bubble thickly, stirring often, about 5 minutes.

Transfer to bowl; repeat with remaining nectarines, sugar, and lemon juice.  Set aside at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.

For Sour Cream:  Combine sour cream and sugar in bowl; whisk to blend.

Cut biscuits horizontally in half.  Place 1 biscuit bottom in each of 8 bowls.  Spoon filling and sour cream onto each; cover each with biscuit top.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  reduced-fat (2%) milk
  1                     cinnamon stick -- broken in half
  16                    orange peel strips - (2" by 1/8") -- orange part only

  8              large  basil leaves

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Arrange tomatoes and fennel in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Drizzle oil over; toss to blend.  Bake until fennel is tender and begins to brown, about 45 minutes.  Cool.

Spray 2 nonstick baking sheets with vegetable oil spray.  Arrange eggplant and mushroom slices on prepared sheets.  Bake until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes for eggplant slices and 40 minutes for mushrooms.

Puree tomato mixture in processor.  Transfer to strainer set over bowl.  Press on solids to extract liquid; discard solids.  Stir vinegar into liquid.  Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper.

Stir spinach in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until wilted, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray four 1 1/4-cup custard dishes with vegetable oil spray.  Line each dish with 2 eggplant slices in crisscross pattern.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Top each with 1/4 of spinach.  Top each with 1 mozzarella slice.  Arrange pepper strips over, then basil and mushrooms.  Top with remaining eggplant slices, cutting to fit.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Cover each dish with foil.  (Vinaigrette and lasagnas can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately; chill.)

Bake lasagnas until very tender, about 25 minutes.  Remove foil.  Using small knife, cut around vegetables to loosen.  Invert onto plates.  Spoon vinaigrette over.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

          Grilled Cheddar And Tomato Sandwiches With Miso Spread

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  firm whole-grain bread -(abt 5" x 4" ea)
  4        tablespoons  white or yellow miso
  8              large  tomato slices
  4                     thin onion slices
  12             large  basil leaves
  1 1/3           cups  coarsely-grated reduced-fat
                        sharp cheddar cheese (abt 5 oz)
  4          teaspoons  butter

Place 4 bread slices on work surface.  Spread 1 tablespoon miso over each.  Top each with 2 tomato slices, then 1 onion slice and 3 basil leaves.  Sprinkle each with 1/3 cup cheese.  Top with remaining bread slices, pressing lightly to adhere.  Spread 1/2 teaspoon butter over top of each sandwich.

Heat 2 large nonstick skillets over medium-low heat.  Add 2 sandwiches, butter-side down, to each skillet.  Cover and cook until bread is golden brown on bottom, about 4 minutes.  Spread top of each sandwich with 1/2 teaspoon butter.  Turn sandwiches over; cover and cook until bottoms are brown and cheese melts, about 3 minutes.  Cut sandwiches crosswise in half and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Miso is a combination of soybeans and rice (or another grain) that produces a thick, salty and flavorful paste.  Here, it replaces mayonnaise or mustard as a spread for grilled cheese sandwiches.

Comments:  This is an adaptation of a recipe by Claire Winslow at The Would Bar & Grill in Highland, New York.  Winslow and her partner, Debra Dooley, have found that their clientele is becoming more interested in meatless entrÈes, especially homey ones like this fricassee.  Its great with buttermilk biscuits.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  sweet Italian turkey sausage (abt 2 links) -- casings removed,
                        and sausage finely crumbled
     1/2           cup  chopped peeled carrot
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/3           cups  dried lentils
  1                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  2 1/2           cups  water -- or more if needed
  1              pound  Swiss chard - (abt 1 lg bunch) -- thick ribs and
                        stems cut away and discarded, leaves coars
                        chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

SautÈ sausage in large deep nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until cooked through, about 6 minutes.  Drain any excess fat from skillet.

Add carrot, onion and garlic to skillet; sautÈ until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes.  Stir in lentils, bay leaf, fennel seeds and rosemary.

Add 2 1/2 cups water and bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until lentils are almost tender, about 20 minutes.

Place Swiss chard atop lentils; cover and cook until lentils are tender and chard is wilted and tender, adding more water if mixture is dry, about 7 minutes.  Stir to blend.  Season with salt and pepper.  Discard bay leaf.

Comments:  This satisfying entrÈe goes well with a mixed green salad with cherry tomatoes and a balsamic vinaigrette.  It would also be nice alongside sea bass.

       Marinated Tempeh Stir-Fry With Broccoli And Red Bell Pepper

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  soy tempeh or 3-grain tempeh -- cut 1/2" pieces
     1/4           cup  light soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  12            ounces  broccoli -- stems peeled, and
                        cut 1/2" pieces, florets cut 1" pieces
  2        tablespoons  water
  1           teaspoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped red bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced green onion

Stir tempeh, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, ginger and crushed red pepper in medium bowl to blend.  Let marinate 1 hour at room temperature.

Steam broccoli until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Set aside.  Strain marinade from tempeh into small bowl; set tempeh aside.  Whisk 2 tablespoons water, honey and cornstarch into marinade.

Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add marinated tempeh and bell pepper and sautÈ 4 minutes.  Add broccoli and marinade mixture and sautÈ until broccoli is heated through and sauce thickens, about 3 minutes.  Transfer to bowl.  Sprinkle with green onion and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings as a side-dish.

Comments:  Because of its solid, chewy texture, tempeh (which is made from soybeans and grains) is a good meat substitute.

                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10                    garlic cloves -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  fresh breadcrumbs made from
                        crustless French bread
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped pimiento-stuffed
                        green Spanish olives
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2 1/2         pounds  turkey breast half -- skin, bones,
                        and fillet removed, butterflied
  2 1/2           cups  canned low-salt chicken broth -- more or less

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine garlic and oil in custard cup.  Cover with foil; bake garlic until very tender, about 25 minutes.  Pour oil into small bowl; reserve.  Mash garlic; set aside.  Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees.

Mix breadcrumbs, celery, olives, parsley, lemon peel and rosemary in small bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.

Place turkey breast on work surface.  Using meat mallet, pound turkey to about 1/8-inch thickness.  Spread mashed garlic over turkey, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Spread breadcrumb mixture over turkey, leaving 1/2-inch border on all sides and pressing to adhere.  Starting at 1 long side, roll up tightly, jelly-roll style.  Tie roulade in 5 places with string to secure.

Place doubled 15-inch square of cheesecloth in 13- by 9- by 2-inch pan.  Pour 1/2 cup broth over cloth.  Place roulade on cloth.  Drizzle reserved garlic oil over roulade.  Wrap tightly with cheesecloth.  Roast until cooked through and juices run clear when roulade is pierced in center, basting with 2/3 cup broth every 30 minutes, about 1 hour 15 minutes total.

Let roulade cool 15 minutes.  Remove cheesecloth and string.  Cut roulade into 1/2-inch slices; arrange on 6 plates.  Add 1 cup broth to baking pan.  Bring to simmer, scraping up browned bits.  Pour broth over roulade.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per serving:  calories, 187;  total fat, 7 g;  saturated fat, 1 g;  cholesterol, 71 mg .

Comments:  Ask the butcher to bone, skin and butterfly the turkey breast.  You will also need some cheesecloth (available in most supermarkets) for wrapping the roulade before cooking.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/4           cup  solid vegetable shortening -- frozen, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  2        tablespoons  ice water - (or more)
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  chopped pecans
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  old-fashioned oats
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  whipping cream
  3             pounds  medium peaches

For Crust:  Blend flour and salt in processor 5 seconds.  Add butter and shortening.  Using on/off turns, blend until butter is reduced to pea-size pieces.  Add 2 tablespoons ice water; blend until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic; chill at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.

For Topping: Combine all ingredients in medium bowl.  Stir until small clumps form.  Chill up to 1 day.

For Filling: Combine sugar and cream in heavy large nonstick skillet.  Bring medium saucepan of water to boil.  Drop 3 peaches into water and blanch 1 minute.  Transfer peaches to bowl of ice water.  Peel peaches and slice thinly, letting slices drop into sugar-cream mixture in skillet.  Repeat with remaining peaches.

Cook peach filling in skillet over medium-high heat until peaches are tender and sugar-cream mixture is reduced almost to glaze, stirring often, about 10 minutes.  Set aside.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Roll out dough to 14-inch round.  Transfer dough to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Trim overhang to 3/4 inch; fold under and crimp.  Pierce crust with fork; freeze 10 minutes.

Line crust with foil and beans or pie weights; bake 10 minutes.  Remove foil and beans and bake crust until pale golden, pressing with back of fork if crust bubbles, about 10 minutes longer.

Spoon peach filling into warm crust.  Sprinkle with topping.  Bake pie until filling bubbles and topping is golden brown, placing baking sheet under pie to catch any drippings, about 50 minutes.  Cool pie on rack at least 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The streusel topping adds nice crunch.

               Poblano Chilies With Black Beans And Cheese

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  poblano chilies
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3               cups  thinly-sliced onions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cans  black beans - (15 to 16 oz ea) -- rinsed, drained
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1                cup  grated reduced-fat Monterey Jack cheese -- (abt 4 oz)
                        Tomato salsa
     1/2           cup  fat-free sour cream

Preheat broiler.  Arrange chilies on baking sheet.  Broil until charred on all sides, turning occasionally, about 20 minutes.  Enclose in paper bag; let stand 10 minutes.  Peel chilies.  Cut 1 lengthwise slit in each chili; carefully remove seeds.

Meanwhile, heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.  Add onions; sautÈ until golden, about 20 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spread onions evenly in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Mash half of beans with cayenne in medium bowl.  Mix in remaining beans.  Spoon mixture into chilies.  Arrange chilies seam-side down atop onions.  Sprinkle cheese over.  Cover with foil.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Chill.)

Bake chilies 15 minutes.  Uncover; bake until cheese melts, about 5 minutes longer.  Serve each with salsa and 1 tablespoon sour cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per serving:  calories, 219;  total fat, 5g;  saturated fat, 2g;  cholesterol, 8mg.

Comments:  Brian Polcyn of the Five Lakes Grill in Milford, Michigan, has updated this Mexican favorite by oven-roasting the stuffed chilies rather than coating them with batter and frying them.  The chilies are presented on a bed of rich-tasting caramelized onions.

  1                cup  chopped onion
  5          teaspoons  minced garlic

  2               cups  zucchini in 1/2" pieces
  1                cup  red bell pepper in 1/2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2          teaspoons  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

     1/4           cup  chopped Italian parsley
  1            package  ready-to-use spinach leaves - (10 oz)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Mix onion, 3 teaspoons garlic and 1 tablespoon oil in large ovenproof pot.  Cover; cook over medium-low heat until onion is very tender, stirring often, about 15 minutes.  Stir in eggplant; cover and cook 10 minutes, stirring often.  Stir in next 6 ingredients.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover; bake until vegetables are very tender, about 30 minutes.

Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add mushrooms, rounded-side down.  Cook until bottoms are golden, about 10 minutes.  Turn mushrooms over; cook until just tender, about 6 minutes.  Sprinkle with parsley and 2 teaspoons garlic; cook until mushrooms are very tender, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat 1 teaspoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add spinach; stir until wilted, about 2 minutes.  Divide spinach among 4 plates.  Top each with 1 mushroom, rounded-side down.  Fill mushrooms with ratatouille.

Comments:  An innovative presentation from Flagstaff House Restaurant in Boulder, Colorado.  Chef Mark Monette always offers a few meatless main dishes alongside his game and fish specialties.  He serves rice with this one to catch the juices from the ratatouille.

       Potato, Spinach And Red Pepper Salad, Warm Bacon Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" pieces
  1                     red bell pepper
  1                     bacon slice -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil (preferably extra-virgin)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                cup  thinly-sliced celery
  2               cups  baby spinach leaves - (packed) -- abt 2 1/2 oz
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Steam potatoes just until tender, about 7 minutes.  Transfer potatoes to large bowl.  Char bell pepper over flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag; let stand 10 minutes.  Peel, seed and chop pepper.  Transfer to bowl with potatoes.

SautÈ bacon in small skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 3 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel and drain.

Whisk vinegar, oil and garlic in small saucepan.  Stir over low heat just until warm, about 1 minute.  Stir in bacon.

Add warm vinaigrette to potato mixture.  Mix in celery and spinach.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per serving:  calories, 164;  total fat, 8 g;  saturated fat, 1 g;  cholesterol, 1 mg.

Not to worry:  There's just enough bacon in the snappy dressing to add flavor but not much fat to this colorful salad.  Serve it alongside grilled chicken or fish for a healthful summer dinner.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SYRUP ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  water
                        === CURD ===
  4              large  eggs
  1                cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
                        === FRUIT AND TOPPING ===
  4 1/2           pint  baskets fresh raspberries
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1                     frozen pound cake - (16 oz) -- thawed
  2               cups  chilled whipping cream

For Syrup:  Combine sugar, lemon juice, and water in small saucepan.  Bring to boil over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 1 minute.  Cover and chill.

For Curd:  Whisk eggs, sugar, and lemon juice in heavy medium saucepan to blend.  Add butter and lemon peel.  Stir over medium heat until curd thickens to pudding consistency, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to small bowl.  Press plastic wrap onto surface of curd.  Chill until cold, at least 4 hours.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.)

For Fruit and Topping:  Combine 2 baskets raspberries and 1/4 cup sugar in bowl.  Mash berries coarsely with fork.  Let stand until juices form, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Cut cake crosswise into 8 pieces.  Cut each piece into 3 strips.  Line bottom of 3-quart trifle bowl with 8 cake strips, trimming to fit.  Drizzle with 3 tablespoons syrup; spread with 2/3 cup curd, then half of mashed berries.  Repeat layering.  Top with remaining cake, syrup, and curd.  Cover; chill overnight.

Beat cream and 3 tablespoons sugar in bowl until peaks form; spread over trifle.  Mound remaining berries in center.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  This summery trifle is simple to make since it calls for a purchased pound cake.  Begin preparing the trifle one day ahead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  wheat berries -- see * Note
  5 3/4           cups  water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     3/4           cup  basmati rice

* Note:  Also called hard wheat berries.  Available at most natural foods stores.

Place wheat berries in heavy medium saucepan.  Add enough cold water to saucepan to cover wheat berries by 3 inches.  Let stand overnight.  Drain.

Bring 4 cups water, wheat berries and 3/4 teaspoon salt to boil in same saucepan.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer until wheat berries are tender but still slightly firm to bite, about 1 hour.  Drain.

Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add rice and garlic; stir 1 minute.  Stir in remaining 1 3/4 cups water and 3/4 teaspoon salt; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover and cook until liquid is almost absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes.

Comments:  The University of Minnesota studied 30,000 women over nine years and found that those who ate at least three daily servings of whole grains, such as wheat berries, were 30 percent less likely to die of heart disease.  (Note that the wheat berries in this recipe need to soak in cold water overnight, so start preparing the dish one day before you plan to serve it.)

Comments:  The University of Minnesota studied 30,000 women over nine years and found that those who ate at least three daily servings of whole grains, such as wheat berries, were 30 percent less likely to die of heart disease.  (Note that the wheat berries in this recipe need to soak in cold water overnight, so start preparing the dish one day before you plan to serve it.)

  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  turmeric
  12            ounces  firm tofu -- crumbled
  1                cup  chopped red bell pepper
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced seeded jalapeÒo chili
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/2           cup  grated mozzarella cheese - (abt 2 oz)

     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  3        tablespoons  honey

     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2        tablespoons  chilled whipping cream - (or more)
  1              large  egg yolk
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2         quarts  fresh strawberries -- stem end of each
                        cut flat
     1/2           cup  strawberry jam

For Curd:  Whisk eggs, sugar, and lemon juice in heavy small saucepan to blend.  Add butter and lemon peel.  Stir over medium heat until curd thickens to pudding consistency, about 8 minutes.  Transfer to small bowl.  Press plastic wrap onto surface of curd and chill at least 2 hours.

For Crust:  Combine flour, sugar, and salt in processor; blend 5 seconds.  Add butter; using on/off turns, blend until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 2 tablespoons cream and yolk.  Blend until moist clumps form, adding more cream by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap and chill 1 hour.  (Curd and dough can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep chilled.)

Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer dough to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Trim overhang to 1/2 inch.  Fold overhang in and press firmly, forming double-thick sides.  Pierce crust all over with fork; refrigerate 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake crust until golden, pressing with back of fork if crust bubbles, about 20 minutes.  Cool crust completely on rack.

Spread curd in crust.  Stand berries in curd.  Strain jam into saucepan; warm briefly to thin.  Brush jam over berries.  Chill tart until glaze sets, at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours.  Release tart from pan

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  An elegant tart with a cookie-like crust.

  1            package  firm tofu - (12 oz) -- drained, patted dry,
                        and cut into 1"-thk slices
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
     1/2           cup  grated carrot
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
  2          teaspoons  minced peeled ginger
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/2           cup  almonds -- toasted, and
                        finely chopped
  1              large  egg white -- beaten to blend
  4          teaspoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  oriental sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  sesame seeds -- toasted
                        Salt -- to taste

  4                     tomato slices
  1                cup  alfalfa sprouts

Wrap tofu in doubled dish towel.  Place on work surface.  Weigh down with a board topped with food cans or weights for 1 hour.  Squeeze towel-wrapped tofu to extract as much liquid as possible from tofu.  Transfer tofu to medium bowl.  Using fork, mash into small pieces.

Spray medium nonstick skillet with nonstick spray; place over medium heat.  Add carrot, green onions, ginger and garlic; sautÈ until slightly softened, about 3 minutes.  Cool.

Cover and chill.)

If grilling, spray grill rack with nonstick spray, then prepare barbecue (medium heat).  If sautÈing, spray large nonstick skillet with nonstick spray and heat over medium heat.  Lightly spray patties on both sides with nonstick spray.  Place patties on grill or in skillet and cook until golden brown and heated through, about three minutes per side.

Place 1 burger on each bun bottom.  Top each with 1 tomato slice, some sprouts and bun top and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Thanks to a generous amount of basil, mint and dill, this salad is quite refreshing.  It can be taken to a picnic in a covered container that is stored in a cooler.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- chopped
  1                     red bell pepper -- coarsely chopped
  1             medium  zucchini -- chopped
  2               cups  spinach leaves - (packed) -- torn 1" pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3              large  eggs
  6              large  egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground black pepper
  1              ounce  shaved Asiago cheese
  1                cup  chopped tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil

Preheat broiler.  Heat olive oil in 10-inch-diameter nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and bell pepper; sautÈ until golden, about 8 minutes.  Add zucchini; sautÈ until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add spinach; stir until wilted, about 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper.

Whisk eggs, egg whites, salt and pepper in medium bowl to blend.  Pour egg mixture over hot vegetables in skillet; stir gently to combine.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cook without stirring until eggs are set on bottom, about 5 minutes.

Sprinkle cheese over frittata.  Broil until cheese melts, about 2 minutes.  Sprinkle with tomatoes and basil.

Comments:  At Captiva Art Cafe on Captiva Island, Florida, chef Matthew Mitchell offers imaginative pasta and egg dishes as his meatless selections.  We reduced the yolks in his frittata, but all the wonderful flavor is still there.  Mitchell accompanies the frittata with toasted focaccia.
