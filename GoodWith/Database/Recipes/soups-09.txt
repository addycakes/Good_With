  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  milk
  1                cup  half-and-half
  2                     bay leaves
  3             slices  onion
  3                     parsley sprigs
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped celery leaves
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped celery
                        Tabasco sauce -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              pound  bay scallops
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh tarragon
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried tarragon)
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh summer savory
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried savory)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Unsalted crackers or fresh toast
  4          teaspoons  finely-chopped chives

Scald the milk and the half-and-half with the bay leaves, the onion slices, parsley sprigs, and the chopped celery leaves.  Cover and let stand for about 5 minutes.  Strain out the bay leaf, parsley, celery leaves and onion, and add the finely chopped celery stalk, 2 to 3 dashes of Tabasco, and the butter. 

Bring the liquid to a boil again, lower the heat, and simmer gently for about 5 minutes.  Add the scallops and the herbs, taste for seasoning, and add a little salt and pepper if you think it needs it.  Simmer 10 to 12 minutes. 

Put crackers or pieces of toast in each of 4 soup plates, and pour the stew over, sprinkling with finely chopped chives. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

       "Twice-Boiled" Vegetable Soup With White Beans - (Ribollita)

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  dried Great Northern beans
  10       tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped red onion
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1              large  russet potato -- peeled, sliced
  2              large  carrots -- peeled, sliced
  2                     zucchini -- sliced
  1                     red onion -- sliced
  1              bunch  kale or Swiss chard
  4             ounces  savoy cabbage -- thinly sliced
  4             ounces  green beans -- chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- thinly sliced
  1              slice  pancetta or bacon - (4 oz)
  10              cups  canned low-salt chicken broth -- or more

Place Great Northern beans in large saucepan.  Add enough cold water to cover beans by 3 inches; let soak overnight.  Drain.  Return to saucepan.  Add enough fresh cold water to cover beans by 3 inches.  Simmer until beans are tender, about 1 hour.  Drain.  Puree 1 cup beans in processor.  Set aside pureed beans and whole beans. 

Remove stems and ribs from Swiss chard; slice leaves.  Heat 4 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add chopped onion and parsley; sautÈ 3 minutes.  Stir in tomato paste.  Add remaining vegetables and pancetta; sautÈ 3 minutes.  Add 10 cups chicken broth, pureed beans and whole beans.  Cover; simmer until vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours. 

Season with salt and pepper.  Cool slightly.  Chill uncovered until cold.  Cover; chill overnight.  Bring soup to simmer.  Remove pancetta.  Ladle soup into bowls.  Drizzle remaining oil over soup and serve. 

This recipe yields 10 servings. 

Comments:  In leaner times, this hearty soup provided a delicious way for Tuscans to use their leftovers: Ribollita means "reboiled," and the soup was always eaten two days in a row.  Plus, it was poured into the bowl over a slice of stale bread, which we recommend that you do, too.  Begin making it two days ahead, and don't leave out the final drizzle of olive oil.

                           African Peanut Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  oil
  2             medium  onions -- chopped big pieces
  2              large  green peppers -- chopped big pieces
  4                     garlic cloves -- pressed
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz) -- cut into quarters,
                        juice reserved
  10              cups  vegetable stock
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red chili peppers
     1/2           cup  raw brown rice
     2/3           cup  creamy peanut butter
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Crushed peanuts

In a large soup pot, heat the oil, then sautÈ the onions, green peppers, and garlic until they begin to brown.  Cut in the tomatoes and cook over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time, until they cook down.  Pour in the remaining tomato juice and the stock.  Bring to a boil, add the rice, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 45 minutes. 

When ready to serve, stir in the peanut butter until it melts and the broth is smooth.  Reheat to a simmer, then ladle into bowls and sprinkle with crushed peanuts. 

It can serve equally well as a provocative first course for 8 people...or as luncheon with salad and bread for 4. 

Comments:  This is really a pretty soup -- juicy and intense, earthy and piquant.  Many thanks to Canadian poet and novelist Jerry Newman for recommending it to me.  (Adapted from Vegetarian Times, 1995)

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1              small  onion -- chopped fine
     1/2      teaspoon  curry powder
  6               cups  chicken stock
  3                     ripe bananas - (abt 12 oz) -- peeled and chopped
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Splashes of heavy cream
                        Scallions slices

Melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat.  Stir in the onion and sweat for about 5 minutes.  Stir in the curry powder and saute for another 15 or so seconds.  Pour in the stock, bananas, lemon juice, and salt.  Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. 

Puree the soup, solids first, then pour in the cream and blend.  Taste for seasoning.  Pour into bowls, flick in the cream, in an attractive pattern, and place sliced scallions.  Serve immediately. 

Serve hot to 4 to 6 people as a rich first course. 

Comments:  I adapted this recipe from Joyce Molyneux's Carved Angel Cookery Book.  It's an easy and rather astonishing soup -- with a warm, sunshinely color and a tropically tantalizing taste.  It is described as the best recipe of an Estonian woman who had moved all over Europe during World War II.  Flecked with splashes of heavy cream and touched up with a few scallion slices, it's a pretty soup -- with a hot earthy sweetness overlaid with the tart of lemon and the spice of curry.  Absolutely outstanding as a first course to spicy barbequed chicken or pork.

I made mine in a big plastic container, covered it with a potholder, and put it on the back of the stove.  The kitchen counter is also fine.)  Stir once a day.  The fermentation and sour smell is a sign that it's getting good.  After making the soup, you can decant the clear liquid, refrigerate, and use as a flavoring in other soups. 

MAKING THE SOUP:  When you're ready to make the soup, bring a quart of water to a simmer on the stove.  Beat together the egg and milk, then slowly stir it into the simmering pot.  Turn up the heat a bit, let thicken, then slowly pour in the barscz.  Stir until it thickens to the consistency of watery oatmeal or runny pea soup.  Season well with salt and pepper.  It should smell sour. 

FINAL ASSEMBLY :  When ready to serve, place the bread bits, chopped sausage and egg into each bowl that you're serving.  Ladle the Barscz soup over all, then stir in horseradish to taste. 

Serve hot to 4 to 6 people on Easter morning...or whenever. 

Comments:  This authentic Polish recipe was brought to the United States from Krakow in the early 1900s by Agnes Kravitz, who settled in Northeastern Pennsylvania and passed the "little bit of this, little bit of that" recipe to her daughter Theodosia (Tess) Burke, who in turn passed the love of it on to her own daughter-in-law, of Italian descent, Maria Burke.  Maria sent it to me, for which I shall always be grateful. 

It's a rich and unusual soup -- thickly white from milk and dark rye flour; sour from fermenting the flour into traditional barscz kwaszony zytni (the Russian kvass), tart from freshly grated horseradish, and highly textured from chopped egg and smoked kielbasa and rye bread.  Maria says, "it's something you have to acquire a taste for, but once you do, there's no substitute for it."  As a converted addict, I agree.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Juice from two 1-lb cans sliced beets
  6               cups  beef stock
  1                     bay leaf
  1 1/2      teaspoons  red wine vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Sour cream -- served on the side
                        Lemon in thin rounds -- served on the side

Combine the beef stock, juice from the canned beets (juice only -- you can use the reserved beets for something else), bay leaf, vinegar, sugar, and pepper in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Taste and correct the seasoning. 

When ready to serve, strain out the bay leaf and pepper, then pour into fine china tea cups.  If you are serving cold, refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. 

When serving, you can either float a lemon slice on top of each serving, or serve the lemon on the side, also passing a dish whipped sour cream. 

Serve this "speedy" recipe either hot or cold as a first course to 6 people. 

Comments:  This elegant beet consomme is a snap to make and an outstanding appetite stimulant -- light but savory, and either warming or refreshing, depending if you serve it hot or chilled.  It was a favorite of that extraordinary danseur and choreographer George Balanchine, who was born in Russia as Georgi Balinchinvadze, attended the Imperial Ballet School in (at that time) Petrograd, then became principal dancer in Sergei Diaghilev's Ballet Russe in Paris.  Mr. Balanchine described Borschok as "a light, clear consomme, an essence of beet-beef extract, that should be drunk from thin china cups, not soup bowls, with sour cream and slices of lemon served on the side.  Strictly on the side."  I agree, but can't resist floating a paper-thin lemon round on top before serving.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             slices  country white bread - (ea 3" by 5"
                        by 3/4" thick)
     1/2           cup  slivered fresh basil
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  chopped red onion
  3 1/2           cups  canned vegetable broth
  1              pound  plum tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Grated Parmesan cheese -- for garnish

Cut bread into cubes.  Divide basil and garlic between 2 large soup bowls. 

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ 3 minutes.  Add broth, tomatoes and bread and bring soup to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until bread is falling apart, about 8 minutes. 

Transfer soup to processor.  Using on/off turns, blend to coarse puree.  Season soup with salt and pepper.  Ladle into bowls over basil and garlic.  Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.  Sprinkle with cheese. 

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled. 

Comments:  Our take on this soup is faithful to the classic flavors.  Assorted marinated vegetables from the local Italian deli are nice to start, and wedges of almond cake with espresso are a great finish.

                   Butternut Squash Soup With Chipotle

Recipe By     :Linda Kittler
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/2                yellow onion -- minced
  6                     roasted garlic cloves
  1             medium  butternut squash - (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  dried rosemary
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  1         tablespoon  dried thyme
     1/2    tablespoon  salt
     1/2    tablespoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2               cups  canned beef stock
     1/2           cup  Madeira - (to 3/4 cup)
     1/2           cup  cream
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chipotle and tomato puree -- see * Note

* Note:  Look for the chipotle chiles, preserved in a tomato and spice sauce, in the Mexican food section of the grocery store.  Puree them for this recipe, then refrigerate leftover puree for use in other dishes and sauces. 

Cut squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds.  Mix together rosemary, oregano, thyme, salt, pepper and oil and rub on all the surfaces except the skin.  Place the squashes cut-side down on the baking sheet and put three of the garlic cloves under each seed cavity.  Place in a 350-degree oven for about 30 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork.  When cool enough to handle, peel off the skin and tough strings and puree the squash, the herbs and garlic. 

Melt the butter in a large saucepan and cook the onion until translucent.  Add the stock and the squash-garlic mixture and bring to a simmer, stirring to blend.  Remove from the heat and add the Madeira, cream and chipotle puree.  Whisk thoroughly and taste for salt.  Serve hot with Valley of the Moon Syrah. 

This recipe yields six 8-ounce servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh or canned bing cherries -- pitted
  2               cups  cold water
  2               cups  Dry Creek Chenin Blanc
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- plus
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
  2        tablespoons  fresh orange juice
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract -- (optional)
                        Sour cream

Stem and pit cherries (should be about 4 cups of fruit).  Discard all but 1 tablespoon pits.  (If using canned cherries, disregard this process and add almond extract at end.) 

Crush the pits with a mallet and tie securely in cheesecloth.  Place bag of cherry pits, 2 cups cherries, water, and Chenin Blanc in heavy pan; heat to boiling.  Reduce to low; simmer covered until fruit is soft (about 15 minutes).  Pour through sieve into bowl, saving liquid.  PurÈe the fruit only in a food processor; return purÈe to pan. 

Combine sugar and cornstarch in a bowl; stir this mixture into cherry purÈe.  Slowly add the reserved liquid, 2 cups raw cherries, orange zest and bag of cherry pits.  Heat on medium, stirring constantly, until liquid thickens and begins to boil.  Remove from heat, stir in orange and lemon juices.  Add the almond extract at this time if you haven't used the cherry pits.  Transfer soup to bowl; refrigerate covered until very cold (at least 3 hours). 

Ladle soup into chilled bowls and garnish with sour cream.  Note: if you're using canned cherries with syrup, reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup. 

This recipe yields 5 cups (four 1 1/4 cup servings). 

Comments:  Delicious as a dessert or light first course.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Poultry                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  boneless skinless chicken breast -- sliced on diagonal
                        as thin as possible
  3             stalks  fresh lemon grass -- stripped of
                        outer leaves, cutting away the root end
                        and 2/3 of the top stalk, then sliced
                        sharply diagonally into 1/4" pieces
  4               cups  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  fresh ginger root -- cut 1/4" pieces
  4        thin strips  lime zest
  1                cup  light coconut milk
  2               cups  thinly-sliced fresh mushrooms
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved into
  1         tablespoon  water
  4        tablespoons  nam pla or other fish sauce
  4        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
                        === GARNISH ===
  12                    fresh basil leaves -- julienned
  2                     jalapeÒo peppers -- sliced thin circles

Bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan and stir in the lemon grass, ginger, and lime zest.  Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add coconut milk and bring to a boil, stirring steadily.  Reduce heat and simmer until richly flavored, about 5 minutes.  Strain the soup into another saucepan (or just strain out the flavorings). 

Stir in the chicken and mushrooms and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the dissolved cornstarch and bring to a boil to thicken slightly.  Remove from heat and stir in the nam pla, lime juice, basil, and chili peppers.  Correct the seasoning with more nam pla or lime, as you like. 

Ladle soup and serve hot to 4 people as a first course. 

Comments:  Sour, sharp, piquant, and a sensational appetite whetter.  Watch out for a sweat breaking out on the back of your head!

                  Creamy Cauliflower Soup Auf Siegfried

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  1                cup  chopped celery
  1                     carrot -- thinly sliced
  1               head  cauliflower -- cut into
                        bite-sized florets
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
  8               cups  chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  dried tarragon
                        (or 1 tbspn if you have fresh)
     1/2      teaspoon  whole peppercorns
  1                     bay leaf
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  flour
  2               cups  milk
  1                cup  light cream
  2          teaspoons  salt -- or more to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Toasted cheese croutons -- or
     1/2           cup  Goldfish Cheddar Cheese crackers

Heat the butter in a large Dutch oven, toss in onion, and saute until transparent.  Add the celery and carrot, cooking for 2 minutes.  Add the cauliflowerettes and parsley, cover, and cook over low heat for 15 minutes.  Pour in the chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Tie the tarragon, peppercorns, and bay into cheesecloth or perforated tin foil, and plunge into the soup.  Reduce heat and let simmer. 

In another saucepan, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter and stir in the flour, cooking into a roux for a minute or two.  Whisk the milk in gradually.  Bring just to a boil and cook until the mixture thickens, whisking constantly.  Stir in the cream. 

When the sauce is done, pour it with the salt into the soup, and simmer for 20 minutes. 

When the soup is ready, remove the herb packet.  Jeanne recommends pureeing the whole thing, but the colors and textures are so nice that I prefer either pureeing only half, or just mashing the vegetables in the pot to the desired consistency.  Ladle into bowls and top with croutons or crackers. 

Serve hot to 8 to 10 people as a first course. 

Comments:  This soup makes an unusual and sucessful marriage between cauliflower and tarragon -- perhaps as good an introduction as any to Jeanne, a fellow opera lover who contributed the recipe.  Based in the Chicago area, Jeanne readily confesses her opera fanaticism, recalling a "Ring" season at Lyric opera when she invited friends to celebrate with a wonderful German meal, a game of opera charades, and an invented board game called the "Ring," played with golden nuggets instead of monopoly money.  Of course she met the guests at the door in full Brunhilde regalia, sweeping up to the strains of "The Ride of the Valkyries."  Needless to say, I tested the recipe to the strains of Siegfried.  No wonder it tasted so good.  It's substantial and earthy with the sweetness of tarragon and the crunch of cheese croutons.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    quahog clams -- scrubbed
  4             slices  salt pork -- diced
  2             quarts  stock or water
  1                cup  diced carrots
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped onion
  1                cup  diced celery
  4               cups  pared and cubed potatoes
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  savory
  1         tablespoon  flour
  1         tablespoon  butter

Scrub the quahogs well with a stiff brush to remove external sand.  (Don't worry too much about sand inside; quahogs are notoriously tight clams and don't pick up a lot of grit.) 

Steam the clams in about a cup of water (or half a cup of water and half a cup of dry white wine) until they open.  Discard any that remain closed.  Drain, reserving the broth.  Remove the clams from the shells, dice the meat coarsely, and set them aside in a bowl with the broth poured over them. 

In a heavy stockpot, fry out salt pork until crisp.  Add carrots, onion, and celery and saute gently just until the onion is transparent and amber.  Add the water or stock and bring to a boil, then add potatoes, salt, and pepper.  Simmer for ten minutes, then add herbs, flour, and butter.  Bring back to a boil and stir in clams and clam broth.  Simmer for a few minutes and serve.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Steam the clams in about a cup of water (or half a cup of water and half a cup of dry white wine) until they open.  Discard any that remain closed.  Drain, reserving the broth.  Remove the clams from the shells, dice the meat coarsely, and set them aside in a bowl with the broth poured over them.

Add the water or stock and bring to a boil, then add potatoes, salt, and pepper.  Simmer for ten minutes, then add herbs, flour, and butter.  Bring back to a boil and stir in clams and clam broth.  Simmer for a few minutes and serve.

                Delicate Radish Green And Leek Soup - ...

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped leeks (both white and green parts) -- washed well
  3             medium  potatoes -- chopped
  6                     radishes -- stems and tips
                        removed -- then chopped
  3            bunches  radish greens -- thoroughly washed
  5               cups  weak vegetable stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  butter
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
                        === GARNISH ===
  4                     radishes -- minced, marinated in
                        a couple drops of balsamico vinegar

In a large saucepan, saute the leeks in the olive oil over medium heat for a few minutes.  Add a tablespoon or so of water and cook for 4 to 5 more minutes, until the onions are tender.  Stir in the potatoes and radishes and toss over medium heat for a few minutes.  Add the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.  Add the radish greens and simmer for 10 minutes. 

When ready to serve, puree the soup lightly, solids first, so that there's still a texture to it.  Return to the saucepan, stir in the butter and cheese, then ladle into bowls and top with a sprinkling of marinated minced radish. 

Serve hot to 4 people. 

Comments:  This Italian soup is hearty and thick in texture, yet light and elusive in taste.  Without the radish garnish, I don't think anyone would guess -- or believe -- that you're feeding them the green stuff that's attached to radishes.  It's a delicious and fairly bland soup that makes a great lunch with a sandwich...and a nice first course to a rustic meal.

  4                     coriander seeds
  4                     white peppercorns
  2                     bay leaves
  2               cups  dry white wine
  3             quarts  water
                        === CIOPPINO ===
  6                     red bell peppers -- cut in half
  6                     yellow bell peppers -- cut in half
  4                     jalapeÒo peppers -- halved, seeded
  20                    vine-ripened tomatoes -- cored, halved
  1               head  garlic cloves -- crushed
                        (OK for the skins to stay on)
  1                cup  pure olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SHELLFISH ===
  12                    clams
  12                    black mussels
  6                     prawns - (16/20 size)
  18                    rock shrimp
  12                    day boat scallops or 24 bay scallops
  1                     cooked Dungeness crab -- meat only
  1              bunch  basil

Make the stock:  Heat the oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add the shrimp shells and sear them until they turn red.  Add the brandy and stir until it just evaporates.  Add the tomato paste.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the fennel, celery, carrots, onion, leek, parsley, thyme, coriander, peppercorns and bay leaves.  Cook, stirring, until the vegetables begin to soften and turn glassy.  Add the white wine, turn the heat to high, and cook until the wine nearly evaporates.  Add the water, bring to a boil, and cook over medium-low heat until the stock reduces by one-third to one-half.  Strain the mixture through a chinois or other fine strainer; discard the solids and return the stock to the pot. 

Make the cioppino:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Toss the peppers, tomatoes and garlic with the olive oil.  Spread the vegetables on a large rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan.  Season with salt and pepper.  Roast for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring once, or until the vegetables are just tender.  Add the vegetables to the shellfish stock.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.  Puree the stock in batches in a food processor or blender.  If making ahead, cool, cover and refrigerate. 

To finish the cioppino:  Return the stock to the pot and place over medium heat.  When the stock simmers, add the clams, mussels and prawns, and cook until the clams and mussels open.  Remove the shellfish and reserve.  Add the rock shrimp and scallops to the stock.  Cook for 4 minutes.  Return all of the shellfish and the picked crabmeat to the stock.  Add the basil.  Heat through. 

To serve:  Remove the basil.  Arrange equal portions of the shellfish in wide soup bowls.  Mound crabmeat in the center of each.  Ladle the hot stock over the shellfish. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  The stock may be made one day ahead and refrigerated until ready to use.  At Pisces, Victor Scargle adds the crushed shells from three lobsters to the stock, which enhances its complexity.  He serves the cioppino with crostini spread with roasted garlic butter.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2              large  leeks (white and pale green parts) -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  chopped peeled carrot
  4 1/2           cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
                        or vegetable broth
  2               cups  shelled fresh fava beans -- (2 lbs unshelled)
                        (or 10 oz frozen baby lima beans, thawed)
  5             ounces  green beans -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  8             ounces  asparagus -- tough ends trimmed,
                        diagonally cut into 1" pieces
     2/3           cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- (optional)

Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add leeks and carrot; sautÈ until vegetables are tender but not brown, about 8 minutes.  Add broth and bring to boil.  Add favas and green beans and simmer until almost tender, about 8 minutes.  Add asparagus and 1/3 cup basil and simmer until all vegetables are very tender, about 7 minutes longer.  Season soup with salt and pepper. 

Stir in remaining 1/3 cup basil.  Ladle soup into bowls.  Serve, passing Parmesan separately, if desired. 

This recipe yields 6 first-course servings. 

Comments:  You can use frozen baby lima beans (with the same delicious result) instead of the fresh favas, which are harder to find.

  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  dry white wine

Comments:  This seafood soup, called cacciucco (meaning "mixture"), is a specialty of Livorno, a fishing port that is Tuscany's second-largest city.  It has been made for hundreds of years, and variations of it appear all along the Tuscan coast.  Traditionally, at least five types of fish and shellfish are included (one for each "c" in the name).  If you like, do as the Italians do, and place a slice of toasted bread in each bowl before ladling the soup over.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Clean squid.  Leave tentacles whole and slice bodies into 1/2-inch thick rings.  Add all seafood to soup base.  Cook just until opaque in center, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt.  Ladle soup into 4 bowls.  Sprinkle with additional parsley and sea salt.  Drizzle soup with olive oil.

</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  This seafood soup, called cacciucco (meaning &quot;mixture&quot;), is a specialty of Livorno, a fishing port that is Tuscany&apos;s second-largest city.  It has been made for hundreds of years, and variations of it appear all along the Tuscan coast.  Traditionally, at least five types of fish and shellfish are included (one for each &quot;c&quot; in the name).  If you like, do as the Italians do, and place a slice of toasted bread in each bowl before ladling the soup over.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  seedless white grapes -- stemmed
  3                     cucumbers -- seeded and chopped
  1                     shallot -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2               cups  yoghurt -- (low fat is fine)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Hot pepper sauce - (abt 8 drops) -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        White seedless grapes -- halved
                        Sliced almonds -- toasted

Puree the grapes in a blender, then strain out the skins and return the juice to the blender. 

Add the cucumber, shallot, and garlic, and puree.  Blend in the yoghurt.  Season with salt, pepper, and hot pepper sauce.  Refrigerate until cold.  Serve when ready. 

Serve to 4 to 6 people as a first course. 

Comments:  Cool, bracing, and many layered -- with the sweet fruitiness of the grapes balanced by the savory vegetables and cooled by the yoghurt.  Then there's that little earthy bit of toasted almond garnish that just sets the whole thing off.  A really nice, palate-cleansing cold soup.

                   Ham Hock And 'Peppercorn' Pasta Soup

Recipe By     :Lesli Neilson
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ham                             Pasta
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  smoked ham hocks
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     yellow onions -- diced medium
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  7                     celery ribs -- cut in 1/2" slices
  4                     carrots -- cut in 1/2" slices
  1                cup  dry white wine
  3             quarts  vegetable or chicken stock
  3 1/2    tablespoons  tomato paste
  2                     bay leaves
  3                     thyme sprigs
  12                    peppercorns -- crushed
  4                     parsley stems -- finely chopped
  3             quarts  water
  2 1/4           cups  acini di pepe pasta
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Remove excess fat from the ham hocks.  Heat the oil in a large pot.  Add the onions and garlic and cook until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.  Add the celery and cook for an additional 3 minutes.  Add the carrots and cook 3 minutes.  Add the ham hocks and stir, allowing all the ingredients to blend.  Add the wine, stirring to deglaze the pan, and cook for about 5 minutes.  Cover it all with the stock, add the tomato paste, bay leaves, thyme, peppercorns and parsley.  Simmer for 45 minutes, or until the ham is tender enough to fall off the bone. 

Remove the ham hocks and, when cool enough to handle, separate the meat from the bones.  Discard bones, and return the meat to the soup pot.  Discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs.  Add the water and bring to a boil.  Add the pasta and cook for 13 to 15 minutes, until al dente.  Season with salt and pepper.  (You probably won't need much salt.)  Serve with a loaf of warm French bread. 

This recipe yields 12 servings.. 

Comments:  It freezes very well; simply let it cool completely, then transfer to an air-tight freezer container to avoid freezer burn.

                  Hearty Saffron-Rich Tomato-Fennel Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  saffron -- crumbled
  1         tablespoon  boiling water
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     yellow onions -- chopped evenly
                        into a medium dice
  2                     fennel bulbs -- chopped evenly
                        into a medium dice (reserving the stalk
                        feathers for the garnish)
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  white wine
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves -- finely shredded
  2             quarts  canned tomatoes -- chopped well,
                        with their juice
  2               cups  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Shredded basil
                        Shredded fennel feathers

Crumble and macerate the saffron in the boiling water until it completely gives up its flavor. 

In a large pot, heat the 4 tablespoons of oil then saute the chopped onions, fennel, and garlic over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes.  Pour in the wine and macerated saffron, then stir in the basil.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for a minute or two.  Add the chopped tomatoes, their juice, and the water.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, partially covered. 

When ready to serve, salt and pepper to taste, then stir in 1/4 to 1/2 cup  basil and fennel feathers.  Ladle into bowls and have at it. 

Serve hot to 6 as a first course or as a luncheon soup. 

Comments:  I really like this soup.  It's chunky and full of interesting textures -- very pure -- and with a knockout combination of flavors.  The pureness of the tomatoes really serves up the unusual combination of licorice (the fennel and basil) and saffron.  Don't skimp on the latter -- it's sensational.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  ground veal
     1/2         pound  ground sirloin beef
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
     1/2           cup  finely-grated Romano cheese
  1              pinch  nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  excellent chicken stock
  2               cups  escarole -- washed, and
                        torn into little pieces
                        === GARNISH ===
     1/4           cup  grated Romano cheese

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 

Mix the veal, sirloin, egg, bread crumbs, parsley, 1/2 cup grated cheese, salt, and pepper until uniform, but don't overwork.  Form into small meatballs (like really big marbles) -- about 50 of them -- arrange on a baking sheet, and cook at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.  They should still be tender, not too brown.  Drain off the fat and let them drain on paper towels. 

When ready to serve, bring the stock to a boil in a large pot.  Add the torn escarole, cover, and boil for 5 minutes.  Add the meatballs, reduce heat, and bring to a simmer.  Let simmer for a few minutes, then stir in the remaining 1/4 cup grated cheese.  Serve immediately -- sprinkling with more cheese, if you like. 

Serve hot to 6 people.  (For nonbridal occasions, it can be a proper meal for 4.) 

Comments:  One of the most requested soups on my site -- this one is from Abruzzo and features the meatballs traditional to that part of Italy.  It's a pretty soup, and very substantial with all those meatballs.  The torn escarole floats on the broth, enriched by the meat and molten cheese.  Flavorful yet subtle.  Something to throw a bouquet about.

               L'AÔgo Boulido - {ProvenÁal "Boiled Water"}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  water
                        Salt -- to taste
  12                    garlic cloves - (to 15) -- peeled
  1                     bay leaves - (to 2)
  1              sprig  fresh sage - (to 2)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Day-old French bread in thin slices
                        Grated GruyËre cheese

In a large saucepan, salt the water, add the garlic cloves, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium.  After 10 minutes, add the bay leaves, sage, and a dash of the oil.  Cook 2 more minutes, then remove from heat, cover, and steep for 10 minutes. 

When ready to serve, heat a soup tureen in the oven for a few minutes, then layer the bottom with the bread slices and sprinkle with the cheese, then the rest of the oil.  Ladle the strained broth over all and serve. 

Serve hot to 4 people in need. 

Comments:  Reputedly an elixir for convalescents and birthing mothers -- and a godsend for those with hangovers -- this delicate soup is almost unexplainably comforting.  It's very soft, and the fragrance of the herbed broth and fruity olive oil helps the tender bread sop and cheese slip right down to comfort a tight stomach.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a large saucepan, salt the water, add the garlic cloves, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium.  After 10 minutes, add the bay leaves, sage, and a dash of the oil.  Cook 2 more minutes, then remove from heat, cover, and steep for 10 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;When ready to serve, heat a soup tureen in the oven for a few minutes, then layer the bottom with the bread slices and sprinkle with the cheese, then the rest of the oil.  Ladle the strained broth over all and serve.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Reputedly an elixir for convalescents and birthing mothers -- and a godsend for those with hangovers -- this delicate soup is almost unexplainably comforting.  It&apos;s very soft, and the fragrance of the herbed broth and fruity olive oil helps the tender bread sop and cheese slip right down to comfort a tight stomach.

               Le MourtaÔrol - {PÈrigourdine Saffron Soup}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     loaf stale French bread -- cut thin slices
  1                cup  cooked chicken in small pieces
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        sliced into thin rounds
  8               cups  rich chicken stock
     1/4      teaspoon  saffron -- ground or crushed
                        to a powder

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 

Make one layer of bread slices in the bottom of a deep casserole, sprinkle with chicken meat and carrots, then continue to layer up until all the ingredients are used, ending with bread on top.  Don't layer to the top of the pot or you'll splash in the oven. 

Heat the chicken stock in a saucepan.  In a small cup, mix the crushed saffron with several tablespoons of hot broth and allow about 5 minutes to completely release the saffron color and flavor.  It will be a dark orange liquid.  Mix in with the rest of the stock, then ladle over the casserole.  When the top layer of bread slices begin to float, gently add about another cup worth.  Put, uncovered, in the oven and reduce heat to 350 degrees.  Back about an hour -- most of the liquid will be absorbed and a gratin will form on the top. 

To serve, spoon into flat soup plates. 

Serve hot to 6. 

Comments:  In PÈrigord, France, this bread soup is traditionally served after funerals.  Heavy with saffron, thick, and hearty, it certainly goes back to medieval times.  Too bad it's so closely associated with death -- it's a wonderful -- and beautiful -- soup...maybe worth resurrecting, say, for occasions when you need a ceremonial dish to officially put something behind you.

                       Legal Sea Foods Clam Chowder

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chowder                         Clams/Mussels
                Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             quarts  littleneck clams (abt 1 2/3 cups cooked) -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
  1                cup  water
  2             ounces  salt pork -- finely chopped
  2               cups  chopped onions
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1 1/2         pounds  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        diced into 1/2" cubes
  4 1/2           cups  clam broth
  3               cups  fish Stock
  2               cups  light cream
                        Oyster crackers -- (optional)

Clean the clams and place them in a large pot along with the  garlic and water.  Steam the clams just until opened, about 6 to 10 minutes, depending upon their size.  Drain and shell the clams, reserving the broth.  Mince the clam flesh, and set  aside.  Filter the clam broth either through coffee filters or cheesecloth and set aside. 

In a large, heavy pot slowly render the salt pork.  Remove the cracklings and set them aside.  Slowly cook the onions in the fat for about 6 minutes, stirring frequently, or until cooked through but not browned.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the reserved clam broth and fish stock, and whisk to remove any flour lumps.  Bring the liquid to a boil, add the potatoes, lower the heat, and simmer until the potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes. 

Stir in the reserved clams, salt-pork cracklings, and light cream.  Heat the chowder until it is the temperature you prefer.  Serve in large soup bowls with oyster crackers on the side. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  Recipe from "The Legal Sea Foods Cookbook Simply Perfect Recipes From Boston's Favorite Seafood Restaurant" By George Berkowitz and Jane Doerfer, $15.95. 

I think our clam chowder is the best in the business -- and the  public certainly agrees.  We sell about seven hundred gallons of clam chowder each week at our restaurants and take-out counters.  The reason for its popularity is simple.  We use only the best ingredients and plenty of them.  Don't try and economize by cutting back on the amount of clams or cream because the chowder will never taste as flavorful as ours.

Categories    : Chowder                         Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dried lentils
  1              pound  cod fillet -- cut 1" squares
                        Lots of diced vegetables - (carrots,
                        potatoes, celery, green beans, tomatoes)
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  2        tablespoons  sunflower or green olive oil
  1         tablespoon  dried parsley
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  thyme
     1/8      teaspoon  tarragon

Place the lentils and 5 cups of cold water into a slow cooker (about 4 quart or 4 litre size) or crock pot.  Cook on low overnight. 

At breakfast, add the spices, oil, and enough vegetables to fill the pot to no closer than 3 inches below the top.  Then add enough cold water to cover everything, plus 1/2 inch.  Cook on low for 5 hours. 

Add the fish (the fish should be completely immersed in the liquid), and then cook on low for  another 4 to 5 hours. 

A few minutes before serving, remove the bay leaf and mix in the orange juice.  Serve with salad and whole grain bread. 

Variations:  Substitute haddock, pollock, hake, cusk, clams, or lean back bacon (diced) for some or all of the cod.  Back bacon should be put in the slow cooker in step #2, at the same time as the vegetables. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                         Pear And Cambozola Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  clarified butter
  3                     onions -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  8                     ripe pears -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced
  1                cup  white wine
  8               cups  chicken stock
  8             ounces  Cambozola (German cheese, soft-ripened
                        triple cream) -- rind trimmed away
  4               cups  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-ground white pepper
                        === GARNISH ===
                        A few chive pieces -- crossed, and
                        if it's springtime,
  1                     fresh violet per bowl

In a large soup pot, melt the butter.  Stir in onion, garlic, and pears and allow to sweat over medium-high heat until fragrant.  Deglaze the pan with the wine, then stir in the chicken stock.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for an hour.  Chop the cheese and stir in until it is completely melted into the broth.  Puree, solids first.  Whisk in the cream.  Season with salt and pepper.  Then chill in the refrigerator until cold. 

When ready to serve, stir well, then ladle into bowls.  Top each with a violet and a few cut pieces of chives. 

Serve cold as a delicate first course to 8 people. 

Comments:  Cool and complex, savory and sweet, light and rich -- the kind of soup to be eaten slowly with closed eyes and elegant music in the background.  Unfortunately, one spoonful and the impulse is to pick up the bowl and drink it down.  Besides the manners issue, not a good idea...if you're watching your weight, your cholesterol, or your wallet, that is.  Recommended to me by Canadian poet and novelist Jerry Newman (adapted from John Bishop's Cook Book), who says he's "crazy nutso" about it, could eat a bowl every day, and likes using different cheeses, including Parmesan.  I agree on all 3 counts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Onions -- sliced thin
  1         tablespoon  olive oil - (to 2 tbspns)
                        Cooked beans
                        Lentils or barley -- soaked and rinsed
                        Beef, vegetable, or chicken stock
                        Cauliflower -- chopped to
                        bite-sized pieces
                        Cabbage -- shredded
                        Canned tomatoes -- crushed or cut up
                        Corn, fresh or frozen
                        Carrots -- chopped
                        Green peppers -- diced
                        Potatoes -- cut in chunks
                        Garlic -- crushed
                        Freshly-grated or powdered ginger
                        Chili peppers -- chopped
                        Hot pepper sauce -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large stock pot, heat the oil and sautÈ the onions until tender.  Add the beans, lentils, and/or barley with stock to cover, bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer 20 minutes.  Toss in the rest of the ingredients, bring to a boil with more stock, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until the vegetables are cooked but not too soft -- about 30 minutes or so. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Not unlike the cabbage soup diet, but heartier and even cooked in a little oil.  It's a great soup and one that you should eat to excess to lose the maximum amount of weight, according to Raquel.  Plus you're not on a strict regimen and can take breaks from it as your life demands.  You also have a lot of discretion in its making -- you decide what and how much.  Make a big pot and demolish it...make another pot....

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  water
  1              pound  string beans -- stringed
  2                     celery stalks - (to 3) -- stringed, chopped
  1              bunch  parsley -- stems removed,
                        and finely chopped
  3                     zucchini - (to 4) -- chopped

In a large saucepan, bring the water to a boil.  Toss in the string beans, celery, and parley, and boil on medium heat for 5 minutes.  Add zucchini and continue boiling for 3 to 4 minutes.  Puree, solids first and add the cooking water to your desired consistency -- should be like pea soup.  If you haven't gotten rid of all the celery and bean strings, you can press through a sieve. 

Makes about 6 cups of soup. 

Comments:  More of a pain to make than her devil-may-care cabbage soup, but a nice break and very pure.  Good hot or cold.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  red onions -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3               cans  beef broth - (14 1/2 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Comments:  Onion soup is known internationally as a French classic, but the Tuscans claim that they were actually the first to use the tear-provoking vegetable in soup.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16             large  qauhogs - (2 cups chopped meat)
  2               cups  dry white wine
  2               cups  bottled clam broth or fish stock -- (to 3 cups)
     1/4         pound  salt pork
  1              large  onion
  2                     celery stalks
  2                     garlic cloves
  1              bunch  Italian flat-leaf parsley
  2                     bay leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  4                     ripe tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  tomato puree
  2              large  potatoes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste

Scrub the qauhogs and place them in a large, covered pot with the wine.  Steam them for 10 to 15 minutes or until the shells just open.  Shuck the quahogs and grind, using a meat grinder or food processor.  Strain the cooking liquid through damp cheesecloth -- you should have 6 cups.  If necessary, add clam broth or fish stock to make up the difference. 

Finely dice the salt pork.  Fry the salt pork slowly in a large pot over low heat to render the fat.  Transfer the cracklings with a slotted spoon to a paper towel to drain. 

Meanwhile, finely chop the onion and celery.  Mince the garlic.  Tie half of the parsley and the other herbs into a bouquet garni.  Finely chop the remaining parsley.  Peel, seed and coarsely chop the tomatoes.  Peel and dice the potatoes into a bowl of cold water to prevent them from browning. 

Saute the onions, celery, garlic and bouquet garni in the rendered fat over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until soft but not browned.  Add the tomatoes and tomato paste, increase the heat to high, and cook for 1 minute.  Add the 6 cups of clam liquid and bring to a boil.  Add the potatoes, reduce the heat, and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, or until tender. 

Just before serving, stir in the quahog meat and salt and pepper to taste.  Garnish the chowder with the chopped parsley and the salt pork cracklings and serve at once. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  Here is how Boston chef William Poirer makes red chowder, and it is good enough to convert the most diehard white chowder fanatic.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     unpeeled garlic heads - (1/2 lb total)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter or margarine
  4                     leeks, white part only -- chopped
  1                     onion -- diced
  6        tablespoons  flour
  4               cups  chicken broth -- heated
     1/3           cup  dry sherry
  1                cup  whipping cream
                        lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut off top of each garlic head (about 1/4 inch).  Place garlic heads in small, shallow baking dish.  Drizzle olive oil over garlic -- bake until golden, about 1 hour. 

While garlic is baking, chop leeks and dice onions; set aside.  Heat the chicken broth. 

Cool garlic slightly.  Press individual garlic cloves between thumb and finger to release garlic (garlic should pop out easily).  Melt butter in heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Add garlic, leeks and onion -- saute until onion is translucent, about 8 minutes.  Reduce heat to low.  Add flour and cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Using a wire whisk, stir chicken broth into the flour mixture.  Add sherry.  Simmer 20 minutes.  Cool slightly. 

Puree soup in batches in blender or food processor.  Return soup to saucepan.  Add cream and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.  Add lemon juice to taste.  Season with salt and white pepper.  Garnish with chives.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This recipe may be prepared 1 day ahead by following directions through the pureeing process.  Cool slightly -- cover and refrigerate.  The next day follow directions beginning with the addition of the whipping cream.

     1/2      teaspoon  fresh thyme -- for garnish

Heat oil in a flat-bottom wok or large and deep saute pan.  Saute cabbage until sweetened, about 4 minutes.  Add onion and saute for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add carrot, potatoes, cilantro, and canned chili peppers. 

Combine pinches of the dried herbs and seeds with a smaller pinch of fresh rosemary leaves.  Grind (or otherwise crush) the seasonings, then add to the soup.  Season with pepper and salt and stir well. 

Pour in the milk.  Add chicken broth to level of potatoes, add 1/4 cup more if needed to raise the liquid level.  Bring to a boil.  Cover and reduce heat to simmer; cook the potatoes for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. 

Puree half of the soup.  Add 5 to 6 ounces of fresh or thawed corn kernels.  Top with snipped thyme.  Cover.  Simmer another 10 to 12 minutes. 

Serve in chowder bowls with sauces, like Maggi or Tabasco sauce. 

This recipe yields 5 cups for 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cans  chopped clams - (6 1/2 oz ea)
  4            bottles  clam juice - (8 oz ea)
     1/4      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     3/4           cup  butter or margarine
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2         pound  bacon -- chopped
     3/4           cup  chopped celery
     3/4           cup  chopped onions
  3               cups  chopped peeled potato
  4               cups  scalded milk or half-and-half
                        Butter
                        Chopped fresh parsley

Drain clams and reserve juice.  Combine reserved juice and clam juice in a large soup pot.  Stir in basil and thyme.  Bring to a boil. 

In the meantime, melt 3/4 cup butter or margarine over medium heat in a small saucepan.  Stir in flour to make a roux.  Continue to cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. 

In separate skillet, cook bacon until limp and slightly brown on the edges.  Drain off excess fat.  Add celery and onion.  Continue to cook for 5 minutes or until tender-crisp. 

Cook potatoes in lightly salted water just until tender, and then drain. 

Stir roux into boiling clam juice, using a wire whisk to blend thoroughly.  Stir in clams, bacon mixture and potatoes.  Bring mixture back to a boil, then reduce heat.  Stir in scalded milk or half-and-half.  Do not let soup boil. 

Top each serving with butter and chopped fresh parsley. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                 Slap-In-The-Face Avocado-Tomatillo Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     poblano chiles -- skinned, seeded,
                        and diced
  3                     fully ripe avocados, preferably Hass -- cut in chunks
                        (reserving 1/2 of one avocado for garnish)
  1              pound  tomatillos -- husked, rinsed,
                        cored, and quartered
  4               cups  cold water
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Reserved 1/2 avocado -- in a fine dice

The easiest way to skin the chiles is to broil them close to the heating element, turning with tongs, until they're charred all over -- then sticking them in a plastic bag for a couple minutes.  When they're skinned, cut off the tops and scrape away all the seeds.  Then chop finely. 

Puree the chiles, avocados, and tomatillos in a blender, adding the water as needed to make into a smooth paste.  Then add the remaining water, lime juice, salt, and pepper.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. 

When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and sprinkle with the reserved avocado chunks. 

Serve cold to 6 people as a first course. 

Comments:  Nothing subtle about this one, but what an appetite stimulant!  Sharp, clean, smooth -- it's a real slap in the face of your dinner guests to prepare their palates for the coming meal.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  tomato puree or crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
  1                can  stewed tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                can  chicken broth - (13 3/4 oz)
  1                     carrot
  1                     celery stalk
     1/2      Teaspoon  salt
  2        Tablespoons  butter -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Scrub carrot and cut lengthwise.  Chop the celery fine.  In a large pot, bring all the ingredients except the butter to a boil.  Simmer, covered, for about 15 minutes. 

Just before serving, lift out the carrot and discard it (it helps balance out the acidity of the tomatoes).  Stir in the butter until it melts completely.  Puree the mixture in a blender or pulse in a food processor, then adjust seasoning if desired. 

Pour the soup into individual serving bowls, then let your kids put the smiley faces on top. 

TIPS:  We used sour cream, squeezed through a tiny hole cut in a plastic sandwich bag.  But your kids can experiment with anything that will stay afloat -- plain yogurt, oyster crackers, croutons, green pepper slices, grated cheese, or toast cut into eyes, nose and mouth shapes. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     yellow onions -- chopped
  9             ounces  young tender sorrel leaves -- stems removed
  1 1/4         pounds  red new potatoes -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  2               cups  chicken or vegetable stock
  4               cups  water
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a soup pot over medium heat, melt butter.  Add onions and saute, stirring, until soft, about 10 minutes.  Add sorrel and cook, stirring, until wilted, about 2 minutes.

Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. 

Using a blender and working in batches, puree soup.  Strain puree through a fine sieve into a saucepan.  Stir in cream, mixing well.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 

To serve, place the soup over medium heat and reheat to serving temperature.  Ladle soup into warmed bowls and serve immediately with croutons (optional).

Categories    : Chowder                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  minced or ground bacon or salt pork
     1/2         pound  butter
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1              large  carrot -- chopped
  3                     celery stalks -- chopped
     3/4           cup  flour
  2             quarts  chicken broth
  2              large  potatoes -- diced
  2               cans  corn - (16 oz ea) -- not creamed corn
     3/4         pound  ham -- diced
     1/2         quart  half-and-half
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Hot sauce -- to taste

In a large, heavy soup kettle, cook salt pork until all the fat has been rendered and pork bits are light brown and crispy.  Add butter, onion, celery, and carrot; cook over medium heat 10 minutes.  Stir in flour; cook 10 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent flour from browning. 

Meanwhile, in large pot, combine stock, potatoes, corn, corn liquid, and ham.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. 

Slowly add potato-corn mixture to butter-flour roux, stirring constantly until well blended and roux is completely incorporated.  Cook over low heat 15 minutes, stirring frequently. 

The chowder will be very thick.  Add some of the half-and-half to desired consistency.  Add salt, pepper and Tabasco sauce.  Heat thoroughly but do not boil.  Thin with additional half-and-half if desired. 

This recipe yields about 1 gallon.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     3/4           cup  coarsely-chopped carrots
  1                     celery rib -- coarsely chopped
  1                     leek (white and light-green parts) -- cleaned, chopped
     1/3           cup  coarsely-chopped parsley
  1              large  garlic clove -- chopped
     3/4      teaspoon  dried oregano
  4               cups  fish stock or best-quality
                        bottled clam juice
  1                cup  white wine
     1/4      teaspoon  powdered saffron
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground fennel
     3/4      teaspoon  sugar
  8                     Chilean sea bass fillets - (abt 6 oz ea)
                        Asian sesame oil
                        Seasoning salt, such as Lawry's
  8          teaspoons  kabayaki sauce - (available at
                        Japanese markets)
  1 1/2         pounds  sea scallops
  1 1/2         pounds  peeled shrimp -- butterflied

Make broth:  Heat the olive oil in a large pot over moderate heat.  Add the carrots, celery, leek, parsley, garlic and oregano and saute until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.  Add the fish stock, wine, saffron, fennel and sugar.  Bring to a simmer, adjust heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook about 10 minutes to boil off the alcohol. 

Preheat broiler.  Coat the sea bass lightly with sesame oil, then season with seasoning salt.  Put the fish on a rack in a baking dish and broil until almost done.  Brush each fillet with 1 teaspoon kabayaki sauce and return to the broiler until the fish just flakes. 

While the fish cooks, add the scallops to the simmering broth.  Cover and simmer until they are about half-done, about 1 minute, then add the shrimp.  Cover and simmer briefly, just until the shrimp and scallops are done.  Taste the broth and adjust seasoning. 

Spoon some of the broth, shrimp and scallops into warmed serving bowls.  Using a spatula, transfer a sea bass fillet to each bowl. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  cod or haddock fillets
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
  24                    hard-shelled clams - (to 36)
  4               cups  fish stock -- boiling
     1/4         pound  salt pork -- diced
  2              large  onions -- chopped
  3                     potatoes -- diced
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/8      teaspoon  mace
     1/8      teaspoon  cloves
  1               dash  Tabasco sauce
  1               dash  Worcestershire sauce
  2                     fresh tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
     1/4         pound  butter
                        Common crackers or oyster crackers

Cut the fish into 1 1/2-inch pieces, sprinkle with the peppers and thyme (salt will come from the clams and salt pork), and put aside. 

Scrub the clams well under cold water to rid them of sand and put them in a pot with a little water on the bottom.  Cover pan tightly and steam the clams until the shells open, about 15 minutes.  Remove the clams from their shells, saving the broth for the stock.  Slip the black skin from the foot.  If the clams are large, chop the meat of the foot, and leave the soft part in one piece.  If clams are small, use whole.  Strain clam broth through cheesecloth into the stock.  Add water, if needed, to make 6 cups. 

Fry salt pork until crisp in a ceramic-lined or non-metallic kettle and add onions to soften gently without browning.  Add potatoes and then cover with the fish stock.  Simmer about 5 minutes.  Add milk and cream, the seasonings, and the chopped tomatoes.  (If you have chopped the clam meat, add it now.)  Simmer another 5 minutes and taste for seasonings.  Remove pan from heat.  Add fish and clams (whole or the soft bellies) and refrigerate overnight. 

Reheat in a 200 to 225 degree oven just below the simmering point.  Put a tablespoon of butter in each soup bowl, add soup, and crumble crackers on top or serve them separately. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Scrub the clams well under cold water to rid them of sand and put them in a pot with a little water on the bottom.  Cover pan tightly and steam the clams until the shells open, about 15 minutes.  Remove the clams from their shells, saving the broth for the stock.  Slip the black skin from the foot.  If the clams are large, chop the meat of the foot, and leave the soft part in one piece.  If clams are small, use whole.  Strain clam broth through cheesecloth into the stock.  Add water, if needed, to make 6 cups.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Fry salt pork until crisp in a ceramic-lined or non-metallic kettle and add onions to soften gently without browning.  Add potatoes and then cover with the fish stock.  Simmer about 5 minutes.  Add milk and cream, the seasonings, and the chopped tomatoes.  (If you have chopped the clam meat, add it now.)  Simmer another 5 minutes and taste for seasonings.  Remove pan from heat.  Add fish and clams (whole or the soft bellies) and refrigerate overnight. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Reheat in a 200 to 225 degree oven just below the simmering point.  Put a tablespoon of butter in each soup bowl, add soup, and crumble crackers on top or serve them separately.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1             medium  onion -- minced
  3               cups  turnip in 1/4" cubes
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped mushrooms
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  dried mint
     1/4      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/4      teaspoon  fennel seeds
  4               cups  turkey stock -- divided
     3/4           cup  canned tomatoes -- whole
  1            package  frozen baby lima beans - (10 oz) -- thawed
                        Chopped cilantro or parsley -- for garnish

Heat the oil in a large, heavy saucepan over low heat.  Add the minced garlic and onion.  Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden.

Comments:  If your taste buds prefer, you may use canned navy or kidney beans in place of the limas; rinse them well and add them during the last 5 minutes of cooking.

  3                     leeks
  4                     green onions
     1/2         pound  mushrooms
  1              pound  thin asparagus
     1/4         pound  sugar snap peas or 3/4 lb fresh peas
  2        tablespoons  butter
  6               cups  vegetable or chicken broth
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2         pound  prepared puff pastry -- defrosted
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  water

Clean leeks thoroughly; slice crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick pieces.  Trim green onions; slice diagonally into 1-inch pieces.  Wash mushrooms, trim stems; slice into strips about 1/4 inch wide.  Wash asparagus, snap off dry, tough ends, and slice on diagonal into 1-inch pieces.  Remove stems from snap peas. 

Heat butter in a 3-quart saucepan.  Add leeks and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until tender (about 8 minutes).  Add mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes.  Stir in onions and cook 1 minute.  Add broth, salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes. 

Add asparagus and peas.  Turn off heat.  Pour into a 2-quart, ovenproof, deep souffle or serving dish.  Cool slightly, then refrigerate until well-chilled. 

Cut puff pastry into a circle 2 inches larger than dish.  Place pastry over top of dish and press onto sides, pressing edges of puff pastry to adhere pastry to dish.  Refrigerate until 45 minutes before serving time. 

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Mix egg and water in small bowl and brush on puff pastry.  Bake until puff pastry is golden brown and crisp (about 40 minutes).  Serve at once; cut puff pastry open at the table.  Ladle soup into individual bowls; top each serving with a piece of pastry. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  If you break open the puff pastry at the table, everyone can enjoy the burst of aroma created by this presentation.  To prepare the soup without the pastry lid, cook the asparagus and peas for 3 minutes, omitting the chilling step; then ladle the soup into bowls and serve at once.

                            Spring Onion Soup

Recipe By     :Chef Michael Betts of Chicago's Wild Onion restaurant
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- 3/4 stick
  4              large  Texas Sweet or Vidalia onions -- halved, and
                        thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4           cup  dry sherry
  6               cups  low-sodium beef broth
  4                     beef bouillon cubes
  8                     toasted French bread slices -- cut 1" thick
  8             slices  mozzarella
  8             slices  Swiss cheese

Melt butter in large saucepan or Dutch oven.  Add onions; cook over medium heat, stirring often, until caramelized, about 40 minutes.  Add Worcestershire, pepper, garlic, thyme and bay leaves; cook three minutes.  Stir in sherry; cook one minute.  Add broth and bouillon cubes.  Heat to boil; simmer 10 minutes. 

Heat broiler.  Pour soup into oven-proof bowls or crocks.  Top each with one slice bread, mozzarella and Swiss cheese.  Broil until cheese is bubbly, about three minutes. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  If you don't have individual crocks for the soup, you can use an oven-proof casserole dish.

Categories    : Beef                            Soups/Stews
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  beef stew meat -- cubed
  1                can  tiny peas - (15 oz)
  1                cup  sliced carrots
  2               cups  chopped onions
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                can  cream of tomato soup or celery
                        or mushroom soup
     1/2                soup can water
  1              large  raw potato -- sliced
                        Bay leaf piece -- (optional)

Combine meat, peas, carrots, onions, salt, pepper, soup, water, potato and bay leaf in a casserole dish that has a tight lid.  Put the lid on and put the casserole in a 275 degree oven.  Now go back to bed.  It will cook happily all by itself and be done in 5 hours. 

This recipe yields 5 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  This recipe calls for cooking the meat at only 275 degrees.  However the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline advises that all meat must be cooked at a temperature of at least 325 degrees to avoid the risk of food poisoning.  The meat will be done in about 3 hours at 325 degrees.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fruit                           Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  hulled ripe strawberries -- (2 1/2 pints)
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  2        tablespoons  mild-flavored honey, such as clover
                        Juice of 1 orange
  1         tablespoon  creme de cassis
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint
                        Additional fresh mint -- for garnish

Divide the berries in half according to their appearance, including all crushed berries in the batch of less attractive berries.  You will use this one for the concasse.  Cut the large berries in the prettier batch into halves or quarters and toss them with the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon honey, or more to taste.  Cover and refrigerate. 

Place the remaining strawberries in the bowl of your mixer or in a large bowl.  Using the mixing beater, a fork, or a pestle, crush the berries to a coarse puree.  Beat in the orange juice, creme de cassis and 1 tablespoon honey, or more to taste.  Set aside until ready to serve.  This can be done hours in advance and stored in the refrigerator.  Just before serving, stir the mint into the concasse. 

To serve, ladle a generous portion of the concasse into each bowl.  Give the whole strawberries a toss and add them to each serving.  Garnish with fresh mint leaves and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- sliced
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (3" long) -- peeled, sliced
  2        tablespoons  patis or other fish sauce -- see * Note
  2              large  tomatoes -- chopped
  3             pounds  mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
  4               cups  water
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Patis (Filipino fish sauce).  This amber-colored sauce made from salted and fermented fish is similar to Thailand's nam pla and Vietnam's nuoc nam, but saltier than both.  Patis is used in cooking or as a condiment. 

Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat.  Add the onion, garlic and ginger, and saute until the onion is translucent.  Add the fish sauce and chopped tomatoes, and saute until the tomatoes begin to soften, about 2 minutes. 

Add the mussels, water and wine.  Cover and simmer until the mussels open, about 10 minutes.  Season to taste with pepper.  Serve hot. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;* Note:  Patis (Filipino fish sauce).  This amber-colored sauce made from salted and fermented fish is similar to Thailand&apos;s nam pla and Vietnam&apos;s nuoc nam, but saltier than both.  Patis is used in cooking or as a condiment. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat.  Add the onion, garlic and ginger, and saute until the onion is translucent.  Add the fish sauce and chopped tomatoes, and saute until the tomatoes begin to soften, about 2 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Add the mussels, water and wine.  Cover and simmer until the mussels open, about 10 minutes.  Season to taste with pepper.  Serve hot.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  green beans -- blanched
  1                cup  pineapple juice
     1/2           cup  roasted peeled red bell peppers
     1/4           cup  chopped peeled fresh ginger
  3                     fresh jalapeÒo peppers -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and chopped
  2        tablespoons  Sweet Soy Sauce -- see * Note
  4               cups  tomato juice
  1             medium  zucchini -- cut in 1/4" dice
  1             medium  red onion -- cut in 1/4" dice
  1             medium  green bell pepper -- cut in 1/4" dice
  1              small  seeded ripe tomato -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut in 1/4" dice
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
  2                     mangoes -- peeled, pitted,
                        and cut in 1/4" dice
     1/2           cup  fresh lime juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  To make Sweet Soy Sauce:  Combine 2 cups regular or lite soy sauce, 1 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon chili paste.  Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Simmer on low for 25 minutes.  (We reduced this recipe by half and left out the chili paste.) 

To blanch beans, drop in boiling water for 2 minutes.  Then transfer to ice water.  Drain again thoroughly.  Cut the beans into 1/4-inch rounds and set aside. 

Combine the pineapple juice, roasted red peppers, ginger, jalapeÒos and soy sauce in a blender or food processor and process until smooth.  Press the mixture through a fine sieve into a large bowl.  Stir in the beans and the remaining ingredients and refrigerate, covered, until well chilled, about 2 hours. 

To serve, stir the gazpacho, then ladle it into chilled bowls, dividing the vegetables and mango evenly. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     parsnips - (8 oz total) -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1                     baking potato - (abt 8 oz) -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic clove -- chopped
  2              small  jalapeÒos -- cored, seeded,
                        and chopped
  4               cups  chicken stock
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  diced celery
     1/2           cup  diced bell peppers -- different colors
                        if possible, plus extra for garnish
     3/4           cup  diced sweet potato
     3/4           cup  corn kernels
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  milk
  1 1/2           cups  cooked wild rice -- plus more for garnis
  1                cup  diced smoked chicken - (abt 5 oz)
                        Worcestershire sauce -- to taste

Put parsnips, potato, onion, garlic, and jalapeÒos in a large saucepan with the chicken stock, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the vegetables are extremely soft, about 30 minutes.  Cool slightly, then puree in a blender or food processor until smooth. 

Rinse out the saucepan.  (If the soup base seems fibrous, strain it through a fine sieve.)  While the soup base is cooking, heat the butter in a large frying pan, add the celery, bell peppers, sweet potato, and corn and saute over medium-high heat until soft and slightly browned, about 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste. 

Put the soup base in the clean saucepan, add the milk and bring it back to a simmer.  Add the cooked wild rice, smoked chicken, and sauteed vegetables.  Season with a little more salt to taste and a splash of Worcestershire sauce.  Simmer a few minutes to give the flavors a chance to blend. 

Serve hot, garnished with a small heap of wild rice and diced bell peppers. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.
