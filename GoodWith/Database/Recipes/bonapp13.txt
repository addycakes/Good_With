  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3             medium  onions -- chopped
  4              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  3 1/2           cups  chicken stock or canned broth
  1 1/2           cups  dry red wine
  3                     bay leaves
  4             pounds  boneless first-cut beef brisket
                        Paprika -- to taste
  1            package  dried apricots - (6 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  pitted prunes
  3             pounds  yams -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" pieces
  6              large  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" pieces
                        Minced fresh parsley -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Heat oil in heavy large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Add onions and garlic and cook until beginning to brown, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes.  Add 1 teaspoon paprika, allspice and crushed red pepper and stir 20 seconds.  Add chicken stock, wine and bay leaves.  Boil 10 minutes to blend flavors.

Sprinkle brisket with paprika and rub in.  Add brisket to pot, fat-side up.  Add dried apricots and pitted prunes.  Cover and bake 1 1/2 hours.

Add yams and carrots to pot.  Cover and cook until brisket is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours longer.  Remove from oven and let stand 20 minutes.

Remove brisket from pot and slice thinly across grain.  Arrange on platter.  Degrease pan juices.  Spoon pan juices over meat.  Arrange fruit and vegetables around meat.  Garnish with minced fresh parsley and serve.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate before slicing meat.  To serve, remove meat from pot and slice thinly across grain.  Remove any solid fat from sauce.  Return sliced meat to pot.  Place pot in 325 degrees oven and bake until brisket is heated through, about 30 minutes.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This can be prepared one day ahead, making the seder day much easier.  Serve steamed broccoli on the side.

                        Bittersweet Chocolate Cake

Recipe By     :Terry Gibralter, Sixteenth Arrondissement, Paris, France
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- cut into pieces
  4              large  eggs -- separated
     2/3           cup  sugar
  3 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        Powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line bottom of 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 2-inch-high sides with waxed paper.  Butter sides of pan and paper.  Dust pan with flour.

Melt chocolate and butter in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring until smooth.  Cool slightly.

Whisk yolks and sugar in large bowl until pale yellow.  Mix in flour, then chocolate mixture.  Using electric mixer, beat whites in another bowl until stiff but not dry.  Fold into chocolate mixture.

Pour batter into prepared pan.  Bake until toothpick inserted into center comes out with only a few moist crumbs attached, about 25 minutes.  Cool completely in pan on rack.

Run small sharp knife around sides of pan to loosen cake.  Turn cake out onto platter and cool.  (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead.  Cover with cake dome and let stand at room temperature.)  Sift powered sugar over cake and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Similar to a flourless cake, this one contains only a small amount of flour, which results in an incredibly rich, fudge-like dessert.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/3           cups  sifted all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  7        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  ice water
  1              large  egg yolk
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  brandy
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  unflavored gelatin
  5             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- finely chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch -- plus
     1/4      teaspoon  cornstarch
  2               cups  half-and-half
  4              large  egg yolks
                        === TOPPING ===
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  water
     1/2           cup  whipping cream -- plus
  1         tablespoon  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  1                cup  toasted pecans -- chopped

For Crust:  Combine flour, sugar and salt in processor.  Add butter and blend using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Beat water, egg yolk and vanilla together in small bowl.  Add egg mixture to processor and process until large moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 30 minutes.  (Dough can be prepared up to 2 days ahead.  Let dough stand at room temperature to soften slightly before continuing.)

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Lightly butter 9-inch-diameter pie pan.  Roll dough out on floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer to prepared pan.  Fold edges under and crimp to form high fluted edge.  Freeze until firm, about 15 minutes.

Line crust with foil and fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake until sides are set, about 20 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Pierce bottom of crust until golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Cool on rack.

For Filling: Combine brandy and vanilla in small bowl.  Sprinkle gelatin over and let stand 10 minutes.  Place chocolate in medium bowl.  Mix sugar, cornstarch and salt in heavy medium saucepan.  Gradually whisk half-and-half and egg yolks into sugar mixture.  Cook over medium-high heat until custard is thick and smooth and begins to boil, whisking constantly, about 3 minutes.

Quickly add 1 1/4 cups custard to chocolate.  Stir until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.  Add brandy and gelatin mixture to remaining hot custard.  Stir until gelatin dissolves.  Spread chocolate filling in crust.  Spread brandy filling over.  Refrigerate uncovered until pie is completely cool.

For Topping:  Heat sugar and water in heavy small saucepan over low heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil, without stirring, until mixture is deep amber, brushing down sugar crystals from sides of pan with wet pastry brush, about 11 minutes.

Remove from heat and add cream (mixture will bubble up).  Add butter and stir until smooth.  Stir over low heat until color deepens and caramel thickens slightly, about 3 minutes.  Mix in pecans.  Transfer to small bowl.  Refrigerate until cool but not set, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Spoon topping over brandy layer.  Chill pie until topping is set, about 2 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Two new flavors enhance a classic.

For Crust:  Combine flour, sugar and salt in processor.  Add butter and blend using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Beat water, egg yolk and vanilla together in small bowl.  Add egg mixture to processor and process until large moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 30 minutes.  (Dough can be prepared up to 2 days ahead.  Let dough stand at room temperature to soften slightly before continuing.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Lightly butter 9-inch-diameter pie pan.  Roll dough out on floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer to prepared pan.  Fold edges under and crimp to form high fluted edge.  Freeze until firm, about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Line crust with foil and fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake until sides are set, about 20 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Pierce bottom of crust until golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Cool on rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Filling: Combine brandy and vanilla in small bowl.  Sprinkle gelatin over and let stand 10 minutes.  Place chocolate in medium bowl.  Mix sugar, cornstarch and salt in heavy medium saucepan.  Gradually whisk half-and-half and egg yolks into sugar mixture.  Cook over medium-high heat until custard is thick and smooth and begins to boil, whisking constantly, about 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Quickly add 1 1/4 cups custard to chocolate.  Stir until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.  Add brandy and gelatin mixture to remaining hot custard.  Stir until gelatin dissolves.  Spread chocolate filling in crust.  Spread brandy filling over.  Refrigerate uncovered until pie is completely cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Topping:  Heat sugar and water in heavy small saucepan over low heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil, without stirring, until mixture is deep amber, brushing down sugar crystals from sides of pan with wet pastry brush, about 11 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from heat and add cream (mixture will bubble up).  Add butter and stir until smooth.  Stir over low heat until color deepens and caramel thickens slightly, about 3 minutes.  Mix in pecans.  Transfer to small bowl.  Refrigerate until cool but not set, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon topping over brandy layer.  Chill pie until topping is set, about 2 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

                        = (or apricot nectar)
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           envelope  fast-rising dry yeast
  2        tablespoons  hot water -- (120 to 125 degrees)
  3 1/2           cups  sifted all-purpose flour
  12            ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- coarsely chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
  6             ounces  moist dried apricots -- quartered
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
                        Powdered sugar
                        === WHIPPED CREAM ===
  2             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
  2               cups  whipping cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  apricot-flavored brandy
                        = (or apricot nectar)

For Sponge:  Boil apricot nectar in heavy medium saucepan over high heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 5 minutes.  Pour reduced nectar into large bowl.  Cool to 120 to 125 degrees.  Whisk in flour, sugar, milk powder and yeast.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in warm draft-free area until double in volume, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare Dough:  Generously butter 12-cup kugelhupf pan.  Using electric mixer, cream butter with sugar in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in eggs and egg yolks, 1 at a time.  Beat in apricot brandy, salt, vanilla and ginger.

Combine yeast and 2 tablespoons hot water in small bowl and stir until yeast dissolves.  Mix yeast mixture and sponge into butter mixture.  Gradually mix in 3 cups flour.  Combine chocolate, apricots, brown sugar and cinnamon in medium bowl.  Mix into dough.

Spoon dough into prepared pan.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and clean kitchen towel.  Let stand in warm draft-free area until dough rises just to top of pan, about 3 hours.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Bake kugelhupf until deep brown and cracking on top and tester inserted in center comes out clean, about 48 minutes.  Cool on rack 20 minutes.  Turn out onto rack and cool completely.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Return to pan, cover tightly and store at room temperature.)

For Whipped Cream:  Stir chocolate and 2 tablespoons cream in heavy small saucepan over low heat until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.  Cool.

Beat remaining 2 cups cream and sugar in large bowl until soft peaks form.  Add brandy and continue beating until stiff peaks form.  Pour chocolate mixture over cream and fold together until whipped cream is lightly streaked with chocolate.  Transfer to serving bowl; chill.  (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead.)

Place kugelhupf on platter.  Lightly sift powdered sugar over.  Cut into wedges.  Serve, passing whipped cream separately if desired.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Rich with chocolate and dried apricots, this dessert is a stately yeast-risen cake that requires no kneading and very little attention.  When you set it aside in a warm place, it does much of the work by itself.  A large bundt or angel food pan can replace the traditional ornate mold.

     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- melted
  2             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  24                    walnut halves
                        Whipped cream -- (optional)

For Syrup:  Bring all ingredients to boil in heavy small saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Continue boiling 1 minute.  Cool completely.  (Can be prepared up to 2 days ahead.  Cover and store at room temperature.)

For Filling:  Combine 8 ounces walnuts, 6 ounces chocolate, dates, sugar and cinnamon in processor.  Coarsely chop using on/off turns.  Transfer filling to medium bowl.  Mix in egg.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Lightly butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan.

Place 1 phyllo sheet on work surface (keep remainder covered with plastic and damp towel to prevent drying).  Brush phyllo with butter.  Top with second phyllo sheet and brush with butter.  Arrange sheets buttered-side up and lengthwise in prepared pan, covering bottom and ends of pan.

Brush another phyllo sheet with butter.  Fold phyllo in half forming 8- by 12-inch rectangle and brush with butter.  Repeat with 2 more phyllo sheets.  Place 3 folded phyllo sheets in bottom of pan, buttered-side up.  Sprinkle half of filling over.  Butter another phyllo sheet and fold in half.  Butter top and place atop filling.  Sprinkle remaining filling over.  Repeat buttering and folding with 3 more phyllo sheets.  Place atop filling.  Butter last 2 phyllo sheets.  Place lengthwise in pan, tucking in sides and ends of top and bottom sheets to enclose filling completely.

Carefully cut through top layers of phyllo (do not cut through to filling) to form twenty-four 2-inch squares.  Pour any remaining butter over.  Bake until top is golden brown, about 45 minutes.  Immediately spoon syrup over baklava.  Cool completely.  Cover and let stand at room temperature overnight.

Melt 2 ounces chocolate and 1 tablespoon butter in heavy small saucepan.  Dip walnut halves halfway into chocolate; shake off excess.  Place on waxed paper and refrigerate until chocolate is set, about 30 minutes.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover walnuts with waxed paper.)

Cut baklava into squares to platter.  Place chocolate-dipped walnut half atop each square.  Serve with whipped cream if desired.

This recipe yields 24 pieces.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  2 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  1 1/4         pounds  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
                        === SYRUP ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  water
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped pitted prunes - (abt 3 oz)
     1/4           cup  Cognac, Armagnac or other brandy
                        === CAKE ===
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- room temperature
  2               cups  sugar
  3              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1              ounce  unsweetened chocolate -- melted
  1 1/4           cups  buttermilk -- room temperature
                        Unsweetened cocoa powder
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut into pieces
  2             ounces  imported milk chocolate -- chopped

For Filling:  Scald cream in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Remove pan from heat.  Add chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth.  Pour filling into large bowl.  Refrigerate until filling is very thick but still spreadable, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours.

For Syrup:  Bring sugar, water and chopped prunes to boil in heavy small saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Boil 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Add Cognac.  Cover and let mixture steep 1 hour.  Strain, reserving prunes and syrup separately.

For Cake:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 11- by 17 1/2-inch cookie sheet with 1-inch-high sides.  Line cookie sheet with parchment.  Butter parchment and dust with flour, tapping out excess.

Sift first 5 ingredients into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, cream 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons butter in large bowl.  Gradually beat in sugar (mixture will be grainy).  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Mix in melted unsweetened chocolate and prunes reserved from syrup.  Stir in flour mixture alternately with buttermilk, beginning and ending with dry ingredients and scraping down sides of bowl.

Transfer batter to prepared pan, spreading evenly.  Bake until tester inserted in center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.

Dust parchment sheet with cocoa powder.  Run knife around edges of pan to loosen cake.  Cool cake in pan on rack 15 minutes.  Turn cake out onto prepared parchment sheet.  Peel parchment off cake bottom.  Cool completely.

Trim 1/2 inch off each short edge of cake.  Cut remainder of cake into three 5- by 10 1/2-inch rectangles (there will be some cake left over).  Place 1 cake layer onto 4 1/2- by 10-inch cardboard rectangle.  Brush cake with 3 tablespoons syrup.  Spread 3/4 cup filling over.  Place second cake layer atop filling.  Brush with 3 tablespoons syrup.  Spread 3/4 cup filling over.  Top with third cake layer.  Brush with 3 tablespoons syrup.  Spread 1 cup filling over top and sides of cake to coat.  Chill cake until coating is firm, 45 minutes.

Heat remaining filling in heavy small saucepan over low heat.  Add 1/4 cup butter and whisk until butter melts and mixture is smooth.  Chill until glaze is slightly thickened but still pourable, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.

Transfer cake on cardboard base to rack set over large piece of foil.  Pour glaze over top and sides of cake, smoothing sides only.  Let stand 15 minutes.

Melt milk chocolate in heavy small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly.  Pour chocolate into small parchment cone.  Cut off tip to form small opening.  Pipe chocolate lines 1/2-inch apart crosswise over top of cake.  Starting at 1 short edge 3/4-inch from long edge, draw tip of small sharp knife through chocolate lines to second short edge.  Starting at second short edge 3/4-inch from first line, draw knife tip through lines in opposite direction.  Continue drawing knife tip through chocolate lines, spacing drawn lines 3/4-inch apart and reversing direction each time, creating chevron pattern.

Transfer cake to platter.  Spoon all glaze left on foil into pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch (no. 3) star tip.  Pipe shell pattern unto platter around base of cake.  Refrigerate 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover cake loosely and refrigerate.  Bring cake to room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Prunes and Cognac add moistness and great flavor to this rich chocolate cake.

For Filling:  Scald cream in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Remove pan from heat.  Add chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth.  Pour filling into large bowl.  Refrigerate until filling is very thick but still spreadable, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Syrup:  Bring sugar, water and chopped prunes to boil in heavy small saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Boil 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Add Cognac.  Cover and let mixture steep 1 hour.  Strain, reserving prunes and syrup separately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Cake:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 11- by 17 1/2-inch cookie sheet with 1-inch-high sides.  Line cookie sheet with parchment.  Butter parchment and dust with flour, tapping out excess.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sift first 5 ingredients into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, cream 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons butter in large bowl.  Gradually beat in sugar (mixture will be grainy).  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Mix in melted unsweetened chocolate and prunes reserved from syrup.  Stir in flour mixture alternately with buttermilk, beginning and ending with dry ingredients and scraping down sides of bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer batter to prepared pan, spreading evenly.  Bake until tester inserted in center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dust parchment sheet with cocoa powder.  Run knife around edges of pan to loosen cake.  Cool cake in pan on rack 15 minutes.  Turn cake out onto prepared parchment sheet.  Peel parchment off cake bottom.  Cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Trim 1/2 inch off each short edge of cake.  Cut remainder of cake into three 5- by 10 1/2-inch rectangles (there will be some cake left over).  Place 1 cake layer onto 4 1/2- by 10-inch cardboard rectangle.  Brush cake with 3 tablespoons syrup.  Spread 3/4 cup filling over.  Place second cake layer atop filling.  Brush with 3 tablespoons syrup.  Spread 3/4 cup filling over.  Top with third cake layer.  Brush with 3 tablespoons syrup.  Spread 1 cup filling over top and sides of cake to coat.  Chill cake until coating is firm, 45 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat remaining filling in heavy small saucepan over low heat.  Add 1/4 cup butter and whisk until butter melts and mixture is smooth.  Chill until glaze is slightly thickened but still pourable, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer cake on cardboard base to rack set over large piece of foil.  Pour glaze over top and sides of cake, smoothing sides only.  Let stand 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt milk chocolate in heavy small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly.  Pour chocolate into small parchment cone.  Cut off tip to form small opening.  Pipe chocolate lines 1/2-inch apart crosswise over top of cake.  Starting at 1 short edge 3/4-inch from long edge, draw tip of small sharp knife through chocolate lines to second short edge.  Starting at second short edge 3/4-inch from first line, draw knife tip through lines in opposite direction.  Continue drawing knife tip through chocolate lines, spacing drawn lines 3/4-inch apart and reversing direction each time, creating chevron pattern.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer cake to platter.  Spoon all glaze left on foil into pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch (no. 3) star tip.  Pipe shell pattern unto platter around base of cake.  Refrigerate 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover cake loosely and refrigerate.  Bring cake to room temperature before serving.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  hazelnuts - (abt 5 oz) -- toasted
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1 1/4           cups  sifted all-purpose flour
  1 1/4      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  1              ounce  cream cheese -- cut small pieces,
                        and frozen
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
     1/2         ounce  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- finely chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
  1                     egg white -- beaten to blend
     1/3           cup  seedless raspberry jam
                        === FILLING ===
  9             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  3        tablespoons  whipping cream
     1/3           cup  seedless raspberry jam -- plus
  2        tablespoons  seedless raspberry jam
  1                     basket raspberries - (1/2 pint)
                        Lightly-sweetened whipped cream

For Crust:  Position rack in lowest third of oven.  Set cookie sheet on rack and preheat to 375 degrees.  Remove bottom from 10 1/2- by 9 1/2-inch heart-shape tart pan with 1-inch-high sides and removable bottom.  Place bottom on parchment and trace heart shape.

Finely chop nuts with sugar in processor.  Add flour, cinnamon, salt, cloves and ginger.  Process just to blend.  Add butter and cream cheese to processor.  Process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 1 egg and chocolate.  Process, using on/off turns, until large moist clumps form.

To form top crust, transfer 1 1/3 cups dough to pastry bag fitted with number 4 (3/8-inch diameter) plain tip.  Refrigerate remaining dough.  Pipe 7 parallel diagonal lines about 3/4-inch apart across heart outline on parchment.  Pipe border around edge of heart inside traced line, touching ends of diagonal lines (some dough may be left over in pastry bag).  Freeze 10 minutes.

Brush dough with some egg white.  Slide parchment with heart onto heated cookie sheet and bake until crust is golden and edges are beginning to brown, about 15 minutes.  Run long thin spatula between crust and parchment to loosen crust.  Slide parchment with heart-shape crust onto rack and cool completely.  Maintain oven temperature.

Return removable bottom to heart pan.  Press remaining dough onto bottom and 3/4-inch up sides of pan, using plastic wrap if necessary to prevent dough from sticking to hands.  Freeze until dough is firm, about 10 minutes.  Brush lightly with egg white.  Set pan on heated cookie sheet and bake until crust is golden brown and sides are beginning to pull away from pan, about 23 minutes.  Spread bottom crust evenly with 1/3 cup jam.  Bake 3 more minutes.  Cool crust completely on rack.

For Filling:  Stir chocolate, butter and cream in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until chocolate and butter are melted and mixture is smooth.  Mix in 2 tablespoons jam.  Cool slightly.  Pour filling evenly into bottom crust; smooth top.  Chill until filling is firm, about 30 minutes.

Spread remaining 1/3 cup jam over filling and outer edge of bottom crust.  Carefully place cooled heart-shape top crust atop jam.  Press gently to seal.  Cover with foil and refrigerate overnight.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.)

Remove torte from pan.  Transfer to platter.  Let stand at room temperature 45 minutes.  Arrange raspberries in row in first space between crust lines.  Spoon whipped cream into pastry bag fitted with small star tip.  Pipe row of small rosettes in second space between crust lines.  Continue, alternating rows of raspberries and whipped cream rosettes between crust lines.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BROWNIE CRUST ===
  3             ounces  unsweetened chocolate chopped
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut small pieces
     1/2           cup  sifted all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  baking powder
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  golden brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2         ounce  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- finely chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
                        === FILLING ===
  12            ounces  cream cheese -- room temperature
  1                cup  golden brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  3              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1 1/3           cups  creamy peanut butter - (abt 12 oz)
                        = (do not use old-fashioned or
                        freshly ground)
                        === TOPPING ===
     3/4           cup  sour cream
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  creamy peanut butter

For Brownie Crust:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Dust pan lightly with flour, tap out excess.

Melt unsweetened chocolate and butter in heavy small saucepan over low heat.  Cool.  Blend flour, salt and baking powder in small bowl.

Using electric mixer, beat eggs and sugar in medium bowl until slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted, about 4 minutes.  Scrape down sides of bowl.  Beat in melted chocolate mixture, vanilla and chopped chocolate.  Add dry ingredients and mix until just blended; do not overbeat.

Spread 1 cup brownie batter over bottom of prepared pan.  Bake until firm, about 17 minutes.  Cool baked bottom crust in pan in freezer, about 15 minutes.  Maintain oven temperature.

Meanwhile, prepare Filling:  Blend cream cheese and sugar in processor until smooth.  Add eggs and sour cream and process using on/off turns until mixture is smooth, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed.  Blend in peanut butter using on/off turns.

Using small knife, spread remaining brownie batter evenly around sides of pan, sealing batter to bottom crust.  Pour in filling, which will not be as high as brownie batter.  Bake until center of cheesecake is gently set and brownie sides have fallen to form a 1-inch-wide ring around filling, about 30 minutes.

For Topping:  Blend sour cream and sugar in small bowl.  Spread evenly atop cheesecake to within 3/4-inch of edge.  Bake cheesecake 1 more minute.  Set cake on rack.  Using small sharp knife, cut around top edge of cake to loosen from pan sides.  Cool completely.

Place peanut butter in pastry bag fitted with small (no. 1) star tip.  Pipe tiny rosettes of peanut butter around edge of sour cream.  Refrigerate cake until rosettes are firm, about 30 minutes.  Cover pan tightly with foil and chill overnight.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)

Cut around pan sides to loosen cake.  Release sides.  Transfer cheesecake to platter.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  whipping cream

  2             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
     1/2           cup  chilled whipping cream
                        === PASTRY ===
     1/2           cup  milk
                        = (do not use lowfat or nonfat)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut small pieces
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  instant espresso powder
                        = (or instant coffee granules
  1            pinches  salt
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  3              large  eggs
     1/3           cup  sliced almonds
                        Powdered sugar
  2        tablespoons  dark rum

For Sauce:  Stir sugar and water in heavy small saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep golden brown, occasionally washing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush, about 9 minutes.

Add cream (mixture will bubble up).  Reduce heat to very low.  Stir until caramel dissolves completely and mixture is smooth.  Add butter, chocolate and espresso powder and stir until smooth.  (Sauce can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

For Filling:  Whisk sugar and yolks in medium bowl until thick, about 1 minute.  Add flour and beat until well blended.  Combine half-and-half and espresso powder in heavy medium saucepan.  Scrape in vanilla seeds; add pod.  Bring just to simmer over medium heat.  Gradually whisk hot half-and-half mixture into egg mixture.  Return egg mixture to same saucepan and cook until mixture is very thick and boils, whisking constantly.

Pour mixture into medium bowl.  Remove vanilla pod.  Add chocolate and whisk until smooth.  Press plastic wrap directly on surface of filling to prevent skin from forming; cool completely.

Whisk filling until smooth.  Beat chilled whipping cream in another medium bowl until stiff peaks form.  Fold whipped cream into filling in 2 additions.  Cover and chill at least 2 hours.  (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead.)

For Pastry:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 425 degrees.  Stack 2 cookie sheets.  Line top cookie sheet with parchment.  Trace 8 1/2-inch-diameter circle on parchment, using cake pan as guide.  Turn parchment over.  Butter circle lightly and dust with flour.

Combine milk, butter, sugar, espresso powder and salt in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring just to boil over medium heat, stirring until butter melts and sugar dissolves.  Add flour and cook 3 minutes, stirring vigorously with wooden spoon (mixture will form ball).  Remove from heat.

Make well in center of dough.  Break 1 egg into well.  Using wooden spoon, beat rapidly until egg is incorporated and dough is smooth, about 1 minute.  Repeat with second egg.  Beat third egg to blend in small bowl.  Reserve 1 tablespoon egg for glaze.  Add remaining beaten egg to dough and beat until smooth.

Fit pastry bag with 3/4-inch star tip (no. 7).  Transfer warm dough to bag.  Pipe 3/4-inch-wide ring over traced circle on parchment.  Pipe second ring inside first, making certain batter adheres to inside of first ring.  Pipe third ring atop center of first two rings.  Brush lightly with reserved egg glaze.  Sprinkle with sliced almonds.

Bake pastry 2 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees.  and bake until pastry is golden brown and firm to touch, about 40 minutes longer.  Turn off heat.  Leave pastry in oven 5 minutes.  Remove from oven.  Carefully remove pastry from parchment.  Using serrated knife, cut pastry in half horizontally.  Arrange cut-sides up on rack (pastry will appear moist and slightly doughy inside).  Cool completely.

Fit clean pastry bag with 3/4-inch (no. 7) star tip.  Transfer filling to bag.  Place pastry bottom on platter.  Pipe filling into pastry in large circular mounds.  Set top of pastry over filling.  Dust lightly with powered sugar.

Gently heat sauce in heavy small saucepan.  Mix in rum.  Using serrated knife, cut pastry into wedges.  Serve, passing sauce separately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The espresso-flavored cream puff pastry and fluffy coffee and chocolate custard filling vary from the traditional plain pastry and praline buttercream.  Delicious on its own, this is even better with the chocolate caramel sauce.

Bake pastry 2 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees.  and bake until pastry is golden brown and firm to touch, about 40 minutes longer.  Turn off heat.  Leave pastry in oven 5 minutes.  Remove from oven.  Carefully remove pastry from parchment.  Using serrated knife, cut pastry in half horizontally.  Arrange cut-sides up on rack (pastry will appear moist and slightly doughy inside).  Cool completely.

Fit clean pastry bag with 3/4-inch (no. 7) star tip.  Transfer filling to bag.  Place pastry bottom on platter.  Pipe filling into pastry in large circular mounds.  Set top of pastry over filling.  Dust lightly with powered sugar.

Comments:  The espresso-flavored cream puff pastry and fluffy coffee and chocolate custard filling vary from the traditional plain pastry and praline buttercream.  Delicious on its own, this is even better with the chocolate caramel sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     frozen phyllo pastry sheets -- thawed
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  4              large  egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard -- plus
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  half-and-half
  1                cup  whipping cream
  6             ounces  smoked salmon -- chopped
  4                     green onions -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh dill
                        = (or 1 tbspn dried dillweed)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Dill sprigs -- for garnish

Generously butter 9 1/2-inch-diameter deep-dish pie plate.  Place 1 phyllo sheet on work surface (cover remaining pieces with plastic wrap, then with clean damp towel.)

Brush phyllo sheet with butter and fold in half lengthwise.  Brush folded surface with butter.  Cut in half crosswise.  Place 1 phyllo rectangle, buttered-side down, in prepared pie plate, covering bottom and letting pastry overhang 1 section of edge by 1/2 inch.  Brush top of phyllo in pie plate with butter.  Place second phyllo rectangle in pie plate, covering bottom and letting pastry overhang another section of edge by 1/2 inch; brush with butter.

Repeat process with remaining 4 phyllo sheets, making certain entire surface of edge is covered to form crust.  Fold overhang under to form crust edge flush with edge of pie plate.  Brush crust edges with butter.  (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Whisk yolks and mustard in medium bowl to blend.  Beat in eggs, half-and-half, cream, salmon, onions and chopped dill.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour into prepared crust.  Bake until center is set, about 50 minutes.  Transfer to rack.  Cool.  Garnish with dill sprigs and serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Purchased phyllo pastry is used here instead of a regular pie crust for quick and easy assembly.  This tart is best when served at room temperature.

  6        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar

Heat 4 cups oil in wok or deep medium saucepan to 375 degrees.  Add batter-coated fish pieces to oil in batches and fry until crisp and golden, about 4 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer fish to paper towel-lined dish and drain.  Reheat oil if necessary between batches.

Arrange fish on platter.  Reheat sauce briefly, spoon over fish and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1            package  chocolate wafer cookies - (9 oz)
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted, cooled
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  instant espresso powder
  1         tablespoon  water
  3            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  3              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted, cooled
  1         tablespoon  finely-ground coffee
  6             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
     1/4           cup  whipping cream

For Crust: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Grind cookies in processor.  Add butter and process using on/off turns until crumbs are moist.  Press crumbs on bottom and 1 1/2 inches up sides of 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Wrap outside of pan with aluminum foil.

For Filling:  In small bowl, dissolve instant espresso in 1 tablespoon water.  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in large bowl until smooth.  Add sugar and continue beating until mixture is light and fluffy.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Mix in espresso mixture, butter and ground coffee beans.

Combine chocolate and cream in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over low heat until chocolate melts.  Pour half of cheese filling (about 2 1/2 cups) into prepared crust.  Drop 5 tablespoons melted chocolate mixture by tablespoons around edge of filling, spacing evenly.  Use small sharp knife to swirl chocolate into filling.  Carefully pour remaining cheese filling over.  Drop remaining chocolate mixture by tablespoons into center 6 inches of filling, spacing evenly.  Swirl mixtures together using tip of knife.

Bake cheesecake until edges are puffed and beginning to crack and top is golden brown, about 40 minutes (center will not be set).  Cool on rack.  Chill overnight.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.)

Run small sharp knife around edge of pan to loosen cheesecake.  Release pan sides.  Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.  Transfer to platter and serve.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

                        === FILLING ===
  1              large  egg
  2              large  egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1                     basket fresh boysenberries - (1/2 pint)
                        = (or 1 1/3 cup frozen unsweetened
                        boysenberries, thawed)
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  7        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel -- (yellow part only)
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1                     basket strawberries - (1 pint) -- stemmed, halved
  1                     basket fresh raspberries - (1/2 pint)
  1                     basket fresh boysenberries - (1/2 pint)
                        = (or blackberries)
  1              large  peach -- cut 1/2"-wide slices
  5        tablespoons  currant jelly

For Filling:  Beat egg and yolks in small bowl to blend.  Dissolve cornstarch in lemon juice in small bowl.  Mix into eggs.

Puree berries and sugar in blender.  Strain puree through a fine sieve into medium saucepan.  Add butter and bring to simmer over medium-high heat.  Slowly whisk hot berry mixture into egg mixture.  Return mixture to same saucepan and cook until filling is very thick and boils, whisking constantly, about 3 minutes.

Transfer filling to small bowl.  Press plastic wrap directly onto surface to prevent skin from forming; refrigerate at least 6 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)

For Crust:  Blend flour, sugar and salt in processor.  Add butter and lemon peel and process using on/off turns until coarse meal forms.  Add lemon juice and process until moist clumps form.  Gather into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate 45 minutes.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Let soften slightly at room temperature before continuing.)

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Roll dough out on lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch-thick round.  Fold dough over rolling pin and transfer to 9- by 1-inch tart pan with removable bottom.  Gently press dough into pan.  Trim and finish edges.  Chill 15 minutes.

Line dough with foil and fill with dry beans or pie weights.  Bake 15 minutes.  Remove beans and foil and bake until crust is golden, about 20 minutes longer.  Transfer crust to rack and cool.

Spread filling evenly in crust.  Arrange strawberries, cut-side down, in irregular pattern on filling.  Fill in with raspberries and boysenberries.  Tuck peach slices between berries.  Stir currant jelly in heavy small saucepan over low heat until melted.  Brush jelly over fruit to glaze.  (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead.  Refrigerate.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Any colorful combination of seasonal fruit can be used to decorate this pretty dessert.

Combine 3/4 cup sugar, water and yolks in medium metal bowl.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water.

Continue cooking 3 minutes, beating constantly.  Remove from over water.  Add warm melted chocolate and vanilla extract and beat until cool.

Beat whipping cream in another large bowl to stiff peaks.  Gently mix 1/4 of whipped cream into chocolate mixture.  Fold in remaining whipped cream.

Transfer 1 1/3 cups chocolate mixture to medium bowl.  Fold in reduced berry puree.  Fill prepared loaf pan with 1/3 of remaining chocolate mixture.  Cover with berry-chocolate mixture.  Top with remaining chocolate mixture.  Smooth top.  Freeze parfait overnight.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.)

For Sauce:  Puree frozen boysenberries, sugar and creme de cassis in blender or processor until smooth.  Strain.  Add any berry puree reserved from parfait.

Unmold frozen parfait.  Peel off plastic wrap.  Slice into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Drizzle with sauce.  Garnish with berries and fresh mint sprigs.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  frozen puff pastry sheets - (17 1/4 oz) -- thawed
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  hazelnuts - (abt 3 oz) toasted, husked,
                        and finely ground
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2              large  eggs
  1 3/4         ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- cut small pieces
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Cut 1 pastry sheet into 9 1/2-inch-diameter round.  Transfer to heavy large cookie sheet; chill.

Using electric mixer, cream butter and sugar in medium bowl until fluffy. Mix in nuts, flour and vanilla.  Mix in 1 egg.  Spread filling evenly over chilled pastry round, leaving 1/2-inch border at edge.  Arrange chocolate pieces over filling, spacing evenly.  Chill 15 minutes.

Beat remaining egg to blend in small bowl.  Cut second pastry sheet into 9 1/2-inch-diameter round.  Brush border of filled pastry with beaten egg.  Top with second pastry round, pressing edges together firmly to seal.  Crimp edges decoratively.  Brush pastry with beaten egg.  Cut small vent hole in center.  Using tip of small sharp knife, score half circles 1/2 inch apart in top of pastry, beginning at vent and ending at crimped edge.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Bake pastry until puffed and golden brown, about 25 minutes.  Cool 10 minutes on cookie sheet.  Transfer pastry to platter.  Serve warm or at room temperature, cutting pastry into wedges.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This dessert, prominent in the window of virtually every Paris pastry shop, is a true classic.  The puff pastry rounds are usually filled with an almond mixture, but my version features hazelnuts and chocolate.  Purchased pastry makes it approachable for the modern cook.  Since it reheats nicely, the Pithiviers can be made ahead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LEMON CURD ===
     3/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  3              large  eggs
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- plus
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  2        tablespoons  grated lemon peel
                        === FROSTING ===
  2 1/4           cups  whipping cream
  4 1/2         ounces  imported white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt)
     3/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === CAKE ===
  2 3/4           cups  sifted all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  4             ounces  imported white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt)
  1                cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  milk -- plus
  2        tablespoons  milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  2               cups  sugar
  4              large  eggs -- separated

For Lemon Curd:  Combine lemon juice and cornstarch in heavy medium saucepan, stirring until cornstarch dissolves.  Whisk in remaining ingredients.  Cook over medium heat until mixture is thick and smooth and just begins to boil, stirring constantly, about 7 minutes.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Place plastic wrap directly on surface of curd to prevent skin from forming.  Refrigerate until chilled, about 6 hours.  (Can be prepared days ahead.)

For Frosting:  Combine 1/2 cup cream and chocolate in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over low heat until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.  Transfer to large bowl.  Whisk in remaining 1 3/4 cups cream and vanilla.  Refrigerate until well chilled, about 6 hours.  (Can be prepared up to 1 day ahead.)

For Cake:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter three 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line bottoms with waxed paper.  Butter paper.  Dust pans with flour; tap out excess.

Sift flour, baking powder and salt together into medium bowl.  Repeat sifting.

Stir chocolate and 1/2 cup cream in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.  Mix in remaining 1/2 cup cream, milk and vanilla.

Using electric mixer, beat butter and 1 cup sugar in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in yolks.  Stir dry ingredients into butter mixture alternately with white chocolate mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.

Using electric mixer fitted with clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in medium bowl to soft peaks.  Gradually beat in remaining 1 cup sugar.  Continue beating until stiff but not dry.  Fold whites into cake batter in 2 additions.

Divide batter among prepared cake pans.  Bake until tester inserted in center comes out clean and cakes are beginning to pull away from sides of pans, about 24 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Turn cakes out onto racks, peel off waxed paper and cool completely.  (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead.  Cover and let stand at room temperature.)

Using electric mixer, beat frosting in another large bowl until stiff peaks form.  Place 1 cake layer on platter.  Spread 2/3 cup lemon curd evenly atop cake layer.  Spread 3/4 cup frosting atop curd.  Top with second cake layer.  Spread cake with 2/3 cup curd, then with 3/4 cup frosting.  Top with third cake layer.  Frost top and sides of entire cake evenly with 3 cups frosting.

Place remaining lemon curd in pastry bag fitted with number 2 star tip.  Pipe circle of curd around top of cake, 1/2-inch from edge.  Pipe evenly spaced diagonal lines inside circle, creating lattice pattern.  (Reserve remaining curd for another use.)

Spoon remaining frosting into clean pastry bag fitted with number 2 star tip.  Pipe ruffled border around top and bottom edges of cake.  (Can be prepared up to 6 hours ahead.  Refrigerate.)  Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  The contrast of the subtle white chocolate cake and frosting with a tart-sweet lemon curd filling is superb.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  ground unsalted pistachios
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  4              large  egg whites -- room temperature
                        === BUTTERCREAM ===
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/3           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  half-and-half
  8             ounces  imported white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt)
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  5        tablespoons  fraise or framboise eau-de-vie
                        = (clear strawberry or raspberry brandies)
  6        tablespoons  strawberry jam
  3                     baskets strawberries - (1 pint ea) -- stemmed
  7             ounces  marzipan
                        Green food coloring
                        Powdered sugar
  2             ounces  imported white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt)
                        chopped
  4                     strawberries -- cut in half through
                        stem end

For Cake:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter 9-inch square pan with 2-inch-high sides.  Line bottom with parchment paper.  Butter and flour parchment.

Using electric mixer, beat eggs and 1/3 cup sugar on high speed in large bowl until slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted, about 4 minutes.  Mix nuts, flour and baking powder in medium bowl.  Fold nut mixture into egg mixture.  Using clean beaters, beat egg whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.  Fold whites into batter in 2 additions.

Transfer batter to prepared pan.  Bake until tester inserted in center comes out clean, about 18 minutes.  Cool cake in pan on rack 5 minutes.  Cut around cake in pan.  Turn cake out onto rack.  Peel off parchment; cool cake completely.

For Buttercream:  Whisk yolks, sugar and flour in medium bowl until well blended.  Bring half-and-half to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Slowly pour hot half-and-half into egg mixture, whisking constantly.  Return egg mixture to same saucepan and cook until mixture is very thick and boils, whisking constantly.

Transfer mixture to medium bowl.  Add 8 ounces white chocolate and vanilla extract and stir until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.  Press plastic wrap on surface of pastry cream to prevent skin from forming; cool.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before continuing.)

Using electric mixer, beat 1 cup unsalted butter and 1 tablespoon brandy in large bowl until fluffy.  Add pastry cream 1/4 cup at a time, beating after each addition until just blended.

Melt jam in heavy small saucepan over medium heat.  Stir remaining 4 tablespoons brandy into jam.  Cut cake horizontally, into 2 even layers.  Place 1 layer on 8-inch cardboard square.  Brush half of jam over.  Spread 1 cup buttercream over jam.  Cover buttercream layer completely with whole strawberries, stem-end down.

Set aside 1/2 cup buttercream; spoon remaining buttercream over berries, spreading buttercream between and around berries.  Spread remaining jam over second cake layer.  Place cake, jam-side down, atop buttercream.  Press cake gently to adhere.  Refrigerate cake until buttercream is firm.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover cake and remaining buttercream separately and chill.  Bring buttercream to room temperature before continuing.)

Knead marzipan and 2 drops green coloring in large bowl until color is evenly distributed.  Dust work surface with powdered sugar.  Roll out marzipan on sugar to 12-inch-diameter circle, sprinkling with powdered sugar as needed to prevent sticking.  Spread reserved 1/2 cup buttercream over top of cake.  Using rolling pin as aid, drape marzipan over top of cake.  Press gently to adhere.  Trim marzipan flush with top of cake; reserve trimmings.  Brush excess powdered sugar off marzipan.  Using long sharp knife, cut 1/3-inch off each side of dessert to expose strawberries.

Cut marzipan trimmings into leaf shapes using small cutter.

Melt 2 ounces white chocolate in heavy small saucepan over low heat.  Transfer chocolate to small parchment cone.  Cut off tip to form small opening.  Pipe the word Fraisier atop marzipan layer.  Garnish with strawberry halves and marzipan leaves.  Refrigerate.  (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead.)

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  This cake, also called fraisier (French for "strawberry plant"), is usually made with almonds, but pistachios are used in this rendition.  The delicate cake is layered with fresh strawberries and a mousse-like white chocolate buttercream and then topped with marzipan.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
     1/4           cup  minced fresh mint - (packed)
  4              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     bay leaves -- crumbled
  1            5 pound  leg of lamb -- boned, butterflied
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- for garnish

Mix first 5 ingredients in large glass baking dish.  Season with generous amount of pepper.  Add lamb, turning to coat.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Drain lamb and transfer to large roasting pan.  Season both sides with salt and generous amount of pepper.  Arrange fat-side down in pan.  Roast 15 minutes.

Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees and continue roasting until thermometer inserted in thickest part of lamb registers 130 degrees for rare, about 20 minutes.  Let stand 10 minutes.

Cut into slices.  Arrange on platter.  Garnish with mint sprigs and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  SautÈed zucchini or spinach makes a delicious accompaniment.  Serve with a dry red wine such as a Naoussa from Greece or a Zinfandel or Pinot Noir from California.  Baklava from a local Middle Eastern market is the ideal after-dinner sweet.

Increase heat to medium-high and bring mixture to boil.  Boil without stirring until mixture turns deep golden brown, swirling pan occasionally, about 9 minutes.  Immediately divide caramel among ramekins.  Carefully tilt ramekins to coat bottoms (not sides) with caramel.

Bring cream, milk and 1/4 cup sugar to boil in heavy medium saucepan, whisking until sugar dissolves.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and stir until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.  Whisk in instant coffee, yolks, and egg.

Divide custard mixture evenly among caramel-lined ramekins.  Add enough hot water to baking pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.  Bake until custards are set around edges and centers move only slightly when baking pan is shaken, about 30 minutes.

Remove custards from water and cool completely.  Refrigerate until very cold, about 4 hours.  (Custards can be prepared 1 day ahead.)

For Ganache:  Dissolve instant coffee in 1/2 teaspoon water in small bowl.  Combine chocolate and cream in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over low heat until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.  Remove from heat and stir in coffee mixture.  Cool until just warm to touch.

Divide ganache among custards.  Spread ganache with back of spoon to cover top of custards completely.  Refrigerate until ganache is set, at least 30 minutes.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead; cover.)

Run small sharp knife around edge of custards to loosen.  Invert custards onto plates and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  In this great dessert, luscious custard tops a thin layer of mocha ganache.

     3/4           cup  sugar
  6                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  1         tablespoon  Cognac or brandy

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boned skinned chicken breasts
     1/2           cup  soft fresh goat cheese
                        = (such as Montrachet)
     1/3           cup  Thyme Pesto -- (see below)
  1           teaspoon  minced shallot or green onion
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed
                        === THYME PESTO ===
  1 1/2           cups  fresh parsley - (loosely packed)
     1/2           cup  fresh thyme leaves - (loosely packed)
                        = (or 1 tbspn dried thyme, crumbled,
                        plus 1/2 cup fresh parsley)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan - (abt 2 oz)
     1/2           cup  toasted pine nuts or walnuts
  2                     garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For Cicken:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Pound chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper to thickness of 1/4 inch.  Combine goat cheese, pesto and shallot in small bowl; mix well.  Spread boned side of chicken breast with scant 2 tablespoons cheese mixture.  Starting at one long side of chicken breast, roll up tightly, jelly roll style.  Repeat with remaining chicken and cheese mixture.

Heat olive oil in heavy large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat.  Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper.  Dredge in flour and shake off excess.  Fry chicken breast in olive oil until golden brown on all sides, turning occasionally, about 4 minutes.

Place skillet with chicken in oven and bake until chicken is tender and cooked through, about 10 minutes.

For Pesto:  Finely chop first 5 ingredients in processor.  With machine running, gradually add 1/2 cup olive oil.  Continue processing until pesto is almost smooth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Pesto can be prepared up to 1 week ahead.  Cover tightly and refrigerate.)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Garden-fresh Thyme Pesto is the star of this elegant entrÈe, but you can also use purchased or homemade basil pesto.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LADYFINGER ROUNDS ===
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-ground coffee
                        = (preferably espresso)
  3                     extra-large eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
  5        tablespoons  sugar

                        Powdered sugar
                        === FILLING ===
  3        tablespoons  framboise eau-de-vie
                        = (clear raspberry brandy)
  1         tablespoon  instant espresso powder
                        = (or instant coffee granules)
  2           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
                        = (preferably oil-fashioned, low-salt)
     2/3           cup  powdered sugar
  1            6 ounce  basket raspberries - (6 oz)
                        = (or 1 1/2 cups thawed, drained
                        frozen unsweetened raspberries)
     3/4           cup  freshly-brewed strong coffee -- room temperature
                        = (preferably espresso)
  3        tablespoons  sugar
                        Additional powdered sugar
                        Fresh mint
                        === RASPBERRY SAUCE ===
  1            package  frozen raspberries in syrup - (10 oz) -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  framboise eau-de-vie

For Ladyfinger Rounds:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment.

Mix flour and ground coffee beans in small bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat egg yolks and 4 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl until thick and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted, about 4 minutes.  Beat in vanilla.  Mix in dry ingredients (batter will be thick).

Using electric mixer fitted with clean dry beaters, beat egg whites until thick and foamy.  Add remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and beat until whites are stiff but not dry.  Fold into yolk mixture in 2 additions.

Drop batter by rounded tablespoons (8 per sheet) onto prepared sheets, spacing evenly.  Sift powdered sugar thickly over rounds.  Bake until rounds are golden brown on edges, about 16 minutes.  Cool in pan on rack.

Remove ladyfinger rounds from parchment (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Store in single layer in airtight container).

For filling:  Combine framboise and instant espresso in small bowl.  Stir until espresso dissolves.  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and 2/3 cup powdered sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in coffee mixture.  Fold in 1 cup raspberries.  Let stand at room temperature.

Combine coffee and 3 tablespoons sugar.  Stir until sugar dissolves.  Spoon 1 scant tablespoon coffee mixture over flat side of 1 ladyfinger round.  Place coffee-side up on plate.  Spread 1/3 cup filling atop round.  Place flat-side down atop filling.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Spoon Raspberry Sauce around desserts.  Garnish with remaining raspberries and fresh mint and serve.

For Raspberry Sauce:  Puree raspberries and syrup in processor.  Strain into small bowl to remove seeds.  Stir in eau-de-vie.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  An unexpected combination of ingredients updates the classic Italian dessert.  It is presented in individual servings here, but the ladyfingers, espresso and filling can be layered in a large dish and offered with the sauce on the side if you prefer.

For filling:  Combine framboise and instant espresso in small bowl.  Stir until espresso dissolves.  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and 2/3 cup powdered sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in coffee mixture.  Fold in 1 cup raspberries.  Let stand at room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine coffee and 3 tablespoons sugar.  Stir until sugar dissolves.  Spoon 1 scant tablespoon coffee mixture over flat side of 1 ladyfinger round.  Place coffee-side up on plate.  Spread 1/3 cup filling atop round.  Place flat-side down atop filling.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Spoon Raspberry Sauce around desserts.  Garnish with remaining raspberries and fresh mint and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Raspberry Sauce:  Puree raspberries and syrup in processor.  Strain into small bowl to remove seeds.  Stir in eau-de-vie.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  An unexpected combination of ingredients updates the classic Italian dessert.  It is presented in individual servings here, but the ladyfingers, espresso and filling can be layered in a large dish and offered with the sauce on the side if you prefer.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
     3/4           cup  whole unblanched almonds -- toasted, and
                        finely chopped
  1                cup  buttermilk
  2 1/2    tablespoons  instant coffee granules
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  3                     extra-large eggs -- room temperature
  1                cup  pitted prunes - (abt 6 oz) -- coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  1           teaspoon  instant coffee granules
                        Orange slices -- (optional)
                        Cinnamon stick -- (optional)

For Cake:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Generously butter 10-inch (12-cup) tube pan.  Sprinkle half of almonds into pan.  Tilt to coat bottom and halfway up sides with nuts (do not tap out excess).

Combine buttermilk, instant coffee, vanilla and almond extracts in small bowl.  Stir until coffee dissolves.  Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and ground cloves into medium bowl.

Using electric mixer, cream butter and sugar in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Slowly mix in dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.  Mix in prunes and orange peel.

Pour batter into prepared pan.  Sprinkle with remaining almonds.  Bake until tester inserted into center of cake comes out clean, about 50 minutes.  Cool 30 minutes in pan on rack.  Turn cake out onto rack.  Quickly turn upright onto platter and cool until just warm.

For Glaze:  Combine brown sugar, butter and cream in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over medium-high heat until butter melts.  Boil 2 minutes.  Mix in instant coffee granules.  Cool slightly.  Drizzle glaze over cake.

Garnish cake with orange slices and cinnamon stick if desired and serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  Terrific when served with vanilla or coffee ice cream, and a very appealing breakfast or snack cake on its own.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TURKEY ===
  3 1/2         pounds  boned rolled and tied turkey breast
  3                     anchovies -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1              large  garlic clove -- slivered
  2               cans  chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz ea)
  2               cups  dry white wine
  2                     onions -- quartered
  2                     carrots -- cut 2" pieces
  4                     fresh parsley sprigs
  2                     bay leaves
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                can  white meat tuna packed in water - (6 1/2 o -- well drained
  5                     anchovies
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  drained capers
  1 1/4           cups  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                jar  mayonnaise - (8 oz)
                        = (1 cup plus 1 tbspn)
                        Chopped fresh Italian parsley
                        Drained capers
  2                     lemons -- halved lengthwise,
                        and sliced

For Turkey:  Make slits in turkey with tip of small sharp knife; put 1 anchovy piece and 1 garlic sliver into each slit.  Place turkey in large saucepan or Dutch oven.  Add all remaining ingredients.  Add water to cover.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat, cover partially and simmer until meat thermometer inserted in center of turkey registers 140 degrees, about 1 hour.  Turn off heat and let turkey cool in cooking liquid.

For Sauce:  Puree tuna, anchovies, lemon juice and 3 tablespoons capers in processor until very smooth, scraping down sides of work bowl occasionally.  With machine running, gradually mix in oil and blend until creamy.  Add mayonnaise and just blend using on/off turns (do not overmix).

Remove turkey from broth (reserve broth for another use).  Cut off string and pull off turkey skin.  Slice turkey into thin rounds.  Coat platter with some of sauce.  Top with single layer of turkey slices.  Spread turkey with more sauce.  Sprinkle generously with parsley and capers.

Continue layering turkey, sauce, parsley and capers until all of turkey is used.  Surround with lemon slices.  Cover with plastic; chill turkey and any remaining sauce separately for at least 8 hours.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.)

Let turkey stand at room temperature 1 hour.  Serve, passing any remaining sauce separately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Here, turkey stands in for the traditional veal in a do-ahead entrÈ.  Have your butcher bone, roll and tie the turkey breast.

                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  dark brown sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut small pieces
  1              large  egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  ice water
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/4           cups  chopped walnuts - (abt 5 oz)
  2        tablespoons  instant coffee granules
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  3              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted, cooled
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        === COFFEE CREAM ===
  1           teaspoon  instant coffee granules
  1           teaspoon  water
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar

For Crust:  Combine flour, brown sugar and salt in medium bowl.  Add butter and cut in with fingers or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Beat egg yolk and water in small bowl to blend.  Pour over flour mixture.  Stir with fork until mixture forms dough.  Gather into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap dough and chill until firm, at least 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Roll dough out on lightly floured surface to 12-inch-diameter round.  Roll up on rolling pin and transfer to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Fit dough into pan and trim edges.  Freeze until firm, about 20 minutes.

Bake crust until golden brown, piercing with toothpick if crust bubbles, about 15 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Maintain oven temperature.

For Filling:  Place walnuts on cookie sheet and toast in oven until just golden brown and fragrant, about 8 minutes.  Cool.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Dissolve instant coffee in 2 tablespoons water in large bowl.  Add brown sugar and whisk until smooth.  Whisk in eggs, corn syrup, butter and salt.  Stir in walnuts.  Pour filling into prepared crust and bake until set, about 30 minutes.  Cool tart on rack.  (Tart can be prepared 6 hours ahead.  Cover loosely and let stand at room temperature.)

For Coffee Cream:  Dissolve instant coffee in 1 teaspoon water in small bowl.  Whip cream and sugar until medium-soft peaks form.  Add coffee mixture and continue beating until stiff peaks form.  Serve tart with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.
