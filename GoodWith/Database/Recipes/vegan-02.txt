Categories    : Egg Free                        Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  summer squash -- diced
  1                     onion -- peeled, diced
  3        tablespoons  melted butter
  2        tablespoons  chopped Italian parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  Italian-style breadcrumbs
  4             ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh oregano -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

In large mixing bowl, toss together squash, onion, butter, parsley, salt and pepper and breadcrumbs until crumbs are well distributed.  Gently stir in crumbled goat cheese and spoon mixture into large heatproof baking dish.

Bake at 450 degrees for about 20 minutes.  Remove from oven and garnish with oregano.  Serve immediately.

Wine Suggestion:  The combination of summer zucchini, goat cheese, oregano and olives calls for Sauvignon Blanc.  Try Brander Sauvignon Blanc Santa Ynez Valley Cuvee Nicolas

Comments:  Depending on taste and what's freshest in the market, combine zucchini with crookneck or other summer squash, or use only one squash variety.  You can enhance flavors by adding extra goat cheese.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  large sun-ripened tomatoes
                        = (abt 4 large tomatoes)
  1                cup  diced celery
     1/2           cup  apple cider vinegar
     1/4           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  sugar or honey
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced onion
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley

Cut tomatoes into large, irregular chunks, and place with celery in salad bowl.

Combine vinegar, water, sugar and onion.  Stir to dissolve sugar, and infuse about 5 minutes, or until flavors blend.  Pour over tomatoes, and add salt and pepper.  Stir to coat all pieces of tomato with vinegar mixture.  Scatter parsley over top, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Per Serving: 60 Cal; 2g Prot; 1g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 14g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 45mg Sod.; 3g Fiber; 9g Sugar.

Comments:  This delightful 1920s church-picnic salad from central Pennsylvania depends on vine-ripe summer tomatoes for much of its flavor.  Choose plump, sweet-tasting beefsteak tomatoes.  For added zest, sprinkle freshly chopped mint over the salad just before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  buckwheat flour
     3/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  1 2/3           cups  buttermilk
     1/3           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              large  egg yolk
  2              large  egg whites
  1                cup  pure maple syrup
     1/2           cup  frozen cranberry juice concentrate -- thawed
     1/4           cup  dried cranberries

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Lightly coat waffle iron with cooking spray and preheat.

In large bowl, whisk together buckwheat flour, all-purpose flour, cinnamon, baking soda and 1/4 teaspoon salt.

In medium bowl, whisk together buttermilk, brown sugar, oil and egg yolk.  Add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture, whisking just until combined.

In small bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form.  Gently fold into batter.

Ladle 2/3 cup batter (or amount recommended by manufacturer's directions for your waffle iron) into waffle iron.  Close lid and cook until waffles are golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Gently open lid and remove waffle with fork.  Serve immediately or transfer to baking sheet and keep warm in oven.  Repeat with remaining batter, lightly coating iron with cooking spray each time.

While waffles cook, in small saucepan, combine maple syrup, cranberry juice concentrate and dried cranberries.  Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to low, and simmer until berries are plumped, about 3 minutes (syrup will be thin).  Serve warm syrup over waffles.

This recipe yields 12 waffles.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  breadcrumbs
  8             ounces  capellini
                        = (or other thin spaghetti-like pasta)
  6              large  outer leaves of savoy cabbage -- or more if needed
  2               cups  chopped tomatoes -- plus
  1              large  tomato
  30                    black olives -- chopped
                        = (preferably Kalamata)
  1         tablespoon  large capers
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh sweet basil
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        Minced parsley -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray deep 10-inch pie plate with nonstick cooking spray, and dust with breadcrumbs.

Bring large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil, and cook pasta about 10 minutes, or until tender.  Drain, and set aside in large mixing bowl.

Trim off any tough ribs at base of each cabbage leaf, and cook leaves in boiling water about 5 minutes, or until tender.  Remove from water, drain, and pat dry with paper towels.

Line pie plate with cabbage leaves, using scissors to trim leaves evenly along rim of dish.  Make sure to overlap leaves so they completely cover bottom.

Combine cooked pasta, chopped tomatoes, olives, capers, garlic, olive oil, sweet basil and pepper in large mixing bowl, and toss together.  Place pasta mixture into lined pie plate, and pat down firmly with wooden spoon or spatula.  Cut tomato into thin slices, and arrange evenly over top of filling.  Scatter grated cheese evenly over tomatoes.

Bake 30 minutes.  Remove from oven, and cool on rack.  Garnish with minced parsley, and serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Per Serving: 150 Cal; 5g Prot; 6g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 21g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 270mg Sod.; 2g Fiber; 3g Sugar.

Wine Suggestions:  This pasta pie is tailor-made for Red Zinfandel.  The wine and the pie are both earthy, herbal, full-bodied and highlighted with some fruity acidity.  Try drinking Adelaida Cellars Schoolhouse Zinfandel.

Comments:  Pasta pies baked in crusts can be heavy, but this recipe, using cabbage leaves, not only cuts carbohydrates, it enhances the flavor of the tomatoes.  The flavor improves overnight, so the pie is best served the following day at room temperature.  Think of this as a baked pasta salad.  Look for the largest cabbage, and select intact leaves.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray deep 10-inch pie plate with nonstick cooking spray, and dust with breadcrumbs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil, and cook pasta about 10 minutes, or until tender.  Drain, and set aside in large mixing bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Trim off any tough ribs at base of each cabbage leaf, and cook leaves in boiling water about 5 minutes, or until tender.  Remove from water, drain, and pat dry with paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Line pie plate with cabbage leaves, using scissors to trim leaves evenly along rim of dish.  Make sure to overlap leaves so they completely cover bottom.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine cooked pasta, chopped tomatoes, olives, capers, garlic, olive oil, sweet basil and pepper in large mixing bowl, and toss together.  Place pasta mixture into lined pie plate, and pat down firmly with wooden spoon or spatula.  Cut tomato into thin slices, and arrange evenly over top of filling.  Scatter grated cheese evenly over tomatoes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake 30 minutes.  Remove from oven, and cool on rack.  Garnish with minced parsley, and serve at room temperature.

<DirT>
Wine Suggestions:  This pasta pie is tailor-made for Red Zinfandel.  The wine and the pie are both earthy, herbal, full-bodied and highlighted with some fruity acidity.  Try drinking Adelaida Cellars Schoolhouse Zinfandel.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Pasta pies baked in crusts can be heavy, but this recipe, using cabbage leaves, not only cuts carbohydrates, it enhances the flavor of the tomatoes.  The flavor improves overnight, so the pie is best served the following day at room temperature.  Think of this as a baked pasta salad.  Look for the largest cabbage, and select intact leaves.

  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  8             medium  onions -- thinly sliced
  1              pinch  sugar
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
     1/2         pound  prepared pizza dough

     3/4           cup  shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese

In large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onions, sugar and 1/4 cup water, and cook, stirring frequently, until just beginning to color, about 12 minutes.  Add 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 cup water, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are sweet and deep brown, 30 minutes.  Cool.  Stir in basil and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Spray heavy baking sheet with cooking spray.  Sprinkle work surface with a little flour.  Place dough in center, and roll to coat with flour.  Knead dough briefly.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  russet potatoes - (to 3) -- scrubbed
  2          teaspoons  salt - (to 3)
  1                     large bunch Swiss chard
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/2           cup  hot milk - (to 3/4)
                        = (or half-and-half)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (to 3) -- room temperature
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- for garnish

Peel potatoes, leaving some skin on each.  Cut potatoes into large chunks, and place them in medium pot with enough cold water to cover.  Add 2 teaspoon salt, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat slightly and boil until potatoes are tender, about 12 minutes.

Meanwhile, rinse chard well.  Remove and discard stems and chop leaves coarsely.  In large skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Stir in chard and garlic.  Cover pan, and cook, until wilted and tender, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from heat.

When potatoes are done, drain and transfer to large mixing bowl.  Add milk and butter.  Mash potatoes, leaving them slightly lumpy, adding salt and pepper to taste.  Stir in chard and serve, garnished with Parmesan if desired.

This recipe yields 5 to 6 servings.

Per Serving: 274 Cal; 6g Prot; 8g Total Fat (4 Sat. Fat); 46g Carb.; 17mg  Chol; 1153mg  Sod.; 5g Fiber.

Comments  If you'd like to streamline the recipe, use a bag of prewashed baby spinach instead of chard.  Note that some of the skins are left on the potatoes for a rustic look.

  4        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
     1/3           cup  chopped carrot
     1/3           cup  chopped celery
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh oregano
     1/8      teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  fennel seed
  1                     eggplant - (1 1/2 to 2 lbs) -- whole, unpeeled
  2 1/2         pounds  fresh tomatoes - (to 3) -- skinned, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Tomato juice or water -- to thin soup as
                        needed

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in skillet over medium heat and saute onion, carrots, celery and garlic until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add herbs and fennel seeds and cook 2 minutes more.  Remove from heat and set aside.

Grill or broil eggplant until skin is black and blistered and inside is soft.  Remove stem, and scoop insides into large saucepan.  Add sauteed vegetables, tomatoes, vinegar, salt, pepper and tomato juice or water.

Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool slightly.  Puree in food processor or blender until liquid is red with black specks from charred skins.  If soup is too thick, thin with more tomato juice or water.  Season to taste, and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Wine Suggestion:  Choose a crisp, organic Sauvignon Blanc like Napa Wine Cellars to match the strong flavor, or select a nice Dolcetto, such as one from Clerico, a great producer.

                  Chocolate Waffles With Toasted Almonds

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian                      Waffles

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1 1/4           cups  chocolate soy milk
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1              large  egg yolk
  2              large  egg whites
  2        tablespoons  sliced almonds -- toasted

Lightly coat waffle iron with cooking spray and preheat.

In large bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and 1/4 teaspoon salt.

In medium bowl, whisk together chocolate soy milk, sugar, oil, vanilla and egg yolk.  Add soy milk mixture to flour mixture, whisking just until combined.

In small bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form.  Gently fold into batter.

Ladle 2/3 cup batter (or amount recommended by manufacturer's directions for your waffle iron) into waffle iron.  Close lid and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.  Gently open lid and remove waffle with fork.  Repeat with remaining batter, lightly coating iron with cooking spray each time.  If topping with frozen yogurt, let waffles cool to room temperature before serving.  Sprinkle with toasted almonds.

This recipe yields 12 waffles.

Per Waffle: 136 Cal; 4g Prot; 4g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 21g Carb.; 18mg  Chol; 130mg  Sod.; 1g Fiber.

Comments:  While a dedicated chocoholic might consider this waffle to be perfectly appropriate for breakfast, it's intended to be served as a dessert, with toppings like vanilla or chocolate frozen yogurt, fat-free chocolate syrup and toasted almonds.  Or, you can layer a frozen dessert between two waffles to create a sandwich.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 3/4           cups  cake flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
  1 1/3           cups  superfine sugar
  3              large  eggs -- separated
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2               cups  unflavored soy milk
                        === COCONUT CUSTARD CREAM ===
     1/2           cup  superfine sugar
  6        tablespoons  cake flour
  4        tablespoons  coconut cream powder
  1              pinch  sea salt
  2               cups  unflavored soy milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/3           cup  large coconut flakes
                        = (or shredded coconut)
                        === WHITE FROSTING ===
  1 1/2           cups  large-flake dried coconut
  4               cups  sifted confectioner's sugar
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
                        = (or vegetable shortening)
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  6        tablespoons  soy creamer

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place racks in middle of oven.  Lightly grease three 8-inch-round cake pans and line each pan with parchment paper circle.

Sift together flour, baking powder, cream of tartar and salt in mixing bowl.  Set aside.

Cream butter in large mixing bowl for 1 minute, using mixer on medium speed.  Continue beating, gradually adding sugar, and beat for 3 to 4 minutes, scraping down sides of bowl.  Blend in egg yolks, one at a time, mixing well after each.

Add vanilla extract and 1/4 cup of soymilk and beat on low for 1 minute.

Using rubber spatula, and stirring by hand, add flour mixture and remaining soymilk in separate batches, starting and ending with flour.  Beat lightly between additions, until ingredients are well blended.  Beat egg whites until stiff and fold them into batter.

Pour batter into prepared pans, dividing equally among pans.  Smooth tops with rubber spatula.

Bake for 22 to 25 minutes, or until top of cake springs back when lightly touched in center.  Remove pans from oven and cool on rack for 10 minutes.  While oven is still hot, toast coconut flakes: Place flakes on cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 7 minutes, or until flakes turn golden.  Watch coconut closely because flakes can burn easily.  Remove from oven and cool.

Slide thin knife around layers to detach them from pans.  Invert cakes and peel away paper liners.  Let layers cool, right-side up on racks, for at least 1 1/2 hours.

Meanwhile, to make Coconut Custard Cream, combine sugar, cake flour, coconut cream powder and salt in large saucepan.  Whisk in 1/2 cup soymilk and beat until smooth.  Whisk in remaining soymilk.

Cook over medium-low heat about 5 minutes, whisking gently but constantly until thickened.  Cook 2 minutes more or until mixture loses its floury taste.  Stir in vanilla extract and coconut.

Pour custard into small bowl.  Smooth top with rubber spatula and cover surface with wax paper.  Refrigerate until cooled.

To make White Frosting, place sifted confectioner's sugar, butter, salt, vanilla and soy creamer in bowl of electric mixer fitted with beaters.  Set mixer on low speed to prevent sugar from billowing out of bowl and beat for 2 minutes.  Increase speed and beat until smooth and creamy.  Add more soy creamer, if needed, to make frosting spreadable.

To assemble cake, put one layer on serving plate and ice with half the pastry cream.  Add second layer and ice with remaining pastry cream.  Place third layer on top.  Cover sides and top of cake generously with frosting.  Sprinkle with toasted coconut, covering sides and top of cake.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Per Serving: 820 Cal; 9g Prot; 35g Total Fat (17 Sat. Fat); 120g Carb.; 115mg Chol; 470mg Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  The nice thing about this recipe is its endless possibilities; you can even turn this recipe into cupcakes.  Make this a vegan dessert by omitting the eggs and using vegetable shortening instead of butter.

                     Corn And Red Pepper Caesar Salad

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               ears  corn on the cob
                        = (or 3 cups canned corn kernels, drained)
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, diced
  1             medium  romaine lettuce head -- leaves separated
  4              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  garlic croutons
     2/3           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     3/4           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic -- or to taste
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

If using fresh corn, carefully slice kernels from cobs and place in saucepan with water to cover.  Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from heat, drain and rinse under cold water.  Drain again and refrigerate until serving time.

Meanwhile, cook eggs in rapidly boiling water for 7 to 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and run under cold water until cool.  Peel and set aside until serving time.

Trim off stem end of lettuce and rinse each leaf well.  Dry thoroughly and break into bite-sized pieces.  Place in salad bowl.

To make dressing, whisk together 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese with olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, mustard and salt and pepper.  Set aside.

Add diced peppers and cooled corn to lettuce.  Toss with croutons.  Grate cooled eggs over top and toss with dressing.  Garnish salad with remaining 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 820 Cal; 24g Prot; 60g Total Fat (10 Sat. Fat); 50g Carb.; 225mg Chol; 790mg Sod.; 6g Fiber.

Wine Suggestion:  Corn, sweet red pepper and a salty Parmesan cheese will match well with a Chardonnay.  Try the Devil's Lair Margaret River Chardonnay.

Comments:  This rendition of the Caesar salad bolsters the lettuce with added vegetables for a full-meal dish.  Serve with fresh, warm baguettes and chilled fruit for a summertime repast.  Dress as desired and refrigerate any leftover dressing.

Wine Suggestion:  Corn, sweet red pepper and a salty Parmesan cheese will match well with a Chardonnay.  Try the Devil&apos;s Lair Margaret River Chardonnay.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This rendition of the Caesar salad bolsters the lettuce with added vegetables for a full-meal dish.  Serve with fresh, warm baguettes and chilled fruit for a summertime repast.  Dress as desired and refrigerate any leftover dressing.

Variations: &#013;&#010;     ï Sweet Potato Fries:  Substitute sweet potatoes for baking potatoes. &#013;&#010;     ï Spicy French Fries:  Stir 1/4 teaspoon each cayenne pepper and chili powder into butter or oil before tossing with potatoes. &#013;&#010;     ï Herbed French Fries:  Stir 1/4 teaspoon each dried oregano, basil and crushed rosemary into butter or oil before tossing with potatoes.

<Desc>
Better than any fast-food fries, this healthy homemade version is baked instead of fried.  As a welcome bonus, the skins can be left on the potatoes for extra crispness.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  coarsely-chopped peeled
                        all-purpose potatoes
  1                cup  finely-diced carrot
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- plus
                        extra for cooking breads
  1                cup  finely-chopped onion
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
  4                     flour tortillas - (8" dia)

Place potatoes and carrot in large saucepan with enough water to cover by 1 inch, and add 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Boil until potatoes are soft, about 8 minutes.  Drain, reserving cooking liquid, and transfer vegetables to medium mixing bowl.

Heat oil in large skillet.  Add onion, and sautÈ over moderate heat, stirring often, until translucent, 6 to 7 minutes.  Stir in curry powder, and cook, stirring, 15 seconds.  Add 1/2 cup reserved cooking liquid to pan.  Cook briefly over high heat to reduce liquid by about half, 30 seconds.  Add onion with liquid to potatoes, and mash well, adding additional salt if desired.

Working with one tortilla at a time, spread some mashed potato mixture thickly over half the tortilla.  Fold tortilla over potato mixture to close.

Heat 1 teaspoon oil in large skillet.  Add bread, and fry over medium heat, until browned, 45 to 60 seconds.  Flip bread, and cook until browned.  Transfer to chopping board, and slice in half.  Repeat for remaining breads.  Serve immediately, or place in warm oven until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Per Serving: 311 Cal; 6g Prot; 10g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 50g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 234mg  Sod.; 5g Fiber.

Comments:  You've probably eaten something like this in Indian restaurants -- flatbread stuffed with curried vegetables.  They can be made from scratch, with homemade dough, but they're just as good, and certainly much easier, made with store-bought flour tortillas.  The potato mixture doesn't take long to prepare, less than 30 minutes.  Serve alongside curries or as an appetizer with a savory yogurt dipping sauce, such as raita.

  2                     egg whites
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh herbs
                        = (such as basil, oregano and parsley)
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Coat baking sheet with cooking spray.  Slice tomatoes lengthwise.  Scrape out seeds with knife tip and discard seeds.  Lay tomato halves cut-side down on baking sheet.  Scatter onion slices and garlic among tomatoes; sprinkle with black pepper to taste.

Trim ends off eggplant and cut lengthwise into 8 slices.  Lightly coat second baking sheet with cooking spray.  Lay eggplant slices on sheet, overlapping slightly to fit.  Coat eggplant slices lightly with cooking spray.  Place both baking sheets in oven.  Roast until eggplant slices are soft, and tomatoes puff and start to brown, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, in medium bowl, mix spinach, ricotta or cottage cheese, egg whites and herbs.  When vegetables are done, remove from oven; reduce heat to 350 degrees.  With tongs, pull skins off tomatoes and discard skins.  Scrape tomatoes, onion, garlic and pan juices into food processor and process until a chunky sauce forms.

Spoon 1 cup sauce into bottom of 9- by 9-inch baking pan.  Place about 1/3 cup spinach-ricotta mixture on one eggplant slice; roll up from small end, and place seam-side down in baking pan.  Repeat with remaining slices, using all the filling.  Top eggplant rolls with remaining tomato sauce, and sprinkle with Parmesan.  Bake until cheese is melted and casserole is hot, about 25 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2               cups  canned fava beas -- drained, rinsed
  1              large  egg
  1                     onion -- peeled, diced
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
                        extra oil for frying
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        === GARNISH ===
  2        tablespoons  chopped Italian parsley
  1 1/2           cups  plain low-fat or regular yogurt
  1                     red pepper -- seeded, diced

Combine fava beans, egg, onion, garlic, 1 tablespoon olive oil, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon parsley in food processor.  Process until coarsely chopped and well combined.

Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium heat.  When hot, scoop 1/4 cup bean mixture into oil and repeat until skillet is full.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on one side, and when firm and slightly brown, turn over to cook other side.  Carefully remove from skillet and place on plates.  Repeat with remaining bean mixture until mixture is used up.

To serve, spoon generous scoops yogurt over each serving and sprinkle with parsley and diced red pepper.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  fettuccine
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  12            ounces  silken tofu
     1/2           cup  low-fat milk or soy milk
     1/3           cup  grated Parmesan cheese -- plus
                        additional for topping
  2               cups  cooked fresh corn kernels - (abt 3 ears)
                        = (or thawed, frozen corn)
  1                     fresh hot chile - (to 2) -- minced
                        = (or 4- to 7-oz can chopped
                        mild green chilies)
  1           teaspoon  salt

Bring large pot of water to a boil.  Add fettuccine, stirring to prevent sticking.  Cook fettuccine according to package directions, or until just tender.

Meanwhile, in small skillet, over low heat, melt butter.  Increase heat to medium, add garlic, and cook, stirring often, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and set aside; discard garlic.

In food processor, combine tofu, milk, 1/3 cup cheese and melted butter from skillet.  Process until smooth and creamy.

Drain fettuccine well and return to cooking pot.  Add tofu mixture and toss to coat, then stir in corn, chilies and salt.  Warm over low heat, stirring occasionally.  Season with freshly ground pepper and toss again.  Serve hot, passing additional Parmesan to sprinkle on top.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Make this delectable recipe even more tempting by using a box of green and white fettuccine.  If using fresh corn on the cob, quickly cook them by placing ears of corn in a covered casserole with a small amount of water and microwave on high for 10 minutes.  Serve with fresh bread and sautÈed zucchini.

Comments:  Make this delectable recipe even more tempting by using a box of green and white fettuccine.  If using fresh corn on the cob, quickly cook them by placing ears of corn in a covered casserole with a small amount of water and microwave on high for 10 minutes.  Serve with fresh bread and sautÈed zucchini.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  russet baking potatoes -- baked, cooled
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil - (to 3)
  1                cup  finely-chopped onion
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika or mild chili powder
     1/2           cup  prepared salsa
     1/3           cup  low-fat sour cream
     1/4           cup  sliced pickled jalapeÒo peppers - (to 1/3) -- drained
  1                cup  grated pepper Jack cheese - (to 1 1/2)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Cut potatoes into large, bite-size pieces, and set aside.

In large, ovenproof skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat.  Add onion, and cook, stirring often, until softened, 5 minutes.  Add remaining oil and potatoes, and cook, stirring often, until heated through, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt to taste.  Sprinkle with paprika and cook, stirring often, 1 minute.  Remove pan from heat.

Spoon salsa, then sour cream, over potatoes.  Sprinkle with jalapeÒos and cheese.  Bake potatoes in skillet until cheese is melted, 5 to 7 minutes.  Serve right from skillet.

Comments:  If you don't care for the heat of pickled jalapeÒos, substitute any kind of finely chopped pepper you like.  You can remove as much of the skins as you like just before slicing the potatoes.  Bake the potatoes the evening before you need them.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STARTER ===
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  yeast
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  1                cup  warm water
                        === DOUGH ===
  1                cup  semolina
  5               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh herbs
                        = (such as parsley, thyme, rosemary,
                        and oregano)
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1                cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2               cups  water

For the Starter:   In bowl, stir all starter ingredients together.  Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 15 minutes, or until yeast activates and begins producing bubbles.

For the Dough:  Preheat convection oven to 400 degrees or standard oven to 500 degrees.  Grease two 12- by 17-inch sheet pans.

In mixer with dough hook, mix semolina, flour, herbs, garlic, Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.  Add starter, and slowly drizzle in olive oil and water.

Knead for 5 minutes, or until dough forms ball.  Dough should be soft, but if not, add more water.  If too wet, sprinkle in more flour.  Divide dough in half.  If using only one sheet pan, freeze half the dough.

Pat dough out 1/2-inch thick onto greased sheet pan.  Set aside to proof for 2 to 3 hours.

Using fingers, make indentations in dough.  Set aside to rest for 30 minutes more.  Leave dough plain or sprinkle with additional olive oil, herbs and Parmesan cheese.

Bake for 7 to 8 minutes.  Bread is done when crust is golden.  Cool before slicing.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/4           cup  vegetable broth
  3         tablespoon  mirin
  2         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2         tablespoon  red miso

  4              large  firm -- ripe bananas
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Coat waffle iron with cooking spray and preheat.

In small bowl, beat egg whites until they make soft peaks.  Gently fold into batter.

Ladle 2/3 cup batter (or amount recommended by manufacturer's directions for your waffle iron) into waffle iron.  Close lid and cook until waffles are golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Gently open lid and remove waffle with fork.  Serve immediately or transfer to baking sheet and keep warm in oven.  Repeat with remaining batter, lightly coating iron with cooking spray each time.

While waffles cook, peel bananas and cut into 1/2-inch-thick rounds.  Transfer to medium bowl and toss with sugar and lemon juice.  Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Transfer bananas to skillet and cook, flipping occasionally, until heated through but still firm, 1 to 2 minutes.  Top each serving of waffles with 1/3 cup bananas.

This recipe yields 12 (4-inch) squares.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  quick-cooking brown rice
  1                can  black-eyed peas - (16 to 20 oz)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  2              large  onions -- chopped
  1             medium  garlic clove -- minced
  3             medium  tomatoes -- chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh basil
                        = (or 1 tbspn dried basil)
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        = (or 1/4 tspn dried thyme)

Cook rice according to package directions.  Meanwhile, drain black-eyed peas, reserving liquid.  Rinse peas under cold running water and set aside.

In large pot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onions, and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 12 minutes.  Add garlic, and cook, stirring often, until onions are golden, about 5 minutes.

Stir in tomatoes, basil, thyme and 1/4 cup water, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until tomatoes have softened, about 5 minutes.

Stir in rice and black-eyed peas until well combined.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Simmer until flavors have blended, 5 minutes.  If necessary, add a little reserved liquid from peas as needed to keep mixture somewhat moist.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian                      Waffles

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  yellow cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  1 1/2       teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  2             medium  jalapeÒo peppers -- seeded, minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              large  egg yolk
  2              large  egg whites

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Lightly coat waffle iron with cooking spray, and preheat.

In large bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal, sugar, cumin, baking soda and salt.

In medium bowl, whisk together buttermilk, jalapeÒo, cilantro, oil and egg yolk.  Add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture, whisking just until combined.

In small bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form.  Gently fold into batter.

Ladle 2/3 cup batter (or amount recommended by manufacturer's directions for your waffle iron) into waffle iron.  Close lid and cook until waffles are golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Gently open lid and remove waffle with fork.  Serve immediately or transfer to baking sheet and keep warm in oven.  Repeat with remaining batter, lightly coating iron with cooking spray each time.

This recipe yields 12 waffles.

Per Waffle: 104 Cal; 4g Prot; 2g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 17g Carb.; 19mg  Chol; 124mg  Sod.; 1g Fiber.

Comments:  This spicy cornbread-like waffle is delicious with soup or vegetarian chili.  For added corn flavor, sprinkle a few fresh or thawed corn kernels on top of the batter before closing the waffle iron.

  1 1/2      teaspoons  cumin powder
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  4        tablespoons  finely-chopped seeded jalapeÒo peppers
     1/3           cup  whole-wheat bread flour
  9                     pita breads - (6" to 7" dia) -- 1/2" sliced off to

  1                cup  finely-chopped red onion
  1 1/2           cups  dried chickpeas
  1                     bay leaf
  1                     strip kombu - (4" long)
  8                     dry-packed sun-dried tomato halves
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
                        additional for brushing
  1 1/2       teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped fresh mint
  2        tablespoons  tamari
                        = (or reduced-sodium soy sauce)
  1         tablespoon  grated lime or lemon peel

In large pot, combine chickpeas, bay leaf, kombu and 8 cups water.  Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and cook, uncovered, 25 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Let stand, covered, in water overnight.

In shallow bowl, combine tomatoes in boiling water to cover.  Let stand until softened, 20 minutes.  Drain, chop coarsely and set aside.

Drain soaked chickpeas, removing bay leaf and kombu (you can save kombu to use in soup, stew or other vegetable dish).  Transfer chickpeas to food processor.  Add 2 tablespoons oil, 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper and pulse until finely ground.  Add reserved tomatoes, parsley, mint, tamari and lime peel and pulse briefly to combine.  With rubber spatula, scrape mixture into large bowl and set aside.

In large nonstick skillet, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 6 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Stir in cumin, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, garlic and jalapeÒo and cook, stirring often, 5 minutes.  Add onion mixture to chickpea mixture.  Gradually stir in flour until well combined.  Using 1/2 cup for each and packing firmly, form mixture into 9 round patties.

Prepare a hot charcoal fire or preheat gas grill to high.  Place burgers on grill rack, brush with oil and cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side.  To serve, stuff each pita with shredded lettuce and a burger, then drizzle with Lime-Tahini Sauce.

This recipe yields 9 burgers.

Per Burger: 358 Cal; 14g Prot; 7g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 60g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 930mg  Sod.; 7g Fiber.

Comments:  Soaking the chickpeas overnight and then grinding them in a food processor makes them digestible without sacrificing their crunchy texture.  If you're in a hurry, though, they can be brought to a boil for several minutes, removed from the heat and soaked for an hour, or as time allows.

  1 1/2           cups  chickpeas -- soaked, drained
  1                     bay leaf
  1              pinch  saffron
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             medium  onions -- chopped - (2 cups)
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander

Remove beans from heat, stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and let stand 5 minutes.

Remove bay leaf.  Transfer half of soup to food processor or blender, and process until smooth.  Pour purÈe back into soup.  Add additional water, if necessary, to thin soup.  Add lemon juice and more salt if desired.  Stir in parsley.  Serve hot, garnished with extra parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 295 Cal; 13g Prot; 9g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 43g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 21mg  Sod.; 12g Fiber.

Comments:  This is a great soup to savor after spending a day skiing or building a snowman.  It's soothing and warming, rather than fiery hot.  Half the soup is pureed and half is left chunky to combine the best of both textures.  A pressure cooker makes this soup superfast and easy (see variation).

Variation:  To make this soup in a pressure cooker, heat oil in pressure cooker.  Add onions, and cook, stirring often, over medium-low heat until softened, about 7 minutes.  Add garlic, pepper flakes, cumin, coriander, ginger and cinnamon.  Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add chickpeas, bay leaf, saffron and 4 cups water.  Bring to a boil.  Lock lid in place, and bring to high pressure.  Cook over high pressure 25 minutes.  Let pressure come down naturally; remove lid, and add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.  Proceed with Step 3, above.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHORT PASTRY CRUST ===
     1/2           cup  unsweetened butter - (1 stick) -- softened
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
  1 3/4           cups  pastry flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === PEACH-TOMATO FILLING ===
  5 1/2           cups  sliced peeled peaches
  4               cups  seeded tomatoes sliced into strips
     1/4           cup  slivered almonds
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped prunes or dried apricots
                        Shredded zest of 1/2 lemon
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  3        tablespoons  potato starch - (to 3 1/2)
                        = (or tapioca starch)
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon or nutmeg
     1/8           cup  fresh lime juice
                        Sugar -- for garnish

To make Short Pastry Crust:  Combine butter and sugar in mixing bowl, and, using an electric mixer, beat until creamy.  Fold in flour, salt, egg and vanilla, and mix well.  Wrap in plastic or wax paper, and chill dough for 30 minutes.

To make Peach-Tomato Filling:  Combine peaches, tomatoes, almonds, prunes and lemon zest in mixing bowl.  Mix together sugar, potato starch and cinnamon, and stir into fruit mixture.  Add lime juice.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray deep 10-inch pie plate or small casserole or baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.  Pour mixture into prepared pie plate, and pat down with spatula.  Set aside.

Turn dough out onto work surface sprinkled with flour, and roll out.  Carefully place dough over pie filling.

Bake 40 to 45 minutes.  Remove from oven, and sprinkle sugar over top.  Serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 400 Cal; 6g Prot; 15g Total Fat (7 Sat. Fat); 65g Carb.; 55mg Chol; 160mg Sod.; 5g Fiber; 33g Sugar.

Comments:  The Pennsylvania Dutch have been cooking peaches and tomatoes together since the 1850s, enjoying the many varieties of available tomatoes, especially the yellow and orange ones.  The amount of sugar you use depends on the type and sweetness of the peaches, so you will want to adjust the sugar according to taste.  Some cooks put a cinnamon stick in the pie rather than using the ground spice.  The cinnamon stick flavors the pie without discoloring the peaches.  The Pennsylvania Dutch also make a dumpling-type dough for the top crust, which rises during baking and absorbs some of the juice.  But a short pastry crust works well too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  bulgur
  4                     whole-wheat pitas -- cut in half
  1           teaspoon  sweet curry powder
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced

  1 1/2           cups  red grapes -- halved
     1/2           cup  dried cranberries or golden raisins

Categories    : Vegetarian                      Waffles

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 2/3           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  poppy seeds
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1 1/3           cups  vanilla soy milk
                        = (or nonfat milk)
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  finely-grated lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1              large  egg yolk
  2              large  egg whites
  3               cups  frozen blueberries
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  powdered sugar -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Lightly coat waffle iron with cooking spray and preheat.

In large bowl, whisk together flour, poppy seeds, baking powder, baking soda and 1/4 teaspoon salt.

In medium bowl, whisk together soy milk, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, lemon zest, oil, vanilla and egg yolk.  Add milk mixture to flour mixture, whisking just until combined.

In small bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form.  Gently fold into batter.

Ladle 2/3 cup batter (or amount recommended by manufacturer's directions for your waffle iron) into waffle iron.  Close lid and cook until waffles are golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Gently open lid and remove waffle with fork.  Serve immediately or transfer to baking sheet and keep warm in oven.  Repeat with remaining batter, lightly coating iron with cooking spray each time.

While waffles cook, in medium saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups blueberries, remaining 2 tablespoon granulated sugar, 2 tablespoon water and lemon juice.  Bring to boil over medium heat and simmer until berries burst, about 7 minutes.  Stir in remaining 1 1/2 cups blueberries and heat until warmed through, about 4 minutes.  Top each serving of waffles with 1/4 cup blueberry sauce.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired.

This recipe yields 12 waffles.

Per Waffle: 163 Cal; 4g Prot; 4g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 30g Carb.; 18mg  Chol; 126mg  Sod.; 1g Fiber.

Comments:  For added drama, sprinkle this crunchy, lemon-scented waffle with powdered sugar to create a striking contrast with the bright magenta sauce.

Categories    : Dairy Free                      Egg Free
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              small  russet potatoes - (to medium) -- scrubbed
  1         tablespoon  grated onion - (to 2)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- plus more to taste
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme
                        = (or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme)
     1/4      teaspoon  celery seed or dried oregano
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

Place steamer basket in large saucepan with about 2 inches water.  Place potatoes in steamer basket, cover and bring to a boil.  Steam potatoes, covered, until tender, about 20 minutes.  (Potatoes can be just slightly firm at center.)  Cool thoroughly.  Then put potatoes in plastic bag and refrigerate several hours or overnight.

Using a box grater, grate potatoes, removing any large chunks of skin; place potatoes in large mixing bowl.  Add salt and other seasonings, tossing mixture lightly with your hands to mix.  Heat about 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in large skillet; cast-iron works best, but if you're adding Parmesan cheese, use a nonstick skillet.

Using about 1/2 cup grated potatoes each, form 3 or 4 patties, and place in skillet, leaving enough room between them to flip easily.  Press patties firmly with spatula to shape.  Cook over medium heat until nicely browned, flipping them once, 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Repeat with remaining mixture, adding more oil as necessary.  Place cooked patties in warm oven while making remaining patties.

This recipe yields 8 patties.

Per Serving: 124 Cal; 2g Prot; 5g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 19g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 151mg  Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Comments:  Although this version is suitable for vegans, you can add a little freshly grated Parmesan cheese to the potatoes and fry them in butter instead of oil.  Either way, they're delicious -- great for breakfast or dinner.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  finely-chopped onion
  4               cups  vegetable broth
  3               cups  diced peeled Yukon Gold potatoes
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  dried sage
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4             ounces  grated sharp cheddar cheese - (to 6)

In large saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat.  Add onion, and cook, stirring often, until softened, 7 minutes.  Add broth, potatoes and salt.  Increase heat, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to simmer potatoes gently, partially covered, until tender, 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove pan from heat.

Meanwhile, in small saucepan, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat.  Stir in flour, and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.  Whisk 1 cup of hot potato broth, a little at a time, into sauce.  Simmer another minute, and remove from heat.

Using slotted spoon, transfer cooked potatoes to potato ricer or food mill placed over medium mixing bowl.  (Or, transfer potatoes to medium bowl, and mash with potato masher.)  Rice potatoes, then stir back into broth along with sauce, sage and black pepper to taste.  Bring soup just to a boil, stirring, then remove from heat.  Stir in cheese, a little at a time, until melted.  Taste soup, adjusting seasonings if necessary.  Serve hot.

Per Serving: 324 Cal; 11g Prot; 19g Total Fat (11 Sat. Fat); 28g Carb.; 54mg  Chol; 709mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Use a potato ricer or food mill to mash the potatoes -- both of which leave the potatoes, and the soup, with a very fine, smooth texture.  Serve this with marinated vegetables and warm dinner rolls or crusty bread.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     garlic cloves
  1 1/2           cups  nonfat milk
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  2             pounds  potatoes
  6               cups  shredded cabbage - (to 8)
  3             medium  leeks, white and light green parts -- thinly sliced
  3               cups  cauliflower florets
  1         tablespoon  whole wheat flour
  6             slices  fat-free sharp Cheddar singles
  4                     green onions, white and light green parts -- thinly sliced
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika

In small saucepan, combine garlic, 1/2 cup milk and oil.  Cover, and simmer over medium-low heat until garlic is tender, about 20 minutes.  Remove from heat and set aside.

Meanwhile, put potatoes into large saucepan, and cover with cold water.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain, and set aside.

Lightly coat ovenproof casserole with cooking spray.  In large saucepan, combine 1/2 cup water with cabbage, leeks and cauliflower.  Cook over medium heat until water evaporates and vegetables are crisp-tender, about 15 minutes.  Sprinkle vegetables with flour and stir over low heat, 2 minutes.

Remove pan from heat.  Gradually add remaining 1 cup milk, stirring until well blended.  Return pan to heat, and stir until sauce thickens.  Add cheese slices, and stir until cheese is melted, and sauce is smooth.  Spoon cabbage-leek mixture into prepared casserole dish.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  When garlic is tender, squeeze cloves from their skins into milk-oil cooking liquid.  Pour liquid into potatoes; mash with fork, leaving skins and some lumps.  Mash in green onion slices, and black pepper to taste.  Top cabbage-leek mixture with garlic mashed potatoes.  Sprinkle potatoes with paprika.  Bake until potatoes brown and filling is hot, about 25 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  thin asparagus -- bottoms trimmed,
                        and discarded, with 4" to 5" tips
                        remaining
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
  1           teaspoon  canola oil
  2             ounces  rice vermicelli
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        sliced into long strips 1/8" wide
  1                     Japanese cucumber -- peeled, and
                        sliced into long strips 1/8" wide
     1/2           cup  large fresh mint leaves
  1              small  red leaf lettuce head -- leaves separated,
                        and washed
  8                     round 8 1/2"-dia rice paper wrappers - -- (to 10)
                        Ginger Dipping Sauce -- (see recipe)

Bring saucepan of water and sea salt to a boil over high heat.  Blanch asparagus for 1 minute.  Remove asparagus from water, rinse under cold water and set aside.

Add oil to water and cook vermicelli about 2 minutes, or until tender.  Drain and rinse under cold water.  Leave noodles in cool water to prevent sticking together.

Just before wrapping, drain noodles and place on cookie sheet, loosely covered with damp paper towel.  Repeat with prepared vegetables, mint leaves and lettuce.

Fill large mixing bowl with very hot water.  Keep boiling water handy if temperature drops.

Dip rice paper wrapper into water for several seconds; these soften after moistening.  Remove from water and lay flat on work surface.  Place 2 mint leaves on bottom half of wrapper.  Layer small lettuce leaf, 2 asparagus spears and pieces of cucumber and carrot on top of mint.  Top with 1 tablespoon of the noodles.

Start rolling wrapper up tightly, folding right and left sides in over filling after first roll.  Continue rolling rice paper and pressing in ingredients, keeping edges folded in, until packet is complete.  Repeat procedure with rice papers until you have used up filling.

Cut each roll in half, arrange attractively on platter and pass with Ginger Dipping Sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Look for rice vermicelli and rice paper wrappers at Asian markets or specialty food stores.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               ears  sweet corn
                        Olive oil -- for brushing plus
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  diced onion
  1 1/2         pounds  tomatoes -- diced
  1                cup  diced green bell pepper
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  1           teaspoon  hot smoked paprika
  1           teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper to taste

Husk corn, and roast ears on grill or under broiler, brushing with olive oil.  Turn occasionally so ears do not scorch.  Continue to roast corn until it begins to turn golden brown on at least two sides and all kernels are thoroughly hot.  Remove from heat, and pare kernels into large bowl.

Add onion, tomatoes, green pepper, garlic, olive oil, lime juice and smoked paprika.  Combine ingredients, and season with salt and black pepper.  Let stand at room temperature about 15 minutes so flavors blend, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Per Serving: 310 Cal; 4g Prot; 22g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 28g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 400mg Sod.; 5g Fiber; 11g Sugar.

Comments:  Most salsas come to the table laden with cilantro or cumin to or both to but many people do not like the flavors of these strong-tasting herbs.  This salsa solves that problem, relying on the rich, smoky flavor of the corn and the paprika.  Smoked paprika is made in Spain and in Latin America, and it's sold at Latino markets.

Husk corn, and roast ears on grill or under broiler, brushing with olive oil.  Turn occasionally so ears do not scorch.  Continue to roast corn until it begins to turn golden brown on at least two sides and all kernels are thoroughly hot.  Remove from heat, and pare kernels into large bowl.

Add onion, tomatoes, green pepper, garlic, olive oil, lime juice and smoked paprika.  Combine ingredients, and season with salt and black pepper.  Let stand at room temperature about 15 minutes so flavors blend, and serve immediately.

Comments:  Most salsas come to the table laden with cilantro or cumin to or both to but many people do not like the flavors of these strong-tasting herbs.  This salsa solves that problem, relying on the rich, smoky flavor of the corn and the paprika.  Smoked paprika is made in Spain and in Latin America, and it&apos;s sold at Latino markets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  red bell peppers
  2         tablespoon  olive oil
  2               cups  chopped leeks, white parts only - -- (4 to 5 leeks)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1             medium  boiling potato - (1/4 lb) -- peeled, and
                        cut into small cubes
  4 1/2           cups  low-sodium vegetable broth
  1           teaspoon  red wine vinegar
                        Basil Cream -- (see recipe)

To roast peppers:  Place peppers directly on grate over gas burner.  Turn heat to high, and cook until sides are blistered and charred, turning until peppers are black.  Place charred peppers in paper bag.  Seal bag, and let sit 15 to 20 minutes.

When peppers are cool enough to handle, remove charred skin, using a paring knife if necessary.

Alternatively, cut peppers in half, and remove stems, seeds and white membranes.  Place cut-side down on greased baking sheet.  Broil until evenly charred.  Remove from broiler, and proceed as above.

In large pot, heat oil over medium heat.  Add leeks and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Cook, stirring often, until softened, about 8 minutes.  Add garlic, pepper flakes and tomato paste, and cook, stirring often, 3 minutes.  Add roasted peppers, potato cubes and broth.  Cover, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, and simmer, partially covered, until potato cubes are tender, about 15 minutes.

Transfer soup to blender or food processor, and process until smooth.  Return soup to pot, add another 1/2 teaspoon of salt, a sprinkling of freshly ground pepper and vinegar.  Taste, and add more salt if desired.  Serve hot with dollop of Basil Cream swirled into soup.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh angel hair pasta
                        = (or 1/2 pound dried)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
  1              pound  zucchini -- diced
  1              pound  broccoli florets -- chopped
  2                     red peppers - (abt 1/2 lb) -- diced
  8             ounces  mushrooms -- sliced
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  shredded basil
     1/2           cup  chopped Italian or broad-leaf parsley
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese

Bring saucepan of water to a boil and cook pasta according to package directions.

Heat oil in skillet over medium heat.  Add onions and saute until wilted, about 10 minutes.  Add other vegetables and cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked but still firm, about 7 minutes more.  Add salt, pepper, basil and parsley and mix well.

Toss pasta and vegetables, top with grated cheese, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 530 Cal; 22g Prot; 16g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 80g Carb.; 85mg Chol; 310mg Sod.; 12g Fiber.

Wine Suggestion:  This summery pasta dish should pair well with Sauvignon Blanc.  California, the Loire Valley in France and the Marlborough region in New Zealand's South Island are areas that produce fantastic Sauvignon Blanc.  Try Villa Maria Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc.

Comments:  You can vary this recipe by using any number of seasonal vegetables, including cauliflower, green beans, peas, zucchini or yellow squash to even cucumber.  In place of the Parmesan cheese, stir in 8 ounces of chevre, or soft goat cheese, before adding basil and seasoning to taste.  Use any one of the spiral- or shell-shaped pastas in place of the angel hair.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  dried shaped pasta
                        = (such as campanelle or fusilli)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- or more as needed
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic - (to 2)
  8             ounces  sliced portobello mushrooms
  1              bunch  greens -- rinsed, trimmed
                        = (such as broccoli rabe, chard or
                        spinach)
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  4             ounces  gorgonzola - (or to taste) -- crumbled
  1 3/4           cups  artichoke hearts
                        Crushed red pepper to taste -- optional

Bring saucepan of water to a boil over high heat.  Add pasta, stirring well, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until al dente.  Remove from heat and drain, rinsing pasta under cold water.

Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium heat.  When hot, saute garlic and portobello mushroom slices for 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn slices over and continue cooking until softened.  Add more oil, as needed

Slice trimmed greens crosswise into 1-inch-wide pieces.  Add half bunch to skillet.  When it cooks down, add remaining greens and balsamic vinegar, stirring often.

Add pasta, crumbled gorgonzola and artichoke hearts, and continue stirring until cheese melts.  Remove from heat, season with crushed red pepper to taste, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Suggestion:  Cabernet Franc is a grape varietal often blended with Cabernet Sauvignon because it is usually lighter, less acidic and more herbaceous.  A good match here: Linden Vineyards Cabernet Franc.

  1                can  diced low-sodium tomatoes - (4 1/2 oz) -- drained
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
  1         tablespoon  vegetarian Worcestershire sauce

Make potato topping:  In large saucepan, combine potatoes with enough cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain well.

In large bowl, mash potatoes with 1 cup broth and mustard, and salt and pepper to taste.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bring small saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add carrots, and cook 2 minutes to blanch.  Drain, and set aside.

Coat large skillet with cooking spray, and set over low heat.  Add onion, and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes.  Add garlic, and cook 15 seconds.

Stir in lentils, blanched carrots, vegetable broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano and Worchestershire sauce.  Mix well.  Cook, stirring often, until flavors have blended, about 10 minutes.  Season with freshly ground pepper to taste.

Lightly coat 3-quart gratin dish or shallow casserole with cooking spray.  Spoon filling into prepared dish.  Top with dollops of mashed potatoes and cheese if desired.  (For an elegant look, pipe topping using a pastry bag fitted with star tip.)

Bake until heated through, 30 to 45 minutes.  Let stand 10 to 15 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

             Shiitake Pot Stickers With Sesame Dipping Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  dried shiitake mushrooms
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
     1/3           cup  minced leeks -- white and green
     1/3           cup  minced scallions -- white and green
  5                     canned water chestnuts -- minced
  2        tablespoons  tamari soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  3             ounces  pressed tofu
  24                    round wonton wrappers
                        Cornstarch -- for dusting
                        Peanut oil -- for cooking
                        Sesame Dipping Sauce -- (see recipe)

Place dried mushrooms in medium-sized bowl and cover with 2 cups boiling water.  Let sit for 20 to 30 minutes, or until softened.  Drain and discard liquid.  Mince mushrooms.

Heat sesame oil in large skillet over medium heat.  Cook ginger for about 30 seconds, add mushrooms and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add leeks, scallions, water chestnuts, tamari soy sauce and rice wine.  Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.

Mince tofu in food processor.  Add to mushroom mixture.  Cool for 10 minutes.

Line cookie sheet with parchment paper and dust with cornstarch.  To assemble, place wrapper on work surface; keep unused wrappers under plastic wrap.  Put 2 to 3 tablespoons filling in middle.  Moisten edges of wrapper with water.  Fold wrapper in half over filling, pinching shut at center.  Starting on right side of sealed edge and working towards midpoint, pinch small pleats in wrapper edges.  Repeat from left side.  Put pot sticker on cookie sheet.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.  Dust each pot sticker with cornstarch.

Heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil in large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes.  Arrange 8 pot stickers, pleat-side up, in skillet.  Cook 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or dark golden brown and crispy. Adjust heat.  Wipe pan out with paper toweling and repeat.

Serve immediately or place on cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, and cover loosely with foil.  Keep pot stickers warm in 200 degree oven.  Serve with Sesame Dipping Sauce.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

Commnts:  Use only pressed tofu, a product that is not water-packed, because it is very firm and dry to otherwise, the filling will be too wet.  Pressed tofu should be so firm that you can easily dice it or cut into thin strips.  Pressed tofu can be found in natural food stores and Asian markets, but if you cannot find it, use tempeh instead.  You can make the pot stickers ahead and flash-freeze them for several weeks, or dust with cornstarch, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for several hours.  Frozen pot stickers can be cooked after partial thawing.

Categories    : Dairy Free                      Egg Free
                Soups/Stews                     Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- finely chopped
     1/2        medium  green pepper -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1 1/2           cups  black beans -- soaked, drained
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)
                        = (preferably fire-roasted)
  2                     chipotle chiles in adobo sauce
  2        tablespoons  sherry
  3                     corn tortillas -- cut 1/4"-wide strips
     1/2                ripe avocado -- cut small dice
                        Lime Cream -- (see recipe)

In large pot, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat.  Add onion, celery and green pepper, and cook, stirring often, until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic, cumin and oregano, and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.

Add beans and 6 cups water.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, partially covered, until beans are tender, about 1 3/4 hours.  Add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.

With slotted spoon, transfer 1 cup beans to food processor or blender.  Add tomatoes and chipotles, and process until smooth.  Return mixture to pot.  Stir in sherry, increase heat and bring soup to a boil.  Reduce heat.  Simmer about 15 minutes to reduce liquid.

Meanwhile, in large nonstick skillet, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat.  Add tortilla strips in batches, and toss frequently and gently (for best results, use tongs) to brown evenly, about 3 minutes.  Adjust heat as necessary.  Remove to paper towels to blot excess oil.

Place tortilla strips, avocado and Lime Cream in separate small bowls.  Serve soup hot with garnishes along side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 270 Cal; 12g Prot; 8g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 39g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 193mg  Sod.; 10g Fiber.

Comments:  The deep red-brown of this soup makes it a color cousin to Mexican molÈ sauce.  It makes a dramatic presentation when topped with tortilla strips, avocado chunks and Lime Cream.  Chipotle chiles packed in adobo sauce are available in most large supermarkets.  Any canned, diced tomatoes will work well, but the fire-roasted variety sends this soup over the top.

Variation:  To make this soup in a pressure cooker, heat 1 tablespoon oil in pressure cooker.  Add onion, celery and green pepper.  Cook, stirring often, over medium-low heat until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic, cumin and oregano, and cook another few minutes, until fragrant.  Add beans and 4 cups water, and cover.  Bring to a boil, lock lid into place, and bring to high pressure.  Cook over high pressure 15 minutes.  Turn off heat, and let beans return to pressure naturally.  Remove lid, and add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.  Proceed with Step 3, above.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  dried fettuccini or linguini
                        = (or 1 pound fresh)
  3         tablespoon  canola or sunflower oil
  2               cups  sugar snap peas in 1/2" pieces -- strings removed
  3               cups  arugula
  2                     red or green bell peppers -- diced
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring saucepan of water to a boil and cook pasta according to package directions.

Heat oil in skillet over medium heat.  Add vegetables and seasonings, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes, or until tender.

Toss with pasta, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 340 Cal; 9g Prot; 12g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 49g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 160mg Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Wine Suggestion:  This dish should pair nicely with a wine that is somewhat light, not very woody and contains moderate acid.  A Chablis, such as the Bernard Legland Chablis Premier Cru Montmains, makes perfect sense to accompany this Ayurvedic pasta dish.

Comments:  Try soba or buckwheat noodles in place of the fettuccini or linguini.  For variety, try spinach instead of arugula, and peas or green beans for the snap peas.  This lends itself to a basket of piping hot biscuits or Italian focaccia bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     leek, greens included -- roughly chopped
  1             medium  onion -- peeled, and
                        cut into large dice
  1                     carrot -- peeled, chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped
  8                     dried shiitake mushrooms
  2                     lemongrass stalks -- cut 4" pieces
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (2" long) -- unpeeled, and
                        cut into 6 pieces
  4                     garlic cloves -- unpeeled, and
                        cut in halves
  2                     jalapeÒos -- cut in half
  1                     Handful cilantro stems
                        === GARNISHES ===
  2             ounces  rice stick noodles -- broken 3" pieces
  2        tablespoons  dark red miso
  4             ounces  firm silken tofu - (1/3 box) -- cut 1/4" dice
  1                     scallion, white and light green parts -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  watercress - (1/2 bunch) -- heavy stems removed
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  cilantro leaves
                        === OPTIONAL ===
  1              small  chile -- cut very thin rings
                        = (such as Thai bird or serrano, or small
                        jalapeÒo)

In stockpot or large saucepan, combine leeks, onion, carrot, celery, mushrooms, lemongrass, ginger, garlic, jalapeÒos, cilantro stems and 8 cups water.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, about 35 minutes.

Pour stock through a strainer set over a large bowl; discard solids.  You should have about 5 cups of stock.  If necessary, add water to measure 5 cups.  Pour stock back into pot, and reheat if necessary.

Bring medium saucepan of water to a boil.  Add rice noodles.  Let boil 1 minute, turn off heat, and let stand 10 minutes to soften.  Drain.

Remove 1/4 cup stock to small bowl; add miso, and stir until dissolved.  Add miso mixture, noodles, tofu, scallions and watercress to stock.  Stir in lime juice and cilantro leaves.  Serve hot with jalapeÒo rings floating on top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 86 Cal; 4g Prot; 1g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 16g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 409mg  Sod.; 1g Fiber.

Comments:  This is a bright, attractive twist on the usual miso soup.  It's light and energizing and fierce enough to drive away a cold.  Don't be intimidated by the long list of ingredients.  The stock takes only minutes to get in the pot, and the garnishes are simple.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  coconut milk
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  green curry paste
     1/2      teaspoon  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground turmeric
     1/4      teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  Bragg Liquid Aminos
  2          teaspoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil -- plus
                        extra for cooking
  1            package  frozen "chicken-style"
                        soy meat pieces - (7 oz) -- thawed
  10                    six-inch-long bamboo or
                        metal skewers - (to 12)
                        Fresh lime wedges
                        Spicy Peanut Sauce -- (see recipe)

Mix coconut milk, sugar, curry paste, curry powder, ground turmeric, ground coriander, Bragg Liquid Aminos, shallots, garlic and peanut oil in mixing bowl.  Add soy meat and marinate for at least 30 minutes, or as long as 2 hours.

Grill soy meat on lightly oiled indoor electric grill for about 3 minutes, or until browned.  Alternatively, sear soy meat in heavy skillet, lightly coated with peanut oil, over medium-high heat until each side is browned.  Drizzle with fresh lime juice.  Let cool for 1 minute and skewer.  Serve with Spicy Peanut Sauce.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Try some of the great-tasting, ready-to-use meatless soy products available in natural food or grocery stores.  You can also marinate and grill pressed tofu, seitan or even portobello mushrooms.  For small quantities, you can make these appetizers on a small indoor electric grill, but using a grill basket outdoors works too.

                        cut into 1/2" lengths
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh basil

Heat oil in wok or large, deep skillet over high heat.  Toss in garlic and chiles, and stir-fry 2 to 3 minute.  Add tofu, and stir-fry until tofu is heated through, about 2 minutes.

Add soy sauce and sugar, and mix well.  Add beans, and cook just until bright green, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add basil, and mix thoroughly.  Transfer to warm platter and serve hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  dried soba noodles
  3        tablespoons  sesame seeds -- toasted
  1              pound  firm tofu -- drained, cubed
  4               cups  spinach - (firmly packed) -- rinsed, shredded
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        === TERIYAKI DRESSING ===
     1/3           cup  low-sodium soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  sherry
     1/8           cup  granulated sugar -- or to taste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  grated fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic

Bring pot of water to a rolling boil and cook soba noodles according to package directions, or until tender.  Remove from heat, drain and rinse under cold water.  Set aside to drain completely.

Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in ungreased skillet until golden, stirring to prevent burning.  Remove from heat and set aside.

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in wok or large skillet over medium heat.  Stir-fry cubed tofu 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden.  Add spinach and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until wilted.

Divide noodles into four large soup bowls.  Top each portion with tofu and spinach.  Add dressing, toss and garnish with sesame seeds.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 410 Cal; 19g Prot; 15g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 56g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 1280mg Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Wine Suggestion:  The subtle flavors of the pasta dish provide a nice complement to the fruitiness of Pinot Noir.  Try the Stonelake Pinot Noir from Chile.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  ripe tomatoes
  1                     lemon
  2                     blood oranges
                        = (or regular oranges)
  2             pounds  sugar
                        === SPECIAL TOOLS ===
                        Preserving or stewing pan
                        Preserve jars

Dip tomatoes in boiling water long enough to loosen skins, about 1 minute.  Drain in colander, and remove skins.

Chop tomatoes, and place in large preserving pan.  Peel lemon and oranges, and reserve rinds.  Slice fruit, and remove seeds.  Chop fruit, and add to tomatoes.  Shred reserved rinds in food processor, or cut into thin shreds with sharp knife.  Add to tomatoes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Bring tomato mixture to a rolling boil over high heat, and cook 8 minutes.  Meanwhile, place sugar in pan, and set pan in oven 8 minutes.  Remove sugar from oven, and pour into tomatoes, stirring constantly until shredded rinds become transparent, about 15 minutes.

Pour marmalade into hot, sanitized preserve jars, and seal with screw-on lids by turning jars upside down 5 minutes before setting upright.  Let marmalade stand two weeks before using.

This recipe yields about 4 pints.

Per Serving: 30 Cal; 0g Prot; 0g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 8g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 0mg Sod.; 0g Fiber; 7g Sugar.

Comments:  Blood oranges add an unusual dimension to this old-fashioned jam, but you may use any type of orange.  This marmalade is particularly delicious spread on pound cake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        óEgg- & Dairy-free
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  2        tablespoons  flaxseeds
                        = (available at natural food stores)
     1/2           cup  pitted dates -- soaked in
  1                cup  hot water -- for 30 minutes
  6             ounces  extra-firm silken tofu
  1                cup  pure maple syrup
                        = (or other natural liquid sweetener)
  1         tablespoon  corn oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === FROSTING ===
  1                cup  semisweet chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  raw cashews
  6             ounces  extra-firm silken tofu
     1/4           cup  pure maple syrup
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease two 9-inch round cake pans and coat with flour, tapping out excess flour.

In large bowl, mix flour, cocoa, baking powder and baking soda.

In food processor or blender, grind flaxseeds to fine powder.  Add 1/2 cup water and process until thick and frothy, about 30 seconds.  Add dates and their soaking liquid, tofu, maple syrup, oil and vanilla, and process until smooth.  Transfer mixture to large bowl.

Stir dry ingredients into wet ingredients, blending until smooth.  Divide the batter evenly between prepared pans.

Bake until cakes spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on wire rack 10 minutes; then invert onto wire racks, remove pans, and cool completely.

Make frosting:  In top of double-boiler set over simmering (not boiling) water, melt chocolate, stirring until smooth.  Remove from water and set aside.

In food processor or blender, finely grind cashews.  Add 1/3 cup water and blend until smooth.  Add tofu, maple syrup and vanilla, and process until smooth.  Add melted chocolate and process until smooth.  Transfer to medium bowl and refrigerate until chilled.

To frost cake, spread about 2/3 cup frosting over top of one layer.  Cover with second layer and spread top and sides with remaining frosting.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  basmati rice
  1              pound  brussels sprouts -- trimmed, halved
  2         tablespoon  olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- halved
  4                     shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, sliced
     1/2                butternut squash -- seeded, cubed
  1                     carrot -- cut into matchsticks
  1                cup  canned garbanzo beans -- rinsed, drained
  1                cup  packed chopped kale
  1                cup  soy milk
     1/4           cup  tamari
     1/4           cup  nutritional yeast
                        Toasted pumpkin seeds -- for garnish

In medium saucepan, combine rice and 3 cups water.  Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer until water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.

In large saucepan fitted with steamer basket, bring 2 inches water to a boil, and steam brussels sprouts until bright green and still crisp, about 5 minutes.  Set aside to cool.

In large, heavy skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add garlic, mushrooms, squash and carrot, and cook, stirring often, until tender, 5 minutes.  Add beans and kale, and cook, stirring often, until kale is bright green, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add brussels sprouts, and reduce heat to medium-low.

In small bowl, mix soy milk, tamari and nutritional yeast.  Pour over vegetables in skillet, and cover.  Remove skillet from heat, and let stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Serve over basmati rice and garnish each serving with pumpkins seeds.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Per Serving: 450 Cal; 16g Prot; 8g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 83g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 997mg  Sod.; 12g Fiber.

Comments:  A simple lettuce, tomato and cucumber salad with low-fat dressing of your choice is a nice accompaniment.

Basmati rice has a delicious, nutty flavor.  Look for it in large supermarkets or natural food stores.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  fresh basil leaves - (loosely packed)
     1/2           cup  pine nuts or broken walnuts
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2         pound  dried whole-wheat pasta
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2         pound  asparagus -- cut 1/2" lengths
     1/2         pound  green beans -- cut 1/2" lengths

To make pesto, place fresh basil, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese and chopped garlic in blender or food processor.  With motor running, slowly add olive oil, adding more if needed, and puree.  When smooth, set aside.

Meanwhile, bring saucepan of water to a boil and cook pasta according to package directions.

Heat olive oil in skillet over medium-low heat and saute asparagus and beans, stirring occasionally, until cooked but not limp, about 10 minutes.  Add 1 cup pesto, stir thoroughly and cook until heated through.

Toss cooked pasta with vegetables and pesto, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 560 Cal; 16g Prot; 34g Total Fat (6 Sat. Fat); 51g Carb.; 5mg Chol; 130mg Sod.; 12g Fiber

Wine Suggestion:  When matching a wine with this dish, focus on the basil, nuts, cheese and garlic, which call for a Zinfandel, especially if using the zucchini variation.  Many California wineries make outstanding red Zinfandels to try Easton Wines Fiddletown Zinfandel.

Comments:  For variety, substitute one cup of yogurt for the pesto and sprinkle with chopped almonds or with toasted sesame seeds.  Substitute 1/2 pound cubed zucchini for either the asparagus or the beans.  The pesto recipe makes ample portions; refrigerate leftover pesto for another use.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lemon -- sliced
  1                     orange -- sliced
  1                     apple -- sliced
  1             bottle  Bonterra Chardonnay - (to 2)

                        Sugar -- to taste
                        Ice cubes -- as needed

Place sliced lemon, orange and apple in large pitcher and pour wine over top.  Stir in sugar to taste, and add plenty of ice cubes.  Let chill at least 10 minutes, preferably 30, before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  A refreshing summer cooler, this icy drink is so versatile that you can enhance it with many different fruits, including bananas, strawberries and kiwi, adding mint leaves as a final flourish.  For a less potent drink, dilute the wine with sparkling water.

Categories    : Casseroles                      Egg Free
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         ounces  mixture dried wild mushrooms
                        = (such as oyster mushrooms and porcini)
  1              quart  boiling water
  2              large  onions (1 1/2 pound) -- sliced
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter or olive oil
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1 1/2          pound  stale crusty country-style bread -- cut thick slices
                        = (preferably sourdough)
  3               cups  chopped tomatoes - (1 1/2 lbs)
  10            ounces  coarsely-grated Gruyere-style cheese
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh sage
     1/2           cup  grated sapsago cheese
                        = (or Parmesan cheese)
     1/2      teaspoon  caraway seeds -- (optional)

Place mushrooms in large heatproof container, and add boiling water.  Cover, and infuse 1 to 2 hours, or until mushrooms are tender.  Strain infusion, and reserve infusion liquid.  Coarsely chop mushrooms, and set aside in large bowl.

Place onions, butter and sugar in large skillet, cover and sweat over medium heat 10 minutes, or until onions are soft and beginning to caramelize on bottoms.  Add salt, and stir in flour to thicken.  Place onions in bowl, and deglaze skillet with about 1 cup mushroom infusion, whisking well.  Pour deglazing liquid into mushroom infusion.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Spray 2-quart casserole with nonstick cooking spray.

Layer bread in casserole.  Chop any remaining bread into small irregular pieces, and set aside.  Combine mushrooms and tomatoes, and cover bread layer with mixture.  Combine Gruyere cheese and sage, and scatter evenly over mushroom-tomato mixture.  Cover with chopped bread.  Spread onions over bread, and add mushroom infusion.  Pat smooth with back of wooden spoon.  Sprinkle sapsago cheese and caraway seeds, if using, over top.

Bake uncovered 45 to 55 minutes, or until set and crispy on top.  Serve hot directly from oven.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Per Serving: 430 Cal; 19g Prot; 17g Total Fat (17 Sat. Fat); 50g Carb.; 45mg Chol; 900mg Sod.; 4g Fiber; 7g Sugar.

Wine Suggestions:  The mushrooms, onions and cheeses pair well with earthy red varieties such as Pinot Noir and Syrah/Shiraz.  The tomatoes and cheeses pair with Red Zinfandel.  And a lighter style Cabernet will pick up on the mushrooms, sage and caraway.  Experiment!

Comments:  This warm-weather, one-pot meal is surprisingly light when fresh from the oven.  An earthenware casserole is best because the slow radiant heat creates a crust along the edges that is one of the tastiest parts of the dish.  Best eaten when just made, this dish will reheat well in a microwave oven.  Kids love it.

  2           packages  sliced fresh button mushrooms - (8 oz ea)
  5        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley -- plus
                        more for garnish
