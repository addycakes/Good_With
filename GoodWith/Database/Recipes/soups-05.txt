                 "Iceland Moss" Milk - {FjallagrasamjÛlk}

Recipe By     :Nanna RˆgnvaldardÛttir
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            handful  Iceland Moss (Cetraria islandica lichen)
  4               cups  milk
  1         tablespoon  sugar or brown sugar
                        Salt -- to taste

Wash the lichen carefully and drain.  Heat the milk to boiling point in a pan.  Add the lichen and sugar and simmer for 10 minutes.  Salt to taste and serve. 
Serve hot in small cups to 4 people. 
Comments:  This is the second only soup I've posted on the site without trying first -- not for lack of interest, but for lack of ingredients.  Again, many thanks for this traditional Icelandic recipe to Nanna RˆgnvaldardÛttir, author of Matar·st (or, Love of Food), her comprehensive cooking encyclopedia that includes 1,600 recipes and some 3,000 entries.  She says about this soup that it was made of "a staple of traditional Icelandic cuisine that is little used now -- Iceland moss, not a moss really, but a type of lichen that was much used in many kinds of dishes -- breads, soups, porridge, meat dishes, etc."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  1              pound  carrots -- scraped or scrubbed,
                        then trimmed
  1                     garlic clove
     1/8      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
  1              pinch  cayenne powder or hot sauce
                        Juice of 1 lemon
     1/8      teaspoon  sugar
  1               dash  orange flower water
                        Chopped parsley -- for garnish

Bring the stock to a boil in a medium saucepan and add the whole carrots with the garlic.  Reduce heat and simmer until tender.  Remove half the carrots and set aside. 
Puree the remaining carrots, garlic, and stock and return to the saucepan.  Stir in the cinnamon, cumin, paprika, and cayenne.  Slice the reserved carrots in very thin rounds and add to the soup. 
When you're ready to serve, stir in the lemon juice, sugar, and a dash of orange flower water.  Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with chopped parsley. 
Serve hot to 4 people. 
Comments:  Here's a thin but strong first course.  It's very Moorish and will go well with either hearty -- or bland -- meals.

  6               cups  chicken stock
  1              whole  chicken breast -- boned, skinned,
                        and halved
                        Grated zest of 1 lemon
     2/3           cup  long grain rice
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
  3                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh mint
                        (or 1 tspn dried mint)
  1           teaspoon  oregano -- rubbed into soup
                        between your palms
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated black pepper
                        Whipped yogurt -- for garnish

  2               cans  chopped clams - (8 oz ea)
  1                cup  dry white vermouth

Stir in mushrooms and eggplant and cook until just tender -- about 15 minutes.  Add zucchini and all seafood except the clams to the chowder (you can pour in the clam juice), then pour the vermouth over all.  Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. 
When ready to serve, gently stir in the clams, cayenne, salt, and pepper.  Ladle into bowls and top with a handful of croutons and parsley. 
Comments:  A pot of plenty, redolent of the Andorras -- serve hot as a meal to 8 to 10 people.

                           Beef Tea - {British}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  round steak, 1" thick
                        Water
                        Salt -- to taste

Broil the steak 2 minutes per side.  Then, right in the broiling pan, cut the steak into 1-inch squares -- and put the squares into a glass pint jar.  Be sure to scrape up the bottom of the pan with one of the squares and get every scrap of goodness into the jar.  Pour cold water over the meat to cover, then put the jar into a pot of cold water. 
The point here is not to cook, but to steep the meat.  Turn the heat to low and let the goodness leach out of the meat slowly, over the next two hours or so. 
When ready to serve, pour off the beef tea, salt slightly to taste, and serve warm, preferably on a tray with silver and linen napkins in a beautiful cup. 
This recipe yields 1 serving. 
Comments:  A horrible pain to make correctly...but no trouble at all when you've got a weak invalid on your hands and are anxious to "beef" him or her up.  Serve warm, in bed, to one sick chick.  Then sit back to watch the roses bloom in those pale cheeks.

                 Brazilian Winter Squash Soup - {Quibebe}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1                     tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     red chile - (to 2) -- seeded, chopped
  2             pounds  winter squash -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
                        (such as butternut or acorn; ideally
                        calabaza)
  4               cups  beef or vegetable stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
                        Finely-minced fresh parsley -- for garnish

Saute onions, tomato, garlic, and hot peppers in the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until the onion is softened and the mixture is thick -- about 15 minutes. 
Stir in the squash and the stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, stir in salt and sugar, then simmer, covered, for 20 minutes, or until the squash has disintegrated and thickened the soup.  This may take a little mashing -- but better to mash than overcook.  You want a nicely chunky texture. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and sprinkle a line of finely minced parsley across the top of each bowl surface. 
Comments:  Colorful, piquant, festive--definitely NOT your smooth, bland pumpkin/butternut ho-hum.  Serve this Bahian specialty hot as a substantial first course to 6 people.

                   Bulgarian Cucumber Soup - {Tarator}

Recipe By     :Kurt Masur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     cucumbers -- peeled, chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  4               cups  plain yoghurt
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  chopped dill
                        Toasted almond slices -- for garnish

In a blender, puree cucumber and garlic -- pulsing the blades to liquify the chopped cubes.  Toss in the dill, salt, water, and yoghurt and mix well.  Refrigerate at least 2 hours. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and sprinkle with toasted almonds. 
Serve cold as a first course to 4 to 6.  It's easy and fast to make and very low calorie. 
Comments:  Cold, sharp, and tart -- a superb summer first course that refreshes while it stimulates the palate.  This is a favorite recipe of Maestro Kurt Masur, brilliant conductor and music director of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.  Mr. Masur, a Silesian by birth (over the centuries, that's meant German, Polish, and Czech, depending on the year and torn history of central Europe), makes the soup himself, describing it as simple and delicious -- both of which are true.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  cellophane (bean thread) noodles -- soaked in cold water
                        for 15 minutes, then cut into 6" lengths
  6               cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped smoked ham
     1/2           cup  ground pork
  2        tablespoons  minced water chestnuts
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  minced green onions -- for garnish

Boil the stock in a large saucepan and stir in the soaked and cut cellophane noodles.  Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. 
Meanwhile, mix together the minced ham, pork, and water chestnuts with the cornstarch and soy sauce. 
Shape the meat into little balls and drop into the soup.  Continue cooking over moderate heat for another 15 minutes.  Taste.  If the broth is too concentrated, dilute with a little water. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and garnish with scallions.  Arm your guests with any tools they ask for and promise not to laugh as they slurp away 
Serve hot to 4 to 6 people as a first course. 
Comments:  A sloppy soup to eat, but fun and savory.  Those crazy cellophane noodles slip all over the place, no matter what you try -- the best strategy is a combination of spoon, chopsticks, and picking up the bowl and drinking it.

                        (or 4 tbspns olive oil)
  2               cups  sliced onions
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  flour
  5               cups  light vegetable or chicken stock
  1             medium  potato -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt
  1              pound  cauliflower -- broken into
                        flowerets and the rest chopped
  1           teaspoon  tumeric
     1/4           cup  chutney
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  diagonally-sliced green onion

Fry bacon until crisp, then remove, drain, and reserve.  Pour off all but about 3 tablespoons of the bacon fat and scrape up the bottom of the pan a bit, then add onion, garlic, curry, and cayenne and stir for about a minute.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for about 15 minutes, until the onions are soft.  Add the sugar, turn up the heat to high, and stir until the onions are brown -- about 5 minutes.  Stir in the flour and set aside. 
At the same time, bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan and add the potato and a teaspoon of salt.  Cover, reduce heat, and cook for 10 minutes.  Add the cauliflower and tumeric, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cover, cooking until the vegetables are very tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool a minute or two. 
Puree 3/4 of the cauliflower mixture with the chutney, then pour back into the pan with the remaining cauliflower mixture.  Stir in the onion mixture and bring to a simmer.  Simmer for 10 minutes.  At this point, you can hold it in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve it.  Just reheat when you're ready. 
When ready to serve, stir in the crumbled bacon, parsley, lemon juice, and the remaining 3/4 teaspoon of salt.  Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with the green onions.  Serve immediately. 
Serve hot to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  It's a hearty first course soup and tasting distinctively subcontinent Indian, except for the bacon....  Of course it's easy enough to substitute olive oil for a delicious vegetarian soup.

                 Chilean Cabbage Soup - {Sopa De Repollo}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  green cabbage - (abt 1 lb) -- finely shredded
  2             medium  potatoes -- peeled, sliced thin,
                        and cut into fingers
  1              large  leek -- washed, and
                        sliced finely
  4        tablespoons  butter
  6               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  coarsely-grated Muenster cheese

Melt the butter over medium heat in a Dutch oven.  When bubbly, stir in the cabbage, potatoes, and leeks -- tossing with a wooden spoon for about 4 to 5 minutes until the cabbage and leeks are wilted.  Pour in the stock, season to taste, bring to a boil, then reduce heat.  Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes, until the cabbage is tender. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and grate the cheese directly on top of each serving. 
Serve hot as a first course to 6 people -- or a light meal to four. 
Comments:  In flat soup bowls, this looks like a fingerpainting in delicate greens and pale yellows.  Eaten, it serves to stimulate appetites and prepare the palate for spicy foods.  It's also nice eaten up as a quick lunch or snack.

         Chilean Jerusalem Artichoke Soup - {Sopa De Topinambur}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  Jersualem artichokes (or "sunchokes")
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  4               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        === GARNISH ===
  1         tablespoon  minced cilantro or parsley -- (to 2 tbspns)

Peel the sunflower rhizomes and slice them thinly.  Put them in a medium saucepan with the onion and stock -- bring to a boil and simmer, covered, about 30 minutes. 
Puree in a blender, solids first, then pour back into the saucepan.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, stir in the cream, and reheat. 
When ready to serve, ladle into individual bowls.  Pour 2 tablespoons of cream in the middle of each bowl and swirl in a figure eight.  Top with minced cilantro or parsley. 
Serve to 4 people as a complex first course. 
Comments:  Unexpectedly delicate -- and deeply artichoke-like.  This unusual soup is good both hot and cold -- but particularly hot, I think, when cold winds are blowing and these sunchokes start showing up in the market.

           Chilled Avocado Soup - {Soupe D'Avocat Abidjanaise}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     ripe avocados
  4               cups  cold chicken or vegetable stock
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  plain yogurt
  2             dashes  Tabasco sauce - (hefty)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  4             slices  lime - (paper thin)
                        Tabasco sauce

Dump the avocado flesh into a blender and puree.  Add the stock and continue processing until smooth.  Blend in the lime juice, yogurt, Tabasco sauce, and salt and pepper.  Refrigerate for at least one hour. 
When ready to serve, spoon into bowls, top each with a thin lime slice, and sprinkle a bit of Tabasco sauce over each portion. 
Serve this to 4 people as a rich first course. 
Comments:  From The Ivory Coast, this thick, clean-tasting soup cries out "tropics" -- bright plumage with the bite of pepper and lime. 
Chances are you won't be able to find the creamy thin-skinned purple avocado varietals native to the Ivory Coast, but buttery Haas avocados are just as good.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  blueberries
  4               cups  water
  1              pinch  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  sour cream
  3        tablespoons  flour
     1/8      teaspoon  cinnamon

Boil 2 cups of blueberries in the water.  Stir in salt, cinnamon, and sugar.  Remove from heat. 
Whip flour into the sour cream, then whip both into the hot liquid.  When well blended, return the pot to the heat and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and stir until thickened. 
Remove from heat, stir in another 1/2 cup of blueberries, and chill in refrigerator. 
When ready to serve, stir in the remaining 1/2 cup of blueberries and ladle into bowls. 
Serve cold to 4 to 6 as a first course. 
Comments:  Marvelous, rich, and on the tart side, this soup is truly refreshing -- a great first course for light luncheons, picnics, or for an aromatic alfresco dinner of grilled meats in the summertime.

Whip flour into the sour cream, then whip both into the hot liquid.  When well blended, return the pot to the heat and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and stir until thickened. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from heat, stir in another 1/2 cup of blueberries, and chill in refrigerator. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, stir in the remaining 1/2 cup of blueberries and ladle into bowls. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve cold to 4 to 6 as a first course. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Marvelous, rich, and on the tart side, this soup is truly refreshing -- a great first course for light luncheons, picnics, or for an aromatic alfresco dinner of grilled meats in the summertime.

                        Chinese Hot And Sour Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  lean pork -- cut into 1/4" cubes
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  brandy
  10                    dried black Chinese mushrooms
     1/4           cup  cornstarch -- mixed with
     1/4           cup  water
  8               cups  pork or chicken stock -- (less the amount
                        of the reserved mushroom liquid)
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  4        tablespoons  rice or white wine vinegar
  2              small  hot chili peppers (like Thai bird peppers) -- seeded, and
                        sliced into thin circles (or 1 jalapeÒo)
                        or
                        more if you like to break out in
                        a sweat on the back of your head
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  diced peeled taro or potato
  1             square  bean curd (tofu) -- sliced 1/4" cubes
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  2                     green onions -- sliced thin
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
                        Finely-chopped fresh cilantro
                        or green onion -- for garnish

Marinate the pork in the soy, brandy, and cornstarch at room temperature for at least 15 minutes. 
Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover for 20 minutes.  Remove the mushrooms, reserving liquid, and slice into thin strips.  Discard any woody stems. 
Mix mushroom liquid and stock in a large saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add soy sauce, vinegar, pepper, chili peppers, and salt -- then blend in the cornstarch-water mixture and bring to a boil, so that it thickens.  Add the pork, reduce heat, and simmer for about 30 minutes. 
Add cubed taro or potato, the mushroom slices, and the cubes of bean curd.  Cook 20 more minutes. 
When ready to serve, keep at a simmer and slowly dribble in the beaten eggs.  Don't stir; you don't want it to glop up in big pieces.  When the egg strands float to the top, stir in the sesame oil and sliced green onions and serve immediately, ladling into bowls and garnishing with the cilantro or more green onions. 
Serve hot to 6 people...at your own risk. 
Comments:  This complex Chinese soup is just the thing for lunch on a cold day -- or for an appetite awakener for dinner.  Traditionally it was made with tree-ear fungi, dried tiger lily buds, winter bamboo shoots, fresh pork blood, bean curd, and eggs -- with the focus on dried products because these were most readily available during cold winter months when you didn't have many fresh products.  You can actually substitute seafood or fowl for the pork and any number of fresh vegetables, so long as you keep the hot pepper, vinegar, eggs, and bean curd.  In her poem "Chinese Food," Erica Jong described this soup as "hot as an adulterous love."

           Clear Russian Fish Soup With Lime And Dill - {Ukha}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  fish stock -- clarified
  1              pound  white fish fillets -- 6 serving pieces
                        (salmon fillets are also excellent)
  6             slices  lime - (paper thin)
  1         tablespoon  finely-cut fresh dill leaves

Bring stock to a boil in a large saucepan.  Lower in the fish fillets and reduce heat to low.  Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes -- until the fish is just opaque. 
Carefully lift the fish out and put into flat soup bowls.  Pour hot stock on top, squeeze a little lime juice into each bowl, float a thin lime slice on top, and sprinkle with dill.  Serve at once. 
A light, clean first course; serve this Russian soup hot to 6 people. 
Comments:  This soup was highly praised by Ivan the Terrible -- who wasn't easy to please -- and by Antoine Careme -- who was even harder to please, at least gastronomically.  As the oldest recorded Russian soup, ukha began life as any digestible food in a liquid, but by the 16th and 17th century lavish Russian courts, it was transformed into elaborate and diverse creations, served between pie courses.  It was in the 18th century that it became associated exclusively with fish -- and in the 19th century, under the influence of French cuisine, that it became the delicate creation that it is today.

                     Cock-A-Leekie Soup - {Scotland}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     leeks -- sliced half-moons
                        after cutting away roots, dark green
                        and  then washing
  1           teaspoon  salt
  5               cups  strong chicken stock
  3        tablespoons  butter (even better, chicken fat)
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring the stock to a boil, add leeks, then reduce heat and simmer for about 5 minutes.  Whisk in butter (or fat) and season.  Stir in cream at the end, ladle into bowls, and serve immediately. 
Serve hot to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  A fine and traditional Scots appetite stimulant to solid fare.  As early as 1598 Fynes Morrison recorded that it was served at a Knight's house with boiling fowl (thus the "cock") and prunes.  By the late 18th century, French statesman and gastronome Charles Maurice de Talleyrand opined that the prunes should be cooked with the soup but removed before serving.  Ultimately they were removed from the recipe altogether.  Sir Walter Scott in St. Ronan's Well cannot help exclaiming:  "Such were the cock-a-leekie and the savoury minced collops...."

        Colombian Avocado Vichyssoise - {Sopa De Aguacate Y Papas}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     leeks, white part only -- sliced thinly
  2             medium  potatoes -- peeled, sliced thin
  3               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     avocados -- mashed
                        Chopped chives or chopped cilantro -- for garnish

Heat stock in a medium saucepan and add leeks and potatoes.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.  Puree in blender, then return to the saucepan and stir in the heavy cream.  Puree avocado in blender. 
If serving hot, stir in the avocado just as you're ready to serve, as heat embitters the avocado. 
If serving cold, allow the stock to cool, then stir in avocado puree and refrigerate.  Serve both with minced chives or cilantro. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Incredibly rich and delicate as a first couse -- either hot or cold -- ideally before a fish course.

             Cool Hungarian Sour Cherry Soup  - {Meggy Leves}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cans  pitted sour cherries - (16 oz ea) -- undrained
  1                cup  sour cream ("lite" is fine)
     1/4           cup  superfine sugar -- (which you can
                        make in a blender or food processor)
     1/4           cup  tawny port or cream sherry
                        Just a spritz of sugar on top -- for garnish

Whisk the cherry juice, sour cream, sugar, and wine in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved.  Stir in the cherries.  Chill for 3 to 4 hours. 
When ready to serve, ladle into small bowls and just flick a little superfine sugar over each one.  Serve immediately with silver spoons. 
Serve cool to cold to 4 to 6 people in small portions.  But they may ask for another round.... 
Comments:  I had kinda put this one off for a while, thinking it was going to be offputtingly odd.  Not at all -- in fact, it was downright fresh and appealing -- and had me sneaking into the fridge for secret spoonsful.  Traditionally it's served as an appetizer -- and for good reason.  The tart-sweet-heady combination is just like an aperitif.  But I think it would be a wonderful minimilist dessert as well after a rich meal.  Marvelous with pork -- and a snap to make.

          Crab, Shrimp, And White Fungus Soup - {Sup Nam Trang}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         ounce  dried white fungus - (abt 1/4 cup)
  1           teaspoon  peanut oil
  1              large  shallot -- sliced thin
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                     hot chile -- seeded, sliced thin
     1/4         pound  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
     1/4         pound  cooked crab meat
  3               cups  Vietnamese or regular chicken stock -- simmered with
  1              piece  ginger - (1") -- crushed
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch - (generous) -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water
  1                     egg white -- lightly whisked
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  extra-finely chopped cilantro
                        Hot chile sauce -- for serving

Reconstitute the fungus in hot water for about 10 minutes (until soft and expanded), then chop coarsely after cutting away its hard knobs.  In a pinch, you can substitute tree ears, but that would shoot the color scheme. 
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, then sautÈ the shallot and white pepper for about a minute.  Stir in the shrimp and cook another minute, flipping after 30 seconds.  Add the stock, then stir in the crab and fungus.  Bring to a simmer, then thicken with the cornstarch liquid, stirring constantly. 
When ready to serve, pour in the egg white in a slow, steady stream, stirring slowly to form ribbons.  Remove from heat, season with salt and white pepper, and ladle into bowls. 
At the last minute, sprinkle with the finely minced cilantro -- which will open up the flavor of the soup -- and put on the table.  Pass the chili sauce separately. 
Serve hot to 4 people as a first course. 
Comments:  Don't be put off by the "white fungus" in this Vietnamese recipe.  I wish I could tell you what it is, besides very pretty and vegetable -- looking like delicate pieces of reef coral inside their hard plastic gift box ($3.99 for 8 ounces, Peony Mark Brand, which will make LOTS of the soup).  In any case, if you can assemble all the ingredients, this is really a lovely soup: white on white, except for the pink of the shrimp and the touches of green garnish -- but hot and spicy in some parts, crunchy in others, rich and chewy with the tang of the sea, all brought together under the light orchestration of the fine cilantro garnish.  It takes practically no time to prepare.

             Creamy Chestnut And Smoked Ham Soup - {Hungary}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  chestnuts -- pierce the shell,
                        simmer for 30 minutes, then peel
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/4         pound  smoked ham -- cut fine julienne
  2                     parsnips -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced on a diagonal
  2                     apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
  2                     leeks, white part only -- sliced thin rounds
  2          teaspoons  sweet Hungarian paprika
  5               cups  chicken stock
  1 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  2                     egg yolks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Chop the cooked chestnuts finely, in a food processor if possible, then set aside. 
Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat, then saute the ham, parsnips, carrots, apples, and leeks, stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes.  Mix in the chestnuts and paprika, then add stock.  Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook for about 20 minutes. 
When ready to serve, beat the egg yolks into the cream, then whisk into the soup.  Stir until the soup thickens, about 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper.  Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with more Hungarian paprika. 
Serve hot, as a meal, to 6 people. 
Comments:  This is enough to make winter worthwhile -- a Hungarian soup that takes away the chill and hunger in minutes.

         Creamy Leek And Mushroom Soup Laced With Stilton Cheese

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1              pound  leeks, white part only -- finely shredded
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- roughly chopped
  3               cups  vegetable stock
  1                cup  milk
     1/2         pound  potatoes -- peeled ,and
                        chopped into a small even dice
  3             ounces  Stilton cheese
                        === GARNISH ===
  4        tablespoons  horseradish -- mixed with
  1                     finely-chopped gherkin pickle -- into
  4        tablespoons  sour cream -- and chilled
                        Finely minced fresh parsley -- as a final topping

Melt butter in a large saucepan, then saute the leeks and mushrooms -- cooking gently for 10 minutes, stirring from time to time.  Add the vegetable stock, milk, and potatoes, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes, until the potatoes are tender. 
When ready to serve, crumble in the Stilton cheese and stir well for a minute or two.  Ladle into bowls.  Top each serving with a heaping spoonful of the pickle-horseradish cream and a fine mince of parsley. 
Serve hot to 4 people. 
Comments:  This British savory soup is just scrumptious, especially with the unexpected counterpoint of its cool, tart garnish.  Easy and fast to make, it's a perfect lunch or light supper on a raw, wet day...very much like a rich and filling tart, but more so.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2             pounds  onions -- thinly sliced
  4               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  3               cups  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === STILTON TOAST ===
  6             slices  French bread - (thick)
  2             ounces  Stilton cheese
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2             ounces  Cheddar cheese -- grated

Toast 6 thick slices of French bread in a 300 degree oven until crisp.  Blend the Stilton with a couple tablespoons of butter, then spread on the toast.  When ready to serve the soup, pop one of these on top of each serving bowl and sprinkle with lots of cheddar cheese. 
Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat.  Add onions, cover, and cook until translucent -- stirring occasionally -- for about 30 minutes.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. 
Add cream and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer to thicken slightly -- about 15 minutes.  Season generously with salt and pepper. 
Ladle into bowls, top with Stilton Toast, and run under the broiler until the cheese is melted and brown.  Serve immediately. 
Serve hot as lunch or light dinner (with accompaniments) to 6 people. 
Comments:  Absolutely sinful...and British to the bone.

            Cucumber And Mung Bean Soup - {Kheera Dal Shorva}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  yellow split mung beans
     1/8      teaspoon  tumeric
     3/4           cup  grated potatoes
     3/4           cup  thinly-sliced onions
  2               cups  grated cucumber
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/4           cup  peanut oil
     3/4      teaspoon  cumin seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro leaves

Wash and pick over the mung beans, then put in a large saucepan with the tumeric and 2 1/2 cups water.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for about 30 minutes -- until the beans are tender.  Stir occasionally. 
Puree coarsely, then measure and add enough hot water to make 5 cups of puree.  Add the potatoes, onions, cucumbers, and salt to the puree, and bring to a boil, stirring, over medium heat.  Reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes.  At this point, you can remove the soup from the heat and keep until you are ready to serve. 
When ready to serve, bring the soup to a simmer.  In a small pan, bring the oil to the smoking point, add the cumin and black pepper, and fry until the cumin turns dark brown -- a couple seconds.  Remove from heat quickly and pour into the soup.  Stir in the lemon juice and cilantro leaves and mix thoroughly.  Taste for seasoning, and serve hot, with a spray of whole cilantro leaves on top. 
Serve hot to 6 to 8 people. 
Comments:  It's an exotic first course; distinctively the subcontinent of India.

Puree coarsely, then measure and add enough hot water to make 5 cups of puree.  Add the potatoes, onions, cucumbers, and salt to the puree, and bring to a boil, stirring, over medium heat.  Reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes.  At this point, you can remove the soup from the heat and keep until you are ready to serve. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, bring the soup to a simmer.  In a small pan, bring the oil to the smoking point, add the cumin and black pepper, and fry until the cumin turns dark brown -- a couple seconds.  Remove from heat quickly and pour into the soup.  Stir in the lemon juice and cilantro leaves and mix thoroughly.  Taste for seasoning, and serve hot, with a spray of whole cilantro leaves on top. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve hot to 6 to 8 people. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  It&apos;s an exotic first course; distinctively the subcontinent of India.

          Curried Kumara Soup - {New Zealand Sweet Potato Soup}

Recipe By     :Kaylie Lewell
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  finely-minced ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  curry powder - (to 1 tspn)
  1              pound  kumara or sweet potato -- peeled, and
                        chopped into small pieces
  1                cup  vegetable stock
                        (also good with chicken stock)
  3               cups  milk - (about)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
     1/4           cup  cream or coconut milk
                        Minced cilantro or scallions

Saute the onion, garlic, ginger, and curry in the butter in a large saucepan on medium heat until the onion is transparent.  Toss in the chopped kumara and cook for 1 to 2 minutes without browning it.  Add the stock, cover, and cook for 10 minutes, until tender. 
Puree the soup, solids first, then begin to thin with the milk.  When pourable, return to the pan and continue adding milk until the soup is a good consistency. 
When ready to serve, reheat, then ladle into bowls.  Swirl a tablespoon full of cream or coconut milk into each bowl, and sprinkle a pinch of fresh minced cilantro or scallion on top. 
Serve hot to 4 to 6 as a "slightly sweet and very mouth watering" first course soup. 
Comments:  When I got this recipe from Kaylie Lewell in Whakatane, New Zealand, I had no idea what "kumara" was.  Turns out it is related to the sweet potato.  Kaylie says it is "a purple-looking root vegetable that, when peeled and cooked, is a yellow green colour...grown in New Zealand and an important part of the Maori (native New Zealanders) diet.  What it also is, is delicious -- and so is this soup.  Thanks, Kaylie!

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        = {PolÈvka Kapustov· S Uzen˝m Masem} =
     1/2                green cabbage
     1/2           cup  butter
  1                     onion -- chopped
     1/3           cup  flour
  5               cups  ham stock (chicken is fine)
  1            handful  dried mushrooms, morel preferably -- soaked in
  1                cup  hot water -- (reserve the
                        mushroom liquid)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  ham -- cut in small
                        bite-sized cubes

Boil the half head of cabbage in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, then drain it briefly and chop it finely. 
Melt the butter in a large saucepan, then toss in onions and sautÈ until soft, then stir in flour and brown, stirring attentively.  This always takes longer than you think, but it is worth the wait.  When well browned, pour the ham (or chicken) stock in all at once, whisking.  Add reserved mushroom liquid, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.  Add the rehydrated mushrooms, chopped, the cabbage, salt, and ham.  Simmer for a few minutes. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls. 
Serve hot to 4 as a hearty lunch with sliced dumplings and a big draft of pilsener on the side. 
Comments:  This one just cries out Czech -- hearty, thick, north European, smelling of the Sumava somehow.  Dream of Libuse and floating up the Moldau....

                    Danish Barley Soup - {Bygvandgr¯d}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  pearl barley -- rinsed cold water
  3               cups  beef or vegetable stock or water
  1                     onion -- diced
  3                     carrots -- diced
  2                     celery stalks with leaves -- diced
  5                     mushrooms -- diced
  3               cups  beef or vegetable stock or water
  4        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Sour cream - (thick) -- for garnish

Bring 3 cups of stock or water to a boil in a saucepan, add rinsed barley, then reduce heat and simmer for an hour, until tender. 
Bring the remaining 3 cups of stock or water to a boil in a large saucepan, add the onion, carrot, celery, and mushrooms, reduce heat, and simmer until tender -- from 30 to 45 minutes. 
When ready to serve, pour the barley-broth in to the vegetables, toss in the butter, salt and pepper to taste, and bring to a fast boil.  Ladle into bowls and swirl big spoonsful of sour cream into each serving.  Pass hunks of bread with lots of butter and cheese. 
Serve hot as a light meal or a substantial first course to 4 to 6 people, ideally with hunks of bread and lots of butter and cheese. 
Comments:  This is wonderfully filling, easy to make, pretty to look at, and nice going down.  It's the barley, of course -- such a nice consistency to that ancient cereal grain.  I like it with a dark, rich beef stock -- which highlighted the vegetable colors so well -- but a vegetable stock or even water is also good.  It's great with beer.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  pumpernickel bread
  3               cups  dark ale (preferably Danish hvidtol)
  1                cup  water
                        Grated rind and juice of 1 lemon
                        Sugar -- to taste
                        Whipping cream -- plain or whipped

Break the bread into small pieces.  Put them in a deep saucepan and pour in the ale, mixed with water.  Soak at least 3 hours, or overnight. 
When ready to serve, simmer the soup over low heat until it thickens.  Puree, stirring in the lemon rind and juice, and sweeten to taste. 
Return to the saucepan, bring to a boil, then serve immediately -- spooning on plain or whipped cream as a garnish. 
Serve this belly-calming soup hot to 6 people. 
Comments:  Excellent for those bad times when you're recovering from a bit of a hangover.  In medieval times, the Medical School of Salerno was already recommending the hair of the dog: 
Si nocturna tibi noceat potatio vini     Hoc tu mane bibas iterum, et fuerit medicina      or      If an evening of wine does you in,      More the next morning will be medicine.

  3                     celery stalks -- chopped
  1                     potato -- chopped
  1                     courgette (aka zucchini) -- chopped
  1            handful  parsley -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Microwave the chicken or chicken parts for 20 minutes.  Let cool briefly, then cut off the chicken meat, reserving it for another dish.  Plunge the bones, remnants, and jelly into a saucepan with the 6 cups of water, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and cook for 20 minutes.  Strain, and return broth to the saucepan. 
Bring the stock to a boil, then add leeks, celery, potato, parsley, and any other green veggies you might have on hand.  Boil on medium-low heat for about 30 minutes. 
When ready to serve, puree, season to taste, and ladle into bowls.  Mr. Lennox says it "goes down like a bomb!" 
Serve hot to 4 people. 
Comments:  This totally nutritious and deeply green soup was a contribution of Gordon Lennox, as deft in the kitchen as he is entertaining grandchildren.  The soup is so clean tasting, I could drink a gallon of it at a sitting -- and feel like I could leap tall buildings at a single bound afterward.  Mr. Lennox is a native of Catherington, UK.  He's served this to his grandchildren after cutting the grass...and led them to believe there was a connection.  "You're only teasing, Granpa!" they say -- and wolf it down.  It's delicious.

            Ethiopian Kidney Bean Soup - {Yeadengware Shorba}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  kidney beans -- soaked in
  4               cups  water -- overnight
                        (or two 15-oz cans kidney beans
                        drained and rinsed)
  6               cups  water
  1              small  leek -- chopped
  1              small  carrot -- peeled, chopped
  3               cups  vegetable or beef stock
                        salt -- to taste
  1              small  potato -- peeled, chopped
  2        tablespoons  pastina - (small soup pasta)
                        (or you can break up soup noodles)

Put soaked kidney beans in a large saucepan with 6 cups of water, bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for an hour or so, until they are done.  If you are using canned kidney beans, you can skip the step of simmering the beans for an hour. 
Add the leek, carrots, stock, and salt and cook for about 10 minutes.  Add the potatoes and pastina, bring quickly to a boil, then reduce heat and cook for 15 more minutes.  Serve hot with injera, if you can find it -- or with pita bread. 
Serve hot to 4 as a first course or, with traditional injera bread torn into it, as a light meal. 
Comments:  This soup is so simple and pure that it just seems right for a land as ancient as Ethiopia -- reputedly founded by the son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, ruled by the fabulous Prester John, and abandoned by Samuel Johnson's Rasselas, the Prince of Ethiopia.

                 Ethiopian Lentil Soup - {Yemisir Shorba}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  lentils
  4        tablespoons  Ethiopian spiced oil
                        (or regular cooking oil)
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
     1/4      teaspoon  mashed peeled ginger root
     1/4      teaspoon  mashed garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
  7               cups  water

Wash lentils thoroughly and let drain.  Heat the oil to low in a large saucepan and add the onion.  Saute at a low heat, stirring constantly, so that the onion doesn't turn color, but rather becomes transparent.  This takes some time -- 10 minutes or so. 
Add the mashed garlic and ginger and continue cooking on low for about 5 minutes.  Then add the lentils, turn the heat up just a little bit, and cook, stirring, for 5 more minutes. 
Add 7 cups of warm water, bring to a boil, then boil on medium heat for 20 to 25 minutes.  Season to taste with salt. 
Serve hot to 4 as a first course or, breaking injera into it, as a light lunch. 
Comments:  Ethiopia -- source of the Blue Nile -- ancient land founded by the progeny of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba around 1000 BC -- reputedly the fabulous land of Prester John -- and departure point for Rasselas, the Prince of Abyssinia, in Samuel Johnson's powerful and pessimistic philosophical novel of the same name.  It is no wonder that Ethiopia's foods are spicy, subtle, and deceptively simple. 
This everyday soup is aromatic, light, and nutty -- not at all the thick mush you would suppose.  It should be served with injera (a large fermented sour and spongy pancake), the traditional bread of Ethiopia which also serves as plate and eating utensils in most dishes.  And it is wonderful served with t'ej, Ethiopia's wonderful honey wine.  Failing these, serve with pita or other bread -- and with beer.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  beef -- trimmed of fat,
                        and cut into small cubes
  1                     ham bone or a few chunks of smoked ham
  3               cups  sauerkraut
  6               cups  beef stock
  2                     bay leaves
  10             whole  allspice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Dollops of sour cream -- for garnish

Place the beef cubes and ham bone in a large sauce pan with the sauerkraut, stock, and allspice.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for about 2 and 1/2 hours over medium-low heat.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Remove allspice berries and bay leaves. 
When ready to serve, ladle into big bowls, top with a spoonful of thick sour cream, and take to the table with chunks of rye bread and a bowl of sour cream to pass around the table. 
Serve hot to 4 people. 
Comments:  Okay, you won't like this soup if you don't like sauerkraut.  But if you DO, I think you'll like it a lot -- especially if you serve it as a main course with purakkaa on the side -- that's oval-shaped pastries made out of rye flour and stuffed with mashed potatoes or rice, or cheese, or meat, or fish.  Oh yes, and it's also nice to have sour rye bread on hand...and cheese...and cold cuts...and a big bowl of sour cream.  Yum.  Then it's off to the sauna and and a roll in the snow.

        Fresh Orange-Carrot Soup - {Hong Lo Bak Tchang Lang Tong}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1              pound  carrots -- coarsely chopped
     3/4           cup  sliced leeks, white part only
  1         tablespoon  fresh ginger root -- peeled, minced
  3               cups  chicken or vegetable stock
  1 1/2           cups  freshly-squeezed orange juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Leeks -- finely sliced,
                        and separated into circles

Heat the oil in a large saucepan, then saute carrots, leeks, and ginger until they are soft.  Add stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes, until vegetables are done. 
Puree, solids first, then return to pan and stir in orange juice.  Season to taste with salt -- remember to oversalt cold soups a little.  Refrigerate and chill. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and top with leek circles. 
Serve chilled in glass or pretty china bowls to 4 to 6 as a first course. 
Comments:  This delicate, tangy cold soup from Singapore is an excellent appetite stimulant for a summer meal of cold duck or chicken.

                        Frisian Mint-Zucchini Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  safflower or vegetable oil -- but not olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
  1              large  zucchini -- cut into 1/2" cubes
  2               cups  milk
                        Concentrated vegetable base that would
                        dilute to make 2 cups of stock -- but don't dilute it
  2           handfuls  fresh mint
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Mint leaves -- for garnish

Fry the onion in the oil until slightly golden.  Add the garlic and zucchini and stir-fry for about half a minute.  Make sure the vegetables don't brown lest the soup become bitter. 
Add just enough milk to cover the vegetables.  Bring to a boil, stir in the vegetable base, then reduce heat and simmer for about 5 minutes, until the zucchini is cooked but not quite well-done. 
Switch off the heat, stir in the mint, count to 5, then puree.  If it's too thick, add some more milk.  If it needs more of an edge, add some salt and/or pepper. 
Ladle into bowls and serve immediately, garnishing with a few young mint leaves. 
Serve hot to 2 to 3 people as a first course. 
Comments:  This marvelous recipe was sent to me by Jacqueline, a native of Frisia.  The soup is not nearly as unusual as you'd think, except in the best sense of the word.  Somehow the creamy, savoury base of the soup is a perfect counterpoint to the mint.  It is sustaining, inexpensive, easy to prepare, low in calories, and will truly make your reputation with your guests if you serve it at a dinner party.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  lamb on the bone
  8               cups  water
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  3                     celery stalks with leaves -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped parsley
     1/2           cup  rice
  3                     egg yolks -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1                cup  milk
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cut the lamb off the bone and chop it coarsely.  Put the meat, the bones, the onion, and the celery into a large saucepan and cover with the water.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer.  Skim any froth and discard.  Cover the pot and cook for about an hour. 
Stir in the rice and the parsley, cover, and cook for about 25 more minutes, until the rice is very tender.  Remove bones and discard. 
When ready to serve, whisk the egg yolks, cornstarch, and milk together until smooth, then whisk it slowly into the soup.  Let the soup cook, uncovered, for about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat, stir in the lemon juice, season with salt and pepper to taste, then ladle into bowls and serve immediately. 
Serve hot to 4 to 6 people.  It's also wonderful reheated -- so long as you reheat carefully and don't curdle it. 
Comments:  This soup is traditional and ritualistic; while a freshly slaughtered spring lamb is roasted for the main course of the Easter feast, this soup, which starts the meal, is supposed to be made out of the remaining parts -- the lungs, liver, heart, and intestines cook in a broth made from the lamb's head.  Well, this recipe just isn't that pure.  On the other hand, it really is lovely -- like a savory rice pudding with little bits of lamb and parsley and a lemony tang.  Just ignore the fact that you're using cornstarch to approximate the thickening you would have gotten from the entrails.  This is a soup that is all about the joy of redemption, the richness of Christian living in Mediterranean communities, and just plain good eating.

  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  2                     leeks, white part only -- thinly sliced
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  cured ham - (serrano or prosciutto) -- preferably one piece
     1/2         pound  dried white beans
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

  1                cup  fresh green beans -- snapped into halves
  1                cup  frozen green peas

In a medium (4- to 6- quart) soup pot over low heat, combine olive oil, onion, leeks and garlic.  Saute until onion has softened, about 10 minutes.  Add 9 cups of water, ham, white beans and salt and pepper to taste.  Simmer, covered, until beans are tender, about 2 1/2 hours.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe adapted from Hostal Burguete, Spain (as told by S.A. Belzer, Dining In/Dining Out section The New York Times, December 17, 1997) 
Mr. Belzer was kind enough to relate the background of this article and recipe -- itself a fascinating soup tale.  He had taken an autumn walking tour in the Pyrenees and Basque country that included a stop at the Hostal Burguete, famous as a stopover for "Papa" -- and also for his protagonist Jake Barnes -- where both were served "a big bowl of hot vegetable soup" (see below).  The group of 18 on the walking tour were distinctly divided on the subject of Hemingway.  In Mr. Belzer's words, most "were indifferent to Hemingway at best; some loathed him.  It was more a personal than a literary reaction, having to do with the male chauvinism, traces of racism and anti-Semitism in his work, and the mean-spiritedness of 'A Moveable Feast.'  I was his lone defender for what he did to change the writing of the novel in English -- and, yes, also because he was a newspaperman, and we newspaper people have a warm spot in our hearts for him as one of us."  On one subject, however, they were in agreement.  The vegetable soup was wonderful.  Out of this experience, his article in The New York Times was born. 
Recreating the soup, however, was the hard part.  The process by which the attached recipe was created not only testifies to The New York Times' meticulousness in research -- it also gives a wonderful insight into the inner workings of newspaper food sections: 
1.  A member of the staff, who owned a house in southern Spain, called the Hostal Burguete and, after a flurry of calls and faxes, obtained a simple list of ingredients and brief cooking instructions. 
2.  Another member of the staff took the ingredients to a friend who ran a Basque restaurant in New York City.  The restauranteur made comments and corrections, then provided quantities for the ingredients. 
3.  Finally, a cookbook writer-editor was tasked to whip the recipe into familiar shape and test it.  Result: it was good. 
And so the final story below and recipe above appeared on December 17, 1997, two months after the experience. 
Not since Ernest Hemingway discovered bullfighting has the Basque country of Spain been so much in the American eye as now, because of the opening there of the Guggenheim Museum.  The startling building in Bilbao, the Basque capital, has come to anchor like a great silver ship on the Nervion River.  It promises to attract more visitors to the region than did "The Sun Also Rises," Hemingway's 1926 novel about the fiesta of the bulls in Pamplona.... 
About 80 miles east of Bilbao, however, across Euskal Herria, as the Basques call their mountainous region, is Burguete, a town that has long depended on tourists and is eager for more.  There, the region's association with Hemingway lives on.  The novelist stopped at Burguete to fish for trout as part of his trip to the Feast of San Fermin in Pamplona in 1924.  And Jake Barnes, the narrator of "The Sun Also Rises," goes to Burguete with his friend Bill Gorton before the bullfights. 
They stay at an inn about 3,000 feet above sea level.  Though it's late June, the low-ceilinged, oak paneled dining room is cold.  Bill sits at a piano and plays to keep warm.  'The girl brought in a big bowl of hot vegetable soup and the wine,' Hemingway wrote.  'We had fried trout afterward and some sort of stew and a big bowl full of wild strawberries.' 
By that slender thread hangs the tourist trade of the Hostal Burguete, a converted farmhouse.  It serves a hearty country soup and trout with ham.  Visitors can see a piano into which someone has carved 'E. Heminway,' with a date in 1923.  One tour group that stopped there this fall had mixed feelings about Hemingway, but praised the soup unanimously.  To warm the cold winter nights ahead, here is the recipe for the soup with which a Basque town remembers an American writer.

Recipe adapted from Hostal Burguete, Spain (as told by S.A. Belzer, Dining In/Dining Out section The New York Times, December 17, 1997) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mr. Belzer was kind enough to relate the background of this article and recipe -- itself a fascinating soup tale.  He had taken an autumn walking tour in the Pyrenees and Basque country that included a stop at the Hostal Burguete, famous as a stopover for &quot;Papa&quot; -- and also for his protagonist Jake Barnes -- where both were served &quot;a big bowl of hot vegetable soup&quot; (see below).  The group of 18 on the walking tour were distinctly divided on the subject of Hemingway.  In Mr. Belzer&apos;s words, most &quot;were indifferent to Hemingway at best; some loathed him.  It was more a personal than a literary reaction, having to do with the male chauvinism, traces of racism and anti-Semitism in his work, and the mean-spiritedness of &apos;A Moveable Feast.&apos;  I was his lone defender for what he did to change the writing of the novel in English -- and, yes, also because he was a newspaperman, and we newspaper people have a warm spot in our hearts for him as one of us.&quot;  On one subject, however, they were in agreement.  The vegetable soup was wonderful.  Out of this experience, his article in The New York Times was born. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Recreating the soup, however, was the hard part.  The process by which the attached recipe was created not only testifies to The New York Times&apos; meticulousness in research -- it also gives a wonderful insight into the inner workings of newspaper food sections: 
</DirT>
<DirT>
1.  A member of the staff, who owned a house in southern Spain, called the Hostal Burguete and, after a flurry of calls and faxes, obtained a simple list of ingredients and brief cooking instructions. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
2.  Another member of the staff took the ingredients to a friend who ran a Basque restaurant in New York City.  The restauranteur made comments and corrections, then provided quantities for the ingredients. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
3.  Finally, a cookbook writer-editor was tasked to whip the recipe into familiar shape and test it.  Result: it was good. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
And so the final story below and recipe above appeared on December 17, 1997, two months after the experience. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Not since Ernest Hemingway discovered bullfighting has the Basque country of Spain been so much in the American eye as now, because of the opening there of the Guggenheim Museum.  The startling building in Bilbao, the Basque capital, has come to anchor like a great silver ship on the Nervion River.  It promises to attract more visitors to the region than did &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; Hemingway&apos;s 1926 novel about the fiesta of the bulls in Pamplona.... 
</DirT>
<DirT>
About 80 miles east of Bilbao, however, across Euskal Herria, as the Basques call their mountainous region, is Burguete, a town that has long depended on tourists and is eager for more.  There, the region&apos;s association with Hemingway lives on.  The novelist stopped at Burguete to fish for trout as part of his trip to the Feast of San Fermin in Pamplona in 1924.  And Jake Barnes, the narrator of &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; goes to Burguete with his friend Bill Gorton before the bullfights. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
They stay at an inn about 3,000 feet above sea level.  Though it&apos;s late June, the low-ceilinged, oak paneled dining room is cold.  Bill sits at a piano and plays to keep warm.  &apos;The girl brought in a big bowl of hot vegetable soup and the wine,&apos; Hemingway wrote.  &apos;We had fried trout afterward and some sort of stew and a big bowl full of wild strawberries.&apos; 
</DirT>
<DirT>
By that slender thread hangs the tourist trade of the Hostal Burguete, a converted farmhouse.  It serves a hearty country soup and trout with ham.  Visitors can see a piano into which someone has carved &apos;E. Heminway,&apos; with a date in 1923.  One tour group that stopped there this fall had mixed feelings about Hemingway, but praised the soup unanimously.  To warm the cold winter nights ahead, here is the recipe for the soup with which a Basque town remembers an American writer.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  rice
     3/4         pound  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        shells reserved for the broth
  3                     lemongrass stalks
  4               cups  water
  1                can  straw mushrooms - (15 oz) -- drained
  1              small  tomato -- peeled, and
                        cut into thin wedges
  1                     lime -- grated and juiced
                        === GARNISHES ===
  2                     green onions -- diagonally sliced
  1 1/2           cups  bean sprouts
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
  4        tablespoons  nuoc mam (fish sauce)
                        Chili oil or Vietnamese chili-garlic sauce -- to taste,
                        and more to pass separately

Prepare rice in a rice cooker or saucepan as directed, and reserve.  Ready the garnishes and set aside.  Cut the green lemongrass stalks from the white bulb and reserve.  Pound the tender inner heart of the bulb flat, mince finely, and set aside. 
Prepare the broth by bringing 4 cups of water to a boil with the shrimp shells, then adding the lemongrass stalks and removing from heat.  After a minute, strain out the shells and stalks. 
When ready to serve, add the mushrooms, lime juice and grated peel, minced lemongrass heart, and tomato to the broth.  Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium and simmer for about 5 minutes.  Add the shrimp and simmer for 2 more minutes. 
Pour into a tureen.  Stir in the garnishes.  Take to the table and serve at once, passing the rice and chili sauce separately. 
Serve hot to 6 people as a first course -- or to 2 as a main course. 
Comments:  Piquant and sour, this Vietnamese soup is an explosion of textures, colors, and shapes.  It will have you gasping for breath, wiping your eyes, and begging for more.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  lamb meat and bones
  2              small  rutabagas -- peeled, chopped
  4                     carrots -- peeled, chopped
  6                     green onions with green -- chopped
  1                cup  fresh or frozen broad beans
  2               cups  fresh or frozen green peas -- divided
  1             medium  cauliflower -- cut into florets
  1              small  lettuce head -- shredded
  2          teaspoons  chopped mint
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

In a large saucepan, cover the lamb and bones with salt water, bring to a boil -- skimming scum as necessary -- reduce heat, cover, and simmer for an hour.  Remove lamb and bones when done -- cut the meat into bite-sized pieces and reserve, discarding bones and gristle. 
Bring the stock to a boil and add the rutabaga, carrots, onions, beans, and 1 cup of peas.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 hours.  Add the cauliflower pieces, the reserved meat, the lettuce, the rest of the peas, mint, sugar, and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer for 30 minutes, until the cauliflower is tender. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and stir in the fresh parsley. 
Serve hot as a meal to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  In 1819, J. G. Lockheart observed about Hotch-Potch that it is, "Also called Hairst Bree, meaning harvest broth...a truly delicious soup, quite peculiar to Scotland."  Indeed, it was considered quite special to the Scots as it meant all fresh vegetables and freshly slaughtered meat at summer's end were packed into a light broth for a wonderfully fresh soup.  It's quite attractive, with white, bright orange, and dark green vegetable chunks, redolent of lamb and fresh herbs.  And it's substantial -- the very soul of comfort after a cold day on the highlands.

                  Hungarian Goulash Soup - {Gulyﬂsleves}

Recipe By     :Sandor Fenyvesi
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  beef chuck or other stew beef
  6        tablespoons  lard or other cooking fat
  2             medium  onions - (to 3)
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  cumin
  2        tablespoons  hot Hungarian paprika
                        (or mix with sweet Hungarian paprika
                        to your taste)
                        Salt -- to taste
  10              cups  beef stock
  4             medium  new potatoes - (Hungarian RÛzsaburgonya
                        or "pink potato") -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" square cubes
  2                     banana peppers -- chopped
                        (these are also called "Hungarian wax" -
                        use the sweet blunt or pointed piquant
                        ones, as you wish)
  2             medium  tomatoes -- peeled, chopped
                        (or a 15-oz can of tomatoes, seeded
                        and chopped)
  1              bunch  celery leaves -- tied in a bundle
                        with string
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Homemade pasta bits - (made from 1 egg
                        and about 3/4 cup flour)
                        Finely-chopped green onions

Prepare the meat by cutting away all fat and cubing it into small pieces -- about 1/2-inch square.  Set aside. 
Chop the onion finely and saute in hot lard in a Dutch oven until golden brown.  Stir in the crushed garlic.  Sprinkle with cumin and stir in. 
Remove the pot from the heat and let cool down.  Sprinkle on all the Hungarian paprika and stir in well -- then mix in the meat cubes and salt.  Return the pot to a medium heat and let roast, mixing from time to time and adding stock, if needed, to keep it from drying out.  When nicely roasted, moisten again, cover, and let stew. 
When the meat is soft, add the potato cubes, the chopped peppers, chopped tomatoes, and the remaining stock (add water to make a total of about 12 cups (3 litres) of soup) -- then plunge in the bundle of celery leaves.  Bring soup to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the vegetables and meat are tender. 
Prepare the pasta by kneading the flour into the beaten egg.  This is especially easy in a food processor.  The dough will be stiff.  Cover with plastic and let rest for at least an hour.  Knead again briefly, then roll into a pencil shape and cut into pea-size pieces.  Sprinkle with a little flour to keep from sticking. 
When 10 minutes away from serving, bring the soup to a boil.  Add the pasta pieces, reduce heat, cover partially, and leave alone for about 5 minutes or so.  Mix carefully.  Remove celery bundle.  Then ladle into bowls and top with finely chopped green onions.  As Mr. Fenyvesi says, "So easy to do, so tempting to the appetite!" 
As for this superb soup, serve as a meal to 8 people. 
Comments:  Talk about authentic!  Sandor Fenyvesi has translated his wife's marvelous recipe for Gulyﬂsleves into English and sent it in from Budapest.  Mr. Fenyvesi is an air traffic controller in Budapest Approach and uses professional English in his job.  He says, "the kitchen is my wife's empire, so I translate interesting recipes for her to try -- and if my family likes it, then we add it to our personal cookbook." Mr. Fenyvesi's own website can be found at www.nexus.hu/flashfy.

<DirS>
<DirT>
Prepare the meat by cutting away all fat and cubing it into small pieces -- about 1/2-inch square.  Set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Chop the onion finely and saute in hot lard in a Dutch oven until golden brown.  Stir in the crushed garlic.  Sprinkle with cumin and stir in. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the pot from the heat and let cool down.  Sprinkle on all the Hungarian paprika and stir in well -- then mix in the meat cubes and salt.  Return the pot to a medium heat and let roast, mixing from time to time and adding stock, if needed, to keep it from drying out.  When nicely roasted, moisten again, cover, and let stew. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the meat is soft, add the potato cubes, the chopped peppers, chopped tomatoes, and the remaining stock (add water to make a total of about 12 cups (3 litres) of soup) -- then plunge in the bundle of celery leaves.  Bring soup to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the vegetables and meat are tender. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare the pasta by kneading the flour into the beaten egg.  This is especially easy in a food processor.  The dough will be stiff.  Cover with plastic and let rest for at least an hour.  Knead again briefly, then roll into a pencil shape and cut into pea-size pieces.  Sprinkle with a little flour to keep from sticking. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When 10 minutes away from serving, bring the soup to a boil.  Add the pasta pieces, reduce heat, cover partially, and leave alone for about 5 minutes or so.  Mix carefully.  Remove celery bundle.  Then ladle into bowls and top with finely chopped green onions.  As Mr. Fenyvesi says, &quot;So easy to do, so tempting to the appetite!&quot; 
</DirT>
<DirT>
As for this superb soup, serve as a meal to 8 people.

               Indonesian Chicken-Peanut Soup - {Soto Ayam}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  molasses
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2                     garlic cloves -- pressed or mashed
     1/4           cup  peanut butter
     1/3           cup  peanuts -- chopped
  1                cup  slivered cooked chicken
     1/2           cup  sliced green onions in rounds
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Green onions -- sliced lengthwise
                        into thin strips

In a large saucepan, combine the stock, soy sauce, molasses, lemon juice, and garlic.  It seems like an awful combination at first, but it mellows together into a savory broth.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 15 minutes. 
Whisk in the peanut butter, then simmer for 5 more minutes. 
When ready to serve, stir in the peanuts, chicken, and scallions.  Heat through, then ladle into soup bowls and lattice the tops with scallion strips.  Serve immediately. 
Serve hot as a first course in small bowls to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  This earthy and complex soup brings to mind hot tropical suns and perfumed air.  It's exotic but pleasantly so -- and is a wonderful start to roast pork, broiled fish, or other plain fare.  Selamat makan! (or, "good eating").

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  rice sticks -- broken up
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  6                     shallots (or an onion) -- thinly sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (2") -- grated
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  tumeric
  2               cups  fish stock
  1                cup  coconut milk
  1                cup  shrimp -- cleaned, peeled,
                        and split
     1/2           cup  bean sprouts
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     scallions -- chopped for garnish

Break the rice sticks into a pan and cover with boiling water for 5 minutes -- then strain.  Reserve. 
Fry the shallots and garlic for a few minutes in the oil, then add the ginger, coriander, and tumeric.  Pour in the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. 
When ready to serve, add the rice sticks and the coconut milk and bring to a simmer for about 5 minutes.  (If you bring the coconut milk to a boil, you'll lose the coconut taste.)  Toss in the shrimp and bean sprouts and simmer for 5 more minutes.  Adjust the seasoning, ladle into bowls, and garnish with chopped scallions. 
Serve hot to 4 people. 
Comments:  What a taste treat -- great with a sandwich for lunch if you're not in the mood to go whole hog into an Indonesian feast.  And it's just as good, if not better with chicken and chicken stock.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  water
  1              pound  lamb shanks
                        (or other lesser cuts of lamb and bone)
     1/2           cup  yellow split peas
  1                cup  chopped onion
  3                     beets with green tops
     1/2           cup  rice
  1              bunch  scallions -- sliced well
                        down into the green
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
     1/2           cup  parsley
  2        tablespoons  pomegranate concentrate - (called
                        "molasses" or "paste") -- see * Note
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped cilantro
  2               cups  finely-chopped spinach
                        === GARNISH ===
  1         tablespoon  dried mint -- crumbled, mixed with
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon -- and also
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

* Note:  Or substitute  1 cup pomegranate juice made by rolling an uncut fresh pomegranate hard underfoot on the floor, then making an incision and "squeezing" it over a juicer. 
Bring the water to a boil in a large pot, then stir in the lamb, split peas, and onion.  Skim where necessary, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for an hour. 
In the meantime, wash the beet tops and spinach, slice finely and chop, wrap in paper towels, and crisp until needed.  Also peel the beets and chop into a small dice.  Also prepare the mint/cinnamon/pepper garnish in a separate bowl. 
When the lamb broth is ready, add the beets and rice and cook another 30 minutes. 
Pick out the lamb -- cut away the bones and fat, shred the meat, and return to the pot.  Add the scallions, 2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of lime juice, parsley, and either the pomegranate concentrate or the pomegranate juice.  Simmer for 10 minutes. 
When ready to serve, bring the soup to a boil and stir in the beet greens and spinach.  Let wilt, while stirring for a minute or two, then stir in cilantro, more lime juice, as needed, and seasonings.  Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with the mint/cinnamon/pepper topping. 
Serve hot as a meal to 6 people, with lots of bread on the side. 
Comments:  It sounds pretty weird -- and it's not as "pure pomegranate" as I was hoping -- but it does happen to be very, very good.

                            Irish Oyster Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  potatoes -- unpeeled
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/4         pound  salt pork -- diced
  4               cups  milk
  1                     bouquet garni - (a bay leaf
                        and green herbs tied together
                        or in a tea ball)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  36                    fresh shucked oysters -- juice reserved
                        Chopped parsley -- for garnish

Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water until just tender.  Meanwhile, bring the milk to a boil, remove from heat, dunk in the bouquet garni, and let infuse.  Then saute the diced salt pork in a little butter over low heat until it is just cooked through. 
When the potatoes are done, peel and mash, then whip in the hot herbed milk.  When the salt pork is tender, add the pieces, drained of their grease.  Season to taste.  Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then add the oysters with their liquid.  Simmer for a few minutes.  Taste for seasoning and stir in the rest of the butter. 
You can make a nice presentation from a tureen at the table -- or just ladle into bowls in the kitchen and serve at once, garnished with chopped parsley. 
Serve hot as a meal to 6 to 8 people. 
Comments:  This old recipe from Ballymoney in County Antrim is wonderfully rich -- and extravagant in its oysters, reflecting Ireland's generous use of the fabulous bivalve from as far back as mesolithic 5500 BC.  You can certainly get away with fewer -- say, a pint instead of a quart of shucked oysters.

                           Israeli Pumpkin Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4          teaspoons  olive oil
  2             pounds  pumpkin -- peeled, chopped
                        (or butternut or other winter squash)
  1                     onion -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled, chopped
  1              piece  chile pepper -- to taste, chopped
                        (a piece of orange habanero is as
                        wonderful as it is dangerous or add
                        a pinch of cayenne pepper with the stock)
  2              large  tomatoes -- peeled, chopped
                        (or 4 to 6 canned tomatoes)
  8               cups  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Slivered leftover chicken -- (optional)
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Paprika
                        Minced cilantro leaves

In a large soup pot, saute onion, garlic, and chile pepper in the olive oil on high heat until slightly browned.  Cut in the tomatoes and cook down for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add stock.  Bring to a boil, add pumpkin, then reduce heat and simmer for about an hour, until all solids are very soft. 
Puree, solids first, and return to soup pot.  If you have leftover chicken, sliver it and toss it into the pot now.  When ready to serve, reheat and ladle into bowls.  Garnish with a sprinkling of paprika and top with minced cilantro. 
Serve hot to 6 to 8 people. 
Comments:  This beautifully colored soup was suggested by Sharon Saunders of Jerusalem.  It's hearty, but not heavy -- a nice prelude to and stimulant for a richly flavored meat or chicken autumn meal.

        Japanese Clear Winter Vegetable Soup - {Suzuki No Suimono}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  dashi
     1/2         small  carrot -- notched lengthwise
                        with lemon zester so that thin slices
                        look like flower petals
     1/4           cup  matchsticks of daikon radish
  4             slices  sea bass or other firm fish -- cut exactly
                        into 1" by 1" squares
  8                     tiny lemon rind slivers -- white scraped away

Put salted water on the boil to cook the vegetables: first, the carrot flowers until just tender; then the daikon; finally the fish boxes.  Drain each by turn. 
When ready to serve, heat the dashi to a boil.  Set out the heated bowls and arrange the fish, carrot flowers, and daikon strips in them.  With a large ladle, carefully pour the dashi into each bowl and top with a few strips of lemon rind.  Serve immediately. 
Serve hot to 4 people in beautiful cups. 
Comments:  Wintry, yes; but subtly so.  Here the aromatics of dashi are given weight with a small slab of fish, a flower of carrot, and daikon sticks.  A bracing and stimulating prelude to a meal.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless lean beef
  8               cups  beef stock
  3        tablespoons  butter
  2                     onions -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  flour
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1                can  tomatoes - (16 oz) -- seeded, chopped
     1/4           cup  rice
     1/2      teaspoon  dried tarragon
     1/4      teaspoon  dried mint
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sweet Hungarian paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  ground fenugreek -- (in a pinch
                        use curry powder)
  2          teaspoons  tamarind paste -- diluted in hot stock
                        (can substitute 4 tbspns lemon juice)
  3                     garlic cloves -- pressed or minced
     1/4           cup  walnut pieces -- crushed
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh herbs - (any mixture of
                        tarragon, cilantro, basil, parsley, mint,
                        or dill)
                        === GARNISH ===
     3/4           cup  chopped fresh herbs - (any mixture of
                        tarragon, cilantro, basil, parsley, mint,
                        or dill)

Bring the meat, in one big piece, to a boil in the stock.  Skim off the foam as necessary.  Reduce heat and simmer, partly covered, for about 1 1/2 hours.  Remove and reserve the meat. 
When the meat has been cooking for an hour or so, melt the butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat, and stir in the onions.  Fry for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and colored. 
Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, for about a minute.  Add 1/2 cup stock and stir until smooth.  Stir in the tomato paste and the tomatoes.  Whisk in the rest of the stock, add the rice, and simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes. 
Add all the rest of the ingredients, except for the fresh herbs, and simmer them until the rice is tender -- another 10 to 15 minutes.  At this point, you can cut the meat into bite-sized pieces. 
When ready to serve, remove the soup from the heat, stir in the meat pieces and the 1/4 cup of fresh chopped herbs, cover, and let sit for 10 minutes.  Stir in the remaining herbs and ladle into bowls.  Serve with hearty bread and butter and a good Georgian red wine. 
Serve hot as a meal to 6 to 8 people. 
Comments:  This truly outstanding soup can single-handedly help you prepare for or recover from a blizzard, a grueling journey, any challenge you can imagine -- it is that rich and robust.  It has an unusual number of herbs and flavorings; these create an exotic but not offputting taste and texture.  I recommend it highly.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  rutabaga -- cut into 1/2" dice
     1/2         pound  small potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
     1/2         pound  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice

Nanna says: "Traditionally, fatty meat is used but many now prefer to remove most of the fat.  Place the meat and onion in a large pan and pour cold water over it.  Heat to boiling point, let boil rapidly for a few minutes, then skim.  Add dried vegetables and some salt and pepper and simmer for around 40 minutes. 
Add rutabagas, potatoes and carrots and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes more, or until all the vegetables are tender.  Season to taste.  The meat is either served in the soup or removed and served on a separate plate, but it is always eaten with the soup.  Some cut it up small, then add it back to the soup, others would eat it from a separate plate. 
Serve hot to 6 to 8 people as a substantial meal. 
"Other versions of the soup may add or substitute other vegetables, like cabbage, kale or turnips, and a fistful of oats or rice was sometimes added to thicken it somewhat, but this is the version I like best; simple, clear and thin but tasty." 
I also like the pure version, but tried the one with oatmeal too.  It's excellent -- very "stick to your ribs."  It's also good the next day -- and easy to pick the solid fat off after refrigeration. 
Comments:  This marvelous, authentic, and aromatic Icelandic soup is compliments of Nanna RˆgnvaldardÛttir, author of Matar·st (or, Love of Food), a 700-page compendium of some 1,600 recipes and 3,000 entries in the first ever Icelandic cooking encyclopedia.  This soup, which is taken from Matar·st, is -- according to Nanna -- what most Icelanders consider THE Icelandic soup, though she adds that "it is not really unique; Scottish and Welsh lamb soups are very similar and I've even got a Mongolian recipe for lamb soup (Guriltai Shul) that is remarkably similar, except the meat is briefly stir-fried in the beginning, but the vegetables are exactly the same."  That, of course, is a lesson in the transmigration of recipes.  The fact remains, it's a hearty, wholesome, protein-rich soup that looks positively festive in the bowl when the vegetables are cut into a same-size dice: like a white-yellow-orange confetti soup.

                 Latvian Potato-Wild Mushroom Soup - ...

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        = {Kartofelniy Sup S Gribami} =
  1              ounce  imported dried mushrooms -- rinsed, soaked in
  1                cup  warm water -- for an hour
                        (cepes/porcini are best, but
                        Asian mushrooms will also work)
  5               cups  water
  2          teaspoons  salt
  6                     russet potatoes -- peeled, cubed
  4             slices  bacon -- finely diced
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  sweet Hungarian paprika
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh dill -- for garnish

Filter the mushroom liquid to remove impurities, then add it, the rest of the water, and the mushrooms to a large soup pot, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Add salt, reduce heat, then simmer for 30 minutes.  Add the potatoes, raise heat to medium, and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.  Remove from heat. 
Fish out the mushrooms, let them cool for a minute, then chop them roughly and set to the side.  Fry the bacon crisp in a separate skillet, then drain.  Pour off all but a tablespoon of bacon grease -- and add the onion and mushrooms to it.  SautÈ over medium heat for about 15 minutes, until the mixture is nicely browned.  Stir the bacon back into it. 
Meanwhile, purÈe the potatoes with a cup of broth, then whisk the potatoes back into the pot, beating hard to remove any lumps.  When the bacon mixture is ready, bring the potato soup back to a simmer, add the cream, and let heat for several minutes, until the soup is about to boil.  Stir in the mushrooms, bacon, and onion, season with paprika and pepper and adjust for salt. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and garnish with fresh dill. 
Serve hot to 6 to 8 people. 
Comments:  Thick, rich, creamy, and laced with sweet paprika, crispy bacon, and pungent wild mushrooms.  Oh my.  It's really, really good.  It's a proper meal in itself, served with good bread and salad.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  lamb -- cubed
  1              pound  whole okra -- fresh or frozen
  1                     onion -- chopped
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2                     fresh tomatoes -- peeled, sliced
                        (or 4 to 6 canned tomatoes)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  allspice
     1/8      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  3               cups  water
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice

In a Dutch oven, lightly brown the meat and onion in the butter.  If you're using fresh okra, cut off their stems, add them to the pot, and fry gently for a few minutes.  Mix in the tomatoes and simmer for 5 minutes.  Season with salt, pepper, allspice, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.  Add tomato paste, then stir in water. 
Bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat, then simmer for at least an hour -- so the meat is very tender.  Add more water, if necessary. 
When you're 10 minutes away from serving, add the frozen okra (if you're using instead of the fresh).  Then, in a separate pan, crush the minced garlic with a little salt and fry it in a tablespoon of butter with the coriander until the garlic begins to smell sweet. 
When ready to serve, stir the garlic mixture and the lemon juice into the soup and ladle into bowls.  Garnish with chopped parsley. 
Comments:  So fragrant and rich -- a little mezza, a little pita, this bubbly stew is enough to make any 6 people completely full and happy.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  halibut steaks
  4               cups  water
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  2                     bay leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
  16                    prunes -- stoned, and
                        cut into 4 pieces each
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  flour
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon -- or to taste
  1         tablespoon  sugar

Bring the water to the boil in a pan with vinegar, bay leaves, and some salt.  Add the halibut and simmer at low heat until the fish is cooked through and just beginning to come off the bones.  Strain most of the stock into a clean pan, add prunes and bring to the boil, but leave half a cup or so in the pan with the fish and keep warm. 
Beat the softened butter into the flour, and whisk into the soup to thicken it.  Simmer for 5 to 8 minutes, then add lemon juice and sugar and season to taste.  Serve the fish on a separate plate but with the soup. 
Serve hot in small bowls to 4 with the rest of the meal -- there will be plenty of fish on the side for all. 
Comments:  This unusual soup recipe was suggested by Nanna RˆgnvaldardÛttir, author of Matar·st (or, Love of Food), an Icelandic cooking encyclopedia that was recently nominated for Iceland's Literary Prize.  Nanna notes, "Surprisingly, there are not many traditional Icelandic fish soups -- in fact, there is only one, but there are several versions; other types of fish may be used (for instance salmon or trout); sometimes it is thickened with a couple of egg yolks instead of flour, or with pearl sago.  Some rhubarb or raisins may be added, in addition to or instead of the prunes.  This is an old soup; several versions are in the first cookbook that was published in Icelandic (written in 1783-1784)."  The soup is tangy sweetsour, like the sea -- but with the soft rich warmth of plums, like the earth.  Outstanding in small portions.

Strain most of the stock into a clean pan, add prunes and bring to the boil, but leave half a cup or so in the pan with the fish and keep warm. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat the softened butter into the flour, and whisk into the soup to thicken it.  Simmer for 5 to 8 minutes, then add lemon juice and sugar and season to taste.  Serve the fish on a separate plate but with the soup. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve hot in small bowls to 4 with the rest of the meal -- there will be plenty of fish on the side for all.

Comments:  This unusual soup recipe was suggested by Nanna RˆgnvaldardÛttir, author of Matar·st (or, Love of Food), an Icelandic cooking encyclopedia that was recently nominated for Iceland&apos;s Literary Prize.  Nanna notes, &quot;Surprisingly, there are not many traditional Icelandic fish soups -- in fact, there is only one, but there are several versions; other types of fish may be used (for instance salmon or trout); sometimes it is thickened with a couple of egg yolks instead of flour, or with pearl sago.  Some rhubarb or raisins may be added, in addition to or instead of the prunes.  This is an old soup; several versions are in the first cookbook that was published in Icelandic (written in 1783-1784).&quot;  The soup is tangy sweetsour, like the sea -- but with the soft rich warmth of plums, like the earth.  Outstanding in small portions.

         Madeira Squid Stew - {Caldeirada De Lulas A Madeirense}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     onions -- coarsely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     bell peppers -- cut fine strips
                        (red, green, yellow, or any combination)
  2              small  hot peppers - (or to taste) -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ginger
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2                     fresh tomatoes - (or 4 to 6 canned) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  2             pounds  squid -- cleaned, and cut
                        into 1/4" slices, leave tentacles in
                        one piece if they're small enough
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  fish stock
  2                     potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into a julienne
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

In a large saucepan, heat the oil and saute the onions, garlic, and peppers for about 5 minutes.  Blend in the curry powder and ginger and stir for a minute or two.  Add the bay leaves, salt, and tomatoes, bring to a boil, then reduce to lowest heat and steam for 5 or more minutes.  Add the squid, wine, and stock.  Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to lowest heat, cover, and gently simmer for 30 minutes.  Only by very slow cooking will the squid be so tender.  Add the potatoes, keeping the heat at a bare simmer, and cook until the potatoes are fork tender -- about 30 more minutes. 
When ready to serve, ladle into flat soup plates, garnish with plenty of chopped parsley, and serve with lots of bread. 
Serve hot as a meal to 6, with lots of bread, a green salad, and strong red wine. 
Comments:  This Portuguese stew from the Madeira Islands is robust, spicy, and wonderfully tender, with just a hint of Portugal's early age of exploration to India, the Far East, and the Americas.  Also downright pretty to look at -- if you like the look of squid, that is.

                    Medieval Sowpys Dorry - {British}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     onions -- sliced thinly
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3               cups  dry white wine (dry vermouth is good)
  3               cups  water or stock (chicken especially good)
     1/3          cups  almonds -- ground
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  4             slices  bread - (to 6) -- toasted to a
                        dry hardness (one for each person)

Soak the ground almonds in 1 cup wine. 
Heat oil in a large saucepan, add onions, and cook over low heat for 20 minutes (onions will be golden and soft).  Add remaining wine and water, bring to a boil, cover pot, and let simmer for 20 minutes.  Pour in almond mixture, reboil, then turn down heat and simmer for 5 minutes. 
When ready to serve, put a slice of toasted bread -- or "sop" -- in each bowl, then ladle soup over.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 
Comments:  NOT just a curiosity, but a terrific and filling onion soup.  Maybe Chaucer's cook in The Canterbury Tales made it when he "boiled the chiknes with the marybones" -- but you too can make and serve it hot as a wonderful and aromatic luncheon meal.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  raw lamb or chicken
  2                     onions -- chopped small
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6               cups  water
  3             ounces  dried melokhia leaves -- crushed in hands
                        (or substitute spinach, chard, or beet
                        greens mixed with parsley)
  6              large  garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
                        === GARNISH ===
  3                     onions -- thinly sliced,
                        and soaked in
  2        tablespoons  vinegar

Boil the meat, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in 6 cups of water -- skimming, then simmering for 2 hours.  Remove the meat, chop fine, and reserve.  Strain the stock. 
Bring the stock back to a boil.  Crush the leaves between your hands into the stock, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes. 
Meanwhile, crush the remaining garlic with some salt, then fry it in the oil until it is golden.  Stir in the coriander and cayenne.  Set aside until the leaves are cooked. 
When ready to serve, return the meat to the pot, stir in the spices, and let simmer for a few minutes.  Ladle into bowls and serve immediately -- and pass the onions soaked in vinegar on the side. 
Serve hot to 4 to 6 people, if they like it. 
Comments:  Portrayed in Pharonic tomb paintings and still the staple of the Egyptian people, this soup is probably for curiosity seekers only.  Melokhia is a member of the mallow family, and it cooks up into something pretty slimy that, to a non-cognoscenti, looks a lot like the dark green of pond scum.  Worse, what you thought would be the saving grace of the cayenne only serves to give you a nasty bite in the back of the throat once you get a mouthful down -- and you're left, dazed, with bad breath.  As you can tell, not my favorite.  I was able to find the dried melokhia leaves at a local market.  Maybe I should have tried alternatives with fresh spinach, chard, or beet greens mixed with parsley.  Anyway, here it is for you brave ones out there.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  red beets -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/8" by 2" strips
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2                     fresh tomatoes -- peeled, chopped
                        (or 4 to 6 canned tomatoes)
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         quarts  beef stock
     1/2         pound  cabbage -- shredded
     1/4         pound  ham -- cut into cubes
  1              pound  leftover beef -- cut small chunks
  1            handful  parsley
  1                     bay leaf
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped fresh dill
                        Whipped sour cream

In a Dutch oven, saute the onions in butter for about 5 minutes.  Stir in the beets, then add vinegar, sugar, tomatoes, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and a few grindings of pepper.  Pour in 1/2 cup of the stock, cover, and simmer for an hour. 
Pour the rest of the stock into the soup, add the chopped cabbage, and bring to a boil.  Stir in the ham and beef, parsley and bay leaf, and simmer, partially covered for 30 minutes. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls, sprinkle with chopped fresh dill, and serve with a bowl of whipped sour cream. 
Comments:  A grand Russian soup of the people -- serve hot, as a meal or as a first course, to 6 to 8 people. 
Souptale:  Borscht was originally named after a weed -- the borshchevik -- a universal ingredient in the earliest days of soupmaking.  It was only later, in the 10th and 11th centuries, that peasants starting adding beetroot, when it was imported from from Europe into the Ukraine -- which then became the main beet-growing region in Russia.  In fact, the classic Russian borsch, as noted, is called "malorossisky borscht," from the Old Russian name for Ukraine.  While Ukrainians used their abundant beets for everyday soup, in the less fertile north borscht was a special treat only to be cooked for festivals.  Thus its great popularity with northern artists.  Alexander Pushkin and Nikolai Gogol were known to savor their borscht to the very last drop.

Souptale:  Borscht was originally named after a weed -- the borshchevik -- a universal ingredient in the earliest days of soupmaking.  It was only later, in the 10th and 11th centuries, that peasants starting adding beetroot, when it was imported from from Europe into the Ukraine -- which then became the main beet-growing region in Russia.  In fact, the classic Russian borsch, as noted, is called &quot;malorossisky borscht,&quot; from the Old Russian name for Ukraine.  While Ukrainians used their abundant beets for everyday soup, in the less fertile north borscht was a special treat only to be cooked for festivals.  Thus its great popularity with northern artists.  Alexander Pushkin and Nikolai Gogol were known to savor their borscht to the very last drop.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped leek or green onion
  1                     celery stalk with leaves -- finely chopped
  1                     carrot -- peel, chop fine
                        reserving 1" thick piece from bottom
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped parsley and cilantro -- (to 1 cup)
     1/2      teaspoon  fennel seed -- slightly crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  4               cups  vegetable or fish stock
     1/8      teaspoon  saffron -- heated til brittle
                        (or 1/4 tspn tumeric)
  1                can  peeled tomatoes - (28 oz) -- with juice
  2         tablespoon  white vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste

For garnish:  Cut lengthwise notches out of the reserved raw carrot piece to make a flower petal shape, then cut paper thin slices.  Set aside. 
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat, then saute leek, celery, carrot, and garlic until they are very tender -- about 12 minutes.  Mix in the parsley and cilantro, the fennel seed and sugar, then stir in the stock.  When hot, crush the brittle saffron (or tumeric) into the soup.  Cook at a medium boil for 15 minutes. 
Puree soup solids with the tomatoes.  Add tomato juice and stock.  Stir in vinegar and salt and either serve or refrigerate until cold.

Serve chilled to 6 people. 
Comments:  This cold soup soup is redolent of the Casbah -- vivifying after any hot and dusty enterprise.  Also good served hot.

  1                     chicken
     1/2           cup  parsley

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  warm vegetable or chicken stock
                        (in a pinch you can also use water)
     3/4           cup  fast-cook couscous
  5        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  saffron
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground aniseed
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped cilantro

Mix the stock, couscous, butter, salt and pepper, and saffron in a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Cook over medium heat for three minutes.  Stir in the aniseed and cilantro.  Serve immediately -- if you delay it will turn into a gloppy mess. 
Serve hot to 6 people. 
Comments:  This buttery and aromatic mideastern soup is both beautiful and palate-stimulating as a first course to plain, solid fare as well as to a Moroccan meal.  It's especially terrific on those occasions when unexpected guests arrive for dinner.  Why?  Because the couscous continues to expand in everyone's stomach, leaving a feeling of fullness and repletion.  And it's lightening fast to make.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  lamb -- cut small cubes
  1           teaspoon  tumeric
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ginger
  2        tablespoons  butter
     3/4           cup  chopped celery and leaves
  2                     onions -- chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped parsley and cilantro
  1                can  tomatoes - (32 oz) -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
     3/4           cup  lentils
  1                cup  chickpeas (canned are fine)
     1/4           cup  fine soup noodles
  2                     eggs -- beaten with the
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon

Put the lamb, spices, butter, celery, onion, and parsley/cilantro in a large soup pot and stir over a low heat for 5 minutes.  Add the tomato pieces, and continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes.  Salt lightly. 
Add the juice from the tomatoes, 7 cups of water, and the lentils.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, partially cover, and simmer for 2 hours. 
When ready to serve, add the chickpeas and noodles and cook for 5 minutes.  Then, with the soup at a steady simmer, stir the lemony eggs into the stock with a long wooden spoon.  Continue stirring slowly, to create long egg strands and to thicken the soup.  Season to taste.  ladle into bowls and dust with cinnamon. 
Serve hot to 8 people. 
Comments:  Quite possibly the best soup in the world.  By custom the dish to break the fast in Morocco during Ramadan, this thick, rich version is a meal in itself any other time for any body.  If they really like the tang of lemon, serve traditional little bowls of freshly squeezed lemon juice with demitasse spoons on the side.

Comments:  Quite possibly the best soup in the world.  By custom the dish to break the fast in Morocco during Ramadan, this thick, rich version is a meal in itself any other time for any body.  If they really like the tang of lemon, serve traditional little bowls of freshly squeezed lemon juice with demitasse spoons on the side.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter or olive oil
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
  1                     carrot -- peeled, chopped
  1              large  onion -- peeled, chopped
  1                     chile pepper -- seeded, deveined
                        (your choice; banana, poblano, jalapeÒo,
                        habanero, whatever you can stand)
  4               cups  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  lentils
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
     1/2           cup  coconut milk -- see * Note
                        (or use whipping
                        cream)
  1               cups  cooked rice, preferably basmati -- (to 2 cups)
     1/2           cup  shredded cooked chicken - (to 1 cup)
                        (you can cook raw chicken in the stock at
                        the start if you don't have leftover
                        chicken lying around)
     1/2           cup  tart raw apple -- chopped fine
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Extra cream or coconut milk
                        Minced cilantro or parsley

* Note:  If you can't find canned coconut milk in a Thai/Indian market or fancy supermarket you can make it.  Just pour some boiling water over fresh grated or packaged UNSWEETENED coconut.  Let it sit for about 5 minutes, then blend in a blender or food processor and strain as finely as you can, pressing the solids hard before throwing them out.  Add the coconut milk at the last possible minute because its distinctive flavor degrades quickly in high heat. 
Saute the celery, carrots, onion, and pepper in the butter at a low heat until the onion is translucent.  Pour in the stock, add the lentils (and chicken, if it's raw), and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. 
While the soup is simmering, get the rice cooked (if it isn't already); likewise with the chicken.  Then shred the chicken and chopped the apples finely.  You don't need to skin the apples. 
When the soup is done, puree, solids first, in a blender.  Return to pot. 
When ready to serve, bring the soup to a simmer and add the cocoanut milk or cream.  Take the pot to the table, as well as individual bowls of warm rice (heated in the microwave, if necessary), shredded chicken, finely chopped apple, cocoanut milk (or cream), and minced cilantro (or parsley). 
To serve, have big individual serving bowls at the ready.  Spoon rice into each bowl (flat soup bowls are nice here) -- then pile on a big spoonful of chicken and a spoonful of apple.  Ladle the soup on top, then drip cocoanut milk/cream into the center and swirl -- and sprinkling with fresh cilantro and parsley. 
Serve this one hot -- and with a lot of showmanship -- to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  Peggy Gurley and her Mom bullied me into coming up with a good Mulligatawny recipe, and now I'm glad they did.  Mulligatawny -- literally, "Pepper Water" -- is a substantial and deliciously complex meal in itself.  At the same time it poses its own mystery since soup is not a significant part of traditional Indian cuisine.  Rumor has it that the English adapted a traditional spiced pea and lentil Indian peasant dish to suit their own love of soup...and called it Indian.

                    Northwoods Mushroom-Wild Rice Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  uncooked wild rice
  1 1/2           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  1              pound  mushrooms, preferably wild ones,
                        or a mixture of wild and cultivated -- wiped, sliced thick
  3        tablespoons  flour
  4               cups  beef or vegetable stock
  1           teaspoon  paprika
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  Armagnac or cognac
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  Dijon-style mustard
                        Finely-minced green onions or parsley -- for garnish

Partially cook the wild rice in the water, bringing to a boil then reducing heat and simmering, covered, for 20 minutes. 
Meantime, melt the butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add the onion, and sautÈ until transparent.  Add the mushrooms, with a bit more butter if needed, and cook over high heat until the mushroom juices have begun to evaporate. 
Turn down the heat and sprinkle in the flour, stirring, while there's still some liquid. Let cook until bubbly -- to cook away the pasty taste.  Then, gradually stir in the stock, then the paprika.  Bring to a boil, stirring, and continue to stir at a full boil for one minute.  Reduce the heat to low. 
When the wild rice has partially cooked, stir it into the soup with its cooking liquid; cover and simmer for about 30 minutes. 
When ready to serve, whisk the mustard, Armagnac, and cream together...and then into the soup.  Ladle into bowls and top each with minced green onions or parsley. 
Serve hot as a robust first course or as lunch with a sandwich to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  A French-Canadian rich and deeply flavored soup -- straight out of the North American forests and with a distinctly French hand.  The more wild mushrooms, the better -- but it's wonderful with cultivated ones too.

               Norwegian Cauliflower Soup - {Blomkalsuppe}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  cauliflower head
  1 1/2         quarts  boiling water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2     tablespoon  butter
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2                     egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream -- or more to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg

Trim the cauliflower and cut it into bite-size buds, but keep the stalks and trimmings for the stock. 
Put the cauliflower stalks and trimmings into a large saucepan of the boiling water and salt, then -- if you have a steaming basket -- stick the steaming basket on top and add the buds (otherwise you'll have to pick through the stuff to fish out the buds with a slotted spoon).  Cover and simmer until the buds are just tender, then pull the basket out with the buds and cool. 
Continue cooking the stalks and trimmings until they're very soft and mushy.  Strain, pitch the mushy cauliflower, and reserve the stock. 
In a Dutch oven, melt the butter and stir in the flour.  When smooth, stir in the hot stock, beating constantly, then cover and simmer for 10 or so minutes. 
In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks and nutmeg into the whipping cream.  Remove the soup from the heat, then carefully and quickly whisk the egg mixture into the stock.  Adjust for seasoning and grate in some white pepper. 
Return the soup to the lowest possible heat, for fear of curdling it, add the cauliflower buds, heat through, and serve immediately.  Garnish with a small sprinkling of nutmeg. 
Comments:  A very smooth and silken first course; serve hot to 4 to 6 people; a wonderful Norwegian soup.

Reheat soup, then stir in milk.  Bring to a simmer.  When ready to serve, stir in the heavy cream, ladle into bowls and sprinkle with parsley. 
Serve hot to 4 people as a first course. 
Comments:  This is a pretty little soup, especially in a flat soup plate with finely cut parsley sprinkled over its buttery white surface.  The flavor is delicate -- and it's meant to be as filling as it is inexpensive to make.

               Old World Rasberry Soup  - {A German Recipe}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  rasberries
  3               cups  water
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  tapioca
                        === GARNISH ===
  4                     reserved rasberries
  1              small  curl of lemon peel

In a medium saucepan, bring the rasberries, water, sugar, and lemon juice to a boil and cook until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Pour through a strainer or Foley food mill to remove the rasberry seeds, then return to the heat, adding the vanilla and tapioca.  Cook until thick. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and top with the reserved rasberries and lemon zest.  If serving cold, allow to chill in the refrigerator. 
Serve hot or cold as a first course to 4 people. 
Comments:  Many thanks to CarolDee Whitbeck, from upstate New York, who contributed this wonderful and somehow wonderfully old fashioned soup.  She pulled it out of her recipe archives, saying, "it was given to me about 25 years ago by a wonderful old German lady who I fondly referred to as Oma.  When my children were little they thought that Rasberry Soup was the most special treat going.  The soup can be served ice cold in the summer and hot in the winter."  I agree.  It's a perfect balance of sweet and tart -- warm and comforting in the cold months, a lovely start to a meal of roasted or pot roasted meat and winter vegetables.  In the summer, it's cool and stimulating as the start of grilled meal from the barbeque.

                        = {Shorbat Hummus Wa Fool} =
  1                cup  fava beans -- rinsed, and

  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     onions -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                can  tomatoes - (28 oz) -- reserving juice
     1/4           cup  minced cilantro
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  8               cups  water
  1                can  chickpeas - (19 oz)
  2                     potatoes -- peeled, diced

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Rinse the fava beans and leave to soak overnight. 
Heat the oil in a large pot and saute the onions and garlic until soft.  Add the tomatoes, cut up, the cilantro, and the cayenne pepper.  Cook down for 10 to 15 minutes.  Add water and reserved tomato juice, bring to a boil, then add fava beans.  Reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours. 
Pour in the chickpeas and the diced potatoes, reboil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.  When ready to serve, add the oregano, by rubbing it between your palms, and season to taste.  Ladle into bowls and serve immediately. 
Serve hot as a meal to 6 to 8 people with lots of bread. 
Comments:  A dream one-pot meal for vegetarians -- and anyone else who likes good eating.  It's thick, colorful, full of interesting textures, and plenty filling.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2                     onions -- chopped finely
  1         tablespoon  paprika -- a mix of sweet
                        and hot according to your taste
     1/4           cup  water
  1              pound  lamb or beef -- cut small cubes
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  caraway seeds
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  5               cups  beef stock
  1              pound  green beans -- sliced into uniform
                        bite-sized lengths
  1              pound  potatoes -- cut small cubes
  3        tablespoons  flour -- mixed with enough
                        Olive oil -- to blend and pour
     1/2           cup  sour cream -- whipped smooth
                        Minced parsley -- for garnish

Heat the oil in a Dutch oven, then toss in onion and sautÈ until golden brown.  Sprinkle on the paprika, stir in, then add the water to release all the flavor.  Cook down until the liquid has evaporated, then toss in the meat cubes.  Stir in the pepper, bay leaves, caraway, salt, and garlic.  Cover and simmer over medium heat for about 30 to 35 minutes.  The sauce should be thick by the end. 
Pour in the stock, bring to a boil, then add the potatoes and string beans, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 more minutes. 
When ready to serve, have the soup at a boil and whisk in the flour-oil roux to thicken.  Spoon the sour cream in -- NOT stirring, as you want the creamlets to hold their shape, not blend in -- and allow to boil for 2 to 3 minutes. 
Ladle into flat soup plates and top each with minced parsley. 
Serve hot to 4 people as a meal with lots of bread and, ideally, a strong red Hungarian wine. 
Comments:  Thick, meaty, and complex in flavor, this traditional Hungarian soup from the Budapest area sticks to the ribs.  The caraway is a wonderful counterpoint to the piquancy of the paprika and the cool blandness of the sour cream.

           Paraguayan Zucchini Soup - {Caldo De Zapallo Tierno}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     onion -- chopped fine
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  5               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  3        tablespoons  raw rice
  1              pound  zucchinis - (abt 2 med)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  fresh-grated Parmesan cheese -- (to 4 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced parsley

In a medium saucepan, saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil until tender.  Pour in the stock, bring to a boil, add the rice, and cook on low for 10 minutes.  Stir in the grated zucchini, season with salt and pepper, and simmer -- partially covered -- for about 15 minutes. 
When the zucchini is tender, beat the egg with the cheese and parsley and whisk into the soup, mixing well.  Let simmer for a few minutes, then ladle into bowls and serve immediately. 
Comments:  Just when you thought all zucchini soups were dishwater grey-green, here comes this thick, rich, and flavorful hot first course from Paraguay.  Makes you and 3 to 4 others think about looking for second portions instead of the next course.

In a medium saucepan, saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil until tender.  Pour in the stock, bring to a boil, add the rice, and cook on low for 10 minutes.  Stir in the grated zucchini, season with salt and pepper, and simmer -- partially covered -- for about 15 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the zucchini is tender, beat the egg with the cheese and parsley and whisk into the soup, mixing well.  Let simmer for a few minutes, then ladle into bowls and serve immediately. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Just when you thought all zucchini soups were dishwater grey-green, here comes this thick, rich, and flavorful hot first course from Paraguay.  Makes you and 3 to 4 others think about looking for second portions instead of the next course.

                   PhÛ - {Vietnamese Beef-Noodle Soup}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  phÛ noodles - (these can be the real
                        thing, or very thin rice sticks or even
                        vermicelli or capelli d'angelo pasta)
  8               cups  light beef stock - (if you can't make
                        or get unsalted, dilute what you've got)
  2                     onions -- sliced thin
  2             pieces  star anise
                        (or 1/4 tspn aniseed)
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  nuoc mam - (to 3 tbspns) -- or other
                        Southeast Asian fish sauce
     3/4         pound  boneless beef (top round is fine) -- partially frozen
                        === ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
     1/4           cup  sliced green onions
     1/2           cup  chopped cilantro
  2               cups  fresh beansprouts
  6                     lime slices
                        Finely-sliced jalapeÒo peppers.

Cook the noodles in boiling water for 5 minutes, then drain (or follow package directions for whatever noodles you're using). 
Heat stock, onion, anise, lime juice, and nuoc mam in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer the broth for about 30 minutes. 
Slice the beef in paper-thin slices. 
Arrange green onions, cilantro, beansprouts, chiles, and lime slices on a platter. 
When ready to serve, strain the onion and star anise out of the broth.  With a slotted spoon or strainer, lower a handful of beef slices into the simmering broth and let cook until they lose their red color.  Remove -- then repeat with the rest of the beef. 
Distribute the noodles evenly among the deep bowls, then top with meat slices.  Pour the broth over both, filling the bowl, and serve immediately, with porcelain spoons and chopsticks. 
Serve hot as a meal in great big bowls to 6, with accompaniments and a bottle of chili-garlic sauce (Tuong ot Toi Viet-Nam, if you can get it) on the side. 
Comments:  The ultimate comfort food -- and a snap to make once you get hold of all the ingredients.  It's delicate but filling; fragrant and satisfying.  With love and thanks to Angi Davison for addicting me to this marvelous soup.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              pound  ground meat - (beef, lamb, pork,
                        or a combination)
  1                cup  chopped onion
  1                can  tomatoes - (28 oz) -- tomatoes squeezed,
                        and cut into pieces -- the juice reserved
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cups  beef stock
  1                     apple -- unpeeled, cored,
                        and chopped
  2                     canned whole jalapeÒos -- sliced thinly
  10                    pimiento-stuffed olives -- halved
     1/4           cup  raisins
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  cloves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
     1/2           cup  almond pieces -- sauteed, toasted in
  1           teaspoon  butter

Brown the meat and onions in the olive oil in a large saucepan.  Stir in the garlic after the meat is brown, then add the stock, reserved tomato juice, and all the remaining ingredients.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer for 20 minutes. 
When ready to serve, ladle the soup into festive bowls and sprinkle with the toasted almonds.  Serve immediately.  
Serve hot to 6 people as a first course. 
Comments:  This unusual soup is based on the traditional Latin one-meal dish that customarily stuffs tacos, tamales, empanadas, and poblano peppers -- traditionally is served at Mexican weddings -- and now is being used in the southwestern United States to stuff Thanksgiving turkeys.  It's definitely a waker-upper as a soup, best served in small portions as an appetite stimulant.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  bacon
  3              dozen  large hard-boiled eggs -- sliced
  1              pound  Polish sausage -- sliced
  1              pound  ham -- cubed
                        Water -- as needed
                        Freshly-grated horseradish -- for garnish
                        (if you don't like horseradish
                        you can substitute Tabasco sauce)

Fry the bacon and cut it into 1-inch pieces.  Slice the eggs and sausage.  Cut up the ham into 1/2-inch cubes.  Put everything into a large pot and cover with hot water. 
Bring to a boil.  Simmer until the egg yolks are well dissolved.  Serve with horseradish to suit your taste. 
This recipe yields ?? servings. 
Comments:  This authentic Polish soup was handed down to Deanna Wilson of Gilbert, Arizona, from her great, great grandparents who lived in Warsaw.  Deanna only makes it once a year -- for Easter.  It is certainly wonderful in terms of using up those myriad hard boiled eggs!  Serve hot to Easter guests and to family for the days following.

                       Polish Hunter Stew - {Bigos}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  chopped bacon
  1              pound  boneless pork -- cut small cubes
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3                     onions -- quartered
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- quartered
  2               cups  beef stock
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2                     bay leaves
  2               cups  sauerkraut -- rinsed in
                        cold water and drained
  3                     apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into chunks
  2               cups  canned tomatoes with juice -- cut into pieces
  1                cup  diced cooked ham
  1 1/2           cups  Polish sausage in small chunks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Sour cream -- served on the side

Fry the bacon in a Dutch oven, to render the fat, then toss in the pork chunks, garlic, onions, and mushrooms.  Saute until the meat is browned -- about 5 minutes. 
Pour in the stock, tomatoes with their juice, sugar, bay leaves, sauerkraut, and apples, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for about 2 hours.  Stir in the ham and sausage, then cover and cook on medium-low heat for about 30 more minutes. 
When ready to serve, remove bay leaves and taste for seasoning.  Ladle into bowls and serve with boiled potatoes, a bowl of sour cream, and thick, crusty bread. 
Serve hot to 6 people as a filling meal. 
Comments:  Not for vegetarians!  This is just crammed with meats and sausages, with the sweetness of apples more than balanced by the sharpness of sauerkraut -- but it's hearty and delicious and really quite unforgettable.  Traditionally served in Poland as a good-luck New Year's dish, it was originally eaten only by the Polish aristocracy (they being the only ones allowed to hunt game on their estates...and the only ones who could afford so much meat).

Fry the bacon in a Dutch oven, to render the fat, then toss in the pork chunks, garlic, onions, and mushrooms.  Saute until the meat is browned -- about 5 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour in the stock, tomatoes with their juice, sugar, bay leaves, sauerkraut, and apples, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for about 2 hours.  Stir in the ham and sausage, then cover and cook on medium-low heat for about 30 more minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, remove bay leaves and taste for seasoning.  Ladle into bowls and serve with boiled potatoes, a bowl of sour cream, and thick, crusty bread. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve hot to 6 people as a filling meal. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Not for vegetarians!  This is just crammed with meats and sausages, with the sweetness of apples more than balanced by the sharpness of sauerkraut -- but it&apos;s hearty and delicious and really quite unforgettable.  Traditionally served in Poland as a good-luck New Year&apos;s dish, it was originally eaten only by the Polish aristocracy (they being the only ones allowed to hunt game on their estates...and the only ones who could afford so much meat).

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     onions -- thinly sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  madeira
  3                     tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely chopped
  3                     potatoes -- peeled, cubed
  4                     whole cloves
  2              large  bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  tarragon
     1/2      teaspoon  marjoram
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2             quarts  water
  1              pound  white fish fillets
  1              pound  swordfish or mackerel
  1         tablespoon  salt
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Garlic toast
                        Parmesan cheese
                        Chopped fresh parsley

Saute onion and garlic in the butter and oil until lightly browned -- about 15 minutes.  Stir in the next 10 ingredients and bring to a boil.  Cover and simmer for an hour.  Uncover and simmer until the liquid is reduced, at least 2 hours. 
Add the fish, breaking it into chunks, and simmer for 5 minutes, until just cooked through.  Let cool, cover, then refrigerate overnight. 
About 20 minutes before serving, begin to reheat slowly.  Season to taste.  When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and top with toasted bread, handfuls of parmesan, and fresh chopped parsley. 
To make garlic toast:  Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet and saute 1 minced clove of garlic for a minute, then add 12 to 16 1/2-inch slices of French baguettes and brown lightly on both sides.  Drain on paper towels. 
Comments:  After bubbling on the stove most of the night before, it is heady and rich -- a proper meal, piping hot, for 6 to 8 people.

                  Portuguese Green Soup - {Caldo Verde}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     onion -- minced fine
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  6                     potatoes -- peeled, sliced thin
  2             quarts  cold water
  6             ounces  dry, garlicky sausage -- sliced paper thin
                        (such as linguica, chorizo, even
                        pepperoni)
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1              pound  collards, kale, or turnip greens -- washed, trimmed,
                        rolled up, and sliced extra-fine shreds
                        (in a pinch, slightly defrost frozen kale
                        and finely shred it with a sharp knife)

In a large saucepan, saute the onion and garlic in 3 tablespoons of oil for about 3 minutes.  Add the potatoes and saute, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add water, cover, and boil gently over medium heat for 20 minutes, until the potatoes are mushy. 
Meanwhile, fry the sausage in a skillet over low heat for about 10 minutes, until most of the fat has drained out.  Drain well and reserve. 
When the potatoes are soft, remove from the heat and either mash them in the pan with a masher or puree them -- then add the sausage, salt, and pepper.  Return to medium heat, cover, and simmer for 5 more minutes. 
When ready to serve, add the shreds of greens and simmer uncovered for about 5 minutes -- until they are tender and the color of jade.  Mix in the last tablespoon of oil, taste for seasoning, and ladle into large flat soup plates. 
Serve this recipe hot as a first course to 6 people. 
Comments:  Delicate, beautiful, and restorative.  How do I know?  It was my 50th birthday soup: after waking up to a pouring rain in Castelo da Vide, horribly sick from goat stew, daughter Meg and I made the long, twisting drive to Evora; at day's end, she insisted on buying me birthday dinner in our tiny hotel dining room.  Caldo Verde -- it was just what the doctor should have ordered.

  1              whole  unboned chicken breast -- split
  1                     onion -- sliced thin wedges
  4                     parsley sprigs
  4                     lemon zest strips - (2" by 1/2")
  1              sprig  fresh mint
  6               cups  chicken stock
     1/3           cup  small pasta or fine egg noodles
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh mint

Comments:  A clear, light Portuguese canja -- excellent as a palate reconditioner; serve hot as a first course to 4 to 6 people.

                Portuguese Shrimp Soup - {Sopa De Camarao}

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  raw shrimp -- peeled
  4               cups  fish stock
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     canned tomatoes - (to 4) -- seeded, chopped,
                        reserving their juice
  3                     mushrooms - (to 4) -- sliced
  1            handful  parsley and celery leaves -- finely minced
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  piri piri or cayenne
  1                cup  vinho verde or other dry white wine
  2                     potatoes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Chopped cilantro -- for garnish

In a large saucepan, saute onions and garlic in the olive oil for about 5 minutes, until golden.  Mix in tomatoes, mushrooms, parsley/celery leaves, bay leaf, black pepper, and piri piri.  Turn heat to low and cook tomatoes down -- about 10 to 15 minutes.  Slowly pour in the reserved tomato juice, fish stock, and wine -- whisk through and bring to a boil. 
When the broth is bubbling, grate in the potatoes and allow to thicken.  Reduce heat, stir in the peeled shrimp, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.  Season to taste.  Ladle into soup plates and top with chopped cilantro.  Serve immediately. 
Comments:  Rib-sticking and spicy good -- a substantial first course; add a few more shrimp and you have a whole meal.  Serve hot to 4 people.

In a large saucepan, saute onions and garlic in the olive oil for about 5 minutes, until golden.  Mix in tomatoes, mushrooms, parsley/celery leaves, bay leaf, black pepper, and piri piri.  Turn heat to low and cook tomatoes down -- about 10 to 15 minutes.  Slowly pour in the reserved tomato juice, fish stock, and wine -- whisk through and bring to a boil.

<DirT>
When the broth is bubbling, grate in the potatoes and allow to thicken.  Reduce heat, stir in the peeled shrimp, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.  Season to taste.  Ladle into soup plates and top with chopped cilantro.  Serve immediately. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Rib-sticking and spicy good -- a substantial first course; add a few more shrimp and you have a whole meal.  Serve hot to 4 people.

       Puerto Rican Green Plantain Soup - {Sopa De Platanos Verdes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     green plantains - (to 3)
  4        tablespoons  lard
  6               cups  beef stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Grated parmesan cheese -- for garnish

Peel the plantains and cut into 1/2-inch slices.  Soak them in cold, salted water for 20 minutes.  Drain and pat dry. 
In a heavy frying pan, saute the plantains in lard until they are tender, about 15 minutes.  The pieces will be gold colored and will brown a little.  Drain well on paper towels, then crush with a pestle or mallet until they break into bits. 
Heat the beef stock in a large saucepan and add the plantain.  Simmer for 15 minutes, adjust seasoning, then ladle into bowls.  Garnish with generous handfuls of grated parmesan. 
Comments:  Simple but exotic -- deceptively substantial as a first course; serve hot to 6 people, follow with grilled meat and juicy tropical fruits.

        Saltkjˆt Og Baunir - {Icelandic Salted Lamb And Pea Soup}

Recipe By     :Nanna RˆgnvaldardÛttir
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  yellow split peas
  8               cups  water
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2           teaspoon  dried thyme -- rubbed between
                        the palms of your hands
     1/4         pound  bacon -- cubed
  2 1/2         pounds  salted lamb shoulder -- cut large chunks
  1              pound  rutabagas -- cut large cubes
  1              pound  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut in thick slices
     1/2         pound  carrots -- cut in pieces
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Salt -- if needed

Nanna says:  "Put the peas in a large pan and add water.  Bring to the boil, skim, then add thyme and onion.  Simmer, covered, for 45 minutes.  Add the bacon and one piece of meat to the soup and boil the rest of the meat in a separate pan.  Simmer the soup with the meat for around 30 minutes, stirring frequently and adding more water if needed. 
Add the vegetables and cook for 20 minutes, or until tender.  Season to taste with pepper and salt, if needed.  The bean soup should be thick (when cold it almost becomes like pease pudding).  The meat and vegetables may be served on a separate plate and eaten with the soup, or cut up small and returned to the soup." 
Serve hot as a meal to 8 people. 
Comments:  This rich Icelandic soup recipe was contributed by Nanna RˆgnvaldardÛttir, author of Matar·st (or, Love of Food), a 700-page encyclopedia of Icelandic cooking that was shortlisted for the Icelandic Literary Prize in 1999.  It contains some 1,600 recipes and 3,000 entries -- and weighs nearly 7 pounds! 
Saltkjˆt og baunir is what most Icelanders eat on Shrove Tuesday, or "sprengidagur" (literally "bursting day").  According to Nanna, "Tradition says you should eat as much (especially meat) as you possibly can, until you are about to burst.  The reason for this is of course that in the old days, you would have been preparing for seven meatless weeks, so you better pig out.  The soup is fairly similar to Scandinavian pea soups, except they are usually made with salted pork, not lamb."  Salted lamb is not easy to find in many locations, but it is possible to substitute 1 pound of country ham and 2 pounds of fresh lamb for the bacon and salted lamb, above, to get a decent flavor of the dish.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  water
  1 1/4            cup  dried lentils
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     potatoes -- cut small pieces
  1                     celery stalk -- finely chopped
  2                     zucchini -- cut small pieces
  1           teaspoon  cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     lemons -- cut into wedges

Place the lentils, onion, and garlic in a large saucepan and cover with the water.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. 
Stir in the potatoes and celery and cook, covered, 15 minutes.  Then add the zucchini and cumin and cook uncovered another 15 minutes, until the lentils and potatoes are tender.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
When ready to serve, ladle the soup into bowls, sprinkle each with lemon juice, and serve a lemon wedge with each portion. 
Serve hot to 4 to 6 people as a substantial first course or a light meal. 
Comments:  This is a great soup -- with a great tradition that goes with it.  During the Hadj -- which fulfills a Moslem's fifth duty of the five pillars of Islam -- many pilgrims to Mecca make a meal of this satisfying soup.  While the soup is thick, it is neither rich nor creamy -- the cumin is wonderfully aromatic -- and the lemon turns the meal into something quite special.

                     Scandanavian Brown Cabbage Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  cabbage -- shredded
     1/4           cup  butter
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1 1/2         quarts  beef stock
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  allspice
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISHES ===
                        Dumplings
                        Toasted croutons
                        Cheddar cheese

In a Dutch oven, brown the cabbage on all sides in the butter, stirring often, until it is colored a light brown.  This will take at least 15 minutes, and it should be watched carefully at the end as the browning takes place quickly. 
Add the sugar and stir until it is completely dissolved.  Add the stock, salt, pepper, and allspice -- bring to a boil, then simmer, covered, for about an hour. 
Traditionally, it is served with dumplings, but it is delicious with toasted croutons and a handful of cheddar cheese thrown in.  Don't forget how good it is with a good and cold beer and a sharp salad. 
Serve this substantial soup hot to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  The 3rd Book of the Problemata -- a work traditionally ascribed to Aristotle -- is entirely devoted to the human reaction to alcohol. 
Why is it that to those who are very drunk, everything seems to revolve in a circle?... 
Why is it that to those who are drunk one thing at which they are looking sometimes appears to be many?... 
Why is it that wine which is mixed but tends towards the unmixed causes a worse headache the next morning than entirely unmixed wine?... 
Why is it that cabbage stops the ill effects of drinking?... 
Like French onion soup, it is surprisingly sweet and tender.  To really take care of that headfuzz, sleep late, then serve at brunch with a good beer and a crisp salad.

In a Dutch oven, brown the cabbage on all sides in the butter, stirring often, until it is colored a light brown.  This will take at least 15 minutes, and it should be watched carefully at the end as the browning takes place quickly. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the sugar and stir until it is completely dissolved.  Add the stock, salt, pepper, and allspice -- bring to a boil, then simmer, covered, for about an hour. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Traditionally, it is served with dumplings, but it is delicious with toasted croutons and a handful of cheddar cheese thrown in.  Don&apos;t forget how good it is with a good and cold beer and a sharp salad. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve this substantial soup hot to 4 to 6 people.

Comments:  The 3rd Book of the Problemata -- a work traditionally ascribed to Aristotle -- is entirely devoted to the human reaction to alcohol.

Why is it that to those who are very drunk, everything seems to revolve in a circle?...

Why is it that to those who are drunk one thing at which they are looking sometimes appears to be many?...

Why is it that wine which is mixed but tends towards the unmixed causes a worse headache the next morning than entirely unmixed wine?...

<DirT>
Why is it that cabbage stops the ill effects of drinking?... 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Like French onion soup, it is surprisingly sweet and tender.  To really take care of that headfuzz, sleep late, then serve at brunch with a good beer and a crisp salad.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     dried mushrooms - (to 10)
                        (preferably cepes/porcini, but
                        even shiitakes are okay)
  3        tablespoons  butter
  4               cups  shredded cabbage
  2               cups  sauerkraut - (to 3 cups) -- cold pack,
                        not canned, if possible
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  12              cups  beef or vegetable stock
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                     carrot -- peeled, and
                        cut into a julienne
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onions
  1                     celery stalk -- diced
  1              large  turnip -- peeled, diced
  1                can  tomatoes - (16 oz) -- drained, seeded,
                        and chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced or pressed
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped fresh dill -- mixed into
                        Sour cream

Begin by soaking the mushrooms in 1 cup hot water for an hour.  Rinse the sauerkraut well with cold water and squeeze dry. 
In a large Dutch oven, melt 3 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat, then toss in the cabbage and sauerkraut and sautÈ for 15 minutes, stirring often.  Stir in the tomato paste and 1 cup or so of stock, cover, and simmer of low heat for 40 minutes. 
Meanwhile, squeeze the mushrooms dry and slice finely.  Melt the other 3 tablespoons of butter in a skillet and sautÈ the carrot, onions, celery, turnips, and mushrooms until soft and slightly brown -- about 15 minutes.  Seed and chop the tomatoes, reserving them. 
When the sauerkraut and cabbage are nicely stewed, stir in the sauteÈd vegetables, the tomatoes, and the stock.  Season with salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce to a low heat -- cover and simmer for about 20 minutes.  Add garlic and cook 5 more minutes. 
Let stand at least 15 minutes -- but ideally a day or so in the refrigerator to cure. 
When ready to serve, reheat slowly.  Ladle into bowls and garnish with spoonsful of dilled sour cream. 
Serve hot as a meal to 6 to 8 people, with lots of pumpernickel or rye bread and butter on hand. 
Comments:  Shchi can be made with meat or without it -- with sauerkraut or with cabbage or with both.  The only thing all cooks seem to agree on is that it should sit and cure for as long as possible, up to a day or two, before eating.  This particular recipe is meatless -- and can be vegetarian if you use water or vegetable stock instead of beef stock -- but it is unusually rich and hearty, full of flavor and textures, using both sauerkraut and cabbage. 
Souptale:  There is evidence that shchi was known in Russia long before 988 AD, when Christianity was accepted -- so long before that shchi actually meant "liquid food" in the beginning, and only came to mean specifically "cabbage soup" when that vegetable was cultivated there.  As has been described in Faves of the Stars, shchi has been a favorite soup of characters as diverse as a 13th century Mongol khan, Ivan the Terrible, Nicholas II, his assassin Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Vladimir Zhirinovsky.  Alexander Dumas liked it so much in the 19th century that he included it in his cookbook.  Lewis Carroll, author of Alice in Wonderland, found it "quite drinkable, though it contained some sour element, which perhaps is necessary for Russian palates."  When Russian soldiers marched into France in 1812, they were so desperate for the taste of fermented cabbage that they picked vine leaves and started pickling them so they could make shchi.  Its associations, always, are with peasants, the earth, common soldiers, ordinariness.  Thus when Russians call someone "a professor of sour shchi," they mean he's a fraud -- cause you can't earn respect by making something so common. 
And here's how the Russian writer Edouard Limonov had his hero Edichka (from the novel That's me, Edichka) describe surviving on it in New York City:  "'The advantages of shchi are as follows,' Edichka explains.  'There are five of them:  1.  It is very cheap -- a saucepan [of it] costs two or three dollars, and it is enough for two days.  2.  It doesn't get sour without refrigeration -- even when it is very hot.  3.  It is cooked quickly -- only one and a half hours.  4.  It is possible and even necessary to eat it cold.  5.  There is no better meal for summer, because it is sour.'"

           Shurpa - {Hearty Spiced Lamb Soup From Central Asia}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  stewing lamb -- cut into 1" chunks
  1                cup  chopped onions
  10              cups  beef stock
  1              large  turnip -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  1              large  zucchini -- cut into 1/2" dice
  2                     carrots -- cut into 1/2" dice
  2              large  green bell peppers -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into strips
  1 1/2         pounds  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1                can  chickpeas - (16 oz) -- drained
                        Salt -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  white vinegar
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro -- for garnish

In a large Dutch oven, brown the meat in the hot oil over high heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in the onions and cook 5 or so more minutes, until the onions are softened and have taken on color.  Spoon off all the fat that you can, pour in the stock, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours.  Refrigerate the soup, preferably overnight, so you can easily remove the fat. 
About an hour before serving, start chopping the vegetables.  Bring the skimmed soup to a boil over medium heat, then add the turnip, zucchini, carrots, peppers, tomatoes, cumin, hot pepper flakes, coriander, and chickpeas.  Cook, covered, for 30 minutes.  Salt to taste, then stir in the vinegar.  Cover and let stand for 15 minutes. 
Ladle into bowls and garnish with lots of finely minced cilantro.  Serve hot to 6 people as a first course. 
Comments:  Aromatic and hearty with root vegetables, this rich soup is beautiful to see, with its even and colorful dice, and superb as a winter meal.  It's a good one to start the night before, so you can refrigerate overnight and easily remove every scrap of fat before adding the vegetables the next day.

It&apos;s a good one to start the night before, so you can refrigerate overnight and easily remove every scrap of fat before adding the vegetables the next day.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     boned skinned chicken breast -- sliced into
                        paper-thin strips
  1         tablespoon  egg white -- lightly whipped
  6               cups  chicken stock
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1                     cucumber -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into a julienne
     3/4      teaspoon  dark sesame oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Finely-ground white pepper -- to taste

Mix chicken strips into the egg white and set aside. 
Pour chicken stock, sugar, and soy sauce into a large saucepan and bring to a boil.  Stir in the chicken strips and the cucumber sticks and bring the stock back to a boil.  Immediately stir in the sesame oil, salt, and pepper -- ladle into bowls -- and take to the table. 
Comments:  Really just a warm up for spicy dishes to follow, this hot first course to a meal in Singapore is delicate, warming, and puts 6 people in the mood for the next course.

           Sweet And Sour Red Cabbage Soup - {Eastern European}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                     onion -- sliced
  1                     tart apple -- cored, peeled,
                        and sliced
  3               cups  lightly-chopped shredded red cabbage
  4               cups  beef stock
                        (but vegetable stock is fine)
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  celery seed
     1/3           cup  raisins
     1/4           cup  apple butter
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Sour cream
                        Chopped apple with skin

In a large saucepan, saute the apple and onion in the butter until tender.  Stir in the cabbage and saute for 5 more minutes.  Pour in the stock and vinegar and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, stir in sugar, salt, pepper, celery seed, and raisins -- then simmer, uncovered, for an hour.  Stir in apple butter. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls, top with a spoonful of sour cream, and sprinkle with chopped apple. 
Serve hot as a first course to 8 -- and follow up with lots of buttery mashed potatoes and whatever.  Definitely beer, if you're so inclined. 
Comments:  Sharp and stimulating, this Eastern European favorite is related to borscht, but uses red cabbage instead of red beets.  It has a vegetable pickle bite, but far more aromatic and savory because it's steaming hot.  The raisins are terrific -- a great textual and taste counterpoint.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1              small  cabbage head -- sliced very finely,
                        as for cole slaw
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  6               cups  beef or chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2           cup  rice
                        Grated Gruyere or Parmesan cheese -- for garnish

Melt the butter in a Dutch oven, toss in the cabbage and onion to coat, then cover and cook over low heat until the cabbage is golden and half cooked.  Stir frequently or it will burn. 
Pour in the stock and bring to a boil.  Season to taste with the salt and pepper, then stir in the nutmeg.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.  Add the rice and continue simmering for 15 to 20 more minutes.  Serve with grated cheese. 
Serve hot to 6 people -- it's substantial enough to be a light meal. 
Comments:  This traditional Swiss soup is native to the Schwyz canton, but quite similar to variations in other cantons.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1                     chicken - (abt 3 lbs) -- cut into pieces
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  curry powder
  1         tablespoon  dried red chile -- ground to a powder
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  8               cups  chicken stock
  1              large  tomato -- peeled, chopped
                        (or 4 canned tomatoes)
  1                cup  grated coconut -- (DON'T USE
                        SWEETENED!)
  2                     bananas -- sliced into
                        chunky quarter pieces

In a Dutch oven, brown the chicken pieces in the oil.  Remove chicken, reserving, and add the onion and garlic to the pot.  SautÈ until soft, then stir in the powdered chile, the curry, and the black pepper and fry for 2 more minutes.  Add the tomatoes, stock, chicken pieces, and coconut, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. 
When the chicken is done, remove, let cool, then strip away the meat and cut it into bite-sized chunks, discarding the skin and bones.  Add it back into the pot with the banana chunks.  Simmer 10 minutes. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls. 
Serve hot to 4 people as a filling meal, with a frosty drink on the side to offset the red hot pepper. 
Comments:  Piquant, sweet, aromatic, and succulent all at once -- this is a wonderful soup, reflective of the hot African sun of its origin.

                         Trinidad Black Bean Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dried black beans
     1/2         pound  corned beef
  2                     onions -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     parsley sprigs
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  2                     celery stalks
  4                     green onions -- chopped
  1                     bay leaf
  6               cups  beef stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Curls of lime zest
                        Lime juice or Pepper Wine -- (see below)
                        === PEPPER WINE ===
  6              whole  hot peppers
  1               pint  light rum or dry sherry

Pepper Wine:  Make in advance; it keeps forever.  Mix ingredients together in a jar; cover; and let sit for 10 days.  A little goes a long way -- just a few drops or so at a time in soups and sauces. 
Soak beans overnight in cold water.  Drain, discarding water, and put beans in a large saucepan with the hunk of corned beef, onion, garlic, parsley, thyme, celery, green onions, bay leaf, stock, and pepper.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 2 hours, until beans are very tender. 
Remove from heat.  Discard bay leaf, fish out the corned beef hunk and set aside. 
Lightly puree the soup, then return to the saucepan and adjust for seasoning.  Shred the corned beef and stir in.  When you're ready to serve, ladle into bowls, lace with the lime juice or Pepper Wine, and top with the lime curl. 
Comments:  It's a hearty soup -- and heady; serve hot to 6 people -- preferably at night with ocean breezes; think tropics and Trinidad, British and Caribbean.  Maybe a rum nightcap on the verandah.

                            Ukrainian Borscht

Recipe By     :S·ndor Fenyvesi
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  beef stock
     1/2        medium  cabbage head -- finely shredded
  3             medium  potatoes -- cut into 1" cubes
  1              large  red beet -- shredded
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  bacon fat
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2             medium  onions -- finely chopped
  2                     tomatoes -- peeled, chopped
                        (4 canned tomatoes are fine)
  1                     carrot -- sliced
  1                     parsley root or 1/2 parsnip
  6                     peppercorns
  3                     allspice berries
  3                     bay leaves
  1              whole  garlic head -- peeled, chopped
  2        tablespoons  bacon fat
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- to taste
                        Sour cream -- for garnish

Heat the stock in a large soup pot, add cabbage and potatoes and simmer for 15 minutes. 
In the meantime, mix the beets, vinegar, bacon fat, sugar, and tomatoes in a saucepan and cook gently, covered, for about 5 minutes.  Set aside.  Then, in another small pan, heat the butter, mix in the onion, carrot, and parsley root (or parsnip), and braise. 
When the cabbage and potatoes are finished simmering, add the beet mixture, the onion mixture, the peppercorns, allspice berries, and bay leaves -- and cook another 10 minutes. 
Stir in the chopped garlic, the remaining bacon fat, and the chopped parsley.  Then turn the heat down to a very low simmer, lightly cover the pot, and simmer very slowly for about 4 1/2 hours.  Turn off the heat, let cool, and allow to ripen for about 12 to 18 hours. 
When ready to serve, reheat gently then ladle into bowls.  Top each with a teaspoonful of sour cream and serve with a slice of dark rye bread. 
Serve this authentic Ukrainian soup hot to 6 to 8 people as a substantial first course or as a main course. 
Comments:  This fabulous, many layered, complex borscht is compliments of S·ndor Fenyvesi, an air traffic controller in Budapest, Hungary, who was educated at a special school for navigating officers and air traffic controllers in Riga, Latvia, when he was 18 years old and learned this soup while there.  S·ndor has an outstanding bilingual website of soup recipes at www.nexus.hu/flashfy.  Most derive from his wife Katya, a wonderful cook.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PASTE ===
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (2") -- minced
  1                     white onion -- minced
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              whole  small fresh green chile - (to 2)
                        (serrano, jalapeÒo, etc.)
  2        tablespoons  curry powder
  2          teaspoons  tumeric
  2          teaspoons  cumin
  4        tablespoons  oil
                        === FOR THE SOUP BASE ===
  4               cups  vegetable stock
  4             stalks  celery -- chopped small
  2                     carrots -- chopped small
     2/3           cup  yellow split peas
  4                     potatoes -- cubed
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     white onion -- chopped small
  1                cup  cilantro - (loosely packed)
  4        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1                cup  yoghurt
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Finely-sliced lemon slices
                        Minced cilantro

In a large pot, add all the "paste" ingredients and cook slowly over low heat until the onions are wilted and translucent.  If the paste seems dry, you can add a little extra oil. 
Pour in the stock and add all the rest of the soup ingredients.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook for 30 minutes. 
When ready to serve, stir in the yogurt.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Ladle into bowls, topping each with a thin slice of lemon and minced cilantro sprinkled on top. 
Serve hot as a meal to 4 to 6 people; as a course to 6 to 8. 
Comments:  Lisa Gitelson (of Balsamic Strawberry Soup fame) has come through again with a marvelous addition to this soup collection.  We'd been talking about Vegetarian Mulligatawny for some 3 months, and Lisa finally seized the initiative and came up with the following recipe.  It's rich, aromatic, and completely satisfying.  Lisa recommends pureeing -- I prefer it in all its chunky glory, with so many interesting colors and textures.

                        = {Mien Ga} =
  8               cups  chicken stock or Vietnamese
                        spiced chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  nuoc mam
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  6                     green onions -- slivered, with
                        white and green parts separated
  1 1/2           cups  slivered cooked chicken
  6             ounces  cellophane noodles
                        === GARNISH ===
  2               cups  bean sprouts
     1/4           cup  cilantro

Chop up the cellophane noodles, then cover with cold water.  After 30 minutes, drain.  They'll still be stiff, but they're ready to be finalized in the hot broth. 
In a large saucepan, pour in the stock, nuoc mam, lemon juice, and white slivers of the green onion.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.  Strain out the scallions. 
When ready to serve, divide the chicken and noodles among the soup bowls, then ladle the broth over them.  Garnish with bean sprouts and cilantro, and serve immediately -- ideally with chopsticks and ceramic spoons. 
Serve hot in large soup bowls to 6 as a substantial first course or a light meal. 
Comments:  Easy to put together once you've got the fish sauce and cellophane noodles, this makes you feel good just smelling it -- it's light, healthy, digestible, and interesting.  Those cellophane noodles are just too cool -- there but not there, slippery but substantial.

           Vietnamese Crab And Asparagus Soup - {Sup Mang Tay}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  peanut oil
     1/4         pound  cooked crabmeat -- cut bite-size
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5               cups  Vietnamese or regular chicken stock -- simmered with
  1              piece  ginger - (1") -- that has been
                        crushed
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water
  1              pound  asparagus -- if using fresh,
                        cut off the tips, slice each spear
                        lengthwise and chop into half-moon shapes
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten
                        === GARNISH ===
  1                     green onion -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  cilantro leaves
                        Red wine vinegar

Heat the oil in a large saucepan, then stir in the crab, salt, and pepper and toss for about 1 minute.  Pour in the stock and asparagus and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and cook until the asparagus is tender -- about 5 minutes or more, depending on the thickness of the pieces.  Stir in the cornstarch liquid and allow it to thicken the soup for a minute or so. 
When ready to serve, slowly pour the egg white into the simmering soup, stirring slowly to create ribbons.  Let these set for a minute, then ladle the soup into bowls and top with the green onion and cilantro leaves.  Serve piping hot -- and pass the red wine vinegar separately. 
Serve hot as a first course to 4 to 6 people.  It could be an absolutely sensational start to a perfectly roasted chicken. 
Comments:  Delicate and moony, this is one of those gorgeous Eurasian hybrids that is neither French nor Vietnamese, but something quite in its own category.  French colonialists brought asparagus to Vietnam, but couldn't get it to grow -- so they imported cans and cans of it...and the Vietnamese people got hooked. 
Although the soup is customarily made with canned white asparagus, I prefer fresh -- and green is even prettier, to my taste.

          Vietnamese Dilled Tomato-Fish Soup - {Ca Nau Ca Chua}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
  1              pound  fish fillets -- cut triangle shapes
                        (such as cod, snapper, perch,
                        or whatever looks fresh)
  3                     tomatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into triangle shapes
  1                     onion -- cut into eighths
  2        tablespoons  nuoc mam or other fish sauce
  2             quarts  water
  2                     celery stalks -- cut fine julienne
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh dill
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Additional nuoc mam
                        Dill sprigs
                        Vietnamese chili-garlic sauce (tuong ot
                        toi Viet Nam)

Heat the oil in a large pot and add fish -- saute until lightly browned.  Add the tomatoes, onion, and nuoc mam and simmer for 5 minutes.  Pour in the water and bring to a boil.  Cook at a low boil for 15 minutes. 
When ready to serve, stir in the celery, the dill, and the black pepper.  Let cook a minute or two then ladle into bowls.  Top each with a dill sprig.  Serve with extra nuoc mam and with Vietnamese chili-garlic sauce for those who like it hot. 
Serve hot to 4 to 6. 
Comments:  This fragrant soup is very light, subtle, and extremely low calorie.  Served in large bowl portions, it is an excellent appetite suppressant.  Don't be put off by the fish sauce (nuoc mam or the like) -- added to broth it merely acts, like salt, to season the dish.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  raw rice
  2               cups  water
  1              pound  fish fillets or steaks -- cut 1/4" strips
  2                     green onions -- thinly sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce (nuoc mam or nam pla)
  6        tablespoons  tamarind concentrate -- dissolved in
  6        tablespoons  hot water
  5               cups  fish stock
  1                     fresh tomato -- skinned, and
                        cut into thin wedges
                        (or 3 canned tomatoes, seeded)
  2              small  red bird chilies -- thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam or nam pla)
  1 1/2           cups  sliced okra in rounds - (fresh or
                        frozen, but let the frozen defrost)
                        === GARNISH ===
  1                cup  mung bean sprouts
     1/4           cup  slightly chopped cilantro
  2          teaspoons  hot pepper oil
                        (make by sautÈing 1/4 tspn dried hot
                        peppers in 2 tspns of oil)
                        Lime wedges - (small)

Prepare the rice:  Boil rice with about 2 cups of water for 20 to 30 minutes (pot tightly covered) and set aside when done. 
In a bowl, mix the scallion, black pepper, and 1 tablespoon of nuoc mam, then toss in the fish strips and let marinate for 15 minutes. 
In another bowl, stir the tamarind concentrate into the hot water and let sit until ready to use. 
In a large saucepan, bring the stock to a boil, then stir in the tamarind, the tomato wedges, the sliced chiles, and 3 tablespoons of nuoc mam.  Simmer for 3 minutes, then add the okra and fish.  Simmer until the fish is done -- about 3 minutes. 
Remove from heat and stir in the bean sprouts, cilantro, and chile oil.  Spoon rice portions equally into the bowls, then ladle the soup over each one and top with the lime wedges. 
Serve piping hot to 6 people as a first course or to 2 to 3 people as a meal. 
Comments:  Visually beautiful, with red, dark green, and white cut shapes in a tamarind-dark broth; in taste, sour piquant offset by sweet fish and earthy okra -- it's a sensational soup: appetite stimulating and totally, totally satisfying at the same time.

<DirT>
In a large saucepan, bring the stock to a boil, then stir in the tamarind, the tomato wedges, the sliced chiles, and 3 tablespoons of nuoc mam.  Simmer for 3 minutes, then add the okra and fish.  Simmer until the fish is done -- about 3 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from heat and stir in the bean sprouts, cilantro, and chile oil.  Spoon rice portions equally into the bowls, then ladle the soup over each one and top with the lime wedges. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve piping hot to 6 people as a first course or to 2 to 3 people as a meal. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Visually beautiful, with red, dark green, and white cut shapes in a tamarind-dark broth; in taste, sour piquant offset by sweet fish and earthy okra -- it&apos;s a sensational soup: appetite stimulating and totally, totally satisfying at the same time.

              Watercressed Shrimp Soup - {Canh Sa Lach Soan}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     shallot
  3        tablespoons  nuoc mam (fish sauce)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4         pound  large shrimp - (abt 12) -- peeled, deveined,
                        shells reserved for the broth
  6               cups  Vietnamese or regular chicken stock -- simmered with
  1              piece  ginger - (1") -- that has been
                        crushed
  1 1/2        bunches  watercress -- cut bite-size
                        (it's traditional to leave whole,
                        but what a mess!)

Pound the shallot into a paste, then mix in the nuoc mam and the pepper.  Toss in the shrimp and pound the paste into them -- they should stay whole. 
Heat the stock in a large saucepan to a boil, then stir in the reserved shrimp shells, reduce to medium heat, and cook for about 8 minutes.  Fish out the shells with a strainer spoon. 
When ready to serve, reheat the stock to a boil.  Add the shrimp and cook for 1 minute.  Toss in the watercress, and cook for another minute.  Ladle into bowls and serve immediately. 
Serve hot to 4 people as a first course. 
Comments:  This Vietnamese soup is really lovely to look at -- I recommend serving in flat soup bowls for the full effect.  In taste, the broth is earthy and sour, with a sea-salt tang, all counterpointed by the sweetness of the shrimp and the peppery crunch of the watercress.  In a word, it's an elegant appetite stimulant.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pounds  stewing hen or capon -- cut serving pieces,
                        with giblets (or two 3-pound fryers)
     1/4           cup  butter -- softened
  5                     leeks -- cut big chunks
  5                     celery stalks -- cut big chunks
  2                     carrots -- cut big chunks
  2                     onions -- peeled, and each
                        stuck with 2 whole cloves
  1                     bouquet garni consisting of
  6                     parsley sprigs -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme -- plus
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg -- plus
  10                    peppercorns -- plus
  1                     bay leaf -- (all wrapped in foil
                        and pierced all over with a fork)
  8               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  4                     egg yolks
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
                        === GARNISH ===
  8                     paper-thin lemon slices
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley

Rub the chicken pieces with butter, then broil, 4 to 5 inches away from the heat, for 20 minutes, turning often.  When lightly browned, put in a kettle with the giblets, and all the rest of the ingredients except for the lemon juice, egg yolks and cream.  Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 1 hour or more (less for fryers), until the chicken is tender. 
Remove chicken and giblets from the broth and cool. 
Strain the broth and skim off the fat.  (If you're not serving the soup immediately, you could put the broth in the freezer to make the skimming easier.)  Return broth to kettle and stir in the lemon juice. 
When ready to serve, cut the chicken in big chunks and mince the giblets.  Throw out the bones and skin.  Bring the broth to a simmer, then scrape in the chicken and giblets and return to kettle.  Heat through, covered, for 5 minutes. 
When ready to serve, beat the eggs and cream together, then beat a cup of the simmering broth into the egg cream and whisk the whole mixture back into the kettle.  Simmer at very low heat (lest it curdle!) for 2 to 3 minutes.  Ladle into deep souplates then float a thin lemon slice, sprinkled with parsley, in each one. 
Serve hot as a meal to 8 people -- ideally with boiled potatoes, brown bread, and butter on the side. 
Comments:  Waterzooie or Waterzootsje -- originating in Flanders -- is one of the great national soups of the world.  Belgians are pretty loose with the ingredients, though.  Not only does every family have its own recipe that varies eggs, cream, and lemon -- but some use fish instead of chicken.  In fact, Escoffier himself captured the recipe as a fish and wine soup.  Apparently wine is the ONLY ingredient all these variations have in common -- and even then I have heard of variations that recommend dark Belgian beer instead of wine.  This particular recipe, however, is made for the hearts and stomachs of poultry lovers -- it is chicken times a thousand, and wonderfully silky and rich to boot.  And just exactly what does Waterzooie mean?  I hunted for weeks to find out.  It translates to "a simmering, watery thing."  In other words, eggs and cream notwithstanding, the broth should not be too thick.

  4              thick  leeks -- minus the roots
                        and dark green, chopped
  2             slices  bacon
  6               cups  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Saute the bacon until crisp -- remove it and reserve.  Add the chopped leeks to the bacon grease and stir to coat for about 2 minutes, until they take on a little golden color. 
Pour in the stock, bring to a boil, and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. 
Remove from heat.  Puree, bring to a boil, season to taste, then ladle into bowls and top with crumbled bacon and fresh circles of leek. 
Comments:  This traditional Welsh leek broth hearkens back to King Cadwallader's defeat of the Saxons in the 5th century; served to 4 as a first course, it will strengthen the heart cords of anyone with Welsh blood.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     onions -- chopped
  1                cup  peanut butter
  4               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  1                can  tomatoes - (16 oz) -- cut in pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper flakes -- or less to taste
  2               cups  finely-chopped cabbage
  3                     sweet potatoes -- chopped
  4                     carrots -- chopped
  2                     turnips -- chopped
  12             whole  okra, fresh or frozen -- with stems trimmed
  2               cups  cooked chicken in big chunks -- (to 3 cups)

In a large pot, fry the onion in the oil until soft, about 3 minutes.  Reduce the heat to medium and stir in 1 cup of the stock. 
Whisk in the peanut butter, then stir in the rest of the stock, the tomatoes with their juice, salt and pepper to taste, and the hot pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and let simmer for 30 minutes. 
Stir in the cabbage, sweet potatoes, carrots, and turnips, bring back to a boil, then reduce heat again, cover, and cook for 20 more minutes. 
Stir in the okra and chicken chunks, cover, and let stew for 30 minutes. 
To serve, gather your guests around a table and invite them to dig in, right hands only.  Or ladle it out into individual soup bowls and serve with cornbread or the traditional fried cornmeal mush. 
Serve hot as a meal to 6 to 8 people -- ideally with sadza, or fried cornmeal mush. 
Comments:  This ceremonial dish for special occasions in Zimbabwe villages is a "must eat" for anyone who loves good food.  It's rich and sweet, thick and succulent -- not to mention piquant! -- with an unusual and beautiful combination of vegetables.  Chicken is expensive in Zimbabwe and only brought out for feasts -- which is to say that vegetarians would not be at all violating the authenticity of the dish by cutting out the chicken and substituting vegetable stock for the chicken stock.  It's traditional to eat this right out of the pot (or from a big serving dish), right hand only.

In a large pot, fry the onion in the oil until soft, about 3 minutes.  Reduce the heat to medium and stir in 1 cup of the stock.

Whisk in the peanut butter, then stir in the rest of the stock, the tomatoes with their juice, salt and pepper to taste, and the hot pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and let simmer for 30 minutes.

Serve hot as a meal to 6 to 8 people -- ideally with sadza, or fried cornmeal mush.

Comments:  This ceremonial dish for special occasions in Zimbabwe villages is a &quot;must eat&quot; for anyone who loves good food.  It&apos;s rich and sweet, thick and succulent -- not to mention piquant! -- with an unusual and beautiful combination of vegetables.  Chicken is expensive in Zimbabwe and only brought out for feasts -- which is to say that vegetarians would not be at all violating the authenticity of the dish by cutting out the chicken and substituting vegetable stock for the chicken stock.  It&apos;s traditional to eat this right out of the pot (or from a big serving dish), right hand only.
