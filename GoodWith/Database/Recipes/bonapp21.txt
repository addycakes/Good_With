                        === ICE CREAM ===
  2 1/4           cups  whipping cream
  1                cup  whole milk
     1/4           cup  malted milk powder

  5              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  brandy
                        === BOURBON HOT FUDGE SAUCE ===
  1                cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  instant espresso powder
                        = (or instant coffee powder)
  10            ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/2           cup  bourbon
                        === DRIED CHERRY TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  Merlot
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  dried tart cherries
                        Sweetened whipped cream

For Ice Cream:  Whisk first 3 ingredients in medium saucepan to blend.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Bring to simmer.  Whisk yolks and sugar in bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in hot cream mixture; return to saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until mixture coats back of spoon, about 3 minutes (do not boil).  Stir in brandy; chill until cold.

Process custard in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer ice cream to container; cover and freeze until firm.

For Bourbon Hot Fudge Sauce:  Whisk cocoa powder and sugar in heavy large saucepan to blend.  Gradually whisk in water and espresso powder.  Whisk over medium heat until mixture comes to boil.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate; whisk until smooth.  Whisk in bourbon.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.  Rewarm over low heat until just pourable.)

For Dried Cherry Topping:  Stir wine and sugar in medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Add cherries; simmer until liquid is almost evaporated, about 20 minutes.

Divide half of hot fudge sauce among 8 cups.  Top with a few cherries, then scoop of ice cream.  Repeat layering with ice cream, sauce, and cherries.  Top each with whipped cream and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Homemade malted vanilla-bean ice cream is layered with a bittersweet chocolate sauce and drunken dried cherries.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  12       tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut small pieces
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  3        tablespoons  ground amaretti cookies -- see * Note
                        = (from about 3 cookies)
  1 3/4           cups  apricot or fig jam
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend

* Note:  Italian macaroons, available at Italian markets and some supermarkets.

Blend flour, sugar, lemon peel, baking powder, and salt in processor until combined.  Add butter; using on/off turns, cut in until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 2 eggs; using on/off turns, process until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball.  Flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate overnight.  Let soften slightly before rolling out.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Set aside 1/3 of dough.  Roll out remaining dough on lightly floured surface to 14-inch round.  Transfer to prepared tart pan.  Trim overhang to 1 inch.  Fold in dough to make double-thick sides.  Freeze crust 15 minutes.  Sprinkle amaretti crumbs in crust.  Spoon jam into crust, smoothing with spatula.

Roll out reserved dough to 11- by 6-inch rectangle.  Cut into eight 1/2-inch-wide strips.  Arrange strips atop jam to form lattice.  Brush lattice with beaten egg.

Bake tart until crust is golden, about 45 minutes.  Cool at least 6 hours to allow jam to set.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  "My mother's favorite restaurant in Sacramento is Biba," writes Grace Bannor, San Francisco, CA.  "She claims it's the most authentic Italian food she has tasted outside her native Florence.  Whenever the jam tart is on the menu, it's a must-have for my mother.  If I had the recipe, I could make it for her next birthday."

  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                     onion -- chopped
     1/3           cup  vermouth
  2           packages  frozen artichoke hearts - (8 oz ea)
  3               cups  low-salt chicken broth
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  crumbled blue cheese - (abt 2 oz)

Comments:  Holly Gustafson of Shaker Heights, Ohio, writes: "Noggins Restaurant, Raw Bar & Pub is a great restaurant in my neighborhood that serves the most wonderful artichoke-blue cheese bisque.  I've searched many cooking Web sites for something similar, but I can't find anything close to it.  Can you help me get the real recipe?"

The blue cheese adds a pungent note to this silky, warming soup.

This Middle Eastern eggplant spread is also a delicious dip for raw vegetables.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5 1/2         pounds  boneless country-style pork ribs -- excess fat trimmed,
                        cut into 2" to 3" pieces
  2               cans  low-salt chicken broth - (14 oz ea)
  1              large  garlic head -- peeled, chopped
  2                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
                        Mojo Sauce -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine pork, broth, half of garlic, bay leaves, salt, and pepper in large ovenproof pot.  Cover tightly; bake until pork is very tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes.

Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to bowl.  Boil liquid in pot until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 30 minutes.  Return pork to pot; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and remaining garlic; sautÈ until onion is tender and golden brown, about 12 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Transfer pork to plates; spoon some pan juices over.  Top with sautÈed onion mixture.  Serve with Mojo Sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a simplified version of Havana Harry's recipe; at the restaurant, they deep-fry the pork after braising it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2               cups  stout
                        = (such as Guinness)
  2               cups  unsalted butter - (4 sticks)
  1 1/2           cups  unsweetened cocoa powder
                        = (preferably Dutch-process)
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking soda
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  4              large  eggs
  1 1/3           cups  sour cream
                        === ICING ===
  2               cups  whipping cream
  1              pound  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter three 8-inch round cake pans with 2-inch-high sides.  Line with parchment paper.  Butter paper.  Bring 2 cups stout and 2 cups butter to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add cocoa powder and whisk until mixture is smooth.  Cool slightly.

Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in large bowl to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat eggs and sour cream in another large bowl to blend.  Add stout-chocolate mixture to egg mixture and beat just to combine.  Add flour mixture and beat briefly on slow speed.  Using rubber spatula, fold batter until completely combined.

Divide batter equally among prepared pans.  Bake cakes until tester inserted into center of cakes comes out clean, about 35 minutes.  Transfer cakes to rack; cool 10 minutes.  Turn cakes out onto rack and cool completely.

For Icing:  Bring cream to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add chopped chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth.  Refrigerate until icing is spreadable, stirring frequently, about 2 hours.

Place 1 cake layer on plate.  Spread 2/3 cup icing over.  Top with second cake layer.  Spread 2/3 cup icing over.  Top with third cake layer.  Spread remaining icing over top and sides of cake.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  "I am a lifelong chocoholic and have eaten many a piece of chocolate cake," writes Elizabeth Means of Williamsburg, Massachusetts.  "Never before, though, have I enjoyed anything as much as the chocolate stout cake at the Barrington Brewery in nearby Great Barrington.  If I could get a copy of this recipe, I would be eternally grateful."

The dark beer known as stout gives this cake an intense, not-too-sweet flavor.

Comments:  &quot;I am a lifelong chocoholic and have eaten many a piece of chocolate cake,&quot; writes Elizabeth Means of Williamsburg, Massachusetts.  &quot;Never before, though, have I enjoyed anything as much as the chocolate stout cake at the Barrington Brewery in nearby Great Barrington.  If I could get a copy of this recipe, I would be eternally grateful.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
The dark beer known as stout gives this cake an intense, not-too-sweet flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  whipping cream
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1                     dried ancho chili with seeds -- stemmed, chopped
  1              pinch  ground cumin
     1/3           cup  sugar -- plus
  6          teaspoons  sugar
  6             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine first 4 ingredients and 1/3 cup sugar in heavy large saucepan and bring to boil, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate; whisk until melted and smooth.

Whisk egg yolks in large bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in hot chocolate mixture.  Divide custard among eight 3/4-cup custard cups or soufflÈ dishes.

Place cups in heavy large baking pan.  Add enough hot water to pan to come halfway up sides of cups.  Bake custards until almost set in center, about 35 minutes.  Remove cups from water and cool completely.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat broiler.  Mix remaining 6 teaspoons sugar and ground cinnamon in small bowl.  Sprinkle sugar mixture over custards.  Broil until sugar melts and caramelizes, watching carefully and turning often, about 2 minutes.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Refrigerate.)  Transfer to plates and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  In this intriguing twist on a delicious and popular dessert, the ancho chilies add a touch of earthy heat.  This deep-reddish-brown chili is available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  3        tablespoons  chilled solid vegetable shortening -- cut small pieces
  4        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2              large  eggs
  1              large  egg yolk
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
  1 1/2           cups  sweetened flaked coconut
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/8      teaspoon  coconut extract
                        === TOPPING ===
     2/3           cup  sweetened flaked coconut
  1 1/4           cups  chilled whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  coconut extract

For Crust:  Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Add butter and shortening; using on/off turns, cut in until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Drizzle 4 tablespoons ice water over mixture.  Process just until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic.  Chill 1 hour.

Roll out dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap to 14-inch round.  Transfer dough to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Fold overhang under.  Crimp edges decoratively.  Pierce bottom of crust all over with fork.  Freeze crust 15 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep frozen.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line crust with aluminum foil.  Fill with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake 20 minutes.  Remove weights and foil.  Bake until golden and set, about 10 minutes.  Cool.  (Crust can be made 1 day ahead.  Wrap tightly with plastic wrap.  Let stand at room temperature.)

For Filling:  Whisk 1/2 cup sugar, eggs, egg yolk, and flour in medium bowl.  Bring milk and coconut to simmer in medium saucepan over medium heat.  Gradually add hot milk mixture to egg mixture, whisking constantly.  Return to same saucepan; cook until pastry cream thickens and boils, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes.

Remove from heat.  Mix in vanilla and coconut extracts.  Transfer pastry cream to medium bowl.  Press plastic wrap directly onto surface to prevent formation of skin.  Chill until cold, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.  Transfer filling to crust.  Cover; chill overnight.

For Topping:  Toast coconut in heavy small skillet over medium heat until lightly browned, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes.  Cool completely.

Using electric mixer, beat cream, sugar, and coconut extract in medium bowl until peaks form.  Spread whipped cream all over top of filling.  Sprinkle evenly with toasted coconut.  (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)  Serve cold.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MERINGUE ===
  2               cups  sweetened flaked coconut
  6              large  egg whites
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  cider vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  boiling water
                        === MOUSSE ===
  2              large  eggs -- separated
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- cut small pieces,
                        and at room temperature
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  dark rum
  4             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips -- (abt 2/3 cup)
     3/4           cup  chilled whipping cream
  2                     bananas -- cut 1/4"-thk rounds

For Meringue:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Spread 1 1/2 cups coconut on large baking sheet.  Toast until golden, stirring twice, about 15 minutes.  Cool.  Maintain oven temperature.

Line another large baking sheet with foil.  Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and next 4 ingredients in large bowl until foamy.  Gradually add sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.  Beat in 1/4 cup boiling water, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until whites are stiff and glossy.  Fold in 1 cup toasted coconut.  Spoon meringue onto center of prepared baking sheet and spread to 9-inch-diameter circle with slightly raised edges.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup untoasted coconut.

Bake meringue 10 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees and bake until dry and crisp outside and just cooked through inside, about 1 hour.  Turn off oven.  Let meringue stand in oven 1 hour.  Remove from oven and cool completely.

For Mousse:  Whisk egg yolks, 2 tablespoons sugar, butter, 2 tablespoons water, and rum in medium metal bowl to blend.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water).  Whisk until thermometer inserted into mixture registers 160 degrees, about 6 minutes.  Add chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth.  Turn off heat; leave bowl over water.

Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add 2 tablespoons sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.  Fold 1/3 of egg whites into chocolate mixture to lighten.  Fold in remaining whites.  Remove from over water and let mousse cool 20 minutes.

Beat whipping cream in large bowl until peaks form.  Place meringue on platter.  Spread mousse over center of meringue; top with sliced bananas.  Spread whipped cream over bananas and chill at least 20 minutes and up to 3 hours.

Sprinkle with remaining toasted coconut.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  A chewy coconut meringue "crust" and rich chocolate mousse filling make this delicious, inventive Australian dessert taste like a combination of coconut cream pie and chocolate cream pie.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  4          teaspoons  chili-garlic sauce
  3 1/2      teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped red bell pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  chopped red onion
  2        tablespoons  chopped seeded jalapeÒo chili
  1              pound  crabmeat -- coarsely chopped
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
  5               cups  fresh breadcrumbs
                        = (made from crustless French bread)

Mix mayonnaise, chili-garlic sauce, and 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice in small bowl.  Cover and refrigerate chili mayonnaise.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add bell pepper, celery, onion, and jalapeÒo; sautÈ 3 minutes.  Transfer to large bowl.  Mix in crab, egg, 1/2 cup chili mayonnaise, and remaining 2 teaspoons lemon juice, then 1 1/2 cups breadcrumbs.

Form crab mixture into eight 1/2-inch-thick cakes, using 1/2 cup for each.  Dredge cakes in remaining 3 1/2 cups breadcrumbs, turning to coat.  Place on baking sheet.  Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours.

Comments:  These crab cakes get an extra kick from the chili-garlic sauce, available in the Asian foods section of most supermarkets.

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal cake pan.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup almonds and 1/2 cup pecans over bottom of pan.

Combine cake mix, 1 1/4 cups water, oil, and eggs in large bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat at low speed until mixture is moistened, about 30 seconds.  Beat at medium speed 2 minutes.  Pour batter into pan.

Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Gradually stir in powdered sugar (mixture will form clumps); stir in cream cheese.  Whisk until smooth, about 1 minute.  Pour cream cheese mixture in large ribbons atop cake batter in pan.  Using knife, swirl mixture into batter (do not overmix).

Bake cake until tester inserted into center (in cake part only) comes out clean, about 50 minutes (bottom of cake will be very moist).  Cool cake in pan on rack.  Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup almonds and 1/2 cup pecans over cake.

For Icing:  Mix sugar and cocoa in medium bowl.  Bring milk and butter to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Reduce heat to medium-low; add powdered sugar mixture and whisk until melted.  Add chocolate chips and whisk until smooth.  Mix in vanilla.

Drizzle warm icing over cake.  Let stand until set, about 2 hours.  Drizzle caramel topping over.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; store at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

  2 1/4           cups  low-salt chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
     1/2           cup  quick-cooking hominy grits - (3 oz)
     3/4           cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  diced drained oil-packed
                        sun-dried tomatoes - (2 1/2 oz)
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

                        Chopped fresh chives -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass baking dish.

Bring broth, 2 tablespoons butter, and garlic to boil in heavy medium saucepan.  Gradually whisk in grits and return mixture to boil, whisking occasionally.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until grits are thick and almost all broth is absorbed, whisking frequently, about 8 minutes.

Whisk in 1/2 cup cream and simmer 5 minutes, whisking occasionally.  Whisk in remaining 1/4 cup cream and simmer until very thick, stirring often, about 5 minutes longer.  Stir in tomatoes and thyme.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Comments:  "At the Charleston Grill in Charleston, South Carolina, we were overwhelmed by how delicious the grits were," write Neil and Judy Kleinman of Pasadena, California.  "This spectacular side dish was made with goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes, and was served in a small skillet."

  3               cups  water
  2               cups  plain couscous - (12 oz)
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped roasted salted cashews
     1/4           cup  dried currants

                        Peach Chutney -- (see recipe)

For yogurt: Combine cilantro, lime juice, and salt in processor; blend to coarse puree.  Transfer to medium bowl; mix in yogurt and sour cream.  Season with pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)

For vegetables:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Spray 2 large baking sheets with nonstick spray.  Mound eggplant cubes on 1 sheet; drizzle with 4 tablespoons oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss to coat.  Spread out evenly.

Mound zucchini on second sheet; drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss to coat.  Spread out evenly.

Roast eggplant and zucchini until golden and tender, turning occasionally with spatula, about 25 minutes for zucchini and 50 minutes for eggplant.  Transfer vegetables to bowl and cool.

Meanwhile, char peppers directly over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag; let stand 10 minutes.  Peel and seed peppers.  Cut 2 peppers into 1-inch pieces.  Thinly slice remaining pepper and reserve for garnish.

For couscous:  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion; sautÈ until soft, about 6 minutes.  Mix in curry powder; stir 1 minute.  Add 3 cups water; bring to simmer.  Cover; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer curry water 10 minutes.

Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large pot.  Add couscous and stir constantly until color darkens and couscous is toasted, about 3 minutes.  Mix in hot curry water.  Turn off heat, cover pot, and let stand until couscous is tender and curry water is absorbed, about 10 minutes.

Fluff couscous with fork to separate grains.  Mix in cashews and currants and cool completely.  Mix in eggplant, zucchini, and bell pepper pieces. Season salad to taste with salt and pepper.

Mound salad on large platter; garnish with reserved bell pepper slices.  Serve with cilantro yogurt and chutney.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Here's a hot Indian meal interpreted as an exotic and refreshing meatless salad.

                   Flans With Marsala And Caramel Sauce

Recipe By     :Chef Jason Corrigan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whipping cream
     3/4           cup  sugar
  5        tablespoons  sweet Marsala
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  3              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  purchased caramel sauce

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Arrange six 3/4-cup custard cups or ramekins in 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan.

Combine cream, sugar, 2 tablespoons Marsala, and lemon peel in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over medium heat just until sugar dissolves (cream will be only lukewarm).  Remove from heat.

Whisk eggs and yolks in medium bowl until well blended.  Whisk in cream mixture, then vanilla.  Pour custard into cups, dividing equally.  Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of custard cups.

Bake flans until softly set in center, about 35 minutes.  Remove flans from water bath and refrigerate uncovered until very cold and firm, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.

Using knife, cut around flans in cups to loosen.  Invert onto plates, shaking to dislodge if necessary.  Stir caramel sauce in small saucepan over medium heat until warm, about 2 minutes.  Whisk in remaining 3 tablespoons Marsala.  Serve flans with caramel sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Jason Corrigan, of A Touch of Garlic in Springfield, Massachusetts, writes: "As the chef at a small Italian restaurant, I have only two nights per week off.  That's when I like to come up with simple dishes that my four-year-old daughter and I can make together at home.  Well, mostly she just does a lot of pouring and stirring, but she loves to help.  I hope one day her younger sister will, too."

Make and chill these a day ahead for a treat that doesn't require much last-minute effort.

Comments:  "I literally didn't know how to boil an egg until I was in my 20s -- when I tried to impress a guy by making dinner for him," writes Sally Siegel of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  "I didn't have much success with the dinner or the guy, but I regrouped and put together a repertoire of fairly elegant dishes I felt confident making.  Over the years, my cooking style has become more casual; I make dishes that are not too demanding, but still special for company."

  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1                cup  boiling water
  1                cup  vegetable oil
                        Purchased caramel sauce -- warmed
                        Whipped cream -- for serving

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour 12-cup Bundt pan.

Sift first 5 ingredients into medium bowl.  Whisk molasses, sugar, sour cream, eggs, and vanilla in large bowl until well blended.  Whisk in 1 cup boiling water and oil, then dry ingredients.  Pour batter into prepared pan.

Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.  Cool in pan on rack 20 minutes.  Turn out onto plate; cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and store at room temperature.)  Cut cake into wedges.  Serve with warm caramel sauce and whipped cream.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  David Barber, chef at Three Square Grill in Portland, Oregon, writes: "My restaurant may not be located in the trendiest part of town, but we have a neighborhood following of customers who appreciate my house-made bread, lox, bacon, sausage, preserves, and pickles."

This Bundt-cake gingerbread is moist, rich, and decadent -- no wonder it's Three Square Grill's signature dessert.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  6                     lamb shanks - (12 to 14 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1              large  carrot -- chopped
  6              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  3                     drained canned anchovies
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  2              small  bay leaves
  2                     fresh thyme sprigs
  5                     juniper berries
                        = (or 2 tablespoons gin)
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1             bottle  Merlot - (750 ml)
  1                can  low-salt chicken broth - (14 oz)
  1                can  low-salt beef broth - (14 oz)

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Heat oil in large ovenproof pot (wide enough to hold lamb in single layer) over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle lamb on all sides with salt and pepper.  Add lamb to pot and sautÈ until brown, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Transfer lamb to plate.

Add next 10 ingredients to pot.  SautÈ until vegetables brown, about 20 minutes.  Mix in tomato paste.  Add wine and all broth; boil until liquid is reduced by half, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Return lamb to pot, arranging in single layer; add any accumulated juices.  Bring to boil.

Place lamb in oven and cook uncovered until tender, basting and turning occasionally, about 2 hours.  Transfer lamb to plate.

Skim any fat from top of roasting liquid.  Press all liquid and enough of vegetables through sieve set over large bowl to make sauce with gravy consistency.

Return gravy to pot; add lamb.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.)  Rewarm lamb over low heat.  Transfer to platter and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  At the restaurant, orzo (rice-shaped pasta) is served alongside the gravy-rich lamb.

  4        tablespoons  drained capers
  2              large  tomatoes -- thinly sliced
  1              small  red onion -- thinly sliced
  4              large  romaine lettuce leaves

* Note:  A dried herb mixture available at specialty foods stores and in the spice section of some supermarkets.  A combination of dried thyme, basil, savory, and fennel seeds can be substituted.

Using meat mallet, pound chicken breasts between sheets of plastic wrap to 3/4-inch thickness.  Combine 1/3 cup oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, herbes de Provence, and half of garlic in large resealable plastic bag.  Add chicken to bag; shake to coat with marinade.  Chill at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Remove chicken from marinade; shake off excess.  Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.  Grill chicken until cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.  Cool.  Cut chicken on diagonal into 1/2- to 3/4-inch-thick slices.

Whisk anchovy paste, remaining 4 tablespoons lemon juice, and remaining garlic in small bowl.  Gradually whisk in remaining 3/4 cup oil.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.

Cut both bread loaves horizontally in half.  Pull out and discard soft interior crumbs from top halves, leaving 1/2-inch-thick shell; drizzle 1/4 cup dressing over inside of each top.  Drizzle 1/4 cup dressing over inside of each bottom half; sprinkle 2 tablespoons capers in each.  Divide chicken, tomatoes, onion, and lettuce between sandwiches.  Cover with tops, pressing to compact.

Wrap sandwiches in foil, then place heavy skillet or food cans on top to weigh down.  Refrigerate at least 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.)

Cut each sandwich into quarters and serve cold or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A ProvenÁal specialty, pan bagnat is literally a sandwich with "bathed bread" -- that is, the loaf of bread is split and drizzled with olive oil and/or a vinaigrette before being filled with other ingredients.  In this version, grilled chicken stands in for the traditional tuna.  Begin these sandwiches at least four hours and up to one day before serving.  Get the picnic started with a selection of cheeses, salami, and crackers.

What to drink:  A light red, slightly chilled, such as a Beaujolais or Bandol RosÈ.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cans  low-salt chicken broth - (14 oz ea)
  1                cup  orange juice
     1/2           cup  sugar
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  tamarind paste -- see * Note
  4          teaspoons  grated orange peel
  4          teaspoons  grated peeled fresh ginger
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  raw long-grain white rice -- cooked

* Note:  Tamarind paste, a tart, seedless paste, is available at Middle Eastern, Indian, and some Asian markets.

Place chicken in shallow bowl.  Whisk next 5 ingredients in medium bowl.  Pour over chicken; turn to coat.  Cover; chill at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours, turning often.

Whisk broth, juice, sugar, 3 tablespoons butter, tamarind paste, peel, and ginger in large saucepan.  Boil mixture over medium-high heat until reduced to 3/4 cup and glaze coats back of spoon, stirring often, about 25 minutes.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cool glaze, then cover and chill.  Rewarm over medium heat, whisking occasionally.)  Whisk in 3 tablespoons butter.  Season glaze with salt and pepper.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Reserve 1/4 cup glaze in bowl.  Grill chicken until cooked through, basting with reserved glaze, about 5 minutes per side.  Arrange chicken atop rice on platter.  Spoon remaining glaze over chicken.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Tamarind paste, from a pod with a sweet-tangy pulp, is common in Hawaiian cooking.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  shredded four-cheese mix
                        = (or pizza cheese)
  2        tablespoons  Italian-style dry breadcrumbs
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced fresh basil
  1             medium  eggplant - (abt 1 lb) -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1/2"-thick slices
  8             ounces  plum tomatoes -- thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  garlic-flavored olive oil
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Stir cheese mix, breadcrumbs, and 1/3 cup basil in medium bowl to blend.

Transfer eggplant slices to plates.  Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons basil and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Round out this meatless -- but hearty -- main course with a big spoonful of deli pasta salad on a bed of arugula, and end with purchased tiramis˘ topped with berries.

                        into 1/4"-thick slices
  3                     celery stalks -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped pitted large green
                        Sicilian olives
                        = ( or other brine-cured green olives)

Combine 1/2 cup dill, 1/2 cup olive oil, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, shallot, and 2 teaspoons lemon peel in large bowl; whisk to blend.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add chicken and stir to coat.  Marinate at room temperature 1 hour or chill up to 8 hours, turning chicken occasionally.

Combine mayonnaise, sour cream, 1/4 cup dill, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon peel in small bowl; whisk to blend.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover and chill until ready to use.

Steam potatoes until just tender, about 12 minutes.  Transfer to large bowl; sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Combine zucchini slices and 2 tablespoons olive oil in medium bowl.  Sprinkle with salt; toss to coat.

Heat grill pan or large ridged cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot, about 4 minutes.  Working in batches, grill zucchini slices until just crisp-tender, about 1 minute per side; transfer to plate.

Grill chicken until brown and cooked through, about 6 minutes per side.  Transfer to work surface; cool 15 minutes.  Cut chicken into 1/2-inch cubes; add to potatoes in bowl.  Mix in celery, olives, and dressing; season with salt and pepper.

Overlap zucchini slices around edge of platter.  Mound chicken salad in center.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A grill pan is just the thing for cooking the chicken and zucchini in this recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ORANGE-CHIPOTLE MAYONNAISE ===
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  orange juice
  1         tablespoon  minced canned chipotle chilies
                        === JERK SAUCE ===
  1              bunch  green onions -- coarsely chopped
                        = (abt 1 1/2 cups)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1              small  habaÒero chili -- seeded, chopped
                        = (or 2 medium jalapeÒo chilies)
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  ground allspice
                        === BURGERS ===
  2             pounds  ground beef (15% fat)
  6                     sesame-seed hamburger buns -- toasted
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  3                     tomatoes -- sliced
  6                     romaine lettuce leaves

For Orange-Chipotle Mayonnaise:  Mix all ingredients in small bowl.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

For Jerk Sauce:  Finely chop first 4 ingredients in processor.  Add sugar and next 3 ingredients; process until almost smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.

For the Burgers:  Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Set aside 3/4 cup jerk sauce.  Shape ground beef into six 1/2- to 3/4-inch-thick patties; place in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Pour 1/2 cup jerk sauce over patties and turn to coat; let stand 20 minutes.

Sprinkle patties with salt and pepper.  Grill to desired doneness, brushing occasionally with remaining jerk sauce, about 4 minutes per side for medium.

Spread mayonnaise over cut surfaces of buns.  Place burgers on bottom halves of buns.  Top with onion slices, tomato slices, lettuce, and bun tops.  Serve, passing reserved 3/4 cup jerk sauce separately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

                Javanese Roasted Salmon And Wilted Spinach

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- plus
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2          teaspoons  water
  8                     salmon fillets - (7 oz ea)
  2                     bags baby spinach - (6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Melt 1/2 cup butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add crushed red pepper and garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add sugar; whisk until mixture is melted and smooth and begins to bubble, about 4 minutes.  Whisk in lime juice and soy sauce.  Increase heat and boil until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 2 minutes.  Add cornstarch mixture and boil until thick, about 3 minutes.  Set sauce aside.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over high heat.  Working in batches, cook salmon until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer to baking sheet.  Spoon 1 tablespoon sauce over each fillet.  Roast until fish is opaque in center, about 5 minutes.

Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in large pot over medium-high heat.  Add spinach and toss until wilted but still bright green, about 3 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Using tongs, divide spinach among 8 plates.  Top each with salmon fillet; drizzle with remaining sauce and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  "Although I'm not usually a big fan of fish, I love the roasted salmon at the Saucebox here in Portland," writes Irin Haruchai of Portland, Oregon.  "The sauce served with it is out of this world."

Spicy sauces with sweet-and-sour flavors are popular in Javanese food and, in this case, pair deliciously with salmon.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  water
  1              piece  vanilla bean - (4" long) -- split lengthwise
  8        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1           teaspoon  unflavored gelatin
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  chilled heavy whipping cream
  2          teaspoons  grated lime peel

Combine sugar and 3/4 cup water in heavy small saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Bring mixture to simmer over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Simmer until syrup thickens and is reduced to 1 1/4 cups, about 8 minutes.  Cool to room temperature.  Discard vanilla bean.  Transfer 1/2 cup syrup to small bowl.  Whisk in 1 tablespoon lime juice.  Cover lime-vanilla syrup and chill.

Mix gelatin and remaining 7 tablespoons lime juice in small bowl.  Let stand until gelatin softens, about 10 minutes.  Add to syrup in saucepan.  Stir over low heat just until gelatin dissolves, about 5 minutes (do not boil).

Using electric mixer, beat eggs in large stainless steel bowl at high speed until mixture falls in heavy ribbon when beaters are lifted, about 6 minutes.  Gradually beat in warm lime syrup.  Place bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water); beat until thermometer registers 140 degrees for 3 minutes, about 5 minutes total.  Place bowl over larger bowl of ice water; beat syrup mixture until cold, about 3 minutes.

Beat whipping cream in medium bowl until peaks form.  Fold into syrup mixture in 2 additions.  Fold in lime peel.  Cover mousse and refrigerate until set, at least 6 hours and up to 1 day.

Using 2 large soup spoons, form mousse into 12 egg-shaped "dumplings," placing 2 on each of 6 plates.  Spoon lime-vanilla syrup over mousse and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  cooked lobster meat -- torn bite size
  3        tablespoons  mayonnaise
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  butter -- room temperature
  2                     hot dog rolls
     1/2          head  butter lettuce -- thinly sliced

Combine lobster meat and mayonnaise in medium bowl.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Butter outside surfaces of hot dog rolls.  Heat medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Place rolls, 1 buttered-side down, in skillet; cook until browned slightly, about 2 minutes per side.  Open rolls.  Fill with lettuce, then lobster mixture, and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Owner Dick Varano knows a thing or two about traditional New England lobster rolls: He sells about 20,000 of them a year.  His customers love this dish so much that it's the only recipe he hasn't changed since he bought the restaurant 13 years ago.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COOKIES ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  golden raisins - (abt 4 oz)
                        Powdered sugar -- for dusting
                        === ZABAGLIONE ===
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/3           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  Italian Moscato or Essencia

For Cookies:  Using electric mixer, beat butter and 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in lemon peel and salt, then egg yolks.  Beat in cornmeal, then flour.  Stir in raisins.  Knead dough just to combine; transfer to sheet of plastic wrap.  Using plastic, form dough into 2- by 9-inch log.  Chill until firm, 3 hours or up to 1 day.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Slice dough log into 1/4-inch-thick rounds.  Arrange rounds on prepared baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart and reshaping into rounds if uneven.  Bake cookies until golden at edges, about 15 minutes.  Transfer to rack.  Dust with powdered sugar and cool completely.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

For Zabaglione:  Whisk egg yolks and sugar in large metal bowl to blend; gradually whisk in Moscato.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bowl to touch water).  Whisk until mixture is thick and foamy and thermometer inserted into mixture registers 160 degrees, about 4 minutes.  Divide zabaglione among 6 wineglasses.  Serve immediately, passing cookies alongside.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  If you can't find Italian Moscato, substitute Essencia, the Muscat-based dessert wine made in California.  Serve this rich custard with the raisin-studded cookies featured here.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarse salt
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (105 to 115 deg)
  1           teaspoon  dry yeast
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  honey
                        === TOPPINGS ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1                     red onion - (12 oz) -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              large  red bell pepper
                        === BAKING ===
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed
  1                cup  coarsely-grated whole-milk mozzarella
                        cheese - (packed)
  3        tablespoons  coarsely-grated Parmesan cheese
  4             slices  prosciutto - (thin) -- sliced crosswise
                        into thin strips
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
                        Balsamic vinegar -- as needed

For Dough:  Mix flour and salt in large bowl.  Place 1/2 cup warm water in small bowl.  Sprinkle yeast over water and stir to blend.  Let stand until dissolved, about 10 minutes.  Pour yeast mixture into bowl with flour.  Add oil and honey.  Using flexible spatula, stir until coarse dough forms.  Knead dough in bowl with 1 hand until smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes.  Cover bowl; let dough stand 30 minutes.  Refrigerate dough in bowl, still covered, at least 2 hours (dough will rise very little).  (Can be made 2 days ahead; keep refrigerated.)

For Toppings:  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until golden, about 12 minutes.  Add vinegar and Worcestershire sauce.  Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until liquid cooks away and onion is very tender, about 4 minutes; season onion with salt and pepper.

Heat remaining 1/2 cup oil in heavy small skillet over medium-low heat.  Add garlic and sautÈ just until garlic begins to brown, about 4 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer garlic to custard cup.  Pour oil into separate small bowl.

Char bell pepper over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag; let stand 10 minutes.  Peel, seed, and slice thinly.  (Onion, garlic, garlic oil, and pepper can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately; chill.)

For Baking:  Place chilled dough ball on work surface.  Cover with plastic wrap; let stand at room temperature until malleable, about 1 hour.

Position rack in bottom third of oven.  Place heavy large baking sheet on rack (invert sheet if rimmed).  Preheat oven to 500 degrees at least 30 minutes.

Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round, allowing dough to rest a few minutes if it springs back.  Sprinkle flour on pizza paddle or another rimless baking sheet.  Slide under dough.  Brush 1 tablespoon reserved garlic oil over dough, leaving 1/2-inch plain border.  Sprinkle with mozzarella, then reserved garlic and balsamic onion.  Top with pepper strips in spoke pattern.  Sprinkle with Parmesan.  Slide knife under dough to loosen from paddle, if sticking.

Position paddle at far edge of hot baking sheet in oven.  Tilt paddle and pull back slowly, allowing pizza to slide onto sheet.  Bake 6 minutes.  Rotate pizza half a turn.  Bake until crust is deep brown, about 6 minutes longer.  Arrange prosciutto atop pizza.  Bake until prosciutto softens, about 30 seconds.  Using paddle, transfer pizza to board.  Sprinkle with thyme.  Cut into 8 wedges.  Serve, passing more vinegar and garlic oil separately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  For a meatless pizza, skip the prosciutto and add sautÈed sliced portobello mushrooms.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  No stone?  No paddle?  No problem.  Preheat a heavy baking sheet to stand in for the pizza stone.  And instead of a pizza paddle, you can easily use a large rimless baking sheet to transfer the pizza into and out of the hot oven.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
  2                     frozen lobster tails - (10 to 12 oz ea) -- thawed
  8             ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  thinly sliced fresh basil - (packed)
  6                     green onions -- thinly sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1 1/3           cups  whipping cream
  1             bottle  clam juice - (8 oz)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12            ounces  fettuccine
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Asiago cheese - (abt 1 oz)

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add lobster tails and sautÈ until shells are bright red in spots, about 5 minutes.  Cover skillet; reduce heat to low and cook until lobster is cooked through, about 6 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Using slotted spoon, transfer lobster to work surface.  Using heavy large knife, cut each tail lengthwise in half.  Remove meat from shell.  Cut meat crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces.

Return same skillet to medium-high heat (do not clean).  Add mushrooms, half of basil, green onions, and garlic; sautÈ until mushrooms soften, about 5 minutes.  Add cream and clam juice.  Boil until sauce is slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to low.  Add lobster (or shrimp if using) and simmer 1 minute.  Stir in remaining basil.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite.  Drain well.  Return to pot.  Pour sauce over pasta and add cheese; toss over low heat until warmed through, then serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Cele Bullis of Gainesville, Georgia, writes: "My husband and I recently went to a restaurant in Alpharetta, Georgia, called Vinny's on Windward.  He ordered a pasta entrÈe with lobster and cream sauce and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I'd love to make the dish for him.  Can you get the recipe?"

This can be prepared with 20 ounces of large raw shrimp instead of lobster, if you like.  Peel and devein the shrimp, then sautÈ uncovered in butter until opaque in center, about three minutes.  Cut each shrimp lengthwise in half.

  2 1/2         pounds  Italian sweet sausages -- casings removed,
                        and crumbled
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  mushrooms -- thickly sliced
  3               cups  chopped onions
  1 1/2           cups  chopped fresh basil
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh oregano
  6              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                cup  dry white wine
  5               cups  canned crushed tomatoes with added puree
  2               cups  diced tomatoes
                        = (abt 4 medium-large tomatoes)
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/4         pounds  pappardelle or mafaldine pasta
                        = (or any wide, flat noodles)
  1 1/2           cups  grated pecorino Romano cheese -- (abt 4 1/2 oz)

SautÈ sausage in heavy large pot over medium-high heat until brown, about 12 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer sausage to large bowl.

Add oil to drippings in pot.  Add mushrooms and onions; sautÈ until tender and brown, about 15 minutes.  Stir in 1 cup chopped basil, oregano, and garlic; sautÈ 1 minute.

Add wine; cook until almost absorbed, about 4 minutes.  Add sausage and crushed tomatoes; cover and simmer over medium heat until thickened, about 25 minutes.

Add diced tomatoes and butter; simmer until tomatoes are soft, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and refrigerate.  Bring to simmer before continuing.)

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain well; return to pot.  Pour sauce over pasta; toss to coat.  Add 1/2 cup cheese and 1/2 cup basil; toss to combine.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer pasta to serving dish.  Serve, passing remaining cheese separately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  "I used to go to central New Jersey frequently on business and always made time to stop at Eccoqui, an Italian restaurant in Bernardsville," writes Bobbi Reed of Denver, Colorado.  "Since I no longer travel to that area, I miss the restaurant -- and especially the pappardelle con salsiccia."

Try any of your favorite pasta shapes with this sauce.  Pappardelle or mafaldine -- broad, flat noodles with rippled edges -- work particularly well.

For crust:  Blend first 5 ingredients in processor.  Using on/off turns, cut in butter until coarse meal forms.  Add 3 tablespoons ice water and vinegar; using on/off turns, blend until moist clumps form, adding more water if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball.  Flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic; chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 11-inch round.  Transfer to rimless baking sheet.  Cover and refrigerate while preparing filling.

For filling:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Stir sugar and 3 tablespoons water in heavy ovenproof (preferably cast-iron) 9-inch-diameter skillet with 2-inch-high sides over medium heat until sugar dissolves.

Increase heat to high and boil without stirring until syrup turns light amber color, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush, about 6 minutes.  Turn off heat.  Add butter; stir until melted and smooth.  Cool 2 minutes.

Place 1 peach half, rounded-side down, in center of pan.  Arrange peach quarters close together, rounded-side down, in concentric circles around peach half.  Press remaining peach half and quarters, rounded-side down, atop first layer.  Cook over medium heat until caramel is bubbling thickly, about 20 minutes.

Place chilled pastry atop hot fruit.  Let stand 3 minutes to soften.  Tuck dough edges around fruit.  Bake tart until crust is golden and filling thickens and darkens, about 30 minutes.  Cool in pan on rack 10 minutes.  Place platter atop skillet.  Using oven mitts, invert tart onto platter.  Serve warm with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Apples are traditional, but peaches are divine.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  whole milk
     1/2      teaspoon  grated orange peel
  3              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar
                        === FILLING ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray -- as needed
  2                     sheets frozen puff pastry - (17.3-oz pkg) -- thawed
  1              pound  peaches -- peeled, chopped
     1/2           cup  fresh raspberries
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sugar -- plus
  8          teaspoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1              large  egg white -- whisked until
                        frothy

For sauce:  Combine cream, milk, and orange peel in heavy small saucepan.  Bring to simmer.  Remove from heat.  Cover and let steep 15 minutes.

Whisk yolks and sugar in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk warm milk mixture into yolk mixture; return to saucepan.  Cook over medium-low heat until mixture coats back of spoon and leaves path when finger is drawn across, stirring constantly, about 7 minutes (do not boil).  Pour into bowl.  Chill until cold, whisking occasionally, about 3 hours.  (Sauce can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.)

For filling:  Line baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with nonstick spray.  Roll out 1 pastry sheet to 14-inch square.  Using 5-inch-diameter bowl as guide, cut out 4 circles.  Transfer circles to prepared sheet; cover with plastic.  Repeat with second pastry sheet.  Transfer pastry circles to same baking sheet, placing atop plastic wrap.  Freeze 10 minutes.

Toss peaches, raspberries, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, flour, and lemon juice in medium bowl.  Roll out pastry circles on lightly floured surface to 7-inch-diameter rounds.  Place 1/4 cup fruit mixture in center of each round.  Gather dough atop fruit and twist and pinch firmly to enclose completely.  Place on large baking sheet.  Freeze bundles at least 15 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep frozen.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Brush bundles all over with egg white, and sprinkle each with 1 teaspoon sugar.  Bake until golden, about 22 minutes.  Cool on baking sheet on rack at least 10 minutes.

Place 2 tablespoons sauce in center of each of 8 plates.  Place 1 bundle in center of each plate and serve warm.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The sauce is reminiscent of that sentimental summertime favorite, the 50/50 Bar.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  red onion -- thinly sliced
  4              large  garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh rosemary
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems trimmed,
                        caps thickly sliced
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- cut 3/4" cubes
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2 1/2           cups  low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  drained capers
  1              pound  penne pasta
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- for serving

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to medium bowl.

Add 2 tablespoons oil to pot.  Add garlic and rosemary; sautÈ 30 seconds.  Add mushrooms.  Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until mushrooms are soft and brown, stirring often, about 15 minutes.  Transfer to bowl with onion.

Toss chicken in large bowl with enough flour to coat; shake off excess.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in same pot over medium-high heat.  Add chicken; sautÈ until no longer pink, about 5 minutes.  Add 2 1/2 cups broth, wine, and capers.  Bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits.  Add mushroom-onion mixture and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain.  Add pasta to chicken mixture and toss over medium heat until heated through, adding more broth if necessary to moisten.  Transfer pasta to large bowl.  Sprinkle with parsley.  Serve, passing cheese separately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Here's a hearty and satisfying pasta that makes an easy entrÈe for a dinner party.

          Pepper Steak With Port, Zinfandel, And Mushroom Sauce

Recipe By     :Chef Jason Corrigan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  2              large  shallots -- sliced
  1 1/2         pounds  mushrooms -- thickly sliced
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  Zinfandel
     1/2           cup  ruby Port
     1/2           cup  low-salt chicken broth
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/4         pounds  top sirloin steak, abt 3/4" to 1" thick
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shallots; sautÈ 2 minutes.  Add mushrooms; cover and cook 5 minutes.  Uncover and sautÈ until mushrooms are browned, about 10 minutes.  Add flour and stir 1 minute.  Add Zinfandel, Port, and broth.  Boil until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon thinly, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Set aside.

Meanwhile, place steak between sheets of waxed paper.  Using mallet or rolling pin, pound steak to 1/2-inch thickness.  Coat both sides of steak with 3/4 teaspoon pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in another heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add steak to skillet and cook to desired doneness, about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare.

Transfer steak to work surface; do not clean skillet.  Add mushrooom sauce to skillet; bring to simmer, scraping up any browned bits.

Thinly slice steak; transfer to platter.  Spoon mushroom sauce over and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Jason Corrigan, chef at A Touch of Garlic in Springfield, Massachusetts, writes: "In the past, I've worked at large restaurants, catering to hundreds of people every night.  That alone taught me every possible shortcut to speed up the cooking process: For instance, slicing raw potatoes to reduce boiling time, pounding meat thin so it cooks more quickly, and of course, the mise en place -- getting everything prepped so you're just reaching for ingredients at the last minute."

Pounding the meat reduces cooking time.

Comments:  Jason Corrigan, chef at A Touch of Garlic in Springfield, Massachusetts, writes: &quot;In the past, I&apos;ve worked at large restaurants, catering to hundreds of people every night.  That alone taught me every possible shortcut to speed up the cooking process: For instance, slicing raw potatoes to reduce boiling time, pounding meat thin so it cooks more quickly, and of course, the mise en place -- getting everything prepped so you&apos;re just reaching for ingredients at the last minute.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pounding the meat reduces cooking time.

            Phyllo Cups With Chocolate Mousse And Fresh Fruit

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PHYLLO CUPS ===
  9                     fresh phyllo pastry sheets, 17" by 13" ea
                        = (or frozen phyllo sheets -- thawed)
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- melted
  8        tablespoons  sugar - (about)
  8        tablespoons  finely-chopped toasted hazelnuts - (about)
                        === CHOCOLATE MOUSSE ===
  4              large  eggs -- separated
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut 1/2" pieces
     1/4           cup  water
  1           teaspoon  instant espresso powder
  8             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
                        === FRUIT ===
  1 1/2          pints  fresh raspberries
  2                     ripe pears -- peeled, diced

For Phyllo Cups:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Generously butter every other cup in 12-cup muffin pan.

Stack phyllo sheets and halve crosswise, forming eighteen 8 1/2- by 13-inch rectangles.   Place 1 phyllo rectangle on work surface; cover remaining phyllo with plastic wrap and damp cloth to prevent drying.  Brush rectangle with melted butter; sprinkle with 1/2 tablespoon sugar and 1/2 tablespoon hazelnuts.  Place second phyllo rectangle atop first; brush with butter and sprinkle with 1/2 tablespoon sugar and 1/2 tablespoon hazelnuts.  Repeat 3 more times; top with 1 more rectangle and brush with butter, making stack of 6 rectangles.  Using small sharp knife and 6-inch-diameter plate as guide, cut out two 6-inch round stacks.  Press each stack into 1 buttered muffin cup.  Repeat procedure 2 more times, making 4 more phyllo cups (6 total).

Bake phyllo cups until golden and crisp, about 10 minutes.  Immediately lift phyllo cups from pan, twisting carefully to loosen; place on rack.  Cool completely.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

For Mousse:  Whisk egg yolks, 1/4 cup sugar, butter, 1/4 cup water, and espresso powder in large metal bowl to blend.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not let bowl touch water); whisk constantly until thermometer inserted into mixture registers 160 degrees, about 3 minutes.  Add chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth.  Turn off heat; leave bowl over water.

Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in another large bowl to soft peaks.  Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, beating until stiff and glossy.  Remove chocolate from over water.  Fold 1/3 of beaten whites into warm chocolate mixture to lighten.  Fold in remaining whites.  Cover and chill until set, at least 3 hours or overnight.

Fill phyllo cups with mousse (reserve remaining mousse for another use).  Top with raspberries and diced pears and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add sliced garlic and stir 30 seconds.  Add red onion slices and sautÈ until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes.

Add all peppers and sautÈ until crisp-tender, about 7 minutes.

Stir in Sherry wine vinegar, then olives.  Season salad generously with salt and pepper.  Cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This colorful dish plays with the Basque sautÈ of red and green bell peppers.  The Sherry wine vinegar gives the salad a delicious sweet-tangy edge.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped watercress leaves
  1         tablespoon  coarse-grained Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  water
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  1                     shallot -- thinly sliced
  4                     fresh parsley sprigs
  1                     fresh thyme sprig
  6                     center-cut skin-on salmon fillets - -- (6 oz ea)

Mix first 4 ingredients in small bowl to blend; season to taste with salt and pepper.

Combine 1/3 cup water, wine, shallot, parsley, and thyme in large skillet.  Place salmon fillets, skin-side down, in skillet; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Cover skillet tightly and simmer over medium-low heat until salmon is barely opaque in center, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat; let stand, covered, 5 minutes.

Transfer salmon to platter; discard wine mixture.  Cover salmon with plastic wrap and chill until cold, at least 4 hours.  (Watercress mayonnaise and salmon can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and keep chilled.)

Place 1 salmon fillet on each of 6 plates.  Serve with watercress mayonnaise.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  An elegant, portable entrÈe.  Baby greens with vinaigrette would round out the menu nicely.

What to drink:  A lightly oaked Chardonnay.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  medium-size red-skinned potatoes -- unpeeled, and
                        cut into 1/2"-thick slices
  2        tablespoons  distilled white vinegar
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
     2/3           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped drained roasted red

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- thawed
                        = (half of 17.3-oz package)
  2                     Golden Delicious apples - (7 to 8 oz ea) -- peeled, halved,
                        cored, each half very thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  4          teaspoons  honey

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Roll out pastry sheet on lightly floured surface to very thin 18- by 14-inch rectangle.  Using small plate as guide, cut out four 7-inch rounds.  Transfer 2 rounds to each prepared sheet; cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day.

Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Overlap slices from 1/2 apple on each pastry round, leaving 1/4-inch plain border.  Sprinkle apple on each tart with 2 1/4 teaspoons sugar, then drizzle with 2 1/4 teaspoons butter.

Bake tarts until pastry is golden and apples are tender, about 25 minutes.  Drizzle each tart with 1 teaspoon honey.  Transfer tarts to racks; cool 10 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 tarts.

Comments:  These simple tartes aux pommes are great with vanilla ice cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  whole milk
  4              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     2/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  12            ounces  Golden Delicious apples - (abt 2) -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
                        Powdered sugar -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Whisk milk, eggs, sugar, vanilla, salt, and cinnamon in large bowl until well blended.  Add flour and whisk until batter is smooth.  Place butter in 13- by 9-inch glass baking dish.  Place dish in oven until butter melts, about 5 minutes.  Remove dish from oven.

Place apple slices in overlapping rows atop melted butter in baking dish.  Return to oven and bake until apples begin to soften slightly and butter is bubbling and beginning to brown around edges of dish, about 10 minutes.

Pour batter over apples in dish and sprinkle with brown sugar.  Bake pancake until puffed and brown, about 20 minutes.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar, if desired.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Sherry Sharp of Fremont, California, writes: "The Arroyo Village Inn is a lovely bed-and-breakfast in Arroyo Grande, California.  During my recent stay there, I enjoyed the apple pancake made by the inn's owner, Gina.  When she brought it to the table, it looked like a puffy soufflÈ.  Once I had cut into it, I could see the sliced apples."

This breakfast treat rises like Yorkshire pudding and has the texture of a classic baked pancake.  Sprinkle powdered sugar over the pancake after it's baked, if you like.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sugar
  8              large  egg yolks
  6        tablespoons  framboise eau-de-vie -- see * Note
                        = (clear raspberry brandy)
  2        tablespoons  chilled whipping cream -- plus
  1 1/4           cups  chilled whipping cream
  4                     containers fresh raspberries - (1/2 pt ea)

* Note:  Sold at some liquor stores and specialty foods stores.  If unavailable, use raspberry liqueur instead.

Using electric mixer, beat sugar, yolks, 4 tablespoons framboise, and 2 tablespoons cream in large metal bowl to blend.  Set bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water (do not allow bowl to touch water) and continue beating until mixture is thick and billowy and instant-read thermometer inserted into center registers 160 degrees, about 9 minutes.

Remove bowl from over water.  Continue beating until mixture is cool, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, about 5 minutes.

Beat remaining 2 tablespoons framboise and 1 1/4 cups cream in medium bowl until peaks form.  Fold cream into yolk mixture in 2 additions.  (Sabayon can be prepared 8 hours ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Preheat broiler.  Divide raspberries equally among eight 1 1/4-cup custard cups or shallow ramekins.  Top raspberries with sabayon.  Broil until sabayon is lightly browned, watching carefully to avoid burning, about 2 minutes.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  "This past year, I've enjoyed more opportunities than usual to travel and dine out," writes Tony Solomita of Arlington, Virginia.  "Instead of a photo album, I'd like to create an album of recipes from these new favorite restaurants.  I'll start with a dessert: the berries with custard sauce from L'Auberge Chez FranÁois in nearby Great Falls."

For these individual desserts, a light, foamy custard called a sabayon is poured over berries and broiled until just brown.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     garlic heads -- cloves separated,
                        and peeled
  1                cup  whole milk
  7        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
  4                     onions -- cut into 1" pieces
     2/3           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2                     fresh thyme sprigs
  1                     bay leaf
  3        tablespoons  whipping cream
  2              whole  chickens - (abt 3 1/2 lbs ea) -- split in half
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Bring garlic cloves and milk to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat.  Drain.  Discard milk.  Transfer garlic cloves to 8- by 8- by 2-inch metal baking pan.  Add 3 tablespoons oil and toss to coat.  Roast until golden, about 13 minutes.  Cool slightly.

Transfer garlic with its cooking oil to processor; blend to form paste.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Garlic paste can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Melt butter and 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat.  Add onions and sautÈ until golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes.  Add vinegar, thyme, and bay leaf.  Simmer until liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes.  Stir in cream.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.  Working in 2 batches, add chicken, skin-side down, to skillet and cook until skin is golden brown (do not turn), about 4 minutes.

Place chicken, skin-side up, on large rimmed baking sheet.  Roast until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear when thigh is pierced with knife, about 20 minutes.  Spread garlic paste atop chicken halves, dividing equally.  Bake until golden brown, about 5 minutes longer.

Rewarm onions over medium-low heat, stirring often.  Spoon onions in center of 4 plates.  Place chicken halves atop onions.  Sprinkle with parsley; serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "When I moved to Seattle last year, I found myself really missing my Studio City, California, neighborhood," writes Tim Westmoreland of Seattle, Washington.  "There were so many great places to eat there, especially Pinot Bistro.  I am craving its roasted chicken with caramelized onions.  Would you see if chef Miki Zivkovic would send me an order?  If not, the recipe will do just fine."

At the restaurant, the chicken is accompanied by shoestring fries sprinkled with chopped fresh parsley and the chef's own garlic-salt mixture.

               Rustic Pear Tart With Late-Harvest Riesling

Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  10       tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- cut into pieces
  1              large  egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  late-harvest Riesling
                        = (or other sweet white dessert wine)
                        === FILLING ===
  3              large  ripe Anjou pears -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- plus
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  late-harvest Riesling -- plus
  2        tablespoons  late-harvest Riesling
                        = (or other sweet white dessert wine)
     1/2           cup  water
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

For Crust:  Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor until combined.  Add butter; using on/off turns, cut in until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add egg yolk and wine; using on/off turns, mix just until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill at least 40 minutes and up to 2 days.

For Filling:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Roll out dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper to 12-inch round.  Remove top sheet of parchment and transfer dough, with bottom parchment, to rimmed baking sheet.

Place pear slices, 1 tablespoon sugar, and flour in large bowl; toss to combine.  Spoon pear mixture into center of dough, leaving 1 1/2-inch border.  Using parchment as aid, fold up outer edge of dough over edge of filling.  Bake until pears are tender, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, boil 1 cup wine, 1/2 cup water, and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in medium saucepan until syrup is reduced to 1/2 cup, about 10 minutes.

Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees.  Drizzle half of syrup over filling.  Continue baking tart until juices are bubbling thickly, about 20 minutes.  Cool.

Whisk 2 tablespoons wine into remaining syrup.  Cut tart into wedges.  Drizzle with syrup.  Serve with ice cream.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  The rich, fruity sweetness of a late-harvest Riesling (added to a syrup that is drizzled over the free-form tart) beautifully complements the natural sugars in roasted pears.

  1                     bay leaf
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  10       tablespoons  butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- cut into pieces
  5                     leeks, white and pale green parts only -- chopped
                        = (about 4 cups)
     3/4           cup  water
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh chives - (packed)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  sea scallops
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh tarragon

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy small skillet over medium heat.  Add capers; sautÈ until crisp, about 1 minute.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain.

Boil wine and next 4 ingredients in small saucepan over medium heat until liquid is reduced to 3 tablespoons, about 15 minutes.  Add cream; boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 2 minutes.  (Capers and sauce can be made 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add leeks and 3/4 cup water.  Simmer until leeks are tender and almost all water evaporates, about 4 minutes.  Mix in chives.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer leek mixture to platter.  Tent with foil.

Sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper.  Melt 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon oil in another heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add scallops; sautÈ until cooked, about 2 minutes per side.  Arrange atop leeks.  Tent with foil.

Reheat sauce over medium heat.  Gradually add 6 tablespoons butter; whisk until smooth, about 1 minute (do not boil).  Strain sauce into small bowl.  Stir in capers and tarragon.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spoon over scallops.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The leeks are cooked until they're so tender -- or "melted" -- that they almost fall apart.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
  1 1/4           cups  boiling water
  3                     tea bags of Chinese black tea
     2/3           cup  smooth peanut butter
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1                cup  chopped watercress
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh mint
                        === BEEF ===
  5        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  unseasoned rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1 1/4         pounds  top sirloin steak - (to 1 1/2) -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/4" to 1/3"-thk slices, and
                        then cut into 3" strips
                        === SALAD ===
     3/4         pound  linguine
  1         tablespoon  oriental sesame oil
  2                     cucumbers - (12 oz ea) -- peeled,
                        halved lengthwise, seeded
  8              large  green onions -- halved lengthwise,
                        cut on diagonal into 1" lengths
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              bunch  fresh mint
  1              bunch  watercress
     1/2           cup  roasted salted peanuts -- coarsely chopped
                        Lime wedges -- for garnish

For dressing:  Combine 1 1/4 cups boiling water and tea bags and steep 5 minutes.  Place peanut butter in medium bowl.  Add 3/4 cup tea, soy sauce, lime juice, and cayenne.  Whisk dressing to blend well.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before continuing.)  Mix in watercress and mint.

For beef:  Combine soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, honey, crushed red pepper, and cumin in large bowl; whisk to blend.  Add beef and toss to coat.  Marinate at room temperature at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.

For salad:  Cook linguine in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite.  Drain.  Rinse with cold water; drain again.  Transfer linguine to large bowl.  Mix in sesame oil.  Using vegetable peeler, cut cucumber halves lengthwise into long thin ribbons; arrange on paper towels to drain.

Drain marinade from beef into medium saucepan; boil 2 minutes over high heat.  Cool.  Heat grill pan or large ridged cast-iron skillet over high heat 4 minutes.  Working in batches, grill beef until just brown outside but rare inside, about 1 minute per side.  Transfer beef to bowl.

Add cucumbers, green onions, and cooled marinade to linguine.  Add dressing and toss to coat.  Season salad with salt and pepper.  Arrange mint and watercress around edge of large platter.  Mound noodle salad in center; top with beef.  Garnish with peanuts and lime wedges.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Freezing the steak for about 30 minutes makes it much easier to slice; using a grill pan is the simplest way to cook the slices.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  6              large  garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     beef tenderloin steaks, abt 1" thk - -- (6 to 8 oz ea)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh oregano
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil

Melt butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat.  Remove from heat.  Add garlic.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Let garlic butter stand 2 hours at room temperature.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper.  Grill steaks to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Place pan of garlic butter at edge of grill to rewarm.

Transfer steaks to plates.  Spoon garlic butter over.  Sprinkle with herbs and serve.

Comments:  This specialty is about as regional as you can get.  Although the recipe's name and origin are shrouded in mystery, in central Iowa it's a traditional steak dish topped with butter, Italian herbs, and garlic.  The version featured here uses fresh herbs for extra flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  2        tablespoons  chilled solid vegetable shortening -- cut small pieces
  3        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
  2              large  yams - (1 3/4 lbs)
                        = (red-skinned sweet potatoes)
  1                cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  whipping cream
  3              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground mace
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              large  egg white -- beaten to blend

For Crust:  Mix flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Add butter and shortening; using on/off turns, cut in until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Drizzle 3 tablespoons ice water over mixture.  Process until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic; chill until firm, about 30 minutes.

Roll out dough on floured surface to 14-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Fold overhang under.  Crimp edges decoratively.  (Crust can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover; chill.)

For Filling:  Pierce potatoes with fork.  Cook in microwave on high until tender, about 6 minutes per side.  Cut open; cool completely.  Scrape potato flesh into bowl; mash until smooth.  Measure enough potato puree to equal 1 1/2 cups.

Position rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 400 degrees.  Place puree in large bowl.  Whisk in brown sugar and next 6 ingredients.  Brush crust with beaten egg white.  Transfer filling to crust.

Bake pie until filling is puffed around edges and set in center, about 45 minutes.  Transfer to rack; cool.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; refrigerate.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Similar to pumpkin pie, but not quite as sweet.  Serve with whipped cream, if you like.

For Crust:  Mix flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Add butter and shortening; using on/off turns, cut in until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Drizzle 3 tablespoons ice water over mixture.  Process until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic; chill until firm, about 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out dough on floured surface to 14-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Fold overhang under.  Crimp edges decoratively.  (Crust can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover; chill.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Filling:  Pierce potatoes with fork.  Cook in microwave on high until tender, about 6 minutes per side.  Cut open; cool completely.  Scrape potato flesh into bowl; mash until smooth.  Measure enough potato puree to equal 1 1/2 cups.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Position rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 400 degrees.  Place puree in large bowl.  Whisk in brown sugar and next 6 ingredients.  Brush crust with beaten egg white.  Transfer filling to crust.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake pie until filling is puffed around edges and set in center, about 45 minutes.  Transfer to rack; cool.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; refrigerate.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Similar to pumpkin pie, but not quite as sweet.  Serve with whipped cream, if you like.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  pineapple juice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  4          teaspoons  cornstarch
  2          teaspoons  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  6                     green onions -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped peeled fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  chopped seeded jalapeÒo chili
  1              pound  sea scallops -- halved horizontally
  2              small  red bell peppers -- sliced thin strips
  1              small  bok choy head -- coarsely chopped
                        = (abt 4 cups)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Stir pineapple juice, soy sauce, cornstarch, and vinegar in small bowl until cornstarch dissolves.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat.  Add green onions, garlic, ginger, and chili and stir 1 minute.  Add scallops, red bell peppers, and bok choy to skillet.  Stir-fry until scallops are almost cooked through, about 4 minutes.

Stir cornstarch mixture to reblend and add to skillet.  Stir until sauce comes to boil and thickens and vegetables and scallops are cooked through, about 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "Before we got married, my husband, Gregg, and I were working at a small restaurant, and it kept us ridiculously busy," writes Anita L. S. Eberhardt of Beverly, Massachusetts.  "Now that we have both left the restaurant business, we have a much saner schedule, although raising two kids certainly keeps us busy.  My experience as a professional cook makes it easier for me to throw together a quick meal, which is good because I'm not a convenience-food mom: I try to limit fat and salt, emphasize fruits and vegetables, and use a minimum of prepared foods."

Serve with rice to soak up the flavorful sauce.

                     Tuna Teriyaki With Wasabi Butter

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     tuna steaks, abt 1" thick - (4 to 5 oz ea)
     1/4           cup  purchased teriyaki marinade
  3        tablespoons  butter -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  wasabi powder - (about)
                        = (horseradish powder)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  1         tablespoon  light olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place tuna in shallow glass dish.  Pour marinade over and turn to coat.  Let tuna stand 10 minutes at room temperature, or cover and refrigerate 1 hour.  Mix butter, wasabi powder, and chives in small bowl.

Prepare barbecue (medium heat).  Remove tuna from marinade; brush on both sides with oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill fish, brushing occasionally with remaining marinade, about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Transfer to platter.  Top with wasabi butter and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Wasabi powder is fiery-hot, so adjust the proportion in the butter according to your heat tolerance.  An Asian noodle salad from the deli, blanched sugar snap peas sprinkled with sesame seeds, and a bakery lime tart would be cooling additions to the menu.

                  Tuscan-Style Grilled Chicken Sandwich

Recipe By     :Pat Christofolo

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry                         Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  4          teaspoons  prepared pesto
  2            squares  focaccia or ciabatta - (4" by 4")
                        = (Italian flatbread available at many
                        bakeries and supermarkets)
  2                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             slices  fresh mozzarella - (thin slices)
  2                     canned artichoke hearts -- drained, sliced thin
  1                     plum tomato -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  mixed baby greens

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Combine mayonnaise and pesto in small bowl; whisk to blend.  Cut bread horizontally in half.  Brush chicken lightly with oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Grill chicken until just cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer chicken to cutting board; cool slightly.  Cut chicken on sharp diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick slices.

Spread pesto mayonnaise onto cut surfaces of bread.  Layer chicken, mozzarella, artichokes, tomato, and greens onto bottom halves.  Top with bread tops.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Pat Christofolo runs the kitchen at this restaurant, located only a few minutes from downtown Phoenix.  She's particular about the way she puts this sandwich together: The mayo should touch both the chicken and greens, so each has its own bit of dressing.

Comments:  Pat Christofolo runs the kitchen at this restaurant, located only a few minutes from downtown Phoenix.  She&apos;s particular about the way she puts this sandwich together: The mayo should touch both the chicken and greens, so each has its own bit of dressing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  spaghetti
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  white cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  herbes de Provence
                        = (available at specialty foods stores
                        and some supermarkets)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     veal cutlets - (3 oz ea) -- pounded 1/4"
                        thickness
     1/2           cup  chopped thinly-sliced prosciutto
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh sage
     1/3           cup  dry Marsala
     1/3           cup  low-salt chicken broth
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut small pieces

Cook spaghetti in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain.  Transfer to large bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon oil.  Keep warm.

Meanwhile, mix cornmeal, herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper in medium bowl.  Coat veal in cornmeal mixture.

Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add veal, prosciutto, and sage.  SautÈ 2 minutes.  Turn veal over and sautÈ until cooked through, about 2 minutes longer.  Add Marsala and broth; boil until slightly reduced, about 1 minute.  Transfer veal to plate.  Add butter to skillet; whisk until melted.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Return veal to skillet to coat with sauce.

Divide pasta between 2 plates.  Top with veal and sauce, dividing equally.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Joan Macht of Manistee, Michigan, writes: "My wedding shower was held at the Blue Slipper Bistro in Onekama, Michigan.  For dinner I had the veal scaloppine saltimbocca, and now I want to make it for my new husband.  Will you ask owner Cheryl Kissel for the recipe?

The word saltimbocca in this classic Italian recipe means "jumps in your mouth," because of the great combination of flavors.  The addition of herbes de Provence gives this version a bit of a French accent.
