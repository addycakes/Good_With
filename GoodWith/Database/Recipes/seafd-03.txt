               Grilled Bluefish With Grilled Eggplant Salad

Recipe By     :Susan Volland
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  minced mint
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     bluefish fillet pieces - (abt 6 oz ea)
     1/2                eggplant -- trimmed, and
                        cut in 1/2" slices
  1              large  red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and quartered

Preheat an outdoor grill. 
In a small bowl, stir together the olive oil, mint and garlic.  Brush some of the mixture on the eggplant slices.  When the grill is hot, grill the eggplant and red pepper until tender, 6 to 8 minutes, turning a few times.  Set aside to cool slightly. 
Brush some of the oil mixture over the bluefish pieces, season with salt and pepper and grill until just opaque through, about 8 to 10 minutes, depending on its thickness, and turning the fish just once. 
Meanwhile, cut the eggplant and bell pepper into strips and put it in a bowl.  Drizzle the remaining olive oil mixture over.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss to mix well. 
Arrange the grilled bluefish on individual plates, spoon the eggplant salad over and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The flavorful character of bluefish stands up well to robust flavors reminiscent of the Mediterranean: garlic, herbs and rich olive oil.  Grilling also complements the flavor of the fish, which is accompanied here by an easy eggplant salad.  This recipe can also be done under the broiler.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     grouper fillet pieces - (6 to 8 oz ea) -- boned and skinned
     1/2    tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2    tablespoon  lime juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === MANGO ARUGULA RELISH ===
  2                     mangoes -- pitted, peeled,
                        and cut in julienne
  1              large  red bell pepper -- roasted, peeled,
                        and cut in julienne
     1/2         small  sweet onion -- cut in julienne
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  5        tablespoons  key lime juice
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
  2               cups  fresh arugula - (loosely packed) -- rinsed, and
                        coarsely chopped
                        === ORANGE MINT ORZO PILAF ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  diced sweet onion
  3               cups  good quality chicken stock
  1                cup  orange juice
  1 1/2           cups  orzo pasta
  1             medium  red beefsteak tomato -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1/4" dice
  1             medium  yellow beefsteak tomato -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1/4" dice
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the Mango Arugula Relish:  Combine the relish ingredients in a medium bowl.  Toss gently so as not to mash the mangoes.  Allow to sit at room temperature so the flavors can blend. 
For the Orange Mint Orzo Pilaf:  Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan.  Add the onion and cook until tender.  Add the stock and orange juice and bring to a boil.  Stir in the orzo, cover and simmer over medium heat until the pasta is just tender, about 5 minutes. 
Take from the heat.  Add the tomatoes and mint and toss well.  Season to taste with salt and pepper; the pasta should be somewhat saucy.  Keep warm until ready to serve. 
Preheat an outdoor grill, clean the grate and brush with an oiled towel.  When the fire is hot and the coals are glowing, rub the fish with olive oil, sprinkle with lime juice and season with salt and pepper.  Place the fish on the clean, hot grill and cook on both sides until just opaque in the center. 
Set the fish on individual plates, spoon the mango arugula relish over and around the fish.  Serve the orange mint orzo pilaf alongside. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

              Grilled Halibut With Arugula Raspberry Butter

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     halibut steaks or fillet pieces -- (1 1/2 to 2 lbs total)
                        Vegetable oil -- for fish and grill
                        === ARUGULA RASPBERRY BUTTER ===
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- softened
  3        tablespoons  lightly crushed raspberries
  2        tablespoons  chopped arugula
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Seafood Alternatives:  sea bass, swordfish, salmon 
To prepare the flavored butter, cream the softened butter in a medium bowl with a fork, then add the crushed raspberries, arugula, salt and pepper.  Continue mixing with the fork until thoroughly blended.  Spoon the butter onto a sheet of waxed paper or foil and form into a tight cylinder, twisting the ends snugly.  Refrigerate until needed; the butter can also be frozen. 
Preheat the grill to high, or heat coals until they glow red, with white ash around the edges.  Lightly brush the halibut with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Rub a lightly oiled towel or cloth over the grill, add the halibut and cook until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.  Turn the halibut and continue cooking until opaque through (cut to test), 3 to 4 minutes longer. 
Unwrap the chilled butter and cut across into 1/3-inch slices.  Top each halibut piece with a slice of arugula raspberry butter and serve.  Remaining butter can be frozen and saved for another use. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The butter accented with fresh raspberries and peppery arugula makes a great finish.  If you cannot find arugula (also known as rocket), try basil or parsley in its place.  Fresh raspberries are best here, as thawed frozen berries will be too wet.

To prepare the flavored butter, cream the softened butter in a medium bowl with a fork, then add the crushed raspberries, arugula, salt and pepper.  Continue mixing with the fork until thoroughly blended.  Spoon the butter onto a sheet of waxed paper or foil and form into a tight cylinder, twisting the ends snugly.  Refrigerate until needed; the butter can also be frozen. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the grill to high, or heat coals until they glow red, with white ash around the edges.  Lightly brush the halibut with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Rub a lightly oiled towel or cloth over the grill, add the halibut and cook until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.  Turn the halibut and continue cooking until opaque through (cut to test), 3 to 4 minutes longer. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Unwrap the chilled butter and cut across into 1/3-inch slices.  Top each halibut piece with a slice of arugula raspberry butter and serve.  Remaining butter can be frozen and saved for another use. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The butter accented with fresh raspberries and peppery arugula makes a great finish.  If you cannot find arugula (also known as rocket), try basil or parsley in its place.  Fresh raspberries are best here, as thawed frozen berries will be too wet.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              small  red potatoes - (abt 1 to 1 1/2 lbs)
  1                     garlic head -- papery outer
                        skin removed
  1                     rosemary sprig
  1                     thyme sprig
     1/3           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             medium  vine-ripe tomatoes (red or yellow)
     1/4           cup  sherry vinegar
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  4                     halibut or sea bass fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        Orange segments -- for garnish
                        Fresh basil -- for garnish

Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat. 
Scrub the potatoes, pat dry, cut into quarters and put them in a medium-bowl.  Cut the head of garlic into 4 pieces and add them to the bowl with the sprigs of rosemary and thyme.  Toss with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. 
Empty the contents of the bowl onto a large sheet of aluminum foil, then fold the sides up to enclose the potatoes in a pouch.  Set the pouch on the hot grill and roast until the potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 mnutes.  Move the package to the outer edge of the grill to keep warm. 
While the potatoes are roasting, bring a small pan half-filled with water to a boil.  Core the tomatoes and cut a small "X" on the bottom of each tomato.  Gently add them to the boiling water and simmer until the tomato skin begins to split, about 30 seconds.  Immediately transfer the tomatoes to a bowl of ice water and let the tomatoes cool. 
Drain the tomatoes, cut them in half and scoop out and discard the seeds.  Dice the tomatoes and combine them with the remaining olive oil, vinegar and orange juice.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, toss to mix well and set aside. 
Season the halibut with salt and pepper and cook on the grill until the fish is just opaque through, about 5 to 7 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness of the fish. 
Arrange the roasted potatoes in a small pile on each plate, set the fish on top and spoon the tomato relish around the fillet.  Garnish with orange segments and a sprig of fresh basil. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

           Grilled Jerk Swordfish Caribbean With Pineapple Rice

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  swordfish steaks - (1 1/3 lbs)
  4        tablespoons  bottled jerk marinade (Caribbean-style
                        sauce)
  1                can  pineapple tidbits - (8 oz) -- drained, and
                        liquid reserved
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth -- more or less
  1                cup  long-grain white rice
  1              small  red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and diced
  6              whole  allspice berries -- (optional)
  2                     green onions -- chopped
                        (or 2 tbspns chopped fresh cilantro)
  1                     lime -- cut 4 wedges

Seafood Alternatives:  mahi-mahi, tuna, orange roughy 
Rinse the fish in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Brush both sides with marinade and lay on a plate (or on a broiler rack or baking sheet if broiling); set aside.  Preheat a charcoal grill or broiler. 
Add enough chicken broth to the reserved pineapple juice to measure 2 cups.  Stir the broth mixture, pineapple, rice, bell pepper and allspice together in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.  Cover, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the liquid is absorbed, 18 to 20 minutes.  Take from the heat and let stand until ready to serve; discard the allspice berries. 
When the rice has cooked 12 to 15 minutes, place fish on a lightly oiled grill and cook 3 minutes.  Turn over and cook until the fish is just barely opaque but still moist in the center, 2 to 3 minutes more for 3/4-inch-thick steaks (or broil, without turning, for 6 to 8 minutes). 
Fluff the rice with a fork, stir in the green onions and spoon onto individual plates.  Transfer the swordfish to plates and garnish with lime wedges. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Bottled jerk sauce instantly turns ordinary fish into a spicy Caribbean treat.  Cooking rice with pineapple and peppers adds to the island theme.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              whole  live lobsters - (abt 1 1/4 lb ea)
     1/4           cup  butter -- melted
                        Juice of 1 lemon
                        Lemon wedges

Fill a large pot three-quarters full of salted water and bring to a boil.  Add 2 of the lobsters head first, cover the pot and cook just until the lobsters are evenly red, about 1 minute.  Take the lobsters from the water and set aside to cool.  Return the water to a boil and repeat with the remaining lobsters.  (Cook the lobsters one at a time if your pot is not large enough for two.) 
Preheat the grill to high, or heat coals until they glow red, with white ash around the edges. 
When the lobsters are cool enough to handle, remove the claws and partly crack their shells with a hammer.  Separate the tail from the body and split the tail in half with a large knife.  Rub a lightly oiled towel or cloth over the grill. 
Set the claws and tails, cut-side down, on the hot grill and cook for 4 minutes.  Turn the claws and tails and cook until the tail meat is opaque through, 3 to 5 minutes longer. 
In a small bowl, combine the melted butter and lemon juice.  Transfer the tails and claws to plates; pour some of the lemon-butter over the tail meat, passing extra melted butter and lemon wedges separately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  You can also split a thawed spiny lobster tail and grill it in the same fashion, adding 4 to 6 minutes to the cooking time; omit the initial boiling.

        Grilled Mahi-Mahi Sandwich With Salsa Mayo And Jack Cheese

Recipe By     :Kathy Casey
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Sandwiches
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     skinless mahi-mahi fillets - (abt 5 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  Southwest Dry Chili Rub -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  Snappy Salsa -- (see recipe)
                        (or use purchased high-quality chunky
                        tomato salsa, well drained)
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing grill
  4             slices  pepper Jack or Monterey Jack cheese -- (abt 1 oz)
  2                     French rolls or 4" French bread pieces -- split crosswise
     1/2                avocado -- sliced
  4             sprigs  cilantro sprigs - (to 5)
  2              large  crisp lettuce leaves
  1                     lime -- cut in wedges

Seafood Alternatives:  snapper, swordfish 
Lay the mahi-mahi fillets out in a glass baking dish and sprinkle both sides liberally with the chili rub.  Cover and set aside.  In a small bowl, mix together the salsa and mayonnaise.  Set aside. 
Meanwhile, heat the barbecue grill until the coals glow red with white ash around the edge.  When the coals are hot, carefully brush the grill surface with a little vegetable oil, then lay the mahi-mahi on the grill.  Grill until the first side is well marked, about 2 minutes, then turn the fish over.  After about 1 minute on the second side, top each fillet with slices of cheese and continue cooking until the cheese is melted and the fish is just cooked through and still moist, about 1 to 2 minutes longer. 
While the fish is cooking, lightly toast the bread on the edges of the grill or warm it in a low oven. 
Spread the bread with the salsa mayonnaise and set a piece of the fish on top.  Top with avocado slices, cilantro sprigs and lettuce.  Serve with lime wedges alongside for squeezing.  Pass extra Snappy Salsa on the side if desired. 
This recipe yields 2 servings. 
Comments:  This sandwich is excellent topped with, or accompanied by, "Sweet Pepper And Corn Relish" (see recipe).

Lay the mahi-mahi fillets out in a glass baking dish and sprinkle both sides liberally with the chili rub.  Cover and set aside.  In a small bowl, mix together the salsa and mayonnaise.  Set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, heat the barbecue grill until the coals glow red with white ash around the edge.  When the coals are hot, carefully brush the grill surface with a little vegetable oil, then lay the mahi-mahi on the grill.  Grill until the first side is well marked, about 2 minutes, then turn the fish over.  After about 1 minute on the second side, top each fillet with slices of cheese and continue cooking until the cheese is melted and the fish is just cooked through and still moist, about 1 to 2 minutes longer. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the fish is cooking, lightly toast the bread on the edges of the grill or warm it in a low oven. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the bread with the salsa mayonnaise and set a piece of the fish on top.  Top with avocado slices, cilantro sprigs and lettuce.  Serve with lime wedges alongside for squeezing.  Pass extra Snappy Salsa on the side if desired. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  This sandwich is excellent topped with, or accompanied by, &quot;Sweet Pepper And Corn Relish&quot; (see recipe).

                Grilled Salmon Steaks On A Pea Vine Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon steaks - (abt 8 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/2         pound  pea vines -- rinsed, and
                        tough ends trimmed

Preheat an outdoor grill.  Lightly season the salmon steaks with salt and pepper. 
While the grill is heating, combine the olive oil and vinegar in a large bowl and whisk to mix.  Add the pea vines with salt and pepper to taste.  Toss to coat evenly with the dressing.  Set aside. 
When the grill is hot, lightly brush the grate with oil and add the salmon steaks.  Cook the fish until just opaque through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. 
Arrange the pea vine salad on individual plates and top each with a salmon steak.  Serve right away. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Here's a sample of simplicity with salmon: no marinade, no sauce, just a sprinkle of salt and pepper.  Its an ideal showcase for wild king or sockeye.  Add a handful of wood chips to the coals for a whiff of smoke flavor if you like. 
A pea vine salad gives color and flavor contrast.  If you can't find pea vines in your area (look in specialty shops or Asian markets), use blanched snow peas or sugar snap peas instead.

                Grilled Scallops With Tropical Fruit Salsa

Recipe By     :Kathy Case
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2          teaspoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt
  12             large  sea scallops - (to 16) -- 1 to 1 1/2 lbs
  8                     eight-inch bamboo skewers
                        Tropical Fruit Salsa -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  chopped macadamia nuts -- lightly toasted,
                        (optional)

Seafood Alternatives:  shrimp 
In a medium bowl whisk together the lime juice, honey, oil, cayenne pepper and salt.  Add the scallops and gently toss, coating well.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours or overnight.  Soak the bamboo skewers in a bowl of water for at least 1 hour to prevent them from burning on grill. 
Heat the barbecue grill until the coals glow red with white ash around the edge.  Double-skewer the scallops using 3 to 4 per serving by threading on 2 parallel skewers about 1/2-inch apart. 
Put the scallop skewers on the hot grill and cook until nicely marked about 1 1/2 minutes.  Turn and contine cooking until the scallops are just cooked and still very juicy, about 1 minute longer. 
Arrange on individual plates, dollop with Tropical Fruit Salsa and sprinkle with macadamia nuts, if using. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Big sea scallops retain all their juicy goodness when quickly cooked on a hot grill.  The zippy fruit salsa, with a hint of dried red pepper flakes, is an ideal partner for the sweetness of the scallops.

         Grilled Scallops, Fennel And Lemon-Tarragon Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Chef John Ash, Fetzer Valley Oaks, Hopland
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  fennel bulb -- tops removed
                        Olive oil
  12                    jumbo sea scallops
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISH ===
                        Roasted red pepper strips
                        Salmon caviar
                        Tarragon sprigs
                        === LEMON-TARRAGON VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh tarragon
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced shallot
  1           teaspoon  honey -- or to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the vinaigrette:  Combine all the ingredients except the oil, salt and pepper in a large bowl.  Whisk in the oil slowly to form the vinaigrette; it should be very light in body.  Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper to taste.  Store refrigerated for up to 3 days. 
Preheat a charcoal grill until the coals glow red, with white ash around the edges.  Slice the fennel bulb lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Lightly brush with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill the fennel over the hot coals until attractively marked and crisp-tender.  Arrange the fennel on warm plates and set aside. 
Lightly brush the scallops with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill the scallops over the hot fire until nicely colored, about 2 minutes, then turn and continue cooking 2 to 3 minutes; be careful not to overcook the scallops -- the centers should still be slightly translucent.  Cooking time will depend on the thickness of the scallops. 
Arrange the scallops on top of the fennel along with the garnish ingredients.  Drizzle the lemon-tarragon vinaigrette over to taste and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  If jumbo sea scallops are not available, use about 1 pound sea scallops and skewer them before grilling.

                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  scallops
  1                     ripe papaya -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
     1/2        medium  red onion -- chopped
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped cilantro
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  1                     garlic clove -- minced or pressed
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil

Seafood Alternatives:  shrimp 
Preheat an outdoor grill to hot, or until coals glow red with white ash on the edges.  Rinse the scallops and pat dry; set aside.  If using bamboo skewers, soak them in water for at least 30 minutes. 
In a medium bowl, combine papaya, red onion, garlic, cilantro, 1 tablespoon lime juice and pepper.  Mix gently to avoid mashing the papaya.  Cover and refrigerate (it will keep for up to 2 days). 
Thread the scallops on skewers.  Mix together the oil and 1 tablespoon lime juice.  Baste the scallops and place on the hot grill.  Grill until opaque through, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Serve with salsa on the side. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This delicious lowfat entree combines the sweet taste of scallops with the fresh fruit flavor of papaya.

Thread the scallops on skewers.  Mix together the oil and 1 tablespoon lime juice.  Baste the scallops and place on the hot grill.  Grill until opaque through, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Serve with salsa on the side.

Comments:  This delicious lowfat entree combines the sweet taste of scallops with the fresh fruit flavor of papaya.

                         Grilled Shellfish Medley

Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  small steamer clams -- scrubbed
  1 1/2         pounds  mussels -- scrubbed and
                        debearded
     1/2         pound  bay scallops or sea scallops
     1/2         pound  cleaned squid tubes -- cut in 1/2" rings
  1                cup  finely-chopped tomato
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil
  2        tablespoons  minced or pressed garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
     1/2           cup  white wine

Preheat the grill to high or heat coals until they glow red, with white ash around the edges.  Discard any clams or mussels with broken shells or shells that do not close when tapped.  Cut large sea scallops in half horizontally. 
Cut eight pieces of foil (preferably heavy-duty) about 1 1/2 feet long and double up the pieces, to make 4 pouches.  Distribute the clams, mussels, squid and scallops evenly in the center of each piece of foil; mound the seafood slightly rather than spreading it out. 
Sprinkle the tomato, parsley, basil, garlic and dried red pepper flakes evenly over.  Finally, spoon 2 tablespoons white wine over each mound of seafood.  Pull the two shorter sides up over the seafood and gather the longer ends securely over the top; seal with a pinch or twist in the foil.  Try not to enclose the seafood too snugly, but allow room for the steam to develop in the package. 
Set the seafood pouches on the hot grill, cover the grill and cook for about 12 minutes (if you do not have a covered grill, cook for about 16 minutes).  Partly open one pouch and see if the clams and mussels are open and the scallops are opaque through.  If not, reclose the pouch and continue cooking for another few minutes. 
To serve, open the top of the pouches and partly fold down the sides, creating a rustic bowl.  Put any unopened clams or mussels directly on the grill and leave for a few minutes until they open.  If they do not open, discard them. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Something close to cioppino, a zesty seafood stew, this recipe combines a variety of shellfish with tomatoes and seasonings in a handy foil "pouch."  Just pop it on a hot grill and the foil package becomes a mini-oven, sealing in all the juices and flavor.  It's not your usual barbecue fare, but we're sure you're going to love it.  There will be tasty juices in the pouches, so offer plenty of bread alongside to soak them up.

        Grilled Swordfish, Mediterranean Oil, Tomato-Olive Relish

Recipe By     :Kathy Casey
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     swordfish steaks - (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        Mediterranean Oil -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Double Tomato-Olive Relish -- (see recipe)
                        Fresh herb sprigs -- for garnish,
                        (optional)

Seafood Alternatives:  tuna, halibut 
Put the swordfish steaks in a glass baking dish and coat with 1/4 cup of the Mediterranean Oil.  Cover and refrigerate overnight. 
Heat the barbecue grill until the coals glow red with white ash around the edge.  Put the swordfish steaks on the hot grill and season with salt and pepper as desired.  Grill until nicely marked, about 2 minutes, then turn and continue cooking until the fish is just cooked and still juicy, about 2 to 3 minutes longer depending on the thickness of the steaks.  Baste with more Mediterranean Oil if you like. 
Top each swordfish steak with 1/4 cup of the Double Tomato-Olive Relish.  Garnish with fresh herb sprigs.  Pass extra relish along with the remaining Mediterranean Oil to dip crusty French bread in! 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The hearty texture of swordfish makes it an inspired proxy for the traditional steak-on-the-grill.  The intense fragrance of herbs, garlic, olive and tomato will turn your own backyard into a little piece of the sunny coast of Italy.

                     Grilled Trout With Grape Leaves

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  cooked white rice
  3        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              whole  trout - (abt 3/4 lb ea) -- gutted
  12             large  grape leaves - (half an 8-oz jar) -- drained

Seafood Alternatives:  small salmon, small bluefish, small Arctic char 
In a medium bowl, combine the cooked rice, lemon juice, olive oil and lemon zest with salt and pepper to taste.  Preheat a barbecue grill or preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
Thoroughly rinse the fish inside and out and pat dry with paper towels.  Spoon the rice mixture into the stomach cavity of each fish. 
Lay 6 grape leaves in a rectangle on the work surface, slightly overlapping so there are no large gaps.  Set one of the trout on top and wrap the leaves up and over the fish.  Lay another leaf or two on top of the fish if necessary to fully enclose it.  If grilling, tie a few pieces of kitchen string around the fish to secure.  Repeat with the second fish. 
Brush the grill with oil and cook until the fish is just opaque through (make a small slit through the leaves to check), 4 to 6 minutes on each side. 
Alternatively, put the fish in an oiled baking dish and bake for about 20 minutes.  Discard the strings and serve. 
This recipe yields 2 servings. 
Comments:  In the Mediterranean, particularly in Greece, grape leaves are traditionally wrapped around small fish such as red mullet and grilled over a wood fire.  The leaves help keep the fish moist, hold it together and add distinctive flavor.  Here we've adapted that idea to trout, because red mullet and other smaller fish aren't easy to find in this country.  You can also make this recipe with one large fish, 2 to 2 1/2 pounds, rather than two small fish. 
If you like, omit the rice stuffing and simply fill the fish cavity with lemon slices instead.

               Knife And Fork Stuffed Mushrooms Rockefeller

Recipe By     :Kathy Casey
Serving Size  : 14    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  14             large  common mushrooms - (2" to 2 1/2" dia) -- about 1 1/2 lbs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  14                    extra-small shucked oysters - (14-oz jar) -- drained
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced red bell pepper -- (optional)
  1              small  lemon -- halved
                        === FILLING ===
  3             slices  bacon -- minced
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1              bunch  fresh spinach - (abt 4 cups) -- rinsed, trimmed,
                        and chopped
     1/4           cup  half-and-half
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce -- or to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
                        === TOPPING ===
  4             ounces  cream cheese
  2        tablespoons  minced or pressed garlic - (to 3 tbspns)
  1                     green onion -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  Pernod, Pastis or dry sherry

To make the filling:  In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, sautÈ the bacon until crisp.  Stir in the flour, followed by the spinach and half-and-half.  Cook, stirring well, until very thick.  Stir in the Tabasco and salt to taste.  Take from the heat, fold in the Parmesan cheese and let cool thoroughly. 
To make the topping:  Place the cream cheese in a glass bowl and microwave for 30 seconds, or soften at room temperature.  Stir in the garlic, green onion and Pernod until creamy.  (Filling and topping can be prepared up to 2 days in advance; store tightly covered in the refrigerator.) 
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Pull the stems off the mushrooms, leaving a cavity in the cap.  Discard the stems or save for another use. 
Season the mushroom caps with salt and pepper.  Divide the spinach filling evenly among the mushrooms.  Lightly press one oyster into each spinach-filled mushroom. 
Top each oyster with about 1 teaspoon of cream cheese topping, spreading out a bit to partially cover the oyster.  Place the mushrooms on a baking pan, lightly oiled or sprayed with pan spray.  Sprinkle each mushroom with a little minced red bell pepper, if using. 
Bake in the preheated oven until the mushrooms are tender, the spinach filling is hot and the oysters are just cooked, 8 to 12 minutes.  Right after taking the mushrooms from the oven, squeeze the lemon juice over. 
This recipe yields 14 servings. 
Comments:  The oyster lover's ultimate stuffed mushroom!  Extra-large button mushrooms are the baking vehicle for the recipe, which uses fresh jarred oysters.  Timid shuckers will love this variation.

To make the filling:  In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, sautÈ the bacon until crisp.  Stir in the flour, followed by the spinach and half-and-half.  Cook, stirring well, until very thick.  Stir in the Tabasco and salt to taste.  Take from the heat, fold in the Parmesan cheese and let cool thoroughly. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the topping:  Place the cream cheese in a glass bowl and microwave for 30 seconds, or soften at room temperature.  Stir in the garlic, green onion and Pernod until creamy.  (Filling and topping can be prepared up to 2 days in advance; store tightly covered in the refrigerator.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Pull the stems off the mushrooms, leaving a cavity in the cap.  Discard the stems or save for another use. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season the mushroom caps with salt and pepper.  Divide the spinach filling evenly among the mushrooms.  Lightly press one oyster into each spinach-filled mushroom. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Top each oyster with about 1 teaspoon of cream cheese topping, spreading out a bit to partially cover the oyster.  Place the mushrooms on a baking pan, lightly oiled or sprayed with pan spray.  Sprinkle each mushroom with a little minced red bell pepper, if using. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake in the preheated oven until the mushrooms are tender, the spinach filling is hot and the oysters are just cooked, 8 to 12 minutes.  Right after taking the mushrooms from the oven, squeeze the lemon juice over. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 14 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The oyster lover&apos;s ultimate stuffed mushroom!  Extra-large button mushrooms are the baking vehicle for the recipe, which uses fresh jarred oysters.  Timid shuckers will love this variation.

              Red Currant Glazed Salmon With Couscous Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  zucchini -- cut in 1/2" dice
  1              large  carrot -- cut in 1/2" dice
  1                cup  couscous
  1                cup  chicken broth or water
  2        tablespoons  minced basil
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  red currant jelly
  4                     salmon fillets or steaks - (abt 6 oz ea)

Preheat an outdoor grill or preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
Bring a small pan of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add the zucchini and boil until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes.  Scoop out the zucchini with a slotted spoon and drain.  Return the water to a boil, add the carrot and boil until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes.  Scoop out and drain with the zucchini.  Set aside. 
Put the couscous in a medium bowl.  Heat the chicken broth to a boil, pour it over the couscous and stir with a fork until well mixed.  Cover the bowl with foil and let sit for 5 minutes.  Stir again to separate the grains.  Add the zucchini, carrot, basil and olive oil and toss to mix well.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside. 
In a small pan, heat the red currant jelly over medium heat until smooth, stirring often.  Bring to a boil and boil, stirring, until the jelly has reduced and thickened, 1 to 2 minutes.  Let cool slightly. 
Brush the salmon pieces with red currant jelly.  Grill the salmon until just opaque through, about 4 minutes per side, or bake on a foil-lined baking sheet for about 12 minutes (the salmon need not be turned when baked). 
Arrange the salmon on individual plates, spoon the couscous alongside and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The richness of salmon contrasts well with tart ingredients, such as the subtle red current glaze used here.  A colorful accompaniment of couscous with vegetables rounds out the recipe, equally delicious hot or cold.  Any variety of salmon can be used here, though more delicate chum or pink should be baked rather than grilled.

Categories    : Accompaniment                   Condiments
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  small whole dried red chiles -- most seeds removed
                        (1-inch-long "bird" chiles)
  1         tablespoon  coriander seed
                        (or 1 tspn ground coriander)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cumin - (seed or ground)
  10                    peppercorns
  2                     whole cloves
                        (or 1/16 tspn ground cloves)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2                     shallots -- peeled
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1                     quarter-size slice of fresh ginger -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  minced lemongrass - (2 stalks)
  2          teaspoons  grated lime zest
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped cilantro stems and
                        leaves
  1           teaspoon  shrimp paste - (to 2 tspns) -- (optional)
                        (or 1 to 2 salted anchovy fillets)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil

Put the chiles in a small bowl and cover with very warm water.  In a small skillet, toast the coriander seed and cumin seed over medium heat, stirring constantly, until aromatic; don't let the spices burn or they will be bitter.  Pour the spices into an electric spice grinder or coffee grinder with the peppercorns, cloves, nutmeg and salt.  Grind to form a fine powder. 
In the work bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, put the shallots, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, lime zest, cilantro, shrimp paste, if used, and 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Drain the chiles well and add them to the work bowl along with the ground spices.  Process the mixture until it is very smooth.  Wipe down the sides of bowl occasionally and be careful not to breathe in potent chile fumes. 
Scrape the mixture into an electric blender, cover and process until the mixture forms a smooth paste.  Stop the machine and add the remaining oil, as needed, to facilitate blending.  Scrape the bowl.  Store in a small glass jar with a tight fitting lid.  Refrigerate up to 1 month or freeze for longer periods. 
This recipe yields about 1/2 cup. 
Comments:  This highly-flavored curry paste adds distinctive flavor to Red Curry Sauce (see recipe).  There are almost as many variations of curry paste in Thailand as there are cooks to blend them. 
The traditional method of blending the herbs and spices requires one to energetically pound the ingredients with a mortar and pestle, adding them one by one until a silky paste is formed.  This method is intensely laborious.  By using an electric spice grinder, a food processor and a blender, the paste can be reduced by stages, ending up with a respectably smooth blend. 
The fresh, lively flavors of this spice blend will allow you to capture the real essence of Thai cooking right on your own dinner table.  Add it to curries, sauces, fried seafood dishes or soups.  Stir a little into your favorite barbecue sauce or dip recipe.  Add small amounts at first: this curry paste is a fire eaters delight!

</DirT>
<DirT>
The traditional method of blending the herbs and spices requires one to energetically pound the ingredients with a mortar and pestle, adding them one by one until a silky paste is formed.  This method is intensely laborious.  By using an electric spice grinder, a food processor and a blender, the paste can be reduced by stages, ending up with a respectably smooth blend. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
The fresh, lively flavors of this spice blend will allow you to capture the real essence of Thai cooking right on your own dinner table.  Add it to curries, sauces, fried seafood dishes or soups.  Stir a little into your favorite barbecue sauce or dip recipe.  Add small amounts at first: this curry paste is a fire eaters delight!

                       Red Snapper In Coconut Sauce

Recipe By     :Susan Fuller Slack, CCP
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  canola oil
  1             medium  onion -- halved, and
                        thinly sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1                     quarter-size slice fresh ginger -- peeled, and
                        finely minced
  2        small whole  fresh red or green chiles (1" to 2") -- cored, seeded,
                        and finely minced
  2          teaspoons  minced lemongrass - (abt 1/2 stalk)
  1              piece  cinnamon stick - (1" long)
  2                     whole cloves
  3              whole  green cardamom pods
     1/4      teaspoon  ground turmeric
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  coconut milk, preferably low-fat
  1 1/4         pounds  red snapper fillet -- cut in 1" pieces
                        (or large shrimp, peeled and deveined)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
  2        tablespoons  shredded fresh cilantro leaves
                        Yellow or red chile or bell pepper flower -- (for garnish)
                        Fresh lime wedges

Seafood Alternatives:  catfish, haddock, cod fillets 
In a wok, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the onion, garlic, ginger, chiles and lemongrass.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the onions turn golden, 3 to 4 minutes. 
Add the six spices and continue stirring 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the coconut milk, bring the mixture to a boil, cover the pan and reduce the heat to low.  Simmer 5 minutes, stirring once or twice. 
Remove the lid, gently stir in the fish and salt, cover and cook over low heat for 8 to 10 minutes or just until the fish is cooked through.  Taste the sauce for seasoning. 
The spices can be removed at this point or you can allow the diners to do so with their own portions.  Pour the fish and sauce into an attractive serving bowl; garnish with cilantro, chile and lime wedges.  Serve at once with rice. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This easy curry is an intriguing blend of mouth-watering aromas and spicy flavors.  If you like, dry-roast the spices then grind them in an electric spice grinder before adding them.  Grinding the spices intensifies their flavor.  Serve the curry with cooked Indian basmati rice or Jasmine rice.

                   Red Snapper With Orange-Ginger Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  orange juice -- preferably freshly
                        squeezed
  1           teaspoon  minced or grated ginger
  2                     red snapper fillet pieces - (6 to 7 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

In a small bowl, stir together the orange juice and ginger; set aside. 
If using skin-on snapper fillets, make 2 to 3 shallow slashes in the skin side to help prevent the fillets from curling as they cook.  Season the fish on both sides with salt and pepper, then coat lightly with flour, patting to remove the excess. 
Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the snapper fillets and cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn and continue cooking until browned and just opaque through, 2 to 3 minutes longer.  Transfer to individual plates and set aside, covered to keep warm. 
Add the orange juice mixture to the skillet, bring to a boil and boil until reduced by about half, 1 to 2 minutes.  Drizzle the sauce over the fillets and serve right away. 
This recipe yields 2 servings. 
Comments:  Pan-frying seems to really suit red snapper, lightly crisping the outside while leaving the dense flesh moist and tender.  This recipe couldn't be much simpler, with a light, refreshing sauce made in the same pan that the fish is cooked in.  Ten minutes max, and you've got a tasty dinner on the table. 
If you're feeling adventurous, a fun and delicious garnish for this dish would be slivers of fried ginger.  Simply cut about one tablespoon of julienned fresh ginger and fry it in a small skillet of hot oil until lightly browned and crisp, less than one minute.  Drain on paper towels and sprinkle over the fillets for serving.

                Salsa                           Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     sweet corn ears -- husks, silk removed
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and finely diced
     1/2           cup  minced yellow onion
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper - (to 1/2 tspn)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat an outdoor grill or broiler.  Rub the ears of corn with the oil and set them over the hot coals.  Roast the corn, turning it often, until the kernels are tender and lightly charred, about 7 to 10 minutes. 
Let cool until easy to handle, then cut the corn from the ears: hold the ear upright on a chopping board with the broad end down.  With a sharp knife, cut down the ear to remove the kernels. 
Stir together the corn kernels, bell pepper and onion.  Stir in the lemon juice and cayenne and season to taste with salt and pepper. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  This is particularly good paired with grilled fish, so you can get double duty out of the hot coals.  The corn can also be roasted under a hot broiler, but it won't have that grilled flavor.

Comments:  This is particularly good paired with grilled fish, so you can get double duty out of the hot coals.  The corn can also be roasted under a hot broiler, but it won&apos;t have that grilled flavor.

         Roasted Monkfish With Caramelized Sweet Onions And Sage

Recipe By     :Susan Volland
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  sweet onion -- cut in 1/2" slices
                        (such as Walla Walla Sweet or Vidalia)
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped sage
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth or vegetable broth
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  cleaned monkfish - (abt 3 med tails)
     1/4           cup  flour -- seasoned with
                        salt and pepper to taste
  2              large  vine-ripened tomatoes -- sliced
  1         tablespoon  minced chives

Seafood Alternatives:  shark, cod 
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onion slices and sprinkle with sugar.  Cook until the onion slices begin to caramelize, about 5 to 6 minutes, then turn the slices over and continue to cook without stirring until the other side caramelizes, about 3 to 4 minutes. 
Add the vinegar and sage, and stir until the onions are well-coated, add the chicken broth and season well with salt and pepper; set aside to keep warm. 
Heat the remaining olive oil over high heat in a large ovenproof skillet, preferably nonstick.  Lightly roll the monkfish fillets in seasoned flour and pat to remove the excess.  Sear the fish until brown on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. 
Place the pan in the preheated oven and roast until opaque through, turning the pieces once or twice so they cook evenly, about 7 minutes. 
Transfer the cooked monkfish to a cutting board and cut into 1-inch-thick slices.  Arrange the sliced tomatoes on a large platter or individual plates.  Top with the slices of monkfish and spoon the caramelized onions around.  Sprinkle the minced chives over and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Sage has a natural affinity for onions, particularly summers rich supply of sweet onions.  The firm and succulent characteristics of monkfish make it an ideal companion for sage as well. 
Monkfish has a grayish, slippery membrane between the skin and flesh; if it has not already been removed, you should do so before cooking.  Simply cut it away with a sharp knife, removing as little flesh as possible.

                      Roasted Onion And Salmon Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  salmon fillet
  3              large  sweet or yellow onions
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- whole and unpeeled
     1/2           cup  hazelnuts
  6               cups  fish stock, chicken stock or water
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns
  1                     bay leaf -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1              pinch  salt

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Peel and trim the onions and cut them in half crosswise.  Set them cut-side up in a shallow baking dish and brush the tops with the olive oil.  Bake in the heated oven until the onions are beginning to soften, about 20 minutes.  Add the garlic cloves and continue roasting until the garlic and onions are soft, about 20 minutes longer. 
Take from the oven and let cool.  Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Scatter the hazelnuts in a cake pan and toast in the oven until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally so the nuts brown evenly.  Rub the hazelnuts in a coarse dish towel to remove the skins, set them aside to cool, then coarsely chop the nuts. 
In a shallow pan combine 4 cups of the fish stock with the peppercorns, bay leaf, white wine and salt, bring to a boil and simmer for 2 minutes.  Add the salmon fillets and simmer gently until the fish flakes easily at the thickest part, 8 to 12 minutes. 
Transfer the fish to paper towels and let cool.  Strain the cooking liquid and set aside.  When the fish is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin and bones.  Break the salmon into large flakes with your fingers and set aside. 
When the onions are cool enough to handle, coarsely chop them; don't worry about browned bits of onion as they will add the flavor to the soup.  Split the skin of the garlic cloves and squeeze out the garlic.  In a large pan, combine the onion, garlic and salmon cooking liquid with the remaining fish stock.  Bring to a boil and simmer until the onions are soft, 15 to 20 minutes. 
Ladle about half of the soup to a food processor and purÈe, then return to the pan.  Taste the soup for seasoning and spoon it into individual soup bowls.  Top with the salmon pieces, sprinkle with the chopped hazelnuts and serve. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  The rich flavor of salmon blends well with smokey roasted onions for this ultimate cold-water soup.  If you prefer a smoother soup, you can purÈe all of the onion mixture before adding the salmon.  Fresh sourdough bread and a salad alongside make this soup a meal.

Categories    : Accompaniment                   Condiments
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  red bell peppers -- roasted
                        (or two 7-oz jars whole roasted pepper)
     3/4           cup  regular or reduced-calorie mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  grated fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6              drops  Tabasco sauce -- more to taste

Cut the roasted peppers into 1-inch dice. 
In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, combine the mayonnaise, lemon juice, ginger, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper.  Process 10 seconds to blend. 
Set aside 1/4 cup of the roasted pappers and add the rest to the food processor.  Process, pulsing on and off, until the peppers are coarsely chopped and the sauce turns pink, about 10 seconds.  Stir in the reserved peppers and Tabasco; taste and adjust seasonings.  You may also make the sauce by hand by stirring all ingredients together. 
Cover with plastic wrap or transfer to a sealed container until ready to use.  Serve alongside Sauteed Shrimp And Artichokes (see recipe). 
This recipe yields ?? servings. 
Comments:  Serve this luxurious sauce with any seafood -- or toss it with cooked seafood for a tasty sandwich filling or salad.  Its easy to roast your own red peppers to achieve the characteristic smoky flavor.  But if time is limited, jarred roasted peppers are available in most supermarkets.  The sauce can be made up to four days in advance.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             small  red potatoes - (abt 1 lb) -- washed
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             ounces  sturgeon caviar or other caviar
                        Minced chives -- for garnish
                        (optional)
                        === SHALLOT SOUR CREAM ===
     1/2           cup  sour cream, preferably reduced-fat
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh chives or green onion tops
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced shallot or red onion

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  To make the shallot sour cream, combine the sour cream, chives and shallots.  Cover and refrigerate until needed.  (This can be made up to a day in advance.) 
In a medium bowl, toss together the potatoes, olive oil, salt and pepper.  Spread the potatoes on a baking sheet and place in the preheated oven.  Bake until tender, about 25 minutes.  Keep warm. 
Right before serving, cut the potatoes in half, slicing a little piece from the bottoms if they don't sit evenly.  Top each potato piece with a teaspoon of the shallot sour cream and a dollop of caviar.  Sprinkle with minced chives, if using. 
This recipe yields 12 servings. 
Comments:  For a caviar adventure, serve a variety of kinds -- sturgeon, domestic caviar (such as paddlefish), salmon or flying fish roe.  Great for the holiday festivities with a glass of bubbly!

                   Roasted Rock Shrimp With Two Chiles

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped chipotle chiles -- canned or bottled
  1                     Anaheim or New Mexico Green chile -- trimmed, seeded,
                        and sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1         tablespoon  minced or pressed ginger
  1         tablespoon  lemon or lime juice
  1 1/2         pounds  rock shrimp

Seafood Alternatives:  shrimp, squid rings 
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  In a large bowl, combine the chile peppers, garlic, ginger and lemon juice.  Stir to mix, then add the rock shrimp and stir until the shrimp are evenly coated.  Let sit for 5 minutes. 
Pour the shrimp mixture into a shallow baking dish and roast the rock shrimp until they are just opaque through, 8 to 12 minutes. 
Spoon the roasted rock shrimp onto individual plates, with rice alongside, if you like.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Chipotle isn't a variety of chile, but instead the term for smoked -- and often marinated -- jalapeÒo chiles.  If you're a fan of hot-hot food, you can use jalapeÒo or serrano chile in place of the Anaheim, or use more chipotle chiles.  Good steamed rice is a perfect partner for these spirited shrimp -- use basmati, texmati or jasmine rice if you can find it.

                   Rock Shrimp Martini With Orange Oil

Recipe By     :Chef Fred Halpert, Brava Terrace
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     fresh corn ears
  2             medium  red onions
                        Olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1              pound  mushrooms -- sliced
  1               head  romaine lettuce -- sliced
  2             pounds  cleaned rock shrimp
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh herbs
                        (dill, tarragon, chives)
  1         tablespoon  orange oil

Seafood Alternatives:  shrimp, bay scallops 
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Shuck the corn, discarding all of the silk, and add the ears to the boiling water.  Cook for 5 minutes, drain and let cool.  Using a sharp knife, slice the kernels from the ears and set aside. 
Cut the onions into 1/4-inch slices, brush both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill the slices over a hot fire, turning once, until nicely colored and beginning to soften, 3 to 5 minutes.  (Alternatively, you can broil the onion slices in the oven.)  Let cool, then dice the slices. 
Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a medium skillet and sautÈ the mushrooms over medium-high heat just until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. 
In a large bowl, combine the corn, onions and mushrooms and toss to mix.  Set aside.  Stack a few romaine leaves, roll up lengthwise and cut across into thin strips; repeat with the remaining leaves.  Set aside. 
Heat the remaining butter in a medium skillet until it turns nut-brown (not dark or burned).  Add the rock shrimp with salt and pepper.  SautÈ, stirring, until just opaque through (cut into one to test), about 3 minutes. 
Add the rock shrimp to the vegetable mixture along with the herbs, romaine and orange oil.  Toss to thoroughly coat and taste for seasoning.  Serve in a large martini glass or on small plates, with crackers or crunchy bread and a glass of sparkling wine. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  There is no gin or vermouth in this recipe, although at Brava Terrace it is served in an oversized martini glass.  For sautÈing the rock shrimp, Chef Halpert browns the butter before adding the shrimp.  This adds a nutty flavor to the recipe.  Take care not to burn the butter or it will become bitter.  You can also cook the shrimp in plain melted butter.  The recipe can easily be halved to serve 4.

                           Rockfish ¿ La Lemon

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  lemons
     1/4           cup  dried breadcrumbs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  rockfish fillet -- cut 4 serving pieces

Seafood Alternatives:  cod, halibut, snapper, catfish 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Trim one lemon and cut it into thin slices.  Grate 1 tablespoon of zest from the second lemon, then squeeze the juice.  Combine the grated zest, breadcrumbs, salt and pepper in a small bowl and stir to mix; set aside. 
Lay the lemon slices in the bottom of a baking dish.  Put the lemon juice in a shallow dish.  Dip the fish pieces in the lemon juice and set them on the lemon slices in the baking dish.  Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture evenly over the fish pieces and bake in the preheated oven until the crumbs are lightly browned and the fish is just opaque through, 10 to 15 minutes (depending on the thickness of the fish). 
Transfer the fish to individual plates with a few slices of lemon for garnish; spoon some of the cooking juices over and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  A mildly flavored fish, such as rockfish, especially benefits from the distinctive flavor of lemon.  Baking the fish on top of lemon slices allows the flavor to infuse into the fish.  Grated lemon zest gives added citrus flavor to the crunchy breadcrumb topping.  You can use lime in place of, or in addition to, the lemon here.

                       Salmon And Halibut Yakitori

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  salmon fillet -- skin and bones
                        removed
     3/4         pound  halibut fillet -- skin and bones
                        removed
  8                     green onions - (to 10) -- trimmed with 1" of
                        the green parts remaining
                        === TERIYAKI SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  mirin (sweet rice wine) or dry sherry
     1/2           cup  soy sauce, preferably reduced-sodium
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
  2           teaspoon  cornstarch -- stirred with
  1         tablespoon  water

To make the sauce, combine the mirin, soy sauce and chicken broth in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 minute.  For the teriyaki glaze, pour 1/3 cup of the teriyaki sauce into a small pan and heat gently.  Stir in the cornstarch mixture and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes.  Set aside the sauce and glaze. 
Preheat the grill. 
Cut the salmon and halibut into 1 1/2-inch squares, about 3/4-inch thick.  Cut the trimmed green onions into 1 1/2-inch lengths. 
Thread 4 pieces of fish, alternating salmon and halibut, on each skewer, with 3 pieces of green onion between the fish.  Brush the skewers with some of the teriyaki sauce and let sit until the grill is ready. 
Grill the fish skewers over medium-hot fire for 1 to 2 minutes.  Brush the tops with the teriyaki sauce, turn the skewers and brush the cooked side with teriyaki sauce.  Continue grilling just until the fish is nicely browned and opaque through, 1 to 2 minutes longer. 
Brush both sides of the skewers with the teriyaki glaze and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Yakitori is the Japanese term for small skewers of meat -- often chicken -- brushed with teriyaki sauce and grilled.  Yakitori stands abound in Japan, making it a favorite snack food or quick lunch on a busy day.  Some of the teriyaki sauce used for the fish can be used to season eggplant before grilling.  An unusual, and unusually delicious, accompaniment is grilled rice cakes. 
For a traditional teriyaki finish, cornstarch is added to part of the sauce, making a shiny glaze to brush on the fish before serving.  ("Teriyaki" means "shining broil" in Japanese.)  You can omit this step if you like. 
Bamboo skewers 6 inches long are best for this recipe.  Soak them in cold water for at least 30 minutes before using.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  salmon fillet or steaks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8             ounces  dry pasta (such as spirals
                        or small shells)
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped tarragon leaves
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped green onion
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
     1/4           cup  nonfat plain yogurt
  8             ounces  red or yellow cherry tomatoes -- rinsed, stemmed,
                        and halved

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Rinse the salmon in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Season both sides of the salmon with salt and pepper, lay the salmon on a lightly greased baking sheet and bake until just opaque in the center of the thickest part, 8 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness.  Take from the oven and set aside to cool.  Discard the skin and bones and break the salmon into large flakes with your fingers. 
Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil.  Add the pasta and simmer until just tender, 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the size.  Drain, rinse with cold water and drain again throroughly.  Set aside. 
In a large bowl, combine the tarragon, green onion, lemon juice, yogurt, salt and pepper.  Add the well-drained pasta and toss to coat.  Add the salmon and cherry tomatoes and stir gently to incorporate.  Taste the salad for seasoning, cover and refrigerate. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Pasta salads are longtime favorites that will never go out of style.  A firm, flavorful fish like salmon is a partner that stands up well to the heartiness of the pasta.  Any of the various pasta shapes available can be used, as well as flavored pastas such as spinach or red pepper.  If you have some leftover cooked salmon, you can use 2 cups of it, flaked, in place of the salmon here.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2               cups  finely-chopped onion
  1              pound  cooked salmon -- flaked, skin
                        and bones removed
  8             ounces  plain yogurt (not nonfat)
  1                cup  grated Swiss cheese - (abt 3 oz)
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh dill
                        (or 1 tspn dillweed)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === OAT TOPPING ===
     3/4           cup  rolled oats
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh dill
                        (or 1/4 tspn dillweed)
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  3        tablespoons  melted butter

Heat the oil in a medium skillet, add the onion and cook over medium heat until softened and transluscent, 3 to 5 minutes.  Set aside to cool. 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Put the flaked salmon in a large bowl with the cooled onion, yogurt, cheese, dill, salt and pepper.  Stir gently to evenly mix.  Spoon the mixture into a 2-quart baking dish. 
In a medium bowl, stir together the oats, flour, dill, nutmeg, salt and pepper.  Add the melted butter and stir to thoroughly mix.  Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the salmon. 
Bake the salmon pie in the preheated oven until the topping is nicely browned and the filling is thoroughly heated, 30 to 40 minutes.  Serve from the baking dish at the table. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  A variation on the classic crumble dessert, this savory fish pie has a topping of oats and seasonings.  It is an ideal recipe for leftover salmon and a great quick-fix for dinner.  The "pie" can be baked in any shape of baking dish, but the cooking time may vary.  If you are starting with raw fillet or steaks, bake them or poach on the stovetop just until the flesh is opaque through, then let cool, remove the skin and bones, and coarsely flake the salmon.

                         Salmon Sealed In Silver

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  salmon fillet -- skin and bones
                        removed
  4          teaspoons  butter -- melted
     1/2           cup  mango chutney -- purÈed
                        (or use apricot preserves)
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger or pickled ginger
  2          teaspoons  minced or pressed garlic
  1         tablespoon  cider vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes - (to 1/2 tspn)
  2               cups  thinly sliced leeks, green onions
                        or white onions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into 1/8" by 2" matchsticks
  1              small  zucchini -- sliced 3/4" thick
  4             ounces  snow peas -- trimmed

Seafood Alternatives:  mahi-mahi, swordfish, catfish, mackerel 
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.  Cut the salmon into 4 portions and set aside.  For the sauce, stir together the melted butter, chutney, ginger, garlic, vinegar and red pepper flakes. 
Cut 4 sheets of foil, each 12 inches square.  Place 1/2 cup of the leeks in the center of each piece of foil.  Season both sides of salmon with salt and pepper.  Place the salmon on the leeks and spoon 3 tablespoons of the sauce over each portion.  Top each with the bell pepper, zicchini, and snow peas.  Season with salt and pepper. 
For each serving, lift two corners of the foil above the salmon to form a triangular packet.  Double-fold the two edges tightly so no steam escapes, leaving as much air space around the salmon as possible.  Preheat a baking sheet in the oven for 2 minutes, or until very hot.  Set the foil packets on the baking sheet and bake for 12 minutes. 
Remove the sheet from oven and let the packets stand on it without opening for 5 minutes.  Place each packet on a dinner plate and let everyone carefully open their own. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Foil-packet baking means no cleanup and succulent flavor.  The spicy-sweet sauce, piquant with fresh ginger and chutney, pairs well with salmon, snow peas, zucchini and red bell peppers.  Serve this pretty medley with small boiled potatoes and a spinach salad tossed with a sesame-orange dressing.

                           Salmon Thessaloniki

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  2          teaspoons  dried mint
  1           teaspoon  crushed fennel seed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  skinless salmon fillet -- bones removed
                        Vegetable oil -- for fish and grill
  6                     pita bread rounds
  1              large  tomato -- finely chopped
                        === TZATZIKI SAUCE ===
     1/2        medium  cucumber
  1          container  plain nonfat yogurt - (9 oz)
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh mint
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Seafood Alternatives:  tuna, swordfish, shark 
For the sauce, cut the cucumber in half and spoon out and discard the seeds.  Grate the cucumber, squeeze out excess liquid and put it in a medium bowl with the yogurt, mint and garlic.  Stir to mix, adding salt and pepper to taste.  Chill until needed.  The longer the sauce sits, the more flavor it will have; it will keep for up to 3 days, covered, in the refrigerator. 
If using bamboo skewers, soak them in a bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes before grilling.  Combine the oregano, mint, fennel seed, salt and pepper in a small bowl; stir to mix. 
Rinse the salmon and pat dry with paper towels.  Cut the salmon into slices about 1/2-inch thick and 1 inch wide; you should have about 12 slices.  Lightly brush one side of the salmon strips with oil and sprinkle half the herb mixture over the salmon, pressing gently so the herbs stick.  Turn and repeat on the other side with the remaining herb mix.  Thread the salmon strips onto skewers, weaving them back and forth, making a ribbon pattern. 
Refrigerate for about 30 minutes before cooking, allowing the salmon to absorb the flavors of the herbs.  Preheat the grill to high, or heat coals until they glow red with white ash around the edges. 
Rub a lightly oiled towel or cloth over the grill, add the salmon skewers and cook until opaque and lightly browned on one side, about 3 minutes.  Turn the skewers and continue cooking until the salmon is opaque through (cut to test), 2 to 3 minutes longer. 
Serve two salmon skewers on each piece of pita bread, drizzled with the tzatziki sauce and sprinkled with tomato.  Before eating, fold the pita bread around the salmon, hold securely and gently pull out the skewers. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  We're not trying to suggest that there are salmon swimming alongside the tuna in the Aegean Sea, but if there were, we think this Greek-inspired recipe would be a perfect way to serve them.  Here we use dry herbs to coat the fish before it cooks.

For the sauce, cut the cucumber in half and spoon out and discard the seeds.  Grate the cucumber, squeeze out excess liquid and put it in a medium bowl with the yogurt, mint and garlic.  Stir to mix, adding salt and pepper to taste.  Chill until needed.  The longer the sauce sits, the more flavor it will have; it will keep for up to 3 days, covered, in the refrigerator. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
If using bamboo skewers, soak them in a bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes before grilling.  Combine the oregano, mint, fennel seed, salt and pepper in a small bowl; stir to mix. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rinse the salmon and pat dry with paper towels.  Cut the salmon into slices about 1/2-inch thick and 1 inch wide; you should have about 12 slices.  Lightly brush one side of the salmon strips with oil and sprinkle half the herb mixture over the salmon, pressing gently so the herbs stick.  Turn and repeat on the other side with the remaining herb mix.  Thread the salmon strips onto skewers, weaving them back and forth, making a ribbon pattern. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Refrigerate for about 30 minutes before cooking, allowing the salmon to absorb the flavors of the herbs.  Preheat the grill to high, or heat coals until they glow red with white ash around the edges. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rub a lightly oiled towel or cloth over the grill, add the salmon skewers and cook until opaque and lightly browned on one side, about 3 minutes.  Turn the skewers and continue cooking until the salmon is opaque through (cut to test), 2 to 3 minutes longer. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve two salmon skewers on each piece of pita bread, drizzled with the tzatziki sauce and sprinkled with tomato.  Before eating, fold the pita bread around the salmon, hold securely and gently pull out the skewers. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  We&apos;re not trying to suggest that there are salmon swimming alongside the tuna in the Aegean Sea, but if there were, we think this Greek-inspired recipe would be a perfect way to serve them.  Here we use dry herbs to coat the fish before it cooks.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    fresh or dried shiitake mushrooms
  1              pound  salmon fillet -- skin and bones
                        removed
  1            package  wonton wrappers - (12 oz)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  cilantro leaves - (loosely packed)
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  water -- plus extra
                        Cornstarch -- for dusting
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  slivered ginger
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- cored, seeded
                        and cut into 2" long matchsticks
  1          small can  baby corn on the cob - (5 1/2 oz) -- drained
  3                     green onions -- thinly sliced
                        on the diagonal
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro or slivered basil
                        === SESAME SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  mirin (Japanese sweet cooking wine)
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce/ preferably reduced-sodium
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil

Seafood Alternatives:  shrimp, crabmeat, surimi crab 
If using dried mushrooms, soak them in hot water until tender, about 20 minutes.  Gently squeeze the mushrooms to remove excess water.  Remove the tough stems from the fresh or dried mushrooms, sliver the caps and set aside. 
Stir together the sesame sauce ingredients and set aside. 
Cut the salmon into 1 1/2-inch squares.  Any squares thicker than 3/4 inch should be sliced in half; save these thin slices to stack and use together. 
Place one piece of salmon in the center of a wonton wrapper and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Lay a cilantro leaf flat on top of the salmon.  Brush the wrapper edges with the cornstarch mixture.  Set another wonton wrapper on top and press around the edges to seal well, pressing out excess air.  If you like, trim the edges with a ravioli cutter, making scalloped edges.  Set the prepared wontons on a baking sheet dusted with cornstarch.  Repeat with the remaining salmon. 
Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil in a large, wide pan. 
While the water is coming to a boil, heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat.  Add the ginger and garlic and stir until fragrant, about 20 seconds.  Add half the sesame sauce (about 1/4 cup) with the mushrooms, bell pepper and corn; stir until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.  Take from the heat and stir in the green onions and chopped cilantro. 
When the water boils, gently but quickly lower 5 to 6 of the wontons into the water with a slotted spoon or metal spatula and simmer just until tender, 3 to 5 minutes.  Lift the wontons out with a slotted spoon and drain well.  Continue with the remaining wontons. 
Divide the wontons among individual plates.  Spoon the vegetable mixture over and drizzle with the remaining sesame sauce. 
This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  Don't worry about all your wontons looking exactly alike -- what's most important is that each piece of salmon is the same thickness so they all cook evenly.  For a variation, you can make triangular wontons by cutting across the wonton skins and salmon squares to form triangles before assembling them.

               Salt Fried Tuna With Spinach And Feta Cheese

Recipe By     :Betsy Kuhn

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, halved
  1              bunch  fresh spinach - (12 oz) -- cleaned, stemmed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     tuna steaks 1" thick - (6 oz ea)
                        Kosher salt, table salt or coarse sea salt
     1/4           cup  crumbled feta cheese
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest

Seafood Alternatives:  swordfish, shark, salmon 
In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the garlic halves, cut-side down, and sautÈ for 1 minute; remove.  Add the spinach and sautÈ until just wilted.  Season lightly with pepper.  Turn off the heat, leaving the spinach in the skillet. 
Rinse the fish and pat dry with paper towels.  Preheat a medium-sized, very heavy skillet, such as a cast-iron, over high heat.  When the skillet is hot enough that water droplets dance on its surface, add enough salt to form a thin layer across the bottom (about 1 1/2 tablespoons for a medium skillet).  Heat the salt for one minute then add the fish.  If using kosher or coarse sea salt, cook for 3 minutes on one side; with table salt, cook for 2 minutes. 
Turn the fish onto a still-salted area of skillet, adding a little more salt if necessary.  Continue cooking the tuna until done to taste, 1 to 2 minutes for medium-rare, 3 to 4 minutes for medium-well. 
Remove the tuna steaks from the skillet and scrape off the patches of scorched salt.  Divide the spinach between individual plates and lay the tuna over the spinach.  Sprinkle with the feta cheese, lemon zest and freshly ground pepper to taste.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 2 servings. 
Comments:  Here's an earthy combination for the true salt-lover.  It reinterprets with tuna a classic recipe for frying steak in salt.  Most types of salt will do the job, but kosher salt works best:  it is coarse enough to flick easily from the cooked fish yet flaky enough to blend with the finished dish.  Be sure to fry over high heat or the fish will stick to the skillet.  Serve this dish with lemony rice and a small bowl of briny black olives.

         SautÈed Black Cod Roasted Celery Broth And Potato PurÈe

Recipe By     :Chef Colin Turner, Shaw's Crab House
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     celery head -- whole
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                cup  water
  4                     Idaho baking potatoes
     3/4           cup  cream
  1              stick  butter
  4                     black cod fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea) -- aka sablefish

Seafood Alternatives:  halibut, salmon, bass, flounder, cod 
For the celery broth:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the whole celery head on a cookie sheet.  Pour 1/4 cup olive oil over and season with salt and pepper.  Roast the celery in the heated oven until the celery is well browned, turning every 20 minutes, about 50 minutes total.  Remove the tender interior ribs from the celery and finely chop; set aside for adding to the mashed potatoes. 
Coarsely chop the remaining celery and brown it in a small sauce pan with the onion and a couple teaspoons of the remaining olive oil.  Allow the vegetables to brown well and color the bottom of the pan, 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the water to the pan to deglaze, or loosen the flavorful brown bits.  Bring to a boil, boil to reduce by half and strain.  Keep the broth warm. 
For the potatoes:  Place the whole, unpeeled potatoes in a large pot and cover with water.  Add just enough salt to the water so you can taste it.  Bring to a boil, then simmer the poatoes until just tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.  In another pot, combine the cream and butter and heat until almost boiling and the butter has melted. 
Drain the potatoes and when just cool enough to handle, peel them.  Put the warm potatoes in a large bowl and mash them with the warm cream and butter mixture.  Stir in the finely chopped tender celery, season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside. 
Heat the remaining olive oil in a sautÈ pan or skillet, add the fish fillets and sautÈ until lightly browned and just cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side. 
To serve:  Spoon the celery potatoes in the middle of each plate, place a piece of cod on top and ladle the celery broth around. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Coarsely chop the remaining celery and brown it in a small sauce pan with the onion and a couple teaspoons of the remaining olive oil.  Allow the vegetables to brown well and color the bottom of the pan, 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the water to the pan to deglaze, or loosen the flavorful brown bits.  Bring to a boil, boil to reduce by half and strain.  Keep the broth warm. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the potatoes:  Place the whole, unpeeled potatoes in a large pot and cover with water.  Add just enough salt to the water so you can taste it.  Bring to a boil, then simmer the poatoes until just tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.  In another pot, combine the cream and butter and heat until almost boiling and the butter has melted. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain the potatoes and when just cool enough to handle, peel them.  Put the warm potatoes in a large bowl and mash them with the warm cream and butter mixture.  Stir in the finely chopped tender celery, season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the remaining olive oil in a sautÈ pan or skillet, add the fish fillets and sautÈ until lightly browned and just cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve:  Spoon the celery potatoes in the middle of each plate, place a piece of cod on top and ladle the celery broth around.

            SautÈed Fish Fillets With Avocado Grapefruit Salsa

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  grapefruit -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
  2        tablespoons  canned chopped green chiles -- more or less
                        Salt -- to taste
  1             medium  avocado -- peeled, diced
  1 1/3         pounds  white fish fillets -- skin and bones
                        removed, cut into 4 serving pieces
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  cumin ground
     1/4      teaspoon  chili powder
  2          teaspoons  olive oil or vegetable oil

Combine the grapefruit, chiles, cilantro and a pinch of salt in a bowl.  Add the avocado and toss gently; set aside. 
Rinse the fish pieces and pat dry with paper towels.  Combine the flour, cumin, chili powder and a pinch of salt in a shallow dish.  Coat the fillets with the flour mixture, patting to remove excess. 
Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the fish without crowding and sautÈ 3 minutes.  Turn and continue to cook until the fish is just opaque through the thickest part of the fish.  If all the fish doesn't fit easily in the skillet, cook in two batches.  If you are not using a nonstick skillet, you will need to use more oil. 
Transfer the sautÈed fish to warm plates.  Stir the salsa and taste for seasoning.  Spoon the salsa alongside the fish and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  You might be able to convince yourself it's summer with this lively salsa to top any firm fish fillets.

                  SautÈed Scallops With Mint And Carrots

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           teaspoon  vegetable oil
     3/4         pound  scallops -- cut large sea
                        scallops in half or quarters
  1                     carrot -- cut julienne strips
     1/4           cup  white wine or water
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh mint leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Mint sprigs -- for garnish

Seafood Alternatives:  shrimp, cubed white fish 
Heat the vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the scallops and cook just to brown the outside without cooking through, about 1 minute.  Transfer the scallops to a plate and set aside. 
Add the julienne carrot to the skillet with the white wine and cook until the carrots are brightly colored and just tender, 2 to 3 minutes.  Sprinkle the chopped mint over, return the scallops to the skillet and cook, stirring, until the scallops are just opaque through, 2 to 4 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Spoon the scallops onto individual plates, garnish with sprigs of mint and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 2 servings. 
Comments:  There's more to mint than a sprig decorating a dessert.  Here you'll find how tasty mint can be when paired with sweetly flavored scallops and carrots.  You could also use basil or arugula in the place of mint, each with deliciously different results.

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2 1/2         pounds  medium or large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1                cup  vermouth
  1                can  artichoke hearts - (13 oz) -- drained, quartered
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  minced fresh parsley
                        Roasted Red Pepper Velvet -- (see recipe)
                        Cilantro Cream -- (see recipe)

Seafood Alternatives:  scallops 
In a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter with the olive oil.  Add half the shrimp, stir-fry until just opaque, about 3 minutes, and remove.  Add the remaining butter and stir-fry the remaining shrimp; remove and keep warm. 
Add the vermouth to the pan and boil to reduce by two-thirds, 4 to 5 minutes, scraping up any browned bits.  Add the artichoke hearts, salt and pepper; simmer until warm, about 2 minutes. 
Stir in the parsley and shrimp.  Serve at once, with Roasted Red Pepper Valvet and Cilantro Cream passed separately. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  Your guests will devour these succulent shrimp, served with a smoky roasted pepper sauce and zesty cilantro sauce.  Although the shrimp require last-minute sautÈing, the sauces can be made in advance.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3         pounds  tilapia fillets, abt 1/2" thick
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     garlic clove -- minced or pressed
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
     1/2    tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3                     green onions -- chopped

Seafood Alternatives:  cod, sole, catfish, orange roughy, flounder 
Rinse the fish and pat dry.  Put the flour on a plate and season it with salt and pepper.  Dredge the fillets in the flour, patting to remove excess.  In a small bowl, combine the garlic, wine, lime juice and butter, then set aside. 
Heat the oil in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat.  Add the fillets without overlapping (you may need to cook in 2 batches).  Cook until golden on the bottom, about 3 minutes.  Turn the fillets over and cook until opaque through the thickest part, 1 to 2 minutes more.  Transfer the fish to a platter and keep warm (cover with foil or place in a 200 degrees oven). 
Add the wine mixture to pan and boil, scraping up cooked bits, until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the onions and heat on low about 30 seconds.  Pour the sauce over the fish and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  SautÈing is one of the most popular methods for cooking thin fillets, and no wonder -- it is quick and easy.  Once the fish cooks, make a quick sauce in the same pan.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        small whole  trout - (abt 1/2 lb ea) -- cleaned
     1/4           cup  flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2         tablespoon  olive oil -- more if needed
     1/3           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

Seafood Alternatives:  small whole skinned catfish, sole fillet 
Rinse the trout in cold water and pat dry with paper towels; remove and discard the head if desired.  Season the flour with salt and pepper and use it to coat the trout, patting to remove the excess. 
Heat the oil in large skillet, preferably nonstick.  Add the trout and cook over medium heat until browned, about 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spatula, carefully turn the fish and continue cooking on the other side until the fish is opaque through the thickest part, about 4 minutes longer. 
Transfer the trout to individual warmed plates and cover with foil to keep warm.  Add the lemon juice to the pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring with a wooden spoon just until heated through, about 30 seconds. 
Pour the sauce evenly over the fish, garnish with lemon wedges and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  18            sheets  phyllo dough
  5        tablespoons  butter - (to 6 tbspns) -- melted
                        Vegetable pan spray or oil
                        === FILLING ===
  4        tablespoons  butter
     3/4           cup  diced onion
  1         tablespoon  minced or pressed garlic
  3               cups  chopped mushrooms - (abt 1/2 lb)
     1/2           cup  diced celery
  1                cup  chopped green cabbage
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     3/4         pound  boneless skinless cod -- cut 1/2" dice
  4             ounces  cream cheese -- cut in pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  half-and-half
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  dried dillweed

Seafood Alternatives:  sea bass, halibut 
To make the filling:  Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onion, garlic, mushrooms, celery and cabbage and sautÈ until the vegetables are starting to soften, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the lemon juice, turn the heat to high and fold in the fish.  Add the cream cheese and fold into the mixture, taking care not to break up the fish.  Season with salt and pepper and cook the mixture for about 2 1/2 minutes. 
Whisk together the half-and-half, wine, flour and dillweed.  Add the liquid mixture into the filling and carefully fold in.  Turn the heat down to medium-high and cook until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes longer.  Remove from the heat, cool to room temperature and then chill.  Store refrigerated for up to 2 days. 
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Working quickly, layer 6 phyllo sheets, lightly brushing with melted butter between each sheet.  (See phyllo package instructions for covering dough not being worked with.)  Spoon about 1/3 of the filling (about 1 1/3 cups) along one short end of the dough, about 1 inch from the edge.  Roll up the phyllo dough, not too tightly.  Brush the last edge lightly with melted butter and seal it against the roll. 
Place the phyllo roll seam-side down on the work surface.  Score the roll to make 8 equal pieces with a serrated knife, cutting about 1/2 inch into the top.  Brush the outside of the roll with melted butter and transfer to a lightly oiled baking sheet, seam-side down; cover loosely with plastic wrap.  Make 2 more phyllo rolls with the remaining ingredients.  (The rolls can be assembled up to 4 hours before baking.) 
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool at least 20 minutes before serving.  Slice each roll into 8 pieces with a serrated knife. 
This recipe yields 24 servings. 
Comments:  Flaky phyllo dough surrounds this creamy, rich seafood filling to create an elegant pastry for the buffet table.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     3/4         pound  large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1                     garlic clove -- minced or pressed
  3                     plum tomatoes - (to 4) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Hot cooked rice or pasta for serving -- (optional)

Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the shrimp and sautÈ until they start to turn pink, about 30 seconds.  Add the garlic and sautÈ 30 seconds longer. 
Stir in the tomato, lemon juice, a dash of salt and a few grinds of black pepper; reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the shrimp are pink and just cooked through, about 3 minutes. 
Taste for seasoning and serve immediately, over rice or pasta if desired. 
This recipe yields 2 servings. 
Comments:  Scampi -- a term used here to describe a simple preparation for large shrimp -- is popular throughout Italy.  It's a great Friday night celebration dinner.  You'll want to have everything ready -- the rice simmering, shrimp peeled, tomato chopped, etc. -- before you start cooking, because the shrimp should be served as soon as they are cooked.  Serve with crusty bread, a big salad and chilled white wine for a good start to the weekend.  This recipe can easily be doubled to serve 4.

                  Sea Bass With Strawberry Orange Salsa

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  sea bass fillets -- cut into 6 pieces
                        === STRAWBERRY-ORANGE SALSA ===
  2              large  navel oranges
  6             ounces  fresh strawberries -- stemmed, chopped,
                        (about 1 cup)
     1/2                jalapeÒo chile - (to 1) -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and minced
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh mint or fresh basil leaves
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  1           teaspoon  honey or sugar - (to 2 tspns)
                        Salt -- to taste

Seafood Alternatives:  cod, orange roughy, flounder, catfish, tilapia 
Peel the oranges and remove all the white pith (it has a bitter taste).  Section the oranges and finely chop, discarding the seeds.  Put the chopped oranges in a colander to drain 5 to 10 minutes.  Transfer the chopped oranges to a bowl with the strawberries, jalapeÒos, onions, mint and lime juice.  Season to taste with honey or sugar and salt.  Cover and chill for 1 hour so the flavors can combine and mellow, or up to 8 hours. 
Rinse the fish in cold water.  Measure the thickness of the fish and pour water into a deep skillet or sautÈ pan to measure twice that thickness.  Bring the water to a boil, add the sea bass, cover the pan and remove it from the heat.  Let stand until the fish is opaque in the center, 10 to 12 minutes for fish pieces 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches thick, or up to about 20 minutes. 
Lift the fish from the pan and drain, then arrange on individual plates.  Spoon the salsa with its juice over fish and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Colorful, sweet, tangy salsa perks up any mild-flavored fish.  Spoon generously over hot or chilled seafood.

                        for garnish
  1                     red bell pepper -- roasted, cored,
                        seeded and minced
  1                     Anaheim chile -- roasted, cored,
                        seeded and minced
  1                     jalapeÒo chile -- roasted, seeded,
                        and minced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chili powder
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  2          teaspoons  crumbled dried oregano
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped - (abt 2 cups, use canned
                        if fresh are not at their best)
  1           teaspoon  green salsa (green taco sauce)
  2          teaspoons  white wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === THE REST ===
     1/2         pound  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
     1/2         pound  bay scallops
  2             pounds  clams -- steamed, shelled,
                        (abt 1/2 lb clam meats)
     1/2         pound  firm-fleshed fish, such as halibut
                        monkfish or red snapper -- cut bite-size chunks
     1/2           cup  grated cheddar cheese or a mixture
                        cheddar and Jack cheese -- (optional)
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Sour cream or plain yogurt
  1                     ripe avocado -- peeled, pitted,
                        and diced

Heat the oil in a wide, deep skillet.  Saute the red onion, white onion, garlic and cilantro until the onions are soft and translucent.  Add the bell pepper, Anaheim and jalapeÒo chiles, chili powder, cumin, oregano and cayenne and stir well to combine. 
Stir in the tomatoes and the green salsa, and cook over low heat, stirring often, until the tomatoes break down into pulp.  When the mixture starts to stick to the pan, add the wine and stir vigorously to loosen it and make a dense sauce.  Season to taste with salt and additional minced fresh cilantro. 
At this stage you can remove the sauce from th heat, let cool and store for later use, two nights refrigerated, up to three months frozen.  (I like to let mine sit refrigerated overnight, so that the flavors mellow.) 
Reheat the sauce over moderate heat.  Stir in the shrimp, scallops and fish.  Simmer gently until they are thoroughly opaque when cut into, about 12 minutes.  Add the clams and simmer another 2 to 3 minutes. 
Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese, if desired.  Serve at once, garnished with a dollop of sour cream or yogurt and avocado. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  There's only one secret to making sensational seafood chili, and that's to not take it too seriously.  You'd be surprised how well a little chili powder and taco sauce compensate for less-than-perfect execution, and how thoroughly a good cheddar masks any mistakes you may make along the way.  Improvise at whim; seafood chili is such an anomaly, no one is likely to know if you've made it correctly -- but they will know that you've made something good.

                            Seafood Chop Salad

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         large head  romaine lettuce -- leaves separated
                        and washed (or abt 12 cups washed and
                        torn greens)
     1/4           cup  salad dressing of choice - (to 1/3 cup)
                        (honey-mustard, Caesar, Italian,
                        blue cheese, etc.)
  1              pound  total of 1 or more of the following:
                        Tiny cooked shrimp
                        Flaked cooked crabmeat, lobster meat,
                        crawfish meat or surimi crabmeat
                        Chopped or flaked smoked salmon, trout,
                        bluefish or mackerel
                        Choose 3 or 4 of the following:
  2                     hard-cooked eggs -- sliced or chopped
  1                can  sliced black olives - (2 1/4 oz) -- drained
  6                     mushrooms - (to 8) -- sliced
  2                     green onions -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  chopped walnuts or toasted sunflower seeds

Stack the lettuce leaves, a few at a time, and slice crosswise very thin.  Put them in a large bowl and toss with enough dressing to lightly coat. 
Divide the lettuce among individual large plates or shallow bowls.  Equally portion the seafood and garnishes among the salads, arranging them in a wagon-wheel pattern. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Take advantage of the prep work already done at your local grocery store by picking up washed lettuce and salad toppings from the salad bar.  But this meal-in-a-salad is a snap even if you do all the work yourself.

Stack the lettuce leaves, a few at a time, and slice crosswise very thin.  Put them in a large bowl and toss with enough dressing to lightly coat. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the lettuce among individual large plates or shallow bowls.  Equally portion the seafood and garnishes among the salads, arranging them in a wagon-wheel pattern. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Take advantage of the prep work already done at your local grocery store by picking up washed lettuce and salad toppings from the salad bar.  But this meal-in-a-salad is a snap even if you do all the work yourself.

                            Seafood Fried Rice

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish
                Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  small shrimp -- peeled and deveined
     1/4         pound  squid mantles -- cleaned, and
                        cut in 1/2" rings
     1/4         pound  bay scallops
  2        tablespoons  corn oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1           teaspoon  minced or grated ginger
     1/4           cup  diced carrot
  2 1/2           cups  cooked long-grain rice
  1                cup  green peas
  3                     green onions -- thinly sliced
                        Soy sauce -- for serving

Seafood Alternatives:  cubed salmon 
Rinse the shrimp, squid rings and scallops and pat dry with paper towels. 
Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat.  Add the garlic and ginger and cook until just golden and fragrant, 20 to 30 seconds.  Add the onion and carrot and stir-fry until just beginning to soften, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the shrimp, squid and scallops and stir-fry until evenly opaque on the surface, 3 to 5 minutes. 
Add the rice and peas and continue to stir-fry over high heat until the rice is thoroughly heated and the shrimp and scallops are opaque through the center (cut to test), 2 to 3 minutes longer.  Transfer the fried rice to individual rice bowls or plates and sprinkle with sliced green onion.  Pass the soy sauce separately. 
This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings. 
Comments:  This Chinese staple is an easy and delicious way to use leftover rice and meats.  Here we suggest a small variety of seafoods to combine, but you can also prepare the recipe using 3/4 pound of single seafood instead of all three.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  onion -- thinly sliced
  1                can  yellow hominy - (15 oz) -- drained and rinsed
     3/4         pound  rockfish fillet
  1                     lime -- cut in 6 wedges
  2          teaspoons  olive oil or salad oil
  3               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                can  chopped green chilies - (4 oz)
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
                        Salsa or hot pepper sauce -- (optional)

Seafood Alternatives:  snapper, cod, orange roughy, shrimp 
Rinse the fish, pat dry and cut onto 3/4-inch cubes (discard any bones you discover while cutting the fish). 
Heat the oil in a 3- to 4-quart pan over medium-high heat, add the onion and cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes. 
Add the hominy, chicken broth, tomatoes and their juice, chilies and cumin.  Cover the pan and bring to a boil; reduce the heat and simmer 5 minutes. 
Add the fish; simmer and stir gently until the fish flakes when prodded with a fork, 2 to 4 minutes. 
Ladle the soup into bowls.  Squeeze the juice of 1 lime wedge into each bowl of soup.  Serve salsa or hot pepper sauce alongside to season to taste. 
Comments:  A specialty of Guadalajara, Mexico, pozole is traditionally made with pork.  Since this region of Mexico is known for its seafood cuisine, we've stretched tradition just a bit to make this healthier substitution.  Corn bread or fresh corn tortillas are good accompaniments.

                             Seafood Risotto

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish
                Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7               cups  reduced-sodium chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
     1/3         pound  medium shrimp -- peeled and deveined
     1/3         pound  bay scallops or sea scallops -- cut 1/2"-thick
                        slices
     1/3         pound  cleaned squid tentacles and tubes -- cut 1/2"-thick rings
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2               cups  short-grain rice such as arborio
                        or California pearl rice
     1/8      teaspoon  powdered saffron
                        (or 1/2 tspn saffron threads, crumbled,
                        or 1/2 tspn dry thyme leaves)
  1                cup  frozen petit peas -- thawed
     1/2           cup  grated or shredded Parmesan cheese
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley or chives

Seafood Alternatives:  crawfish meat, salmon cut in 1/2-inch cubes, clams or mussels 
In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken broth to a boil; cover the pan and keep the broth simmering. 
Meanwhile, in a large pan melt the butter over high heat.  Add the garlic, shrimp and scallops and stir until the shrimp are nearly all pink on the outside, about 2 minutes.  Add the squid and stir until the rings are white the and edges curl, about 1 minute more.  Transfer the seafood to a bowl and cover to keep warm. 
Add the olive oil and onion to the pan and cook, stirring, until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the rice and stir to thoroughly coat in oil.  Add 1 cup of the hot broth and the saffron and cook, stirring constantly, until the broth is nearly absorbed, adjusting the heat to keep the mixture simmering.  Add broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring until each addition is nearly absorbed and rice is tender or al dente, 18 to 22 minutes total.  It is important to stir constantly to promote the creamy consistency typical of this Italian recipe. 
With the last addition of broth, add the cooked seafood, peas and Parmesan; stir until heated through.  Spoon the risotto into 4 bowls and garnish each serving with parsley. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Any short- or medium-grain rice (but not long-grain), stirred during cooking, will produce a creamy, satisfying mixture perfect to set off your favorite seafood.  Saffron is the world's most expensive spice, but just a tiny pinch does the trick, lending risotto an earthy flavor for which there is no substitute.  If saffron is unavailable, thyme will season it just as acceptably.

                            Semi Smoked Salmon

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  salmon fillet - (abt 3 lbs)
                        (or 6 to 8 fillet pieces abt 6 oz ea)
     1/3           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  3        tablespoons  kosher or table salt
                        Vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  Cajun seasoning mix -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic -- (optional)

Rinse the fish well under cold running water.  If you want boneless fish, remove the pin bones with needle-nose pliers or tweezers. 
Combine the sugar and salt in a small bowl and stir to blend.  Line a rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap or waxed paper.  Sprinkle a few tablespoons of the brine on the baking sheet and set the salmon skin-side down on the brine.  Rub the remaining brine over the top of the salmon, wrap and let the fish sit in a cool spot for 2 hours or refrigerate for up to 4 hours; turn the fish over halfway through.  (Alternatively, you can combine the brine and salmon in a large resealable plastic bag, press out the air and seal.  Shake the bag until the fish is evenly coated with brine.) 
Rinse off the brine under cold running water, rubbing the fish well, then pat dry.  (After rinsing off the brine, the fish can be covered and refrigerated for another day before cooking.) 
To cook the fish, preheat an outdoor grill.  Soak about 1 cup of hardwood smoke chips in a bowl of cold water for 20 to 30 minutes.  Rub both sides of the salmon lightly with oil.  Sprinkle an optional seasoning on top, if desired. 
When the coals are hot, scatter them in a solid, even layer.  Drain the smoking chips well and sprinkle them over the coals.  Brush the grill rack with oil and lay the fish skin-side down in the center of the grill. 
Cover and cook, without turning, 15 to 25 minutes (cooking time will vary depending on the heat of the coals and thickness of the fish).  The flesh will separate into moist flakes when prodded with the tip of a small knife and will look shiny and barely opaque. 
Take the fish from the grill and serve hot or let cool and serve tepid.  To store, let cool, then wrap well and refrigerate.  Serve with salsa alongside. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  A refreshing salsa would be ideal alongside this flavorful salmon.  Try the Peppery Mango Mint Salsa or the Cucumber and Fennel Salsa with this recipe.  Not only are their colors and textures inviting, but the natural sweetness of these salsas is an ideal foil for the light saltiness of the salmon.

Rinse the fish well under cold running water.  If you want boneless fish, remove the pin bones with needle-nose pliers or tweezers. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the sugar and salt in a small bowl and stir to blend.  Line a rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap or waxed paper.  Sprinkle a few tablespoons of the brine on the baking sheet and set the salmon skin-side down on the brine.  Rub the remaining brine over the top of the salmon, wrap and let the fish sit in a cool spot for 2 hours or refrigerate for up to 4 hours; turn the fish over halfway through.  (Alternatively, you can combine the brine and salmon in a large resealable plastic bag, press out the air and seal.  Shake the bag until the fish is evenly coated with brine.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rinse off the brine under cold running water, rubbing the fish well, then pat dry.  (After rinsing off the brine, the fish can be covered and refrigerated for another day before cooking.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To cook the fish, preheat an outdoor grill.  Soak about 1 cup of hardwood smoke chips in a bowl of cold water for 20 to 30 minutes.  Rub both sides of the salmon lightly with oil.  Sprinkle an optional seasoning on top, if desired. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the coals are hot, scatter them in a solid, even layer.  Drain the smoking chips well and sprinkle them over the coals.  Brush the grill rack with oil and lay the fish skin-side down in the center of the grill. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cover and cook, without turning, 15 to 25 minutes (cooking time will vary depending on the heat of the coals and thickness of the fish).  The flesh will separate into moist flakes when prodded with the tip of a small knife and will look shiny and barely opaque. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Take the fish from the grill and serve hot or let cool and serve tepid.  To store, let cool, then wrap well and refrigerate.  Serve with salsa alongside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  A refreshing salsa would be ideal alongside this flavorful salmon.  Try the Peppery Mango Mint Salsa or the Cucumber and Fennel Salsa with this recipe.  Not only are their colors and textures inviting, but the natural sweetness of these salsas is an ideal foil for the light saltiness of the salmon.

                          Sesame Halibut Kebabs

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  halibut steak about 1" thick
  1              large  bell pepper any color - (to 2) -- cored and seeded
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  Oriental sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  minced or grated fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds

Seafood Alternatives:  swordfish, shark, tuna, mahi-mahi 
Rinse the halibut in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Remove the skin and bone and cut the halibut into 3/4- to 1-inch cubes.  Cut the pepper into 3/4- to 1-inch squares.  Thread the fish and pepper pieces alternately onto 4 large or 8 medium skewers (double up pepper pieces if using 2 peppers).  Preheat the broiler. 
In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, sesame oil and ginger.  Brush the basting sauce generously over the skewers, then sprinkle with the sesame seeds. 
Arrange the skewers on a broiling pan or a rimmed baking sheet.  Broil the skewers 2 to 4 inches from the heat about 3 minutes.  Turn the skewers over and broil until fish is just slightly translucent in the center, about 1 minute more.  (To test, cut into center of fish cubes on at least 2 or 3 different skewers.) 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  A mound of hot steamed rice sprinkled with soy sauce or seasoned rice vinegar rounds out this meal nicely.

               Sesame Poppy Mahi-Mahi With Pineapple Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped pineapple -- fresh,
                        or drained canned
  1                cup  orange juice
  1         tablespoon  minced or grated fresh ginger
  1              pinch  dried red pepper flakes -- (optional)
  4                     mahi-mahi fillet pieces - (7 to 8 oz ea)
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  poppy seeds
  2        tablespoons  white sesame seeds
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil - (to 3 tspns)

To make the chunky pineapple sauce, combine the pineapple, orange juice, ginger and dried red pepper flakes in a small heavy saucepan.  Bring just to a boil and gently boil over medium-high heat until the liquid is reduced by about 3/4 and the sauce is slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. 
Meanwhile, prepare the mahi-mahi.  Rub each fillet piece with 1/2 teaspoon of the sesame oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set the mahi-mahi pieces on a plate and sprinkle half of each fillet surface with poppy seeds.  Sprinkle the other half of the fillets with sesame seeds.  (For tidy lines, lay a piece of paper across half of the fillet piece and sprinkle seeds over the exposed portion; then lay the paper over the first seeded section and sprinkle the other seeds over.)  Press gently with your fingers to help the seeds adhere. 
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick.  Add the fillet pieces seeded-side down and sautÈ over medium heat until lightly colored, 3 to 4 minutes.  Carefully turn the fillets and continue cooking until just opaque through, 3 to 5 minutes longer. 
Arrange the mahi-mahi fillets on individual plates.  Spoon the sauce over and around the mahi-mahi and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The crunch and nutty texture of sesame and poppy seeds help create a distinctive presentation for mahi-mahi fillet, here accented with a chunky pineapple sauce.  It looks sophisticated, but you'll be pleased to see how easy this is to prepare.  For extra simplicity, use only sesame or poppy seeds rather than both.  And you can also use you favorite fruit salsa or other tropical-style sauce in place of the pineapple sauce.

                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  small live hard-shell clams
     1/2         pound  snow crab legs -- broken 6" pieces,
                        shells cracked
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  3        tablespoons  pesto
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  8              large  shrimp -- peeled and deveined

Seafood Alternatives:  live mussels, small lobster tails 
Scrub the clams; discard any that are not firmly closed or do not close firmly when rinsed or tapped.  Layer the crab legs in a steaming basket and scatter the clams on top. 
Combine the wine, pesto and lemon juice in a 4- to 6-quart pan; bring to a boil over high heat.  Lower the steaming basket into pan; cover.  Reduce the heat and simmer until about half the clams are open, 5 to 8 minutes.  Add the shrimp and continue to steam until all clams are open and the shrimp are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes more. 
Divide the shellfish among wide, shallow bowls or rimmed plates.  Pour some of the cooking liquid over each serving. 
This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings. 
Comments:  The flavorful nectar released from clams as they open mingles with the steaming liquid to create a delicious sauce.  Serve with thick slices of toasted French bread for sopping up every last drop.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1 1/2           cups  milk or fish stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  cooked white fish -- flaked, skin
                        and bones removed
  1                cup  frozen peas -- thawed
  1                cup  sliced carrots -- cooked
  1                cup  thinly-sliced mushrooms
     1/3           cup  white wine
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley
                        === BISCUIT TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley
     1/3           cup  vegetable shortening
     1/4           cup  milk -- more if needed

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute, whisking frequently.  Slowly add the milk and cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside to cool slightly. 
In a large bowl, combine the fish, peas, carrots, mushrooms, wine and parsley.  Stir gently to mix.  Pour the sauce over and stir to evenly combine.  Transfer the filling to a 2-quart baking dish.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
For the biscuit topping, sift the flour, baking powder, salt and pepper into a large bowl.  Stir in the parsley, then cut in the shortening until the mixture has the consistency of small peas.  Stir in just enough milk to make a soft dough. 
Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and roll out to about 3/4-inch thick in an appropriate shape to cover the baking dish.  Cover the filling with the biscuit dough.  Using kitchen scissors or a knife, trim the dough so it just covers the edge of the dish.  Lightly press the dough against the dish to seal. 
Bake the pot pie in the preheated oven until the topping is puffed and light brown, 30 to 40 minutes.  Let sit a few minutes before serving.  Serve directly from the baking dish at the table. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  Tender white fish, paired with colorful vegetables in a silky sauce, is transformed into a comfy, warming alternative to the traditional pot pie.  Cod, halibut, snapper and sea bass are good choices.  An easy biscuit-type dough is used here, but you could also use a more traditional pastry dough.  If you have any fish stock on hand, use it in place of the milk for the sauce.  Variations are easy here, such as adding crushed cumin seed to the biscuit topping and curry powder to the binding white sauce.

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute, whisking frequently.  Slowly add the milk and cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside to cool slightly.

In a large bowl, combine the fish, peas, carrots, mushrooms, wine and parsley.  Stir gently to mix.  Pour the sauce over and stir to evenly combine.  Transfer the filling to a 2-quart baking dish.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

For the biscuit topping, sift the flour, baking powder, salt and pepper into a large bowl.  Stir in the parsley, then cut in the shortening until the mixture has the consistency of small peas.  Stir in just enough milk to make a soft dough.

Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and roll out to about 3/4-inch thick in an appropriate shape to cover the baking dish.  Cover the filling with the biscuit dough.  Using kitchen scissors or a knife, trim the dough so it just covers the edge of the dish.  Lightly press the dough against the dish to seal.

                        Shrimp And Asparagus Salad

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" pieces
  1              pound  small pink shrimp -- drained, and
                        patted dry
     1/4           cup  olive oil, preferably extra-virgin
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  honey
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  gourmet salad greens - (abt 12 cups)
                        (or use mixed lettuces)
  8              large  cooked shrimp -- peeled, tails on
  8              large  strawberries -- thinly sliced

Seafood Alternatives:  crabmeat, cooked crawfish meat 
Bring a small pan of lightly salted water to a boil, add the asparagus and cook until just crisp-tender, 2 to 4 minutes depending on the thickness of the asparagus.  Drain the asparagus and run cold water over it to cool; pat dry.  Put the asparagus in a large salad bowl with the small shrimp. 
In a small jar, combine the olive oil, vinegar, mustard and honey with salt and pepper to taste.  Seal the jar, shake well and pour the dressing over the asparagus and shrimp.  Toss to coat well.  (Refrigerate up to 4 hours, if desired.) 
Arrange the salad greens on individual plates and spoon the asparagus mixture on top.  Garnish with a large shrimp and sliced strawberries and serve. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  We use two kinds of shrimp in this recipe, tiny and large, for a variety, but you can use just one if you prefer.  If you like a crisp salad, slightly undercook the asparagus so it keeps some crunch rather than cooking it until fully tender.  Later in the season, try fresh raspberries in place of the strawberries.

                       Shrimp And Goat Cheese Tart

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             ounces  goat cheese -- thinly sliced
                        or crumbled
     3/4         pound  small cooked shrimp -- peeled and deveined
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced chives or parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced sun-dried tomatoes - (to 2 tbspns) -- (optional)
  2                     eggs
     3/4           cup  milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CREAM CHEESE PASTRY ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  6             ounces  cream cheese -- cut in chunks
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  chilled water - (to 4 tbspns) -- more if needed

To make the pastry dough, put the flour, cream cheese and salt in the work bowl of a food processor and pulse until the mixture has a sandy consistency.  Add about 3 tablespoons of the water and continue pulsing the food processor until the dough forms a ball when squeezed in your hand.  Add more water by the teaspoon as necessary.  (Note: do not overwork the dough or it will be tough; use short, quick pulses of the machine.)  Turn the dough out onto the work surface and form into a ball. 
Alternatively, cut the cream cheese into the flour with a pastry cutter, add the salt and sprinkle with water, stirring in just enough to form a ball.  Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
When the dough is well chilled, unwrap it and put it on a lightly floured work surface.  Roll out the dough to a roughly 12-inch circle and use it to line a 9-inch pie or tart pan.  Trim the edges with kitchen scissors or a small knife and prick the bottom with a fork.  Using your fingers or a pastry crimper, pinch the dough around the edge to form a decorative trim. 
Cut a piece of foil about 20 inches long and loosely crinkle it to fit in the pastry shell.  Alternatively, line the pastry shell with beans or pie weights.  Bake the shell until set and beginning to brown, about 15 minutes. 
Take the pie shell from the oven and lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees.  Scatter the goat cheese over the bottom and arrange the shrimp over the cheese.  Sprinkle the chives and sun-dried tomatoes, if using, over the shrimp. 
In a small bowl, combine the eggs, milk, salt and pepper.  Whisk to thoroughly mix, then pour evenly over the shrimp filling.  Bake until the filling is set, 25 to 30 minutes.  (To test, insert the tip of a knife into the filling; it will come out clean when the filling is cooked.) 
Let sit for at least 5 minutes before serving.  Serve warm or at room temperature. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  Cream cheese pastry dough may sound rich and indulgent, but it has less fat and calories than similar doughs made with butter and shortening, although it doesn't have the flakiness of butter doughs.  This savory tart makes a good first course or lunch dish, served with a green salad.

                        Shrimp And Potato Frittata

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  water
  2             ounces  grated sharp cheddar cheese
                        or crumbled blue cheese - (abt 1/2 cup)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried tarragon or basil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             medium  potato - (6 oz) -- skin on
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
  1                cup  very thinly-sliced small zucchini
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     3/4         pound  small peeled shrimp
     1/4           cup  roasted red bell pepper -- cut into 1/4"
                        by 2" strips

Seafood Alternatives:  cubed salmon, trout, or catfish 
Preheat the broiler.  In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, water, half of the cheese, tarragon, salt and pepper.  Cut the potato in half and then into 1/16-inch slices. 
In a 10-inch ovenproof skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the potatoes, green onion, zucchini and garlic and season with salt and pepper.  Cook, partially covered, until the vegetables are tender and lightly browned, about 5 minutes, loosening them with a spatula. 
Stir in the shrimp and cook for 1 minute, stirring; if using frozen shrimp, continue tossing until they begin to thaw, 2 to 3 minutes longer. 
Add the egg mixture to the skillet and gently stir to distribute the eggs among the vegetables.  Decorate the top with roasted pepper strips and sprinkle with the remaining cheese.  Cook until the bottom of the frittata is set, 3 to 5 mintues. 
Place the skillet under the broiler and broil until the eggs are fully set and the top is golden brown and lightly puffed, 3 to 5 minutes.  (If the top is nicely browned but the eggs are not fully cooked, turn off the broiler, close the oven door and let the frittata cook 2 to 3 minutes longer.) 
Cut the frittata into serving pieces and loosen the outside edge with a sharp knife.  Let stand 2 minutes before sliding wedges onto individual plates. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  If you've got frozen small shrimp on hand, they can go from freezer to skillet in this recipe.  Just tosss until they break up and continue as directed.  They'll thaw quickly and save an extra step in preparation. 
This recipe is also a terrific way to use leftover vegetables or other goodies tucked away in your refrigerator.

                       Shrimp And Prosciutto Kebabs

                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  large shrimp -- peeled and deveined
  2             ounces  small mushrooms - (to 3 oz)
  2             ounces  thinly-sliced prosciutto
  8                     sage leaves - (to 12) -- halved, if large

Soak bamboo skewers, if using, in a large bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes before using.  In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper.  Add the shrimp and mushrooms and stir to thoroughly coat.  Set aside for 15 minutes. 
Cut the prosciutto into 4- to 5-inch strips.  Preheat the grill. 
Take one shrimp from the marinade and top with a sage leaf.  Wrap the shrimp in a piece of prosciutto and skewer onto a skewer.  Add one of the marinated mushrooms, followed by another prosciutto-wrapped shrimp.  Continue with the remaining ingredients. 
Set the shrimp skewers on the heated grill and cook until the shrimp are pink and the mushrooms lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn the skewers and continue grilling until the shrimp is just opaque through (cut one to test), about 2 minutes longer.  Arrange the skewers on a platter for serving. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Sage and prosciutto are a traditional Italian combination of flavors, here paired with sweet tender shrimp.  The kebabs can be small, finger-sized servings, or for a more dramatic approach, use long skewers with only one or two wrapped shrimp at the end.

         Shrimp And Scallops With Cracked Black Pepper And Pasta

Recipe By     :Betsy Kuhn
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  shrimp medium -- shell-on
     1/2         pound  bay scallops
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced shallot
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1        large sprig  parsley -- plus
  3        tablespoons  minced parsley
  1                     bay leaf
  1              pinch  salt
  1               thin  dry spaghetti -- (8 ounces)
  2 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-cracked black pepper
  2          teaspoons  brandy -- (optional)

Seafood Alternatives:  rock shrimp, crawfish tails 
Rinse the shrimp, then peel and devein them, reserving their shells.  Rinse the scallops and refrigerate them with the shrimp until ready to use. 
In a medium saucepan, heat half of the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the shallot and garlic and cook until softened, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the shrimp shells and cook, stirring, until they turn pink, about 30 seconds.  Add the water, wine, parsley sprig, bay leaf and salt.  Bring just to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. 
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add the spaghetti and cook until just tender, 5 to 7 minutes.  Drain the pasta well, then pour it into a large bowl.  If desired, toss with a teaspoon of olive oil to prevent sticking. 
Strain the shrimp stock through a fine sieve, pressing gently on the shells with the back of a spoon to remove as much liquid as possible.  Measure the liquid; there should be about 1/2 cup.  (If there is too much, return it to the pan and reduce further.  If there is too little, return it to the pan, add more wine, then reduce to 1/2 cup.) 
In a medium skillet, heat the remaining olive oil over medium-high heat.  Pat-dry the shrimp and scallops, add them to the hot skillet and cook, stirring often, until just opaque through, 2 to 3 minutes.  If the shellfish release more than a couple teaspoons of liquid, drain it off. 
Reduce the heat to low, stir in the stock and minced parsley and immediately pour the mixture over the pasta.  Sprinkle the cracked pepper and brandy over (if using), toss well and serve right away. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  You can extract every ounce of flavor from the shrimp by simmering the shells in a little wine and water for an easy, luscious sauce.  The cracked black peppercorns complete the dish with their snappy heat.

                        Shrimp And Tomato Crostini

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh basil
                        (or 1 1/4 tspn dry basil)
  1              small  baguette, 2 1/2" to 3" across
                        and about 8" long -- cut into 24 slices,
                        abt 1/4" thick
  1                can  diced tomatoes with juice - (14 1/2 oz)
                        (or use sauce)
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  brown sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  24            medium  to large shrimp

Seafood Alternatives:  scallops 
Combine 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon fresh basil (or 1/2 teaspoon dried) in a small bowl.  Arrange the baguette slices in a single layer on a large baking sheet; brush lightly with the oil-basil mixture. 
Bake at 400 degrees for 4 minutes.  Rotate the pan and continue baking until crostini are crisp and lightly brown, about 4 minutes more.  Cool then store in an airtight container for up to one week. 
In a large saucepan, combine tomatoes, vinegar, brown sugar, pepper flakes and pepper sauce with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and basil.  Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes. 
Add shrimp and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are cooked though, 3 to 5 minutes.  Transfer to a heatproof bowl and add the lemon juice.  Cover and refrigerate 2 to 24 hours. 
Just before serving, strain the shrimp and tomato mixture; discard the liquid.  Spread the toasts with goat cheese and place a shrimp and some of the tomato on each.  Garnish with basil leaves. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Combine 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon fresh basil (or 1/2 teaspoon dried) in a small bowl.  Arrange the baguette slices in a single layer on a large baking sheet; brush lightly with the oil-basil mixture. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake at 400 degrees for 4 minutes.  Rotate the pan and continue baking until crostini are crisp and lightly brown, about 4 minutes more.  Cool then store in an airtight container for up to one week. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large saucepan, combine tomatoes, vinegar, brown sugar, pepper flakes and pepper sauce with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and basil.  Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add shrimp and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are cooked though, 3 to 5 minutes.  Transfer to a heatproof bowl and add the lemon juice.  Cover and refrigerate 2 to 24 hours. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Just before serving, strain the shrimp and tomato mixture; discard the liquid.  Spread the toasts with goat cheese and place a shrimp and some of the tomato on each.  Garnish with basil leaves. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                     Shrimp And Tortellini ProvenÁal

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  ready-to-cook cheese-filled
                        tortellini - (9 oz)
  2               cups  small broccoli florets
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried thyme)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced or pressed
     3/4         pound  peeled cooked medium shrimp - (to 1 lb)
  1                jar  marinated artichoke hearts - (7 oz) -- drained, and
                        halved if large
  1             medium  tomato -- cored and diced
     1/3           cup  pitted NiÁoise or common black olives
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Seafood Alternatives:  tiny cooked shrimp, crabmeat, surimi crab 
Cook the tortellini according to the package directions, adding the broccoli during the last 2 minutes; drain (to serve chilled, rinse with cold water until the pasta is cool). 
In a large bowl, combine the oil, vinegar, mustard, thyme, and garlic and whisk to mix.  Add the tortellini, broccoli, shrimp, artichoke hearts, tomato and olives and toss gently.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Buying cooked shrimp saves about 15 minutes of cleaning and cooking time.  While the tortellini cooks, you can toast some bread to serve alongside, if you like.  (Rub the toast with halved garlic cloves to flavor without butter if you prefer.)

                   Shrimp Fajitas With Mango Mint Salsa

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     fresh or pickled jalapeÒo chiles - (to 6) -- cored, seeded,
                        and minced
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh garlic
  1              large  white onion -- thinly sliced
  1              large  red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut in thin strips
  1 1/2         pounds  medium shrimp -- peeled
  8                     flour tortillas - (7 in dia)
  1              large  ripe mango - (14 oz) -- peeled, pitted,
                        and finely diced
     1/2           cup  finely-diced jicama or water chestnuts
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh mint or cilantro
  1         tablespoon  minced chives or green onions
  1         tablespoon  lime juice

Seafood Alternatives:  scallops, monkfish, tuna 
Mix the jalapeÒos, lime juice, oil and garlic in a large bowl.  Pour half the marinade into a medium bowl, add the onion and bell pepper and toss to mix.  Set both bowls aside. 
Lay the shrimp flat on a cutting board; holding the knife blade parallel to the board, slice through the back to cut the shrimp in half.  Discard the veins and toss the shrimp in the large bowl of marinade. 
For the salsa, combine the mango, jicama, mint, chives, and lime juice in a small serving bowl and stir to mix well. 
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Wrap the tortillas in foil and heat in the oven until warm, about 10 minutes. 
While the tortillas are heating, heat a heavy 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat.  Add the onion-pepper mixture and stir until the onions are limp, 3 to 4 minutes.  With a slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables to a platter; cover and keep warm in the oven. 
Add the shrimp to the pan and stir just until the shrimp are opaque through, 3 to 4 minutes.  With a slotted spoon, transfer the shrimp to the warmed serving dish alongside the vegetables and cover.  Boil the pan juices until reduced and thickened to about 1 tablespoon; pour over the shrimp. 
Spoon about 1/2 cup filling and 1 to 2 tablespoons mango salsa into each tortilla (or serve salsa on the side if you prefer).  Roll fajitas jelly-roll style and enjoy. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Fajitas are a Southwest specialty that are fun for family and friends to assemble.  Guests traditionally wrap grilled, marinated beef or chicken in flour tortillas, but seafood is great, too.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  rice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2             slices  bacon -- cut 1/2" pieces
                        (or 1 tspn vegetable oil)
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1              small  green pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1                can  chopped tomatoes in purÈe - (28 oz)
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce -- or to taste
  1 1/4         pounds  medium shrimp -- peeled and deveined

Bring 2 1/4 cups of water just to a boil, then stir in the rice and salt.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until tender, 17 to 20 minutes.  When cooked, fluff the rice with a fork. 
Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a medium saucepan over medium heat until brown and crisp.  Drain off all but 1 teaspoon of the fat.  Alternatively, heat the oil in the saucepan.  Add the onion and green pepper and sautÈ until beginning to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. 
Stir in the flour and cook 1 minute, stirring.  Gradually stir in the tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, thyme and Tabasco.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. 
Add the shrimp and simmer, stirring occasionally, until they turn pink and are cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the cooked rice and continue to simmer just until heated through, about 1 minute.  Serve hot. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  For a change from the traditional -- and time-consuming -- New Orleans recipe, try this fast and easy version.  A little bacon adds authentic flavor, but for a lighter jambalaya you can use oil in its place.

                    Shrimp Lasagna With Three Cheeses

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  dry lasagna noodles
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3               cans  tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz ea) -- chopped, drained
  2        tablespoons  minced basil
                        (or 2 tspn dried basil)
  1         tablespoon  minced oregano
                        (or 1 tspn dried oregano)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             carton  low-fat ricotta cheese - (15 oz)
  1                cup  grated mozzarella
  2                     egg whites or 1 whole egg -- beaten
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley
  1 1/2         pounds  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        and coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese

Seafood Alternatives:  rock shrimp, crawfish meat 
Bring 4 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pan over high heat.  Add the lasagna noodles and boil until tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain, rinse with cold water and drain again.  Lay the noodles on paper towels and set aside. 
Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and garlic and sautÈ until tender, about 6 minutes.  Add the drained tomatoes, basil and oregano with a pinch of salt and pepper.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes.  Taste the sauce for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper to taste. 
In a medium bowl, stir together the ricotta, mozzarella, egg whites and parsley.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
To assemble the lasagna, place one third of the pasta in a 9- by 13-inch baking pan.  Layer with half of the cheese mixture and one third of the tomato sauce.  Scatter half of the chopped shrimp over.  Repeat with the same layers of pasta, cheese, tomato sauce and shrimp.  Top with a final layer of pasta and spread with the remaining tomato sauce.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and cover the dish with foil.  (The lasagna can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.  Add cooking time if the lasagna is cold.) 
Bake the lasagna for 25 minutes.  Remove the foil and continue baking until bubbly, about 25 minutes longer.  Let stand 10 minutes before serving. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  A rich, flavorful dish with lots of shrimp, this takes a little time to put together, but the results are well worth the effort.

Bring 4 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pan over high heat.  Add the lasagna noodles and boil until tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain, rinse with cold water and drain again.  Lay the noodles on paper towels and set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and garlic and sautÈ until tender, about 6 minutes.  Add the drained tomatoes, basil and oregano with a pinch of salt and pepper.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes.  Taste the sauce for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper to taste. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium bowl, stir together the ricotta, mozzarella, egg whites and parsley.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble the lasagna, place one third of the pasta in a 9- by 13-inch baking pan.  Layer with half of the cheese mixture and one third of the tomato sauce.  Scatter half of the chopped shrimp over.  Repeat with the same layers of pasta, cheese, tomato sauce and shrimp.  Top with a final layer of pasta and spread with the remaining tomato sauce.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and cover the dish with foil.  (The lasagna can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.  Add cooking time if the lasagna is cold.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the lasagna for 25 minutes.  Remove the foil and continue baking until bubbly, about 25 minutes longer.  Let stand 10 minutes before serving. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  A rich, flavorful dish with lots of shrimp, this takes a little time to put together, but the results are well worth the effort.

                          Shrimp Polenta Tamales

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  dried corn husks
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano leaves
  2               cans  chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz ea)
  1                cup  polenta (coarse-ground cornmeal)
  1                cup  corn kernels
  1                can  chopped mild chiles - (4 oz)
  1                can  sliced black olives - (2 1/4 oz) -- drained
  12            ounces  medium shrimp or salad shrimp -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro

Seafood Alternatives:  surimi crabmeat, crabmeat, smoked salmon or trout, grilled rockfish or halibut 
Soak the corn husks in water while preparing the filling. 
Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the onion and cook over medium heat until tender, 6 to 8 minutes.  Add the garlic, cumin and oregano and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Stir in the broth, polenta, corn, chiles and olives and bring to a boil. 
Reduce the heat to a simmer and stir until the mixture has thickened and the liquid has been absorbed, about 15 minutes.  Take the pan from the heat and stir in the shrimp and cilantro. 
Drain the corn husks and dry them well with paper towels.  Start with the large husks (5 to 6 inches across) first.  Spoon about 1/4 cup of the filling lengthwise down the center of the husk.  Fold both sides over to snugly encase the filling.  When using narrower husks, fold the sides over as far as they'll go, then lay another husk on top to fully encase the filling. 
Fold the tamale ends underneath or tie the ends shut using strips of husks (tear several husks into 1/4-inch-wide strips).  You can make the tamales up to one day in advance, refrigerating them in an airtight container. 
To steam, arrange the tamales on a steamer rack or in a steaming basket, with at least an inch between them so steam can circulate.  If necessary, stack the tamales, arranging them crosswise for steam circulation.  Set the steamer rack or basket over a few inches of boiling water, cover and steam until the tamales are heated through, 10 to 15 minutes. 
Serve the tamales in the corn husks, allowing each diner to open and enjoy. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  This is a streamlined, low-fat version of the classic Mexican tamale.  In place of the traditional lard and corn mixture, this version calls for coarsely ground cornmeal cooked in broth with all the remaining ingredients stirred in.  It's fast, simple and healthy!  Serve with some typical accompaniments such as a slightly warmed green chile salsa, guacamole or simple diced tomatoes.

              Shrimp SatÈ With Indonesian Style Peanut Pasta

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  bell pepper
  1              large  yellow pepper
  1              pound  medium shrimp -- peeled and deveined
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced or pressed
  8             ounces  dry angel hair pasta
  2                     green onions -- thinly sliced
                        === PEANUT SAUCE ===
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
     1/2         small  onion -- minced
  2                     garlic cloves -- pressed or minced
     1/4           cup  chunky or smooth peanut butter
  1                cup  unsweetened coconut milk or regular milk -- mixed with
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  reduced-sodium soy sauce
  4           teaspoon  brown sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper - (to 1/8 tspn)
                        Salt -- to taste

Seafood Alternatives:  salmon, mahimahi, swordfish 
If using bamboo skewers, soak them in a bowl of water for at least 1 hour before cooking to prevent them from burning under the broiler. 
Core and seed the bell peppers, then cut them into 3/4- to 1-inch squares.  Thread the peppers onto 4 skewers. 
Rinse the shrimp in cold water and pat dry.  Thread the shrimp onto 8 skewers, catching the broad and slender ends to form alternating "C"s.  Stir together the lime juice, brown sugar and garlic and brush the mixture over the shrimp. 
Make the Peanut Sauce:  Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onion and garlic and stir until the onion is tender 3 to 5 minutes.  Add the peanut butter and stir until it softens.  Gradually whisk in the coconut milk or milk/cornstarch mixture until smooth; increase the heat and cook, stirring, until the mixture bubbles and thickens.  Remove from the heat and stir in the lime juice, soy sauce, brown sugar and cayenne.  Add salt to taste.  Cover to keep warm. 
Preheat the broiler.  Lay the skewers of peppers a few inches apart on a lightly oiled broiler pan or baking sheet (foil-covered for easy clean-up).  Broil, turning once, until the edges are tinged with black, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer the skewers to a plate and cover to keep warm. 
Arrange the shrimp skewers on the same broiler pan.  Broil about 3 inches from the heat, turning the skewers once, until the shrimp are pink and just opaque in the center, 3 to 4 minutes total. 
Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to a boil.  Add the angel hair pasta and cook until tender, 4 to 5 minutes.  Drain well.  Add the drained pasta to the peanut sauce and toss to coat. 
Divide the pasta among four plates.  Lay skewers of peppers and shrimp across each serving and sprinkle with sliced green onions.  To eat, push the peppers and shrimp off the skewers onto pasta. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Curves of pink broiled shrimp and skewers of colorful bell peppers nestle atop pasta bathed in spicy peanut sauce -- wonderful flavors from the South Pacific.  Coconut milk adds distinctive flavor to the peanut sauce, but it is high in fat.  Try to find the low-fat coconut milk now available.

                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar or lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  dried rosemary -- crushed
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4         pound  tiny cooked shrimp meat
  1             medium  tomato -- diced
     1/2         small  English cucumber -- diced
     1/3           cup  Kalamata or other black olives -- pitted, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/3           cup  diced feta cheese
  1                     slender loaf French bread (10 to 15 oz) -- split horizontally

To make the dressing, combine the olive oil, vinegar, rosemary and pepper in a jar with tight-fitting lid.  Shake well, taste for seasoning and set aside. 
Combine the shrimp, tomato, cucumber, olives and feta in a large bowl.  Shake the dressing and pour it over the shrimp mixture; toss to thoroughly coat. 
Spoon the shrimp mixture onto the bottom half of the bread loaf and cover with the top half.  Slice across into 4 sandwiches and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This tasty sandwich is a take-off on the traditional Greek salad.  As a variation, you can omit the French bread and serve the shrimp mixture over salad greens for a quick salad.

                     Shrimp With Lemon Alfredo Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  shrimp
  1              large  lemon
  8             ounces  dried or fresh fettuccine -- plain or spinach
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  half-and-half or light cream
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese -- more for serving
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Peel and devein the shrimp, rinse in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Grate enough zest (yellow part only) from the lemon to measure 1 teaspoon, then squeeze the juice from the lemon; set the zest and juice aside. 
When the water comes to a boil, add the fettuccine and simmer just until al dente (tender but still firm), 2 to 3 minutes for fresh pasta, 5 to 7 minutes for dried.  While the pasta is still cooking, combine the butter and cream in a medium skillet (preferably non-stick), bring to a boil and boil for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice and shrimp and simmer until the shrimp are opaque through, 3 to 5 minutes; the shrimp will be evenly pink and partly curled. 
Drain the pasta thoroughly and put it in a large bowl.  Pour the hot shrimp sauce over, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper and stir quickly and thoroughly to coat the noodles with sauce. 
Transfer the hot pasta to individual plates, distributing the shrimp evenly.  Serve immediately, passing extra grated Parmesan cheese alongside. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Fettuccine Alfredo is a favorite standby of pasta lovers -- simple and pure with the flavors of good pasta, good cream and good cheese.  Here we add a splash of new flavors with shrimp and lemon.  Alfredo was, legend has it, a restaurateur in Rome who made this pasta sauce popular.  Freshly grated Parmesan cheese makes all the difference in this simple recipe.

            Shrimp, Broccoli And Cheese Stuffed Baked Potatoes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  russet or baking potatoes - (1/2 lb ea)
     1/4         pound  tiny cooked and peeled shrimp
     1/2       package  frozen chopped broccoli - (10 oz pkg) -- thawed
     1/2           cup  grated Cheddar cheese
     1/2           cup  plain lowfat yogurt
     1/4           cup  nonfat or regular mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  1           teaspoon  dry dill weed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Seafood Alternatives:  crabmeat, cooked flaked salmon 
Scrub the potatoes and prick them several times with a fork.  Set the potatoes on a paper towel and microwave on High (100% power) 4 minutes.  Turn the potatoes over and microwave until tender but still slightly firm in center when pierced with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes more.  Remove from the oven, wrap in foil and let stand until very tender in center, about 10 minutes. 
Rinse the shrimp and pat dry.  Drain the broccoli well.  In a bowl, combine the shrimp, broccoli, cheese, yogurt, mayonnaise, onions and dill. 
Unwrap the potatoes and cut them in half lengthwise.  Scoop the potato meat from the skin, leaving about 1/4 inch all around.  Add the potato meat to the shrimp mixture and stir well.  Add salt and pepper to taste. 
Mound the mixture in the potato shells.  Set the stuffed potatoes on a plate and microwave on High (100% power) until heated through, about 3 minutes. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Potatoes bake quickly in the microwave.  You can stuff these potatoes ahead and refrigerate until later.  Allow an extra minute or two for rewarming chilled potatoes.  For lunch, serve half a potato with apple wedges and carrot sticks, or two halves for dinner.  You can also prepare the recipe in a standard oven, baking the potatoes at 400 degrees for about 1 hour and finishing the stuffed potatoes for about 15 minutes.

                     Shrimp, Orange And Arugula Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  navel oranges - (abt 3 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  shrimp or crab boil seasoning -- (optional)
  1 1/2         pounds  medium shrimp -- peeled and deveined
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             ounces  arugula (rocket) -- trimmed and rinsed

Cut both ends from the oranges just to the flesh.  Set them upright on a cutting board and use the knife to cut away the peel and skin, following the curve of the fruit. 
Working over a large bowl to catch the sections and juice, hold a peeled orange in your hand and slide the knife blade down one side of a section, cutting it from the membrane.  Cut down the other side of the section and remove it.  Continue for the remaining sections, turning back flaps of membrane like the pages of a book, and repeat with the rest of the oranges. 
Add the shrimp boil seasoning, if using, and salt to about 6 cups boiling water in a large pan.  Add the shrimp and simmer until pink and just opaque when cut into, 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain and set aside to cool. 
Sprinkle the olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper over the orange sections in the large bowl.  Add the shrimp and arugula and toss gently to coat.  Taste the salad for seasoning, cover and refrigerate. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This salad travels well thanks to hardy arugula and not much vinegar, which is often the cause of wilty lettuce.  Arugula (also called rocket) is a peppery green with stout stems that resembles dandelion greens.  If you cannot find arugula, use tender fresh spinach leaves instead. 
We suggest a technique for sectioning oranges that removes all of the skin and membrane, but to save time you can peel and section the oranges as you usually would.

                   Sicilian Style Swordfish With Capers

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3               cups  thinly-sliced leeks or onions
  4          teaspoons  minced or pressed garlic
  1              pound  medium white mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and quartered
  1 1/2         pounds  swordfish -- cut into 4 portions
     3/4           cup  dry vermouth, white wine or clam juice
     1/3           cup  drained capers
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley
     1/4           cup  minced fresh oregano, thyme,
                        rosemary and mint
                        (or 4 tspns mixed dried oregano, thyme,
                        rosemary and mint)
  10                    oil-cured black olives -- pitted and slivered
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Seafood Alternatives:  tuna, halibut, mahimahi, salmon, mackerel, trout 
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. 
For the sauce:  In a heavy 10-inch skillet, heat the butter and oil over medium heat until the butter sizzles, about 3 minutes.  Add the leeks and garlic and saute, partially covered, until tender, about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
Increase the heat to medium-high and add the mushrooms.  Cook, partially covered, until the mushrooms soften slightly, about 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, arrange the swordfish in a single layer in a lightly oiled baking dish. 
Stir the vermouth, capers, parsley, mixed herbs, olives and pepper into the sauce.  Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered for 2 minutes, stirring.  Pour the sauce over the swordfish and bake, uncovered, until fish is barely opaque and slightly springy, 12 to 15 minutes. 
Transfer the swordfish to individual plates and spoon the sauce over.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Swordfish is abundant in the waters off Sicily, and oregano, thyme, rosemary and mint thrive in its hot climate.  The vermouth doesnt stand out in the finished dish, but it adds a clean, herby flavor to the sauce. 
Serve the fish with linguine tossed with olive oil and sauteed zucchini splashed with lemon.

<DirT>
Seafood Alternatives:  tuna, halibut, mahimahi, salmon, mackerel, trout 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the sauce:  In a heavy 10-inch skillet, heat the butter and oil over medium heat until the butter sizzles, about 3 minutes.  Add the leeks and garlic and saute, partially covered, until tender, about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Increase the heat to medium-high and add the mushrooms.  Cook, partially covered, until the mushrooms soften slightly, about 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, arrange the swordfish in a single layer in a lightly oiled baking dish. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir the vermouth, capers, parsley, mixed herbs, olives and pepper into the sauce.  Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered for 2 minutes, stirring.  Pour the sauce over the swordfish and bake, uncovered, until fish is barely opaque and slightly springy, 12 to 15 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the swordfish to individual plates and spoon the sauce over.  Serve immediately. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Swordfish is abundant in the waters off Sicily, and oregano, thyme, rosemary and mint thrive in its hot climate.  The vermouth doesnt stand out in the finished dish, but it adds a clean, herby flavor to the sauce. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve the fish with linguine tossed with olive oil and sauteed zucchini splashed with lemon.

                         Simple Shellfish Paella

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  vegetable or chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz)
  2               cups  water
     1/4         pound  Italian sausage -- casing removed,
                        and crumbled
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and coarsely chopped
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  chili powder
  2               cups  long-grain rice
  1              pound  hardshell clams -- scrubbed
  1              pound  mussels -- scrubbed, debearded

Seafood Alternatives:  shrimp, rock shrimp, crawfish tails 
Bring the broth and water to a simmer over medium heat.  Meanwhile, cook the sausage over medium heat in a large skillet, covered, until cooked through.  Drain well on paper towels and set aside. 
Wipe out the skillet and heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onion, bell pepper and garlic and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the cumin and chili powder, followed by the rice and sausage.  Cook and stir 2 minutes.  Add the hot liquid, cover and cook until the rice is almost tender, 13 to 15 minutes. 
Uncover and arrange the clams and mussels, hinge side down, in the rice mixture.  Cover and cook until the clams and mussels are open, 7 to 10 minutes longer.  Discard any unopened clams or mussels.  Spoon the rice mixture and seafood onto warmed plates and serve. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Our streamlined version of the classic paella is easy to put together and makes a festive party dish.  You will need a large (12-inch) skillet with a high cover in order to steam open the clams and mussels.

                          Smoked Black Cod Cakes

Recipe By     :Susan Volland
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  smoked black cod
     1/2                red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and finely diced
  1                     celery stalk -- finely diced
  3                     eggs
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Dijon-style mustard
  1         tablespoon  minced or pressed garlic
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
  4             dashes  Tabasco sauce
  5               cups  soft white bread crumbs
                        Oil -- for frying
                        === PIQUANT PEPPER RELISH ===
  2                     red bell pepper -- roasted and peeled
  2                     yellow bell peppers -- roasted and peeled
  2             medium  tomatoes -- cored and peeled
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar
  3        tablespoons  vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Seafood Alternatives:  smoked halibut, smoked sturgeon, smoked salmon 
To prepare the relish, slice the roasted peppers and tomatoes into thin strips and mix together.  In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, vinegar, allspice, red pepper flakes, with salt and pepper to taste and heat gently until the sugar is dissolved.  Pour the hot liquid over the roasted pepper mixture.  Set aside. 
Remove the skin and bones from the smoked black cod and flake it into a medium bowl.  Add the bell pepper, celery, eggs, mustard, garlic and half of the parsley.  Season with Tabasco, salt and pepper.  Stir in 1 1/2 cups of the bread crumbs until the mixture is thoroughly combined. 
Shape the cod cakes into 1/4-cup balls and place in a container covered with the remaining bread crumbs and parsley.  Sprinkle some of the bread crumbs over the cakes and chill for 30 minutes.  This helps make the cakes easier to handle, and the crumbs make a nice crust. 
Heat about 1 inch of oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Discard excess bread crumbs from the cod cakes and fry until evenly golden brown, about 3 minutes on each side.  Serve the cakes hot with the piquant pepper relish. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This is a very moist and creamy fish cake that takes a little care in handling, but it is worth it in the end.  We used richly-flavored black cod, which can be hard to find, but most any hot-smoked fish will do.  Served in smaller portions, these cakes make tasty first course as well.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  small red potatoes
     3/4         pound  snow peas or sugar snap peas -- cleaned
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3              heads  Belgian endive
     1/4           cup  minced fresh thyme
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  minced chives
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     3/4         pound  smoked trout - (to 1 lb)

Seafood Alternatives:  grilled swordfish, tuna, mackerel, smoked salmon, shrimp 
Put the potatoes in a large pan with cold salted water to cover, bring to a boil and simmer until just tender when pierced with the point of a knife, about 10 minutes.  Drain the potatoes, let cool slightly and cut them in quarters. 
While the potatoes are cooking, bring 2 inches water to a boil under a steamer rack, add the snow peas and steam for 1 minute.  Run cold water over the peas to stop cooking and pat dry.  In a large bowl, combine the potatoes and snow peas.  Add the olive oil and toss to coat. 
Sliver the endive on the diagonal and toss into the potato mixture together with thyme, vinegar, chives, capers, salt and pepper.  Flake the trout into bite-sized pieces, discarding any skin and bones, and add it to the potato mixture.  Gently mix, taste for seasoning and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This is a quick, easy summer supper.  Showcase smoked trout in this pretty salad and serve with warm pita bread and a crunchy cucumber-yogurt dip.  Try basil, tarragon or Italian parsley for a fragrant herbal alternative to the thyme.

                            Smothered Flounder

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  flounder or other flat fish - (abt 2 lbs)
  1              large  yellow onion -- thinly sliced
  2              large  beefsteak tomatoes -- cored and sliced
  2                     zucchini -- thinly sliced
  1                     red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     thyme sprigs

Seafood Alternatives:  trout, sea bass 
Thoroughly rinse the flounder inside and out and pat dry with paper towels.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
In a large bowl, combine the onion, tomatoes, zucchini and bell pepper and stir to mix well.  Add the thyme leaves, olive oil, salt and pepper to taste and toss to evenly coat the vegetables. 
Arrange about one third of the vegetables in the bottom of a 9- by 13-inch baking dish.  Set the flounder on top and arrange the remaining vegetables over the fish.  Set the whole thyme sprigs on top and bake in the preheated oven until the fish is opaque through the thickest part, 20 to 25 minutes. 
Scoop the vegetables onto a serving platter and set the whole fish on top.  Drizzle some of the cooking juices over the fish and serve. 
This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings. 
Comments:  Thinly sliced vegetables thoroughly cover whole flounder in this recipe, which not only keeps the fish moist but also infuses delicious flavor while baking.  You can easily alter the list of vegetables according to your taste.  Consider fennel bulb, mushrooms, Napa cabbage or artichoke bottoms.  If good, ripe tomatoes are not available, use canned in their place.

                           Snapper With Sofrito

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  achiote or paprika oil, see * Note
  6               cups  thinly-sliced onions - (abt 3 lg onions)
  3        tablespoons  minced or pressed garlic
  3               cups  drained canned whole tomatoes
                        (28-oz can, 2 cups drained)
  1           teaspoon  dry basil
     1/2      teaspoon  minced fresh chile pepper -- (to 1 1/2 tspns)
                        (or use dried red pepper flakes)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  snapper fillet -- skin and bones
                        removed, cut into 4 portions
     1/4           cup  drained capers
     1/4           cup  minced cilantro

* Note: Achiote [ah-chee-OH-tay] is the rusty-red seed of the tropical annatto tree.  Slightly smaller than a peppercorn, this triangular seed has a mild, musky, peppery taste.  However, it is used primarily to color rice and other foods a bright saffron yellow.  Heated with oil or ground with herbs and spices, achiote is a culinary staple of the Caribbean and Latin America. 
To make achiote oil:  In a small saucepan, heat 1/2 cup vegetable oil over medium heat for about 5 minutes.  Add 2 tablespoons achiote seeds and cook until the oil turns crimson, 3 to 5 minutes, stirring.  Cool the oil, strain and refrigerate indefinitely.  If achiote seeds are unavailable, stir 2 tablespoons each paprika and turmeric in their place. 
Seafood Alternatives:  grouper, tilapia, catfish, flounders, shrimp 
Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.  Add the onions, toss and cook, partly covered, until softened about 5 minutes, stirring.  Add the garlic, tomatoes, basil, chiles, salt and pepper. 
Cook, partly covered, until the onions are very tender, about 20 minutes, stirring often and mashing the tomatoes with the spoon or spatula. 
Uncover and cook until moisture evaporates and the sofrito is thick, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring often. 
Rinse the snapper with cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Stir the capers into the onion mixture and arrange the snapper on top.  Season the fish with salt, pepper and cilantro.  Cover and cook until just opaque, 5 to 7 minutes. 
With a wide spatula, transfer the snapper to a plate.  Spoon the sofrito into a shallow serving dish and set the snapper on top.  Serve at once. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Sofrito derives its name from the Spanish verb "sofreir," which means to fry lightly.  In Spain, onions, leeks and bacon were slow-cooked in olive oil to produce classic sofrito, the base for much regional Spanish cooking.  The island version adds native tomatoes, chiles, achiote seeds and salt pork to this blend.  Sofrito is great to have on hand for a quick sauce; store it refrigerated up to 1 1/2 weeks or freeze.  Snapper sofrito is ideally paired with rice or beans.

                      Sole With Grapes And Champagne

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  sole fillets
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  Champagne
  2              whole  stems fresh tarragon
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/4         pound  seedless green or red grapes -- halved

Rinse the sole fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Lightly butter a shallow baking dish and a piece of foil just large enough to cover the dish.  Lay the sole fillets in the dish, folding thin tail ends under for even thickness.  Season with salt and pepper.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
In a small saucepan, combine the Champagne and tarragon stems.  Bring the liquid to a boil and simmer for 1 minute.  Carefully pour the hot liquid over the sole fillets, cover with the buttered foil and bake in the heated oven until the fillets flake easily at the thickest part, 2 to 5 minutes depending on their thickness. 
Using a spatula, carefully remove the fillets from the liquid and transfer to paper towels.  Cover with foil to keep warm. 
Pour the liquid back into the saucepan, add the cream and bring to a boil.  Simmer until the sauce is thick enough to just coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.  Discard the tarragon stems, stir in the grapes and taste the sauce for seasoning. 
Arrange the sole fillets on individual plates, spoon the sauce over and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This recipe is a variation of the French vÈronique preparation, which uses white wine and green grapes.  The delicate, tender flesh of sole is perfect with the refined flavors of the sauce, and together they create a dish that will make any mother proud.  True Champagne is by no means a requisite for this recipe; indeed any domestic sparkling white wine will do well.

Rinse the sole fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Lightly butter a shallow baking dish and a piece of foil just large enough to cover the dish.  Lay the sole fillets in the dish, folding thin tail ends under for even thickness.  Season with salt and pepper.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small saucepan, combine the Champagne and tarragon stems.  Bring the liquid to a boil and simmer for 1 minute.  Carefully pour the hot liquid over the sole fillets, cover with the buttered foil and bake in the heated oven until the fillets flake easily at the thickest part, 2 to 5 minutes depending on their thickness. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a spatula, carefully remove the fillets from the liquid and transfer to paper towels.  Cover with foil to keep warm. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the liquid back into the saucepan, add the cream and bring to a boil.  Simmer until the sauce is thick enough to just coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.  Discard the tarragon stems, stir in the grapes and taste the sauce for seasoning. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the sole fillets on individual plates, spoon the sauce over and serve immediately. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This recipe is a variation of the French vÈronique preparation, which uses white wine and green grapes.  The delicate, tender flesh of sole is perfect with the refined flavors of the sauce, and together they create a dish that will make any mother proud.  True Champagne is by no means a requisite for this recipe; indeed any domestic sparkling white wine will do well.

  3                     red bell peppers
  2                     garlic heads
     1/4      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  salt (if not using seaweed)
  4             sprigs  fresh rosemary
                        (or 1/2 tspn dry rosemary)
  7             pounds  live crawfish
                        (or 3 lbs medium or large shrimp, shell
                        on)
  3             pounds  live clams -- scrubbed
  3               cups  beer - (two 12-oz bottles)
                        (or 3 cups dry white wine)
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish
                        Creole Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Lemon Butter -- (see recipe)

Preheat an outdoor grill. 
Place a metal steamer rack in the bottom of a 16-quart pot at least 10 inches in diameter.  If using seaweed, place half of it on and under the steamer rack.

Place the pot on a fire grate over a white-hot fire (adding more briquettes frist, if necessary) or on a stove over high heat.  Cook until a strong gush of steam escapes (about 12 minutes on the stove, about 35 minutes on the grill). 
Reduce the stove heat to medium-high (leave outdoor fire as is) and start timing.  Steam-cook for about 15 minutes or until the "tester" potato is tender and the shrimp are bright pink.  Discard the seaweed and/or corn husks. 
Arrange the shrimp and other ingredients on a large serving platter.  Serve with Creole Sauce and/or Lemon Butter and lemon wedges. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

          Southwest Caesar With Garlicky Grilled Shrimp Croutons

Recipe By     :Kathy Casey
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  romaine lettuce heads
  12             large  shrimp -- peeled and deveined
  32                    one-inch French bread cubes - (abt 4 cups)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced or pressed garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        Snappy Salsa -- (see recipe)
                        === ZESTY LIME CAESAR DRESSING ===
  1                     egg yolk
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  minced anchovy fillets
                        (abt 4 drained fillets)
  2          teaspoons  minced or pressed garlic
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1               dash  Tabasco sauce
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  finely-grated lime zest
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil

Seafood Alternatives:  scallops 
Soak the bamboo skewers in a pan of water for at least 2 hours to prevent them from burning on the grill.  Heat the barbecue grill until the coals glow red with white ash around the edge. 
Meanwhile, make the dressing:  In a food processor or blender, combine all the ingredients except the oils.  Process for 1 minute, then with the motor running, slowly pour in the oils.  The finished dressing should be smooth and creamy. 
Assemble on each skewer the shrimp and bread cubes in this order: 2 bread cubes, 1 shrimp, repeat two more times, then finish with 2 bread cubes.  Mix together the olive oil and garlic.  Lightly brush each side of the skewers with the oil mixture.  Season the skewers with salt and pepper as desired. 
Put the skewers on heated grill.  Turn when first side is nicely marked and shrimp have just turned pink, about 1 minute.  Continue cooking on the other side until the shrimp are opaque through but still juicy, about 1 minute longer. 
Meanwhile, toss the romaine with 1/2 cup of the Caesar Dressing and the Parmesan cheese.  Divide among 4 chilled dinner plates.  Top each salad with 1/4 cup of the Snappy Salsa and lay a skewer on each salad.  Extra Caesar Dressing will keep for 4 days in the refrigerator. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Old Caesar Cardini himself would surely approve of this spirited variation on his creation.  Croutons grilled alongside the shrimp, all basted with garlic oil, make for a fun twist.

            Soy Glazed Mushrooms With Smoked Five Spice Shrimp

Recipe By     :Susan Volland
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  water
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce, preferably reduced-sodium
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  peanut or vegetable oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1           teaspoon  minced or grated ginger
  4               cups  mushrooms -- quartered
                        (use an assortment, such as button,
                        shiitake, oyster mushrooms and enoki)
  2        tablespoons  medium-dry sherry, chicken stock,
                        or wine
  1              pound  smoked five-spice shrimp
                        or other smoked shrimp
     1/2           cup  sliced water chestnuts
  1                     green onion -- thinly sliced

Seafood Alternatives:  smoked scallops, smoked clams, smoked oysters 
Make the sauce by blending the water, soy sauce, sugar and cornstarch.  Set aside. 
Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the oil and swirl the pan to coat the sides.  Add the garlic and ginger and sautÈ until aromatic, about 15 seconds.  Sear the mushrooms in the hot oil until nicely browned and tender, about 4 minutes.  Add the sherry, shrimp and water chestnuts. 
Stir the sauce to thoroughly remix and pour it into the wok.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and the ingredients are evenly coated, 2 minutes more. 
Transfer the shrimp mixture to a warmed serving dish, sprinkle with the green onion and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This simple dish is quick to prepare and full of delicious flavor.  To customize shrimp for this recipe, simply add 1 teaspoon of five-spice powder to the smoked brine mixture and follow the regular steps for smoking shrimp. 
Try adding some tea leaves to the wood chips for an aromatic Chinese variation.  (The shrimp are also great served plain with hot mustard and cold beer.) 
Alternatively, you can use regular smoked shrimp and add 1/2 teaspoon of five-spice powder to the garlic and ginger mixture before adding the mushrooms.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the sauce by blending the water, soy sauce, sugar and cornstarch.  Set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the oil and swirl the pan to coat the sides.  Add the garlic and ginger and sautÈ until aromatic, about 15 seconds.  Sear the mushrooms in the hot oil until nicely browned and tender, about 4 minutes.  Add the sherry, shrimp and water chestnuts. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir the sauce to thoroughly remix and pour it into the wok.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and the ingredients are evenly coated, 2 minutes more. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the shrimp mixture to a warmed serving dish, sprinkle with the green onion and serve immediately. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This simple dish is quick to prepare and full of delicious flavor.  To customize shrimp for this recipe, simply add 1 teaspoon of five-spice powder to the smoked brine mixture and follow the regular steps for smoking shrimp. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Try adding some tea leaves to the wood chips for an aromatic Chinese variation.  (The shrimp are also great served plain with hot mustard and cold beer.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Alternatively, you can use regular smoked shrimp and add 1/2 teaspoon of five-spice powder to the garlic and ginger mixture before adding the mushrooms.

                    Spanish Style Mussels With Olives

Recipe By     :Susan Volland
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped onion
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              pinch  dried red pepper flakes
  3             pounds  mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
     1/4           cup  medium-dry or dry sherry
  1                cup  diced tomato
     1/2           cup  chopped green olives
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and garlic and cook until aromatic and slightly tender, stirring often, 2 to 3 minutes. 
Stir in the red pepper flakes, then add the mussels, stirring so they are evenly coated in the vegetable mixture.  Add the sherry, cover the pan and steam until the mussels just begin to open, 4 to 5 minutes. 
Add the tomato, olives, lemon juice and parsley and gently stir just to mix.  Spoon the mussels onto small individual plates, drizzle the cooking liquids over and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This is a typical "tapas" style Spanish dish, meant to be served as one of many small plates for a casual, festive meal.  It makes a great appetizer or could make a light dinner for 2 with a crisp salad alongside.  Serve these mussels with crusty bread for soaking up the tasty cooking juices.

              Spice Crusted Salmon With Green Herb Dressing

Recipe By     :Chef Matthew Kenney, Matthew's
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  cumin seed -- toasted and ground
  1           teaspoon  cardamom -- toasted and ground
  1         tablespoon  ginger -- blanched and diced
  1           teaspoon  white peppercorns -- ground
  1         tablespoon  coriander seeds -- cracked
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     salmon steaks or fillets - (6 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        === GREEN HERB DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  cilantro leaves
  1                     green onion -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  mint leaves
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  1                     garlic clove -- preferably roasted
  1           teaspoon  cumin seeds -- toasted
  1              pinch  cayenne
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the green herb dressing:  Combine all the ingredients in a blender and blend to mix.  Taste the dressing for seasoning, pour into a bowl and chill until needed. 
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. 
In a shallow plate, combine the cumin, cardamom, ginger, white peppercorns, coriander, salt and pepper; stir to mix well.  Press one side of the salmon into the spice mixture, pressing firmly so the spices will stick. 
Heat the olive oil in a large oven-proof nonstick skillet.  Add the salmon, spice-side down, and cook over medium-high heat until the spices are aromatic and the crust is lightly colored.  Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 3 minutes.  Turn the salmon and continue baking until just opaque through, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
Arrange the salmon on individual plates, spoon the herb dressing over and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This is a sample of Kenney's penchant for coating seafood.  Here the aromatic spice crust contrasts tastefully with the tender richness of salmon.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  green leaf lettuce -- washed, dried,
                        tough stems removed
  1              large  ripe mango or papaya -- peeled, pitted,
                        seeded, and cut in thin strips
     1/3           cup  mint leaves
  1                     lime -- cut into wedges
  1              pound  skinless cod fillet -- pin bones removed
  2                     green onions -- minced
  1                     jalapeÒo chile -- cored, seeded,
                        and minced
  1         tablespoon  pressed or minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  grated or minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  Thai fish sauce or soy sauce
  1              large  lemon
                        Peanut oil or vegetable oil -- for cooking
                        === CILANTRO AIOLI ===
  1              bunch  cilantro -- washed
                        Juice and grated zest of 1 large lemon
  4                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise, preferably reduced-fat

Seafood Alternatives:  catfish, snapper, scallops, salmon 
For the cilantro aioli, coarsely chop the entire bunch of cilantro (stems and leaves) and put it in a blender or small food processor.  Add the lemon zest and garlic to the blender and whirl until coarsely chopped.  Add the mayonnaise and whirl until the cilantro is very finely chopped.  Add the lemon juice and whirl to mix. 
Transfer the cilantro aioli to a small serving bowl and set it on a platter with the lettuce leaves, mango, mint leaves and lime wedges.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. 
Cut the fish into 1-inch pieces and finely chop it in a food processor, 10 to 20 seconds; do not overprocess to a smooth purÈe.  (Alternatively, finely mince the fish with a knife.)  In a bowl, combine the fish, green onions, jalapeÒo, garlic, ginger, fish sauce and lemon zest and stir until well blended. 
Form the fish mixture into patties of about 2 tablespoons each; you should have 16 patties total. 
Pour about 1/8 inch oil into a large frying pan.  Heat over medium-high heat until ripples develop in the oil.  With a spatula, carefully slide 5 to 6 patties into the pan, spacing them at least 1 inch apart.  Cook until golden on the bottom, 2 to 4 minutes. 
Turn and cook until golden on the bottom and opaque in the center.  (Reduce the heat if the patties become too dark before cooking through.)  Drain on paper towels, then keep warm in a 200 degrees oven.  Repeat to cook the remaining patties, adding more oil to the pan as needed. 
Pile the fish cakes onto the serving platter alongside the other ingredients.  To eat, put a fish cake, some mango and mint in the center of a lettuce leaf.  Sprinkle with a squeeze of lime, then spoon on some of the cilantro aioli.  Fold up and eat out of hand. 
This recipe yields  4 to 6 servings. 
Comments:  These flavorful fish cakes are tasty served alone, or with a dollop of the cilantro sauce, but they are outstanding when wrapped in crisp lettuce, with fresh mint and mango tucked inside.  It is an Asian approach that is deliciously different.

Comments:  These flavorful fish cakes are tasty served alone, or with a dollop of the cilantro sauce, but they are outstanding when wrapped in crisp lettuce, with fresh mint and mango tucked inside.  It is an Asian approach that is deliciously different.

                     Spicy Grilled Catfish With Aioli

Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  catfish fillets
                        === AIOLI ===
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  3                     garlic cloves -- pressed
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh tarragon
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried tarragon)
                        === BLACKENING MIX ===
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  dried thyme
  2        tablespoons  dried oregano
  2        tablespoons  garlic powder
  2        tablespoons  onion powder
  2        tablespoons  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  cayenne pepper
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin

Seafood Alternatives:  tilapia, rockfish, lingcod 
Preheat a charcoal grill until the coals glow red with white ash on the edges.  Rinse the catfish with cold water; pat dry with paper towels. 
Combine all the aioli ingredients; mix well and refrigerate. 
Combine all the blackeneing mix ingredients and mix well.  Pour about 1/4 of the spice mixture onto a plate.  Dredge both sides of the fillets in the spices to coat.  Cook the catfish on the hot grill until opaque through the thickest portion, about 5 minutes per side. 
Serve with a spoonful of aioli alongside. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Inspired by a Cajun classic, this blackened catfish cooks on your grill, not in a pan.  The blackening mix is spicy, but not too hot.  Serve with a mess of hush puppies, coleslaw and cold watermelon slices.  The spice mixture makes more than needed for the recipe, but the extra will keep.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  cooked halibut
  4                     Kaiser rolls
  4              large  lettuce leaves
  4              large  tomato slices
                        === SPICY REMOULADE SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise or reduced-fat mayonnaise
  1                     green onion -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced cornichons or dill pickle
  1         tablespoon  minced capers
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh tarragon
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  prepared horseradish
  1                     garlic clove -- minced or pressed
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper

Seafood Alternatives:  cod, salmon, shrimp 
To make the spicy remoulade sauce, stir all the ingredients together in a small bowl. 
Break the fish into 1/2- to 1-inch pieces, discarding any skin or bones, and put it in a medium bowl.  Add the remoulade sauce and gently stir to mix. 
Halve the kaiser rolls and lightly toast the cut sides.  Layer the lettuce, tomato and 1/4 of the fish mixture in each roll. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  A cross between traditional French and spicy New Orleans remoulade, this sauce is a nice alternative to tartar.  Make it as mild or spicy as you like!

               Spicy Shrimp With Green Beans And Red Pepper

Recipe By     :Susan Fuller Slack, CCP
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  large shrimp -- peeled
                        (or 3/4 lb sea scallops,
                        sliced into 1/4" rounds)
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
     3/4         pound  fresh young green beans -- trimmed
     1/4           cup  peanut oil or canola oil
  2                     shallots -- finely minced
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  1                     red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut in 1/4" julienne strips
                        Fresh cilantro sprigs
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/4           cup  low-sodium chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  Southeast Asian fish sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  Indonesian chili sauce (sambal ulek) -- to 3 tspns
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch

Seafood Alternatives:  scallops, squid rings 
Rinse the shrimp with cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Put the shrimp in a medium bowl, sprinkle with the wine, cover and refrigerate until needed, up to 2 hours. 
Bring a medium pan of salted water to a boil, add the green beans and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain, rinse with cold water and thoroughly dry on paper towels.  Cut the beans diagonally in 1 1/2-inch lengths and set aside. 
In a small bowl, stir together the glaze ingredients and set aside. Drain the shrimp well. 
Heat a wok or medium skillet over high heat.  Add half of the oil and when it is very hot, add the shrimp.  Stir-fry until the shrimp are firm and opaque, 1 to 2 minutes.  Take from the heat and set the shrimp aside. 
Reheat the wok over medium-high heat and add the remaining oil.  Stir-fry the shallots, garlic and bell pepper until the bell pepper begins to soften, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the green beans and stir-fry just until hot, about 30 seconds longer. 
Reduce the heat, stir the glaze and pour it into the wok.  Stir until thickened.  Add the shrimp with any juices and stir to combine. 
Pour onto an attractive serving platter and garnish with the sprigs of cilantro. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Indonesians love to "fire up" their dishes with generous amounts of incendiary chili sauces called sambals.  They are served as table condiments or added to dishes as they are cooked.  In Indonesia, sambals and other red-hot dishes are meant to be toned down by mixing them with generous amounts of white rice. 
How may spoonfuls of chili sauce are enough?  The amount depends upon your personal level of tolerance for capsaicin, the fiery crystalline chemical found in chiles.  It acts as an irritant and causes the burning sensation in your mouth.  It is believed to promote perspiration, which cools down the body -- an important consideration in tropical climates.

     1/2         pound  crabmeat

Seafood Alternatives:  cooked shrimp, cooked and flaked cod, salmon or swordfish 
Bring about 1 inch of water to a boil in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan.  Trim tough ends from the asparagus and wash the stalks well.  Add to the boiling water and simmer until the stalks are tender-crisp, about 4 minutes.  Drain the asparagus and cover it with ice water until cold, about 10 minutes; drain again. 
Meanwhile, core the lettuce, wash the leaves and pat dry.  Slice the cantaloupe into 12 wedges and cut away the rind.  Chop the mint leaves. 
Combine the mint, ginger, vinegar, oil, mustard and sugar in a small bowl and mix well. 
Divide the lettuce among 4 plates.  Fan 1/4 of the asparagus and 3 wedges of melon over each bed of lettuce.  Top the salads with crabmeat and drizzle with dressing. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Streamline the making of this salad by purchasing cut-up cantaloupe and washed greens from your supermarkets salad bar.

             Spring Vegetable And Shrimp Pot With Dill Sauce

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  low-fat or regular mayonnaise
  4          teaspoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh dill
                        (or 1 tspn dried dill)
  1         tablespoon  minced onion
  3        tablespoons  pickling or shrimp boil spices -- (optional)
  1 1/2         pounds  small new potatoes - (to 2 lbs) -- scrubbed
  1 1/2         pounds  medium shrimp
  1              pound  sugar snap peas

Seafood Alternatives:  crawfish, crab legs or whole crab, clams or mussels 
In a small bowl stir together the mayonnaise, lemon juice, dill and onion.  Let stand at least 20 minutes for flavors to blend. 
In a 4- to 5-quart pan, bring pickling spices and 3 quarts water to a boil.  Add the potatoes and simmer uncovered until potatoes are tender when pierced, about 20 minutes.  Transfer with a slotted spoon to a large serving platter and cover to keep warm. 
While the potatoes cook, devein the shrimp and rinse well, leaving the shells on.  Add the shrimp to the boiling water and simmer 1 minute.  Add the peas and cook until the shrimp are opaque in the center, about 1 minute more. 
Drain the shrimp and peas and add to the platter with the potatoes.  Serve with dill sauce and/or other sauces to dip vegetables and shrimp into. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  It's not soup, but this entire meal cooks in one pot -- and that sure makes cleanup easy.  Dip potatoes, shrimp, peas into lemony dill sauce, or substitute prepared tartar sauce, ranch dressing or honey mustard dressing.
