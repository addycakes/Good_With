                          Apple And Raisin Crisp

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/4           cups  old-fashioned oats
  1                cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed) -- plus
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  walnuts -- chopped
                        === FILLING ===
  4             pounds  pippin or Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced
  1 1/2           cups  golden or brown raisins
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter 9- by 13 1/2-inch glass baking dish.

For Topping:  Mix old-fashioned oats, brown sugar, all-purpose flour, ground cinnamon and salt in large bowl.  Add unsalted butter and rub into mixture until coarse crumbs form.  Mix in chopped walnuts.

For Filling:  Combine sliced apples, raisins, sugar, fresh lemon juice, flour and ground cinnamon in large bowl.  Mix well to blend.

Transfer apple-raisin filling to prepared dish.  Spread topping over.  Bake until topping is golden brown, about 55 minutes.  Serve crisp warm with scoops of vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The colonists planted around 150 varieties of apples in New England, many of which can still be found today.  Apples show up most often in a double-crust pie, but the crisp is also a superb showcase.  Nothing more than fruit baked with crumbly nut, flour, sugar and butter topping, it's as simple to make as it is delicious.

  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 sticks)
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  lowfat milk
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4         pound  asparagus
  1 1/2           cups  ricotta cheese
  6                     lasagne noodles - (to 9)

  1                cup  diced Canadian bacon - (abt 5 1/2 oz)
     1/2           cup  canned tomato sauce
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add onion and garlic and saute onion until translucent, about 8 minutes.  Add flour and cook 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Cook lasagne noodles in large pot of rapidly boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain.  Rinse noodles with cold water and drain well.

Spread 1/2 of white sauce in bottom of pan.  Top with single layer of lasagne noodles, trimming to fit.  Cover with 1/2 cup white sauce.  Top with 1/2 of asparagus mixture.  Top with half each of Swiss cheese and bacon.  Top with another layer of noodles.  Cover with remaining white sauce.  Top with remaining asparagus mixture, Swiss cheese and bacon.  Cover with remaining noodles.  Drizzle top with tomato sauce.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before continuing.)

  1                     Buttermilk Pie Crust Dough disk - (see rec
                        === GANACHE ===
  4             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  2              large  firm ripe bananas - (abt 1 1/4 lbs) -- cut 2/3"-thk slices
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dark rum
     1/2      teaspoon  unflavored gelatin
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  5              large  egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  chilled whipping cream
                        === TOPPING ===
     3/4           cup  chilled whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2                     firm ripe bananas -- thinly sliced on
                        the diagonal

Position rack in lowest third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Roll out pie crust disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch-diameter round (about 1/8-inch thick).  Roll up dough on rolling pin and transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie plate.  Trim edges of crust, leaving 1/2-inch overhang.  Fold excess dough under.  Crimp edges.  Freeze until crust is firm, about 15 minutes.

Line pie crust with foil.  Fill foil with beans or pie weights.  Bake until crust is set, about 15 minutes.  Remove beans and foil and continue baking until crust is golden brown, piercing with toothpick if crust bubbles, about 12 minutes.  Cool completely.

For Ganache:  Stir bittersweet chocolate, whipping cream and unsalted butter in heavy small saucepan over low heat until chocolate and butter melt and mixture is smooth.  Spoon 6 tablespoons ganache into prepared crust.  Spread ganache with back of spoon to cover crust bottom completely.  Let stand until ganache is cool but not set, about 20 minutes.  Reserve remaining ganache in saucepan.

Arrange 2/3-inch-thick banana slices atop ganache, pressing bananas lightly into ganache.

For Filling:  Combine vanilla extract and dark rum in small bowl.  Sprinkle unflavored gelatin over.  Let stand 10 minutes to soften gelatin.

Bring 1/2 cup whipping cream to simmer in heavy small saucepan.  Whisk egg yolks and sugar to blend in another small bowl.  Gradually whisk in hot whipping cream.  Return mixture to saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until mixture thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 4 minutes; do not boil.

Add gelatin mixture and stir until gelatin melts.  Transfer custard to large bowl.  Chill until cool but not set, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.

Whip 1/2 cup chilled whipping cream to medium peaks in medium bowl.  Fold into custard in 2 additions.  Spoon custard into crust.  Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours.

Stir reserved ganache over low heat until just warm and pourable.  Carefully pour ganache onto center of filling.  Tilt pie, rotating to spread ganache to within 1/4-inch of pie edge.  Chill until ganache is set, about 15 minutes.  (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead.)

For Topping:  Beat 3/4 cup whipping cream with 2 tablespoons sugar to firm peaks.  Spoon whipped cream into pastry bag fitted with large star tip.  Pipe rosettes around inside edge of crust.  Place banana slices in ring alongside rosettes.  Cut pie into wedges.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              pound  lamb neck bones
  1                     lamb shoulder - (7 to 7 1/2 lbs) -- boned, well trimmed,
                        rolled, tied, and bones reserved
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed
  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  10             large  garlic cloves
  2               cups  chicken stock or canned broth
  1                cup  dry red wine
  1                cup  unsweetened pomegranate juice
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     3/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  margarine
  1 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

Position rack in lowest third of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Heat oil in heavy large pot or Dutch oven over high heat.  Add all lamb bones and cook until brown, turning often, about 15 minutes.  Transfer bones to plate.

Season lamb with salt and pepper and dredge thoroughly in flour.  Add to pot and cook until brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Transfer lamb to plate with bones.

Add onions and garlic to pot and cook until onions are just golden, scraping up browned bits, about 5 minutes.  Return lamb to pot.  Arrange bones around lamb.  Stir in stock and next 7 ingredients.  Bring liquid to boil.  Baste top of lamb.  Cover; bake until lamb is tender when pierced with long sharp knife, turning once, about 2 hours 15 minutes.  Cool; cover and chill overnight.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Remove fat from surface of lamb and cooking liquid.  Transfer lamb to platter.  Remove string from lamb.  Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Arrange in shallow baking dish.

Bring pan juices to boil.  Remove bones and discard.  Strain pan juices, pressing hard on solids to extract as much liquid as possible.

Melt margarine in same pot over medium heat.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons flour and stir until mixture begins to brown, about 2 minutes.  Whisk in pan juices and boil until sauce is reduced to 2 cups, about 15 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Pour over lamb.  Cover with foil and bake until lamb is heated through, about 25 minutes.  Arrange lamb on platter.  Spoon sauce over.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Order the lamb from your butcher, and buy the pomegranate juice at a Middle Eastern market or at a natural foods store.  Begin preparing this richly flavored main course one day ahead.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  beets -- trimmed
  4               cups  thinly-sliced cabbage
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cider vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  grated orange peel
  1           teaspoon  honey
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  caraway seeds
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Shredded fresh basil -- for garnish
                        = (or chopped fresh parsley)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Wrap beets in foil.  Bake until tender when pierced with knife, about 1 1/2 hours.  Cool.  Peel beets.  Cut into 2- by 1/4- by 1/4-inch strips.  Place in medium bowl.

Place cabbage in large bowl.  Combine cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, grated orange peel and honey in small bowl.  Gradually beat in oil.  Add caraway seeds.  Pour enough dressing over beets to coat.  Pour remaining dressing over cabbage and mix.  Season both salads with salt and pepper.

Arrange cabbage around edge of platter.  Mound beets in center.  Garnish with basil and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Cabbage has been a staple vegetable in New England since the colonists sowed the first seeds.  In the beginning, English settlers boiled it, just as they had back home.  Eventually, other immigrants introduced creative new ways to prepare it.  Coleslaw, for example, was brought over by the Dutch.  This is our version, with the colorful addition of beets, another popular ingredient in this part of the world.

This is our version, with the colorful addition of beets, another popular ingredient in this part of the world.

  1         tablespoon  cold water
                        === FOR FILLING ===
  1 1/4           cups  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  4              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  grated lime peel
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
     3/4           cup  fresh lime juice
                        === FOR MERINGUE ===
     1/4           cup  water
  1              piece  vanilla bean - (3" long)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3              large  egg whites
                        === FOR BERRY TOPPING ===
  2        tablespoons  fruit-flavored liqueur
                        = (such as creme de cassis, raspberry
                        liqueur [framboise] or Grand Marnier)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lime peel
  2               cups  assorted fresh berries
                        = (such as blackberries, blueberries,
                        raspberries, boysenberries and sliced,
                        hulled strawberries)
                        Mint leaves -- (optional)

For Crust:  Combine 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1/2 teaspoon grated lime peel and 1/4 teaspoon salt in large bowl.  Add 1/2 cup chilled unsalted butter and cut in, using fingers or pastry cutter, until mixture resembles coarse meal.

Beat 1 large egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water in small bowl until blended.  Pour over flour mixture.  Stir with fork until mixture forms moist clumps.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.

Roll dough out on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Roll up dough on rolling pin and transfer to 11-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Press dough into pan; trim edges.  Freeze until very firm, about 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Cover with plastic wrap and keep frozen.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line frozen crust with aluminum foil.  Fill crust with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake until crust is set on edges, about 12 minutes.  Remove beans and foil from crust.  Continue baking until crust is golden in center, about 14 minutes.  Transfer crust to rack and cool completely.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature.)

For Filling:  Combine 1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 cup whipping cream and 1/2 cup dry white wine in heavy medium saucepan.  Whisk in 3 eggs, 2 large egg yolks and 1 tablespoon grated lime peel.  Place 1 tablespoon cornstarch in small bowl.  Gradually whisk in 3/4 cup fresh lime juice.  Add to mixture in saucepan.  Stir over medium-high until mixture comes to boil.  Continue to boil 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Transfer mixture to medium bowl.  Cool mixture completely.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Beat remaining egg into filling.  Pour filling into crust.  Bake until filling is set and begins to bubble around edge, about 40 minutes.  Cool completely.  Refrigerate until well chilled, about 6 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover with plastic wrap and keep refrigerated.)

For Meringue:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine 1/4 cup water and vanilla bean in heavy small saucepan.  Gently simmer until vanilla bean is tender, about 1 minute.  Remove vanilla bean from water and split lengthwise.  Scrape seeds from bean into water; return bean to water.  Add 1/4 cup sugar to water and stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil until mixture is thick and syrupy, about 3 minutes.  Remove vanilla bean from saucepan.

Meanwhile, using electric mixer, beat 3 large egg whites, in large bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat mixture until medium peaks form.

Gradually beat boiling syrup into egg whites.  Continue beating until stiff peaks form.  Using rubber spatula, transfer meringue to pastry bag fitted with large plain or star tip.  Pipe meringue atop tart in diagonal lattice design, spacing lines of meringue about 2 inches apart.  Bake until meringue is golden brown, about 7 minutes.  Cool completely.  (Can be prepared up to 4 hours ahead; refrigerate uncovered.)

For Berry Topping:  Combine 2 tablespoons creme de cassis, 2 tablespoons sugar and 1/2 teaspoon grated lime peel in small saucepan.  Boil mixture until sugar dissolves and mixture is syrupy, stirring constantly, about 1 minute.  Cool slightly.  Place berries in bowl.  Pour creme de cassis mixture over.  Toss to coat berries.

Spoon coated berries decoratively among lattice openings.  Garnish tart with mint leaves if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  golden raisins
     1/4           cup  minced crystallized ginger -- plus
  2        tablespoons  minced crystallized ginger -- (abt 2 1/2 oz)
  3             pounds  ripe medium pears - (abt 7), peeled, cored
                        and sliced 1/2" thick
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  2        tablespoons  quick-cooking tapioca
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/4      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  2                     Buttermilk Pie Crust Dough disks -- (see recipe)

  2        tablespoons  milk
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

Combine raisins and ginger in heavy small saucepan.  Add enough water to just cover.  Simmer over low heat until liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes.  Cool completely.

Position rack in lowest third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Combine pears and next 6 ingredients in bowl.  Stir in raisin mixture.  Roll out 1 pie crust disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round (about 1/8-inch thick).  Roll up dough on rolling pin and transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie plate.  Gently press into place.  Trim edges of crust, leaving 1/4-inch overhang.  Spoon pear mixture into pan, mounding in center.

Roll out second crust disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch-diameter round.  Roll up on rolling pin and unroll over pie.  Trim edges, leaving 3/4-inch overhang.  Fold overhang of top crust under edge of bottom crust.  Pinch edges together to seal.  Crimp edges to make decorative border.

Gather and reroll scraps.  Cut out decorative shapes.  Beat egg with milk in small bowl for glaze.  Brush top of pie with glaze.  Make several slashes in top crust so steam can escape.

Bake pie until crust is golden brown and juices bubble up through slashes, covering crust edges with foil if browning too quickly, about 1 hour.  Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  2             pounds  ripe plum tomatoes
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1              large  red bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  2                     bay leaves
  2                     jalapeÒo chilies -- seeded, chopped
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4         pound  chorizo or hot Italian sausage -- (optional), casing
                        removed
                        === PIZZA ===
                        Olive oil
  1             square  All-Ready pizza crust - (8")
  1         tablespoon  cornmeal
  1                cup  grated Monterey Jack cheese - (abt 4 oz)
     3/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  seeded chopped jalapeÒo chili
                        Guacamole -- (optional)
                        Sour cream -- (optional)

For Salsa:  Bring large pot of water to boil.  Add tomatoes and blanch 20 seconds.  Transfer to bowl of cold water, using slotted spoon.  Drain.  Remove tomato skins using small sharp knife.  Seed and chop tomatoes.  Transfer to large saucepan.  Mix in onion, bell pepper, vinegar, cilantro, bay leaves, jalapeÒo, salt and pepper.

If using sausage, heat heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add sausage and cook until brown, crumbling with fork.  Transfer to paper towel to drain, using slotted spoon.

For Pizza:  Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Brush grill with olive oil.  Place pizza crust on grill and cook until golden, about 3 minutes.  Turn over.  Sprinkle cornmeal on cooked side of crust.  Spread 1 1/4 cups salsa over (reserve remainder for another use).  Top with cheese, cilantro, jalapeÒo and sausage.  Cover with grill lid or tent with foil and grill until crust is cooked on bottom and cheese melts, about 5 minutes.

Serve pizza, passing guacamole and sour cream separately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This recipe makes plenty of extra salsa to serve on tacos or with chips.

  2 1/4      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut 1/2" pieces
  9        tablespoons  half-and-half
  9        tablespoons  pure maple syrup
     3/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Melted butter
                        Sugar
                        Ground nutmeg
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
                        Additional pure maple syrup

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Cut pears crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Combine in large bowl with maple syrup, flour, vanilla extract and ground nutmeg.  Divide among six 2/3-cup custard cups of souffle dishes.  Dot tops with butter.  Bake filling until hot and bubbling, about 18 minutes.

Meanwhile, Prepare Topping:  Mix first 3 ingredients in processor.  Add 6 tablespoons chilled butter and cut in until mixture resembles fine meal.  Transfer to large bowl.  Mix half-and-half, 6 tablespoons syrup and vanilla in another bowl.  Add to dry ingredients and stir until just combined.

Working quickly, drop batter in three mounds, 1 heaping tablespoon per mound, atop hot filling in each cup.  Brush topping with melted butter and sprinkle with sugar and nutmeg.  Immediately return cups to oven and bake 8 minutes.  Reduce temperature to 375 degrees.  and bake until toppings are golden and just firm to touch, about 14 minutes.  Let cool at least 15 minutes.

In medium bowl, beat 1 cup chilled cream with 3 tablespoons maple syrup to soft peaks.  Serve cobblers warm with whipped cream.  Drizzle additional maple syrup over.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Maple syrup is one of New England's unique gifts to the culinary world.  The natural sweetener is a wonderful complement to all kinds of ingredients but is especially good when teamed with pears, which are plentiful in fall.  Here they're partnered in a cobbler, an old-fashioned dessert of fruit baked with a biscuit topping.  Make sure to pass whipped cream flavored with the delicate syrup.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sifted cake flour
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
  6                     eggs -- beaten to blend
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     green onions -- sliced
  2             ounces  cream cheese -- cut small pieces
  2             ounces  smoked salmon -- chopped
     1/3           cup  grated mozzarella - (abt 1 1/2 oz)
  1              ounce  caviar

Preheat broiler.  Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and saute until translucent, about 4 minutes.  Transfer onion to small bowl.

Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet.  Add eggs to skillet and season with salt and pepper.  Cook until edges of omelet are set, about 1 minute.

Sprinkle sauteed onion, green onions, cream cheese, smoked salmon and mozzarella over omelet.  Broil until mozzarella melts, about 3 minutes.   Cut omelet into wedges and top with caviar.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This delightful open-face omelet is aptly named; it's bursting with flavor and style.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2         pound  turnips -- peeled, halved,
                        and cut 1/4"-thk slices
  2              small  leeks, white and light green parts only -- sliced
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  1                     bay leaf
  1                cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  1 1/3         pounds  russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 2" pieces
     3/4           cup  milk -- more or less
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add turnips and stir to heat through.  Add leeks and saute until leeks are soft, about 5 minutes.  Season with pepper.  Add wine and bay leaf and boil until liquid is reduced to glaze, about 3 minutes.

Add stock and boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 7 minutes.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer until turnips are tender and almost no liquid remains in skillet, about 20 minutes.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Cover and let stand at room temperature.)

Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling water until tender.  Drain well.  Puree through food mill into same pot.  Reheat turnip mixture boiling to reduce liquid to glaze if necessary.  Discard bay leaf.  Puree turnip mixture through food mill into same pot with potatoes.  Mix together gently, adding enough milk to thin to desired consistency.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Potatoes are a major crop in northern New England, especially in Maine, and roots such as turnips have always played an important role in the region's cuisine.  The availability and longevity of both vegetables make them indispensable for cold-weather cooking.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2         pounds  small pippin apples - (abt 7) -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped pitted prunes
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
     1/2           cup  dried currants
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/4           cup  unsulfured (light) molasses
     1/4           cup  brandy
     1/4           cup  orange juice
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut into pieces
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1              pinch  salt
  2                     Buttermilk Pie Crust Dough disks -- (see recipe)
                        Milk -- as needed
                        Rum raisin ice cream -- (optional)

Combine first 17 ingredients in heavy large saucepan or Dutch oven.  Cook over low heat until apples are very tender and mixture is thick, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours.  Cool filling completely.  (Can be prepared up to 1 week ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Position rack in lowest third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Roll out 1 pie crust disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch-diameter round (about 1/8-inch thick).  Roll up dough on rolling pin and transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie plate.  Gently press into place.  Trim edges of crust, leaving 3/4-inch overhang.  Fold overhang under crust so that crust is flush with edge of pie pan.  Crimp edges with fork to make decorative border.  Spoon filling into crust-lined pan, gently pressing flat.

Roll out second disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Cut out about 28 three-inch leaves using cookie cutter.  Press leaves lightly with tines of fork to form vein pattern.  Brush bottom of 1 leaf with milk.  Place leaf atop mince, overlapping crust slightly and pressing to adhere to crust.  Continue placing leaves atop pie in concentric circles, overlapping edges slightly until top of pie is covered.

Brush crust with milk.  Bake until crust is golden brown and mince bubbles, about 40 minutes.  Cool completely.  Serve pie with rum raisin ice cream if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This dessert, long favored by the British at holiday time, originally contained minced meat along with the fruits and spices.  This version, more suited to the nineties table, is meatless and brimming with apples, dried fruit and lots of spices.

Combine first 17 ingredients in heavy large saucepan or Dutch oven.  Cook over low heat until apples are very tender and mixture is thick, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours.  Cool filling completely.  (Can be prepared up to 1 week ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Position rack in lowest third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Roll out 1 pie crust disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch-diameter round (about 1/8-inch thick).  Roll up dough on rolling pin and transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie plate.  Gently press into place.  Trim edges of crust, leaving 3/4-inch overhang.  Fold overhang under crust so that crust is flush with edge of pie pan.  Crimp edges with fork to make decorative border.  Spoon filling into crust-lined pan, gently pressing flat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out second disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Cut out about 28 three-inch leaves using cookie cutter.  Press leaves lightly with tines of fork to form vein pattern.  Brush bottom of 1 leaf with milk.  Place leaf atop mince, overlapping crust slightly and pressing to adhere to crust.  Continue placing leaves atop pie in concentric circles, overlapping edges slightly until top of pie is covered.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush crust with milk.  Bake until crust is golden brown and mince bubbles, about 40 minutes.  Cool completely.  Serve pie with rum raisin ice cream if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This dessert, long favored by the British at holiday time, originally contained minced meat along with the fruits and spices.  This version, more suited to the nineties table, is meatless and brimming with apples, dried fruit and lots of spices.

  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- minced

  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  dried basil -- crumbled
  1                can  Italian plum tomatoes - (28 oz) -- undrained
  3 1/2           cups  water

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     bacon slices -- chopped
  2              large  onions -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
  4            bottles  clam juice - (8 oz ea)
  4               cups  peeled white potatoes in 1/2" dice -- (abt 3 lbs)
  4               cups  peeled butternut squash in 1/2" dice -- (abt 3 lbs)
  2                     bay leaves
  4               cups  chopped kale leaves
  5               cups  milk
  1                cup  half-and-half
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh thyme
                        = (or 2 tspns dried thyme, crumbled)
  3             pounds  mixed fresh fish -- cut 3/4" pieces
                        = (a choice of cod, halibut,
                        haddock and/or scrod)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To render fat, cook chopped bacon in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat 5 minutes.  Add chopped onions and saute until onions are translucent, about 8 minutes.

Add curry powder and stir 30 seconds.  Mix in bottled clam juice, diced potatoes, diced butternut squash and bay leaves.  Simmer 5 minutes.

Add chopped kale leaves and simmer until vegetables are almost tender, about 10 minutes.  Add 5 cups milk, 1 cup half-and-half and minced thyme.  (Chowder can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover tightly and refrigerate.)

Bring chowder to simmer.  Add fish and simmer until cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Discard bay leaves.  Ladle chowder into bowls and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Whether they feature shellfish, smoked fish or fresh fish, chowders are an essential part of New England cooking.  Ours is prepared with a mixture of fresh cod, haddock and halibut, three important North Atlantic ocean varieties.  We've made the surprising addition of butternut squash and kale -- both popular regional vegetables -- to this hearty soup for extra color and texture.  Curry powder lends an unexpected bit of spice.

                    Old-Fashioned Stollen With Almonds

Recipe By     :Mrs. Wadi Williams, Villa Park, IL
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPONGE ===
  1 1/3           cups  lukewarm milk -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  lukewarm milk -- (95 to 100 degrees)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  lukewarm water -- (95 to 100 degrees)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  1                     fresh yeast cake
  2 2/3           cups  all-purpose flour
                        === DOUGH ===
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour -- more or less
  1 1/3           cups  raisins
     2/3           cup  blanched slivered almonds
     2/3           cup  chopped candied fruit
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  2                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  ground cardamom
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

For Sponge:  Stir 1 1/2 teaspoons lukewarm milk, 1 1/2 teaspoons lukewarm water and 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar in large bowl.  Add yeast cake and stir until smooth.  Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.

Add flour and remaining 1 1/3 cups lukewarm milk and mix well.  Cover and let sponge rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour 15 minutes.

For Dough:  Mix 3 tablespoons flour with raisins, slivered almonds and candied fruit in medium bowl.

Using electric mixer, beat unsalted butter and sugar in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Beat in eggs, cardamom, vanilla and salt.  Beat in sponge.  Stir in fruit and nuts.  Mix in enough remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time to form slightly sticky dough.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if very sticky, about 10 minutes.

Lightly oil large bowl.  Add dough, turning to coat entire surface.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 2 1/2 hours.

Grease heavy large cookie sheet.  Punch dough down.  Divide dough in half.  Pat each half into 10- by 16-inch oval.  Fold in half lengthwise; pat gently.  Place on prepared sheet.  Cover and let rise in warm draft-free area until almost double in volume, about 2 hours.

Position rack in lowest third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Bake until loaves are golden and sound hollow when tapped on bottom, about 1 hour.  Transfer to rack and cool slightly.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  (Stollen can be prepared up to 1 day ahead.  Cool completely.  Wrap stollen in plastic and store at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 2 loaves.

Comments:  Bake some of these for the holidays, too.

For Sponge:  Stir 1 1/2 teaspoons lukewarm milk, 1 1/2 teaspoons lukewarm water and 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar in large bowl.  Add yeast cake and stir until smooth.  Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add flour and remaining 1 1/3 cups lukewarm milk and mix well.  Cover and let sponge rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Dough:  Mix 3 tablespoons flour with raisins, slivered almonds and candied fruit in medium bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using electric mixer, beat unsalted butter and sugar in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Beat in eggs, cardamom, vanilla and salt.  Beat in sponge.  Stir in fruit and nuts.  Mix in enough remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time to form slightly sticky dough.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if very sticky, about 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly oil large bowl.  Add dough, turning to coat entire surface.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 2 1/2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grease heavy large cookie sheet.  Punch dough down.  Divide dough in half.  Pat each half into 10- by 16-inch oval.  Fold in half lengthwise; pat gently.  Place on prepared sheet.  Cover and let rise in warm draft-free area until almost double in volume, about 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Position rack in lowest third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Bake until loaves are golden and sound hollow when tapped on bottom, about 1 hour.  Transfer to rack and cool slightly.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  (Stollen can be prepared up to 1 day ahead.  Cool completely.  Wrap stollen in plastic and store at room temperature.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 loaves.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Bake some of these for the holidays, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  sugar
  1              piece  vanilla bean - (2" long) -- quartered
     1/2                orange -- unpeeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  1                     bag frozen rhubarb - (20 oz)
     1/2           cup  cranberries -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced dried apricots
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2                     Buttermilk Pie Crust Dough disks -- (see recipe)
                        === SOUR CREAM TOPPING ===
  1                cup  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  grated orange peel

To make the pie:  Position rack in lowest third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Combine sugar and vanilla bean in processor and blend until vanilla bean is finely chopped.  Add orange and process until orange is finely chopped.  Transfer to bowl.  Add rhubarb, cranberries, apricots and flour and toss.

Roll out 1 pie crust disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round (about 1/8-inch thick).  Roll up dough on rolling pin and transfer to 9-inch-diameter pie plate.  Gently press into place.  Trim edges of crust, leaving 3/4-inch overhang.  Roll out second disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Cut round into 1/2-inch-wide strips.

Spoon rhubarb mixture into crust.  Place strips atop pie, forming lattice.  Pinch edges to seal strips to crust edge.  Fold overhang under strip ends so that crust is flush with edge of pie pan.  Crimp edges to make decorative border.

Bake until crust is golden and filling bubbles around edges, covering edges of crust if browning too quickly, about 55 minutes.  Cool.  Serve pie warm or at room temperature with Sour Cream Topping.

To make the Sour Cream Topping:  Combine sour cream, brown sugar and grated orange peel in small bowl.  (Topping can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover tightly and refrigerate.  Makes about 1 cup)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
  10       tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  4                     firm ripe peaches
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                     nine-inch refrigerated ready pie crust -- room temperature
                        = (half of a 15-oz package)
                        === FILLING ===
  4              large  egg yolks
     2/3           cup  sugar
  3 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
  3               cups  half-and-half
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  semisweet chocolate chips - (6 oz)
  1                cup  peanut butter chips - (6 oz)
                        === TOPPING ===
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar
                        Grated semisweet chocolate

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Transfer crust to 9-inch-diameter pie dish.  Trim edges of crust and pierce all over with fork.  Bake pie crust until golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Cool crust completely on rack.

For Filling:  Place yolks in medium bowl.  Combine sugar and cornstarch in heavy medium saucepan.  Whisk in half-and-half.  Bring mixture to boil over medium-high heat, whisking constantly.  Boil 1 minute.  Whisk half of mixture into yolks.  Return yolk mixture to saucepan.  Boil 1 minute, whisking constantly.  Remove from heat.  Stir in butter and vanilla.

Place chocolate chips in medium bowl.  Add 1 cup hot custard and stir until chocolate chips melt and mixture is smooth.  Add peanut butter chips to remaining custard in saucepan and stir until peanut butter chips melt and mixture is smooth.

Spread chocolate mixture evenly into prepared crust.  Gently spoon peanut butter mixture over chocolate, spreading to edge of crust.  Place plastic wrap atop pie to prevent skin from forming.  Cool pie on rack 1 hour.  Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)

For Topping:  Using electric mixer, beat whipping cream in medium bowl to soft peaks.  Add sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.  Spoon topping into pastry bag fitted with large star tip.  Pipe cream decoratively atop pie.  Sprinkle with grated semisweet chocolate.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pork tenderloin - (1 lb)
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  butter
  3                     green onions -- sliced, white and
                        green parts separated
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  whipping cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/4           cups  whole wheat flour
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1 1/3           cups  buttermilk
     1/3           cup  dark molasses
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
  1                     egg
                        Poppy seeds -- as needed

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease 9- by 5-inch glass loaf pan.

Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, yellow cornmeal, baking powder, salt and baking soda in large bowl.  Combine buttermilk, dark molasses, butter and egg in another bowl and mix to blend.  Add to dry ingredients and stir until just blended.

Spoon into prepared loaf pan.  Sprinkle with poppy seeds.  Bake until loaf is springy to touch, about 1 hour.  Cool in pan on rack 10 minutes.  Turn out onto rack.  Cool bread to room temperature.  Cut into slices and serve.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

Comments:  An especially easy baking powder version of the traditional yeast-leavened cornmeal and molasses bread.  We've used buttermilk instead of water to give the loaf moistness and tang.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STUFFING ===
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  2              small  onions -- finely chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- diced
  5                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     bag cubed herbed stuffing mix - (14 oz)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  rubbed or ground dried sage
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme -- crumbled
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  Italian Seasoning
  2                     eggs -- beaten to blend
  1                cup  chicken stock or canned broth
                        === GOOSE ===
  1                     goose - (11 to 13 lbs) -- fat removed from
                        cavity
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     lemon -- halved
  3                     bacon slices

For Stuffing:  Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add onions, celery and garlic and saute until soft, about 8 minutes.  Combine stuffing mixture, sage, salt, oregano, thyme, pepper and Italian Seasoning in large bowl.  Stir in onion mixture and eggs.  Add stock and mix well.  Set aside.

For Goose:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Rinse goose inside and out; pat dry, using paper towel.  Rub goose inside and out with halved lemon.  Season goose inside and out with salt and pepper.  Fill main cavity and neck cavity loosely with stuffing.  Place any remaining stuffing in small buttered baking dish and cover with foil.

Run fingers between breast meat and skin to loosen skin.  Place bacon slices under breast skin.  Wrap goose in cheesecloth. Place goose on rack set into large roasting pan.  Roast goose 30 minutes.

Reduce heat to 350 degrees.  Continue roasting until meat thermometer inserted into thickest part to thigh registers 180 degrees, basting every 20 minutes with pan juices, about 1 hour 20 minutes.  (Place stuffing in covered baking dish in oven during last 40 minutes.)

Remove cheesecloth.  Transfer goose to platter.  Pass stuffing separately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
  2              large  shallots -- minced
  2               cups  fresh white breadcrumbs
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh chives
                        = (or green onion tops)
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     scrod fillets, 1 1/2"-thk - (6 to 8 oz ea) -- all bones removed
                        = (or true cod fillets)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Lemon wedges

Melt 1/4 cup butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add minced shallots and cook 1 minute.  Add breadcrumbs and stir until butter is absorbed.  Remove from heat and add chives, parsley and lemon peel.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Butter baking pan and place fish in pan.  Brush lemon juice over fish.  Cover with breadcrumb mixture, pressing to adhere.  Bake until fish is just cooked through, about 20 minutes.  Serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  It's hard to get consensus on the definition of scrod.  According to well-known Boston chef Jasper White, most New Englanders would agree that it's baby cod weighing under two pounds.  However, some say that baby haddock and pollack are acceptable.  Others contend that the kind of fish isn't important, but the manner of preparation is: If it's not broiled with the breadcrumbs, it's just baby cod.  The Parker House hotel in Boston claims to have invented the dish.  Here's our rendition; we serve it with broiled tomatoes.

Remove from heat and add chives, parsley and lemon peel.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Butter baking pan and place fish in pan.  Brush lemon juice over fish.  Cover with breadcrumb mixture, pressing to adhere.  Bake until fish is just cooked through, about 20 minutes.  Serve with lemon wedges.

Comments:  It&apos;s hard to get consensus on the definition of scrod.  According to well-known Boston chef Jasper White, most New Englanders would agree that it&apos;s baby cod weighing under two pounds.  However, some say that baby haddock and pollack are acceptable.  Others contend that the kind of fish isn&apos;t important, but the manner of preparation is: If it&apos;s not broiled with the breadcrumbs, it&apos;s just baby cod.  The Parker House hotel in Boston claims to have invented the dish.  Here&apos;s our rendition; we serve it with broiled tomatoes.

                        Whipped cream
                        Chopped walnuts

Combine 1/2 cup sugar and red wine in heavy medium saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean and cinnamon stick.  Simmer 10 minutes.

Add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and stir to dissolve.  Add rhubarb and ground cloves.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer until rhubarb is tender, about 8 minutes.

Add strawberries and bring to simmer.  Cool.  Cover and refrigerate until cold.  (Compote can be prepared 3 days ahead.)

Remove vanilla bean and cinnamon stick from compote.  Scoop ice cream into sundae dishes or bowls.  Spoon compote over.  Top each with whipped cream.  Sprinkle with chopped walnuts and serve sundaes immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Strawberries and rhubarb are just two of the many flavorful produce varieties grown in this region.  During fall and winter, the frozen versions stand up surprisingly well, especially in dishes like this compote, which we serve over ice cream or frozen yogurt for dessert or plain breakfast.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  sweet potatoes -- peeled, quartered
  2          envelopes  fast-rising yeast
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  unsalted butter - (3 sticks) -- melted
  1                cup  honey
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  2                     eggs -- beaten to blend
  2          teaspoons  salt
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  whole wheat flour -- more or less
  4               cups  graham cracker crumbs

Cook potatoes in large saucepan of simmering water until tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.  Place potatoes in medium bowl.  Transfer reserved cooking liquid to large bowl; cool to 120 to 130 degrees.

Sprinkle yeast and sugar over reserved warm liquid; stir to dissolve.  Let yeast mixture stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.

Combine potatoes, 1/2 cup melted butter, 1/2 cup honey, oil, eggs and salt in processor.  Blend until smooth.  Add to yeast mixture.  Mix in all-purpose flour.  Gradually stir in enough whole wheat flour 1/2 cup at a time to form soft, slightly sticky dough.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding more whole wheat flour if sticky.

Lightly oil large bowl.  Add dough, turning to coat entire surface.  Cover bowl with kitchen towel.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Grease three 9-inch-diameter cake pans.  Punch dough down.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth.  Divide dough into thirds.  Cut each third into 12 pieces.  Roll each piece into ball.

Mix remaining 1 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup honey until well blended.  Dip each dough ball into honey mixture and then roll in graham cracker crumbs to coat.  Place 12 balls in each prepared pan, arranging close together.  Let stand 10 minutes.

Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes.  (Rolls can be prepared ahead.  Cool completely.  Wrap tightly and refrigerate 1 day or freeze up to 1 month.  Reheat rolls before serving.)  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 3 dozen rolls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     Buttermilk Pie Crust Dough disk -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped walnuts
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped pecans
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds
     3/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted, and
                        at room temperature
  3              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  unsulfured (light) molasses
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  cranberries - (abt 6 oz)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Roll out pie crust disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch-diameter round (about 1/8-inch thick).  Roll up dough on rolling pin and transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie plate.  Gently press into place.  Trim edges of crust, leaving 3/4-inch overhang.  Fold overhang under crust so that crust is flush with edge of pie pan.  Crimp edges to make decorative border.  Freeze crust until firm, about 15 minutes.

Line pie crust with foil, leaving 3-inch overhang.  Fill foil with beans or pie weights.  Fold extra foil gently over crust edges.  Bake until crust is set, about 15 minutes.  Remove foil and beans and continue baking until crust just begins to color, piercing with toothpick if crust bubbles, about 10 minutes.  Cool.  Maintain oven temperature.

Meanwhile, combine chopped walnuts, pecans and almonds on cookie sheet.  Toast nuts until just golden, about 10 minutes.  Cool.

Whisk brown sugar, light corn syrup, butter, eggs, molasses, vanilla extract and salt to blend in bowl.  Stir in toasted nuts and cranberries.  Pour filing into prepared crust.  Bake until center of filling is set, about 45 minutes.  Cool pie completely.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Tart cranberries provide delicious contrast to the rich nut filling.
