Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  slivered almonds -- toasted
  1 1/4           cups  powdered sugar
  3              large  egg whites
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  amaretto liqueur
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line heavy large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Place 1 1/2 cups almonds in large bowl and sift 1/2 cup powdered sugar over; toss to coat.  Whisk 1 egg white to blend in small bowl.  Add 1 tablespoon egg white to nuts and toss to blend.  Spread mixture in even layer over prepared baking sheet.  Bake until almonds are golden and coating is dry, about 10 minutes.  Cool completely.

Transfer candied almonds to processor.  Using on/off turns, process until almost all almonds are coarsely chopped and some fine crumbs form.  Transfer chopped candied almonds to small bowl.

Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Finely chop remaining 1 1/2 cups slivered almonds in processor.  Add flour, baking soda, and salt.  Blend until nuts are very finely ground.

Using electric mixer, beat butter, 3/4 cup sugar, and remaining 3/4 cup powdered sugar in large bowl until well blended.  Add remaining 2 egg whites, amaretto, and vanilla.  Beat until well blended.  Gradually mix in flour-almond mixture.  Stir in chopped candied almonds.

Working in 2 batches and using small ice cream scoop or tablespoon, spoon 2 level tablespoonfuls dough in mound for each cookie, forming about 12 mounds on each sheet and spacing 2 inches apart.  Bake until cookies are golden brown, about 14 minutes.  Cool slightly on baking sheets.  Transfer cookies to rack and cool completely.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 4 dozen cookies.

Comments:  For soft and chewy cookies, bake these just a couple of minutes less than the recipe directs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  4             medium  Granny Smith apples - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped into 1/2" cubes
     1/2           cup  dried sweetened cranberries
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  minced crystallized ginger
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/3           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  old-fashioned oats
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
     2/3           cup  toasted pecans -- coarsely chopped
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter four 1 1/4-cup custard cups or soufflÃˆ dishes.  Mix all ingredients in bowl.  Let stand until juicy, about 5 minutes.  Divide filling among prepared cups.  Bake until bubbling at edges, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, Prepare Topping:  Blend first 7 ingredients in large bowl.  Rub in butter with fingertips until coarse meal forms.  Mix in pecans with fingertips.

Crumble topping over hot apples.  Bake until topping is golden brown, apples are tender, and juices are bubbling thickly, about 25 minutes.  Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  To toast pecans, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spread the pecans in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet.  Bake until slightly darkened, about 8 minutes.

Comments:  This recipe can be doubled and baked in a 13x9x2-inch baking dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CINNAMON-SUGAR WALNUTS ===
  1                     egg white
  1                cup  large walnut pieces
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        === CAKE ===
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- plus
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
  2             medium  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2" pieces
  2             medium  Jonagold apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2" pieces
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1              large  egg
  1                cup  toasted walnuts -- chopped
  1                cup  dried currants
                        === ICING ===
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  1                cup  powdered sugar - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  dried currants - (generous)

For Walnuts:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with foil.  Beat egg white in medium bowl until foamy.  Mix in remaining ingredients.  Spread walnuts in single layer on prepared sheet.  Bake until walnuts are golden, about 10 minutes.  Cool on baking sheet.  Transfer walnuts to work surface and chop coarsely.

For Cake:  Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add all apples; cover and simmer until apples are juicy and almost tender, stirring occasionally, about 18 minutes.  Uncover and simmer until almost all juices evaporate, about 6 minutes.  Using potato masher, mash apples in pan.  Cool.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour two 8-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Whisk flour and next 5 ingredients in medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat remaining 3/4 cup butter and sugar in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Beat in egg.  Beat in half of flour mixture on low speed, then all of applesauce, then remaining flour mixture.  Mix in 1 cup toasted walnuts and currants.

Divide batter between pans; smooth tops.  Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 5 minutes.  Turn cakes out onto racks and cool.

For Icing:  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Add powdered sugar and vanilla and beat to blend.

Place 1 cake layer on plate; spread 1/2 cup icing over top.  Top with second cake layer.  Spread remaining icing over top and sides of cake.  Arrange cinnamon-sugar walnuts in ring 1/2 inch in from edge of cake.  Sprinkle walnuts with currants.  Chill cake until icing sets, about 30 minutes.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome and keep chilled.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  A high proportion of butter makes for an extra-smooth and rich icing.  For best results, use Philadelphia-brand cream cheese.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  graham cracker crumbs
  1                cup  sliced almonds -- toasted
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2       packages  almond paste - (7 oz ea) -- crumbled
  3           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  4              large  eggs
                        === APPLES ===
  4              large  Jonagold apples - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/3"-thick slices
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 10-inch-diameter springform pan.  Wrap bottom with 2 layers of heavy-duty foil.  Mix all ingredients in medium bowl to blend, crumbling almonds slightly.  Press mixture onto bottom and 1 inch up sides of pan.  Bake until set, about 7 minutes.  Maintain oven temperature.

For Filling:  Combine almond paste, cream cheese, and sugar in processor; blend until smooth, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, about 2 minutes.  Mix in eggs until just blended.  Pour filling into crust.  Bake 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 325 degrees and bake until center is set and top appears dry, about 45 minutes longer.  Cool.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate overnight.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

For Apples:  Toss apple slices with lemon juice in large bowl.  Melt 3 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over high heat.  Add apples and sautÃˆ until golden and tender, stirring frequently, about 9 minutes.  Sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon.  Stir to coat.  Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter.  Stir until coated and glazed.  Cool slightly.

Run small sharp knife around edge of pan to loosen cheesecake.  Release pan sides.  Arrange apples (warm or room temperature) in concentric circles atop cheesecake.  Brush apples with any juices left in skillet.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Apples sautÃˆed with brown sugar and cinnamon top this almond-flavored cheesecake.  Bake it at least one day in advance.  For best results, use Philadelphia-brand cream cheese.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  apple cider vinegar
  2               cups  sugar

  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground ginger

Stir vinegar and sugar in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves.  Boil without stirring until syrupy and reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 15 minutes.

Cook asparagus in large pot of boiling salted water until just crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.  Drain; rinse with cold water to cool quickly, and drain again.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Pat dry; wrap in paper towels, then plastic, and refrigerate.)

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add lemon peel and garlic and stir 30 seconds.  Add asparagus and toss to coat.  Sprinkle lemon juice over.  SautÃˆ until asparagus is heated through and coated with butter sauce, about 3 minutes.  Season asparagus with salt and pepper.  Transfer to platter.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The flavors of gremolata Ã³ the garnish of finely chopped lemon peel, parsley, and garlic that traditionally tops osso buco Ã³ are terrific with asparagus.  The asparagus can be blanched and chilled one day ahead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        additional oil for garnish
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
                        = (abt 2 cups)
  1              large  carrot -- finely chopped
                        = (abt 1 cup)
  1              large  celery stalk -- finely chopped
                        = (abt 2/3 cup)
  3               cans  cannellini beans - (15 oz ea) -- drained
                        = (white kidney beans)
  6               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh sage
  2                     Parmesan cheese rinds, 2" by 2"
  3             ounces  thinly-sliced prosciutto -- chopped
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add onion, carrot, and celery and sautÃˆ until vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes.  Add beans, broth, sage, Parmesan rinds, and prosciutto; simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend and soup thickens slightly, about 40 minutes.  Using tongs, remove cheese rinds.

Puree about 5 cups soup in processor and return to pot.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Soup can be made 2 days ahead.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.  Rewarm before serving.)

Ladle soup into bowls and serve, passing grated Parmesan cheese and additional olive oil separately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This hearty soup makes delicious use of the flavorful 1/4-inch-thick rinds that remain after wedges of Parmesan have been grated away; they infuse the soup with a nice salty bite as it simmers.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  crumbled pistachio halvah* - (packed) -- abt 7 oz
                        = (or use plain halvah)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2              large  egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  ice water
                        === FILLING ===
  2               cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  heavy whipping cream
  10       tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1                cup  natural unsalted pistachios - (abt 4 oz) -- toasted
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  1              large  egg white
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  heavy whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  8             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup

* A sesame confection available at delicatessens, Middle Eastern markets, supermarkets, and Italian markets.

For Crust:  Combine flour, halvah, sugar, and salt in processor.  Using on/off turns, process until blended to sandy texture.  Add butter.  Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Whisk egg yolks and 2 tablespoons ice water in small bowl to blend.  Add to flour mixture.  Using on/off turns, process until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into 2 balls; flatten into disks.  Wrap separately in plastic.  Chill 1 hour.

For Filling:  Combine sugar and 1/2 cup water in heavy large saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat to high and boil until syrup turns deep amber or clip-on candy thermometer registers 360 degrees, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with wet pastry brush, about 11 minutes (time will vary depending on size of pan).  Remove from heat.  Carefully stir in cream (mixture will bubble).  Add butter and whisk until melted and smooth.  Stir in pistachios.  Cool until lukewarm but still pourable, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly spray 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom with nonstick spray.  Roll out 1 dough disk between 2 sheets of parchment paper or waxed paper to 11-inch round (dough will be about 1/3-inch thick).  Remove top paper.  Invert dough into prepared pan.  Remove remaining paper.  Trim dough overhang.  Roll out second dough disk between 2 sheets of parchment paper or waxed paper to 10-inch round.  Pour filling into prepared crust.  Brush edges of crust with egg white.  Remove top paper from second dough disk.  Invert over filling.  Remove paper.  Press dough around pan edges to trim and seal.

Place torte on baking sheet and bake until crust is golden, about 35 minutes.  Cool completely in pan.  Chill overnight.

For Glaze:  Bring cream and butter just to boil in medium saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and corn syrup; whisk until smooth.  Cool 5 minutes.

Place rack over rimmed baking sheet.  Remove sides from tart pan.  Invert torte onto rack.  Remove bottom of tart pan.  Pour warm glaze over torte (bottom of torte becomes top).  Let stand until glaze sets.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.)

Slice into thin wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  A rich candy-bar-like dessert that can be made in stages, and even completed three days before a party.  Fresh strawberries make a nice garnish.

<DirT>
For Crust:  Combine flour, halvah, sugar, and salt in processor.  Using on/off turns, process until blended to sandy texture.  Add butter.  Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Whisk egg yolks and 2 tablespoons ice water in small bowl to blend.  Add to flour mixture.  Using on/off turns, process until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into 2 balls; flatten into disks.  Wrap separately in plastic.  Chill 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Filling:  Combine sugar and 1/2 cup water in heavy large saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat to high and boil until syrup turns deep amber or clip-on candy thermometer registers 360 degrees, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with wet pastry brush, about 11 minutes (time will vary depending on size of pan).  Remove from heat.  Carefully stir in cream (mixture will bubble).  Add butter and whisk until melted and smooth.  Stir in pistachios.  Cool until lukewarm but still pourable, about 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly spray 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom with nonstick spray.  Roll out 1 dough disk between 2 sheets of parchment paper or waxed paper to 11-inch round (dough will be about 1/3-inch thick).  Remove top paper.  Invert dough into prepared pan.  Remove remaining paper.  Trim dough overhang.  Roll out second dough disk between 2 sheets of parchment paper or waxed paper to 10-inch round.  Pour filling into prepared crust.  Brush edges of crust with egg white.  Remove top paper from second dough disk.  Invert over filling.  Remove paper.  Press dough around pan edges to trim and seal.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place torte on baking sheet and bake until crust is golden, about 35 minutes.  Cool completely in pan.  Chill overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Glaze:  Bring cream and butter just to boil in medium saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and corn syrup; whisk until smooth.  Cool 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place rack over rimmed baking sheet.  Remove sides from tart pan.  Invert torte onto rack.  Remove bottom of tart pan.  Pour warm glaze over torte (bottom of torte becomes top).  Let stand until glaze sets.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Slice into thin wedges and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 16 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  A rich candy-bar-like dessert that can be made in stages, and even completed three days before a party.  Fresh strawberries make a nice garnish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  5        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" cubes
  4        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/4           cups  dried tart cherries -- chopped
     1/2           cup  ruby Port
     2/3           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     2/3           cup  light corn syrup
  3              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted, and
                        at room temperature
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1                cup  walnuts -- toasted, chopped
                        Whipped cream -- for serving

For Crust:  Blend flour, salt, and baking powder in processor.  Using on/off turns, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 4 tablespoons ice water.  Process just until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Form dough into disk.  Wrap in plastic; chill until dough is firm enough to roll out, about 30 minutes.

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Boil cherries and Port in heavy small saucepan until Port is absorbed, stirring often, about 10 minutes.  Cool completely.

Using electric mixer, beat brown sugar, corn syrup, eggs, and melted butter in large bowl until foamy.  Beat in vanilla.  Stir in walnuts and Port-infused cherries.

Roll out dough on floured work surface to 11-inch round; transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Fold overhang under; crimp edges.  Pour filling into crust.

Bake pie until crust is golden and filling is brown and just set in center, about 50 minutes.  Cool pie completely in dish on rack.  Serve with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Not quite as sweet as a pecan pie, but with the same caramel candy-like filling.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut on diagonal into 1/4"-thick slices
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
  1         tablespoon  ground coriander
                        Drizzle of honey -- (optional)
  1                cup  drained chopped pitted brine-cured
                        green olives

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  whole milk
  1 1/4           cups  semisweet chocolate chips
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4             ounces  French bread with crust - (abt 4 cups) -- cut 1" cubes

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Bring cream, 1/2 cup sugar, and milk to simmer in heavy medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Remove from heat.  Add 1 cup chocolate chips and whisk until melted and smooth.  Whisk egg and vanilla in large bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in hot chocolate mixture.  Cool chocolate custard 10 minutes, stirring often.

Add bread cubes and remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips to custard and toss to coat.  Transfer to 1 1/2-quart-capacity shallow oval baking dish.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar over mixture.  Bake until custard thickens and center is just set, about 50 minutes.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  John and Tori Nicholas of Indianapolis, Indiana, write; "We had such a wonderful time exploring New Orleans that my wife and I are now hopelessly hooked on the Big Easy.  We play lots of Cajun music, and last week we rented the movie A Streetcar Named Desire.  The best part of our trip was the chocolate bread pudding at Red Fish Grill."

The sugar topping becomes crunchy when baked, creating a perfect contrast to the creamy chocolate pudding underneath.

Comments:  John and Tori Nicholas of Indianapolis, Indiana, write; &quot;We had such a wonderful time exploring New Orleans that my wife and I are now hopelessly hooked on the Big Easy.  We play lots of Cajun music, and last week we rented the movie A Streetcar Named Desire.  The best part of our trip was the chocolate bread pudding at Red Fish Grill.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
The sugar topping becomes crunchy when baked, creating a perfect contrast to the creamy chocolate pudding underneath.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  semisweet chocolate chips -- frozen 1 hour
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- diced, and
                        at room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  1              large  egg yolk
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     3/4      teaspoon  almond extract
  1                cup  walnuts -- coarsely chopped

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Whisk flour, cocoa, and salt in small bowl to blend.  Coarsely chop 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips in processor.  With machine running, add butter, then 1/2 cup sugar through feed tube.  Add egg yolk and both extracts and process to blend.  Using on/off turns, mix in walnuts, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally.  Add flour mixture and process just until dough comes together, about 1 minute.  Transfer dough to large bowl.  Using hands, mix in remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips.

Using 1 tablespoon dough for each, shape dough into 1 1/4-inch-diameter balls.  Press each dough ball to 1/2-inch thickness; dip 1 side into remaining 1/2 cup sugar to coat.  Arrange cookies, sugar-side up, on 2 ungreased baking sheets.  Bake cookies until set and almost firm to touch, about 18 minutes; cool on racks.

This recipe yields about 30 cookies.

Comments:  Antoinette writes; "My business partner and I own a company that makes costumes for the film industry.  When we are involved in a huge project Ã³ as we were with Minority Report and X2 Ã³ we work very long days, and sometimes even on weekends.  So I don't have much time to cook or even to go out for lunch or dinner.  That's when my no-fiddling cooking style comes in handy.  I cut corners when I can Ã³ without sacrificing flavor."

A food processor makes mixing the dough for these rich cookies a breeze.

  3                     firm-but-ripe Bosc pears - (8 oz ea) -- peeled, cored,
                        and finely chopped

Market Tip:  Mexican limes, sold at Latin American markets and some supermarkets, are especially good in this recipe because they are sweeter and more fragrant than Persian limes (the more familiar variety).  Mexican limes are also referred to as Key limes, which are available at Melissa's (melissas.com; 800-588-0151).

Market Tip:  Mexican limes, sold at Latin American markets and some supermarkets, are especially good in this recipe because they are sweeter and more fragrant than Persian limes (the more familiar variety).  Mexican limes are also referred to as Key limes, which are available at Melissa&apos;s (melissas.com; 800-588-0151).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     cube steaks - (12 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped shallots
  1           teaspoon  dried rubbed sage
     1/3           cup  dry vermouth
     1/2           cup  whipping cream or half and half
  2        tablespoons  whole-grain Dijon mustard

Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper.  Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add steaks in single layer and cook until browned, turning once, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to work surface; cut each steak in half.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shallots and sage; sautÃˆ until soft, about 30 seconds.  Add vermouth; boil until slightly reduced, about 30 seconds.  Stir in cream and mustard.  Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until slightly thickened, about 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper.  Divide steaks among plates, spoon sauce over, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serve With:  Hash browns and steamed broccoli.  Dessert:  Warm apple pie.

Comments:  Using pre-tenderized steak (labeled "cube steak" at the meat counter) makes this bistro-style dish extra succulent.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CANDIED ORANGE PEEL ===
  1                     orange
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
                        === CRUST ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  slivered almonds -- toasted, and
                        coarsely chopped
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1                cup  heavy whipping cream
  8             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  Grand Marnier
                        = (or other orange liqueur)

For Candied Orange Peel:  Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (orange part only) from orange in strips.  Cut strips into matchstick-size pieces and place in small saucepan.  Cover with cold water; bring to boil.  Cook 30 seconds; drain.  Rinse saucepan; add 1/4 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons water, and peel.  Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Simmer until peel is translucent and syrup is thick, about 20 minutes.  Using tines of fork, transfer peel to plate and cool.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and store at room temperature.)

For Crust:  Using electric mixer, beat butter, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in large bowl until smooth.  Beat in cocoa powder.  Add flour and beat until dough comes together in moist clumps.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

Roll out dough between sheets of waxed paper to 11-inch round.  Peel off top sheet of paper.  Invert dough over 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom; peel off paper.  Gently press dough into pan.  Press dough overhang in to form double-thick sides.  Pierce dough all over with fork.  Refrigerate 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake crust until sides look dry and bottom looks bubbly, about 14 minutes.  Transfer crust to rack.  Using back of spoon, press up sides of dough if falling.  Cool completely.

For Filling:  Toss almonds, sugar, and cinnamon in small bowl.  Chop all but 2 strips of peel.  Sprinkle chopped orange peel, then almond mixture over bottom of prepared crust.  Place cream in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to simmer.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and whisk until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth; mix in Grand Marnier.  Pour into crust.  Refrigerate until filling is firm, at least 3 hours.  Garnish with remaining 2 orange peel strips.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover loosely with foil and keep refrigerated.)

Using sharp knife, gently loosen crust from pan sides.  Remove pan sides.  Cut tart into wedges; serve cold.

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

Comments:  Reminiscent of fragrant Mexican chocolate (which is spiced with cinnamon), and as fudgy as a chocolate truffle, this dessert will serve many more than six, but leftovers will keep for at least a week in the refrigerator.

                           Fresh Plum Napoleon

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY CREAM ===
  5        tablespoons  sugar
  2 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
  1                cup  whole milk -- divided
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  6             ounces  cream cheese -- cut 1/2" cubes,
                        and at room temperature
                        === PLUM JAM ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  12            ounces  small plums - (abt 5) -- halved, pitted,
                        and cut 1/2"-thick slices - (abt 2 cups)
  2          teaspoons  grated orange peel
                        === NAPOLEON ===
  2                     sheets frozen puff pastry - (17.3-oz pkg) -- thawed
  1              pound  small plums - (abt 6) -- halved, pitted,
                        and cut into 1/4"-thick slices
                        Powdered sugar

For Pastry Cream:  Whisk sugar and cornstarch in medium saucepan to blend.  Add 1/4 cup milk; whisk until cornstarch dissolves.  Whisk in remaining 3/4 cup milk and egg yolks.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Whisk over medium heat until mixture is smooth and thick and comes to boil, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Add cream cheese and whisk until smooth.  Strain pastry cream into small bowl; discard solids in strainer.  Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of pastry cream; chill until cold, about 4 hours.

For Plum Jam:  Combine sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Bring to simmer over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves and syrup begins to thicken, about 2 minutes.  Add plums and orange peel; reduce heat to medium and simmer until mixture is very thick and reduced to 3/4 cup, stirring often, about 20 minutes.  Cool.  Discard vanilla bean.  (Pastry cream and plum jam can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and chill.)

For Napoleon:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Place 1 puff pastry sheet on work surface.  Brush 1 edge of sheet with cold water.  Place 1 edge of second pastry sheet atop wet edge of first sheet, overlapping by 2 inches, pressing to adhere, and forming 18- by 10-inch rectangle.  Using rolling pin, roll out pastry to 1 large sheet, 19 to 20 inches long and 11 inches wide.  Transfer pastry to ungreased 18- by 12- by 1-inch baking sheet.  Pierce pastry all over with fork.  Using sharp knife, trim pastry to fit sheet.  Bake until golden, occasionally piercing pastry with fork to deflate slightly, about 25 minutes (pastry will shrink to about 15- by 10-inch rectangle).  Cool completely on sheet.

Carefully transfer pastry to cutting board.  Using serrated knife, cut pastry into three 14- by 3-inch rectangles.  Trim any puffed portions of pastry to flatten and even slightly.  (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead.  Cover with foil; let stand at room temperature.)

Place 1 pastry rectangle on long serving platter.  Stir pastry cream to loosen.  Spread 1 cup pastry cream over pastry rectangle, leaving 1/2-inch plain border at all edges (reserve remaining pastry cream for another use).  Place second pastry rectangle, flat-side up, on cardboard rectangle or 18-inch-long ruler.  Spread with half of jam (generous 1/3 cup) to cover.  Top with sliced plums in neat lines, skin-side facing out.  Using cardboard rectangle or ruler as aid, slide pastry with plums atop pastry cream layer, plum-side up.  Spread remaining plum jam over flat side (underside) of third pastry rectangle.  Place jam-side down on plums on second pastry layer.  Dust top of pastry with powdered sugar.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature; do not refrigerate.)

Cut napoleon crosswise and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Plum fans take note: The jam recipe here is a stand-alone bonus, especially if that tree in the garden is overloaded.  (You can triple the jam recipe below for a yield of two generous cups and store it in the refrigerator for up to one week.)  Pastry novices should also note that this is one napoleon that holds together beautifully when sliced Ã³ so go for it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2         pound  fresh whole-milk ricotta cheese - -- (scant 1 cup)
     1/2           cup  freshly grated pecorino Romano cheese - -- (abt 1 1/2 oz)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh mint leaves
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/8      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FRITTATA ===
  3              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh Italian parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3          teaspoons  olive oil -- divided

For Filling:  Mix all ingredients in medium bowl to blend.

For Frittata:  Whisk eggs, parsley, salt, and pepper in another medium bowl until frothy.  Heat 1 teaspoon oil in 8-inch skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 1/3 of egg mixture (scant 1/4 cup) to skillet, swirling pan to coat bottom evenly in very thin layer.  Cook until eggs are set and lightly browned on bottom, about 45 seconds.  Turn frittata over and cook until set and slightly golden, about 30 seconds.  Transfer to plate.  Repeat with remaining egg mixture and oil for a total of 3 frittatas.

Place frittatas on work surface.  Divide ricotta filling among frittatas, spreading out to edges.  Roll up each frittata jelly-roll style.  Wrap frittatas individually in plastic.  Chill overnight.  Unwrap frittatas.  Cut on diagonal into 3/4-inch-thick slices.  Serve chilled or at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 24 slices.

Comments:  Be sure to use fresh ricotta cheese from an Italian market Ã³ authentic ricotta has the rich, dense texture that's best for this recipe.  Make the rolls one day ahead so the flavors can develop.  Serve with marinara sauce for dipping.

Drizzle over shrimp and serve warm or at room temperature.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GINGER-LIME CURD ===
  3              large  eggs
  3              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  grated lime peel
                        = (from about 12 limes)
  1         tablespoon  grated peeled fresh ginger
  1              pinch  salt
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut into pieces,
                        and at room temperature
                        === CAKE ===
  5               cups  sifted cake flour
                        = (sifted, then measured)
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  unsalted butter - (3 sticks) -- room temperature
  3               cups  sugar
  8              large  eggs
  2               cups  buttermilk -- room temperature
                        Bamboo skewers
                        === FROSTING ===
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  2              large  egg whites
     1/3           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  light corn syrup
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  7             ounces  packaged sweetened flaked coconut - -- (abt 3 cups)

For Ginger-Lime Curd:  Whisk eggs, yolks, sugar, lime juice, lime peel, ginger, and salt in large metal bowl to blend.  Place bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch simmering water); whisk constantly until curd thickens, about 8 minutes.  Remove bowl from over simmering water; whisk butter into curd.  Strain through fine strainer set over bowl; discard solids in strainer.  Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of curd; chill overnight.  (Curd can be made up to 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

For Cake:  Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter four 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line bottoms of pans with parchment paper rounds.  Butter parchment; dust with flour.  Sift flour, baking soda, and salt into large bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in another large bowl until smooth.  Gradually add sugar and beat until very well blended, about 5 minutes.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time, scraping down sides of bowl before each addition.  Beat in flour mixture in 3 additions alternately with buttermilk in 2 additions.  Divide batter equally among prepared cake pans.

Place 2 cake pans on top rack of oven and 2 pans on bottom rack; bake until golden and tester inserted into cake centers comes out clean, reversing pans after 15 minutes, about 30 minutes total.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Turn cakes out onto racks; peel off parchment paper.  Turn cakes right side up on racks; cool cakes completely.

Place 1 cake layer on platter.  Spread 1/3 of ginger-lime curd (about 1/2 cup) over, leaving 1/2-inch plain border around edge of cake.  Repeat procedure on 2 more cake layers.  Let each cake layer stand 10 minutes.  Stack cake layers, curd-side up.  Top with fourth cake layer.  Let cake stand at room temperature while preparing frosting.  Insert 3 or 4 bamboo skewers from top to bottom into cake to hold stacked cake layers in place while frosting.

For Frosting:  Whisk sugar, egg whites, 1/3 cup water, light corn syrup, and cream of tartar in large metal bowl to blend.  Set bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch simmering water).  Using handheld electric mixer, beat on medium speed until mixture resembles soft marshmallow fluff, about 4 minutes.  Increase mixer speed to high and beat until mixture is very thick, about 3 minutes longer.  Remove bowl from over simmering water.  Add vanilla extract and continue beating until marshmallow frosting is completely cool, about 5 minutes longer.

Spread marshmallow frosting thinly over top and sides of cake.  Remove bamboo skewers.  Press flaked coconut into marshmallow frosting on top and sides of cake.  (Cake can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome and refrigerate.  Let stand at room temperature 2 hours before serving.)

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  A buttermilk layer cake is filled with ginger-scented lime curd, then finished with a sweet and fluffy frosting.  Make the lime curd one to two days before assembling the cake.

  1              large  red onion -- halved lengthwise,
                        and thinly sliced crosswise
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar -- plus

Peel and cut beets into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Arrange large radicchio leaves over very large platter to cover (reserve small leaves for another use).  Drain red onions; scatter over radicchio.  Arrange beans over onions.  Arrange beet slices decoratively over beans.  Pour dressing over salad and serve.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  An overnight pickling tames the red onions.

Comments:  Hannah writes; "I first became interested in cooking when my son, Paul, was growing up.  He was a picky eater and quite a challenge to cook for.  He's married now with children of his own, and thankfully, he has learned to love almost everything I make.  When we all get together, I like to do the cooking Ã³ it gives my daughter-in-law a break.  And because most of my recipes are speedy, I still have time to enjoy my three grandchildren."

                          Imperial Peach Sundaes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  chopped dried pitted peaches
  1                cup  amaretto liqueur
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  2              whole  star anise*
  2              pints  vanilla ice cream
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts -- toasted

* Brown star-shaped seedpods available at Asian markets and specialty foods stores and in the spice section of some supermarkets.

Combine first 6 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to boil over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Reduce heat to low, cover partially, and simmer gently until peaches are tender, about 15 minutes.  Cool completely in saucepan.  Discard star anise.  (Sauce can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

Scoop ice cream into dessert goblets.  Spoon peach sauce over; sprinkle with pine nuts and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  China is the original home of the peach (a favorite fruit of its emperors), and pine nuts are grown in China and are used to garnish sweet fruit soups.  The ginger-spiced peach sauce for this dessert can be prepared one day before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             gallon  water
  3               cups  coarse kosher salt
  6 1/2         pounds  bone-in pork shoulder roast (Boston butt) -- excess fat trimmed
  3              large  garlic heads -- halved crosswise
  1 1/2      teaspoons  whole black peppercorns
  1              large  green cabbage head -- cut into 6 wedges
  1              pound  carrots -- peeled, cut
                        crosswise in half, then quartered
                        lengthwise
                        Fresh thyme sprigs
                        Spicy mustard

Combine 1 gallon of water and salt in heavy large pot.  Stir until salt dissolves.  Add pork.  Cover and refrigerate 1 day.

Bring pork in salt water to boil.  Boil 10 minutes.  Carefully drain salt water.  Fill pot with enough cold water to cover pork.  Bring water to boil over high heat.  Add garlic and peppercorns.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover; simmer gently until pork is very tender, about 3 hours.  Transfer pork to large pan.  Cover; keep warm.

Add cabbage and carrots to cooking liquid.  Boil until vegetables are almost tender, about 15 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled.  Before continuing, rewarm over medium-low heat.)  Using slotted spoon, transfer vegetables and garlic to serving platter.

Cut pork into thick slices; arrange on platter with vegetables.  Spoon some hot cooking liquid over pork and vegetables.  Garnish with thyme.  Serve with mustard.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The pork is marinated overnight in a salt-water brine, making it tender and flavorful.  After marinating, the pork can be cooked a day ahead so that St. Patrick's Day will be stress-free.

                        Romaine lettuce leaves

For Dipping Sauce:  Stir all ingredients in small bowl to blend.

For Dumplings:  Finely mince ginger and garlic in food processor.  Add asparagus and next 5 ingredients; using on/off turns, process until asparagus is finely chopped but not pureed.

Sprinkle baking sheet with flour.  Place 1 wonton wrapper on work surface.  Spoon 2 teaspoons asparagus mixture into center.  Moisten edges of wrapper with water; gather corners together over filling.  Twist edges of wrapper together, enclosing filling completely.  Place dumpling on baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.  (Sauce and dumplings can be made 8 hours ahead.  Cover separately and chill.)

Place steamer rack in large pot.  Pour enough water into pot to reach depth of 1/2 inch.  Line steamer rack with lettuce leaves.  Bring water to simmer.  Working in batches, arrange dumplings side by side (but not touching) on rack.  Cover and steam 15 minutes.

Serve dumplings with dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 36 dumplings.

Comments:  The dumplings can be assembled and chilled up to eight hours before steaming.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  spiral tube-shaped pasta
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  whole milk
  1                cup  whipping cream
  3               cups  grated cheddar cheese
  1 1/2           cups  crumbled blue cheese
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh chives

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Drain.

Meanwhile, melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add flour.  Cook 1 minute, stirring constantly (do not allow to brown).

Gradually whisk in milk and cream.  Simmer until mixture thickens slightly, whisking occasionally, about 3 minutes.  Reduce heat to low.  Add grated cheddar cheese and 1 cup crumbled blue cheese.  Whisk until cheese melts, about 2 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Add cooked pasta to sauce; stir to coat.  Transfer mixture to prepared baking dish.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup blue cheese.  Bake until sauce begins to bubble, about 25 minutes.  Sprinkle with chives and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Marie G. Beltran of Seattle, Washington, writes; "The signature dish at Blue Onion Bistro here in Seattle is a rich, velvety macaroni made with blue cheese.  The restaurant, which is housed in a former corner gas station, is both nostalgic and comforting, just like the delicious dish.  Is there any way you could persuade chef Scott Simpson to divulge the recipe?"

For blue-cheese lovers only.  For best results, use Maytag or a Danish blue cheese.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  dry Sherry
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  8               cups  mâ€šche (lamb's lettuce) - abt 4 oz
                        = (or mixed baby greens)
  1                cup  fresh Parmesan shavings - (abt 2 oz)
  1              large  firm Bosc pear - (abt 8 oz) -- peeled, halved,
                        cored, cut crosswise into thin slices
     1/3           cup  walnuts -- toasted
  1                     shallot -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced

Whisk mustard, Sherry, and red wine vinegar in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually add oil, whisking until well blended.  Season dressing with salt and pepper.

Comments:  A lovely twist on the traditional pear and blue cheese pairing.  Tender lamb's lettuce and toasted walnuts provide great contrasting textures.  Use a vegetable peeler to make thin shavings of Parmesan.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  tequila
  6        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  coarse kosher salt
  6                     frozen lime-flavored ice pops or
                        fruit bars -- unwrapped

Mix tequila and lime juice in 1-cup measuring cup.  Place coarse salt in small bowl.  Place all ice pops, sticks up, in deep bowl, or place 1 pop in each of 6 glasses.  Pour tequila mixture over ice pops.  Lightly dip 1 edge of each ice pop into coarse salt and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  For this clever riff on the "frozen" Margarita, try to use natural lime pops (sold at natural and specialty foods stores) rather than artificially colored and flavored varieties.

Comments:  For this clever riff on the &quot;frozen&quot; Margarita, try to use natural lime pops (sold at natural and specialty foods stores) rather than artificially colored and flavored varieties.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  3               cups  graham cracker crumbs
     3/4           cup  powdered sugar
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  1               pint  peach ice cream
  1               pint  raspberry sorbet
  1               pint  vanilla ice cream
                        === MERINGUE ===
  4              large  egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  superfine sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Raspberry-Peach Compote -- (see recipe)

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Blend crumbs and sugar in processor.  Add melted butter; process until crumbs are evenly moistened.  Press crumb mixture over bottom and up sides of pan.  Bake crust until slightly crisp, about 12 minutes.  Cool crust completely, then freeze 15 minutes.

For Filling:  Microwave peach ice cream on low in three 10-second intervals until slightly softened.  Drop ice cream by large spoonfuls over bottom of crust; spread over crust.  Place pan in freezer 15 minutes.  Microwave raspberry sorbet on low in three 10-second intervals until slightly softened.  Spoon sorbet in large dollops atop peach ice cream, then spread in even layer.  Return pan to freezer 15 minutes.  Repeat procedure with vanilla ice cream.  Freeze until filling is firm, about 4 hours.

For Meringue:  Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl until foamy.  Add cream of tartar and salt; beat until soft peaks form.  Gradually add sugar and beat until stiff and glossy, about 5 minutes.  Beat in vanilla.  Spoon meringue atop cake, mounding in center and spreading completely to edge of pan.  Using rubber spatula or knife, swirl meringue decoratively, creating pointy tips.  Freeze 2 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and keep frozen.)

Preheat broiler.  Broil cake just until meringue begins to turn light golden, about 2 minutes.  Carefully remove pan sides.  Place cake on platter.  Serve within 10 minutes with Raspberry-Peach Compote.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Spectacular but easy, thanks to purchased ice cream and sorbet.  The meringue is browned in the broiler, like a baked Alaska, just before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  10       tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
     3/4           cup  pecans -- toasted, and
                        broken into pieces
     2/3           cup  buttermilk
  2              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  maple extract
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
     2/3           cup  powdered sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  mild-flavored (light) molasses

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Combine flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl; whisk to blend.  Add 6 tablespoons butter; using fingertips, rub in until butter is reduced to pea-size pieces.  Mix in pecans.  Whisk buttermilk, egg yolks, and extract in medium bowl.  Add to flour mixture.  Toss with fork until dough comes together in moist clumps.  Gather dough into ball.  Press dough out on lightly floured surface to 8-inch round; cut into 6 wedges.

Arrange wedges 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheet.  Bake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 16 minutes; transfer to rack.

Whisk remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar, 4 tablespoons butter, and cream in heavy small saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Remove pan from heat.  Whisk in powdered sugar and molasses.  Spread glaze over warm scones.  Let stand until glaze sets, at least 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 scones.

Comments:  Ann writes; "Just as T. S. Eliot's J. Alfred Prufrock measured out his life with coffee spoons, I like to measure out my days with interesting meals.  Since I started teaching English literature to junior-high students about a year ago, I've had less time to cook because of all the papers I have to grade.  I'm still a firm believer, though, that food makes life more fabulous, and I get such pleasure from tasting and experimenting.  Sometimes I'll honor requests from my students and whip up new treats for them.  My baked goods, like these scones, are the most popular."

These oversize wedge-shaped scones have a light muffin-like texture.

Comments:  Ann writes; &quot;Just as T. S. Eliot&apos;s J. Alfred Prufrock measured out his life with coffee spoons, I like to measure out my days with interesting meals.  Since I started teaching English literature to junior-high students about a year ago, I&apos;ve had less time to cook because of all the papers I have to grade.  I&apos;m still a firm believer, though, that food makes life more fabulous, and I get such pleasure from tasting and experimenting.  Sometimes I&apos;ll honor requests from my students and whip up new treats for them.  My baked goods, like these scones, are the most popular.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
These oversize wedge-shaped scones have a light muffin-like texture.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- or more if needed
  1                cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     3/4           cup  crÃ‹me fraÃ“che*
     1/3           cup  large-curd cottage cheese
     1/3           cup  sour cream
  2              small  white onions -- very thinly sliced
                        = (abt 1 1/2 cups)
  12            ounces  bacon in 1/4"-thk slices -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/2"-wide strips
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Sold at some supermarkets.  If unavailable, heat 1 cup whipping cream to lukewarm (85 degrees).  Remove from heat and mix in 2 tablespoons buttermilk.  Cover and let stand in warm, draft-free area until slightly thickened, 24 to 48 hours, depending on temperature of room.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

Combine 1 cup flour, 1 cup warm water, and 1 teaspoon yeast in large bowl; stir to blend well.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let stand until mixture bubbles, about 30 minutes.  Stir in salt, then 1 1/4 cups flour.  Mix until soft slightly sticky dough forms, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls if very sticky.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Lightly flour 2 large baking sheets.  Lightly flour hands; punch down dough and divide in half.  Roll out each half on lightly floured surface to thin 16- by 10-inch rectangle.  Transfer each rectangle to prepared baking sheet.  If dough shrinks, roll or stretch each back to size.

Puree crÃ‹me fraÃ“che, cottage cheese, and sour cream in processor until smooth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Spread cream mixture over crusts.  Sprinkle onions and raw bacon over cream mixture, dividing equally.  Bake tarts until edges of crusts are crisp and brown, about 14 minutes.  Sprinkle generously with pepper; cut into pieces and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

What to drink: GewÂ¸rztraminer or a dry Alsatian Riesling.

Comments:  Serve with a green salad for a lovely lunch or light supper.

  33                    paper panettone molds
                        = (2 1/2"-wide by 1 1/2"-high)
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  4 1/2           cups  cake flour
  3 1/2      teaspoons  ground cardamom
  2 1/4      teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  9              large  eggs
  1 1/2    tablespoons  grated orange peel
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  2          teaspoons  orange-flower water*
  2 1/4           cups  unsalted butter - (4 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
  3 3/4           cups  sugar
  1                cup  buttermilk
                        Vanilla And Almond Frosting -- (see recipe)

* A flavoring extract sold at liquor stores and in the liquor section or specialty foods section of some supermarkets.

Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Lightly spray insides of 33 paper molds with nonstick spray; arrange molds on 2 large rimmed baking sheets.

Sift flour, ground cardamom, baking powder, and salt into large bowl.  Whisk eggs, orange peel, vanilla, and orange-flower water in bowl to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in another large bowl until fluffy.  Gradually add sugar, beating until well blended.  Beat in egg mixture in 3 additions.  Beat in dry ingredients in 4 additions alternately with buttermilk, scraping bowl occasionally.

Spoon 1/3 cup batter into each paper mold.  Bake cupcakes until puffed and tester inserted into center comes out clean, reversing sheets after 12 minutes, about 25 minutes total (cupcakes may not brown on top).  Transfer cupcakes to racks; cool completely.

Frost orange cupcakes with vanilla frosting.  (Can be made ahead.  Arrange cupcakes in deep disposable roasting pans.  Cover pans with foil.  Refrigerate up to 2 days, or store at room temperature 1 day.  Bring chilled cupcakes to room temperature before serving.)

Decorate cupcakes with mini roses up to 4 hours before serving.

This recipe yields 33 cupcakes.

Comments:  Taller, heavier-weight paper molds Ã³ typically used for individual panettone, the Italian holiday bread Ã³ are used instead of regular muffin papers to create a more elegant look.

Vanilla And Almond Frosting is an accompaniment for this recipe.

  1                can  cannellini beans - (15 oz) -- drained
                        = (white kidney beans)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh basil
  8             ounces  orecchiette - (abt 2 cups)
                        = (little ear-shaped pasta, or

Meanwhile, cook orecchiette pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until almost tender, about 15 minutes. Add broccoli florets; cook until pasta is just tender but still firm to bite and broccoli florets are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes longer. Ladle out 1/2 cup pasta cooking water and reserve. Drain orecchiette and broccoli florets; return to pot.

Add tomato sauce and reserved pasta cooking water to pasta and toss to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer pasta to bowl. Sprinkle with cheese and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  water
  3             pounds  chicken drummettes
     3/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  salt
  2               cups  purchased barbecue sauce
     1/3           cup  root beer
     1/4           cup  minced peeled fresh ginger
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
                        Sesame seeds
                        Dried crushed red pepper

Combine 8 cups water, chicken drummettes, soy sauce, and salt in large bowl.  Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bring barbecue sauce, root beer, and minced ginger to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Simmer 5 minutes to blend flavors.

Drain chicken drummettes and transfer to large rimmed baking sheet.  Roast 30 minutes.  Pour 1/3 of barbecue sauce mixture into small bowl and set aside.  Brush chicken drummettes all over with remaining barbecue sauce mixture.  Continue roasting until cooked through, about 15 minutes longer.  Brush with reserved barbecue sauce.

Transfer to platter.  Sprinkle chicken drummettes with parsley, sesame seeds, and crushed red pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 8 appetizer servings.

Comments:  Susan Stanley of Providence, Rhode Island, writes; "I vacationed in Alaska not long ago, and I can hardly wait to return.  The scenery was absolutely gorgeous, but I must admit that the delightful ginger-root beer drumsticks at the Snow Goose Restaurant in Anchorage were the real draw.  Could you track down the recipe for me?"

Although these are no longer served at the restaurant, chef Ron R. Sabado was happy to pass along the recipe.  Accompany the spicy drummettes with cold beer.

  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  9        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" pieces
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  almond paste - (packed) -- abt 5 oz
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- room temperature
  2              large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4             medium  Bartlett or Anjou pears - (abt 7 oz ea)

For Crust:  Whisk egg yolks and apple cider in small bowl to blend.  Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Add chilled butter and process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add egg yolk mixture and process until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill 1 hour.  Press dough evenly onto bottom and up sides of 11-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom; chill while preparing filling.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.)

For Filling:  Position rack in lowest third of oven.  Preheat to 375 degrees.  Blend almond paste and sugar in processor until almond paste is finely ground.  Add 1/4 cup flour and 3 tablespoons room-temperature butter and process until thick paste forms.  Add eggs and vanilla extract and process until smooth.  Spread filling in crust; cover and chill while preparing pears.

Peel pears.  Cut each pear in half lengthwise and core.  Slice 1 pear half crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Press on pear half to fan slices toward wider end.  Slide spatula under pear half and place atop tart filling, positioning narrow end of pear in center of tart and wider end against crust.  Repeat with remaining pear halves.  Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter.  Brush over pears.

Bake tart until pears are tender and crust is brown, about 50 minutes.  Cool 30 minutes.  Remove from pan and serve warm or at room temperature.  (Tart can be prepared up to 8 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Hira Rhode of North Bennington, Vermont, writes; "My husband took me to The Perfect Wife Restaurant & Tavern in nearby Manchester to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary.  We rarely order dessert, but we couldn't resist the pear and almond tart.  We have five pear trees of our own at home, so we could most definitely make good use of the recipe.  Could you get it for us?"

To create the most flavorful tart, be sure to use very ripe pears.

                        === CAKE ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  3 1/4           cups  cake flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder

  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  4          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  4              large  eggs
  1                cup  whole milk
  1                cup  pecans -- toasted, and
                        finely chopped
     1/4           cup  dark corn syrup
     1/4           cup  mild-flavored (light) molasses
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
                        === GLAZE ===
  2          teaspoons  water
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  2               cups  sugar
  1                cup  buttermilk
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks)
  2          teaspoons  dark corn syrup
     1/2           cup  bourbon
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray 10-inch-diameter Bundt pan with nonstick spray; dust with flour.  Sift 3 1/4 cups flour, baking powder, and salt into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar, butter, and 2 teaspoons vanilla in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time.  Beat in flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with milk in 2 additions.  Transfer half of batter to prepared pan.

Stir pecans, corn syrup, molasses, and 2 teaspoons vanilla in another medium bowl to blend.  Stir in baking soda.  Stir pecan mixture into remaining cake batter in bowl.  Spoon pecan batter over batter in pan (do not swirl).  Bake until tester inserted near center of cake comes out with dry crumbs attached, about 50 minutes.  Transfer cake in pan to rack.

Meanwhile, Prepare Glaze:  Stir 2 teaspoons water and baking soda in small bowl to dissolve baking soda.  Bring sugar, buttermilk, butter, and corn syrup to boil in heavy 6-quart saucepan over high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar and melt butter.  Reduce heat to medium-high.  Stir in baking soda mixture (glaze will bubble).  Boil until sauce is golden and slightly thickened, stirring often, about 8 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in bourbon and vanilla.

Invert warm cake onto platter.  Immediately brush 1 1/2 cups hot glaze over cake, allowing glaze to soak into cake.  Cool cake completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and let stand at room temperature.  Cover and refrigerate remaining glaze.)

Rewarm remaining glaze, stirring.  Serve cake with ice cream and warm glaze.

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             ounces  Italian sweet sausage -- casings removed
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/8      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  2             medium  carrots -- finely chopped
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- finely chopped
  2               cups  finely-chopped canned whole Italian-style
                        plum tomatoes
  1                cup  low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
     1/2           cup  Chianti
                        = (or other dry red wine)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh basil
  12            ounces  penne pasta
  1                cup  freshly-grated pecorino Romano cheese

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium heat.  Add sausage, garlic, and crushed red pepper; sautÃˆ until brown, breaking up with fork, about 6 minutes.  Add carrots, onion, and celery; sautÃˆ until beginning to brown, about 10 minutes.  Mix in tomatoes.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add 1 cup broth and wine; simmer uncovered until liquid is slightly reduced, about 15 minutes.

Add basil; cover and simmer until vegetables are very tender, adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if liquid evaporates too quickly and stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes.  Simmer uncovered until ragË˜ thickens to desired consistency, stirring often, about 10 minutes longer.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.  Rewarm over medium heat before using.)

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite.  Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid.  Return pasta to pot.  Mix in ragË˜, 1/2 cup cheese, and 2 tablespoons oil.  Add cooking liquid by 1/4 cupfuls to moisten, if desired.  Season with salt and pepper.

Divide pasta among plates.  Serve, passing 1/2 cup cheese separately.

This recipe yields 6 first-course servings.

What To Drink:  Sangiovese wines are a classic pairing with robust pasta dishes.  Try the Cantina di Montalcino 1999 Poggio del Sasso, a good-value Super Tuscan.

           Pizza Bianca With Prosciutto, Arugula, And Parmesan

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cans  refrigerated pizza dough - (10 oz ea)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  16                    thin slices prosciutto - (abt 6 oz)
  2               cups  arugula leaves - (packed)
  2               cups  fresh Parmesan shavings - (abt 4 oz)

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Flour 2 large baking sheets.  Unroll each pizza dough on work surface.

To make round pizzas:  Cut corners off dough, forming total of two 10-inch rounds.

To make rectangular pizzas:  Cut each crosswise in half to make total of four 8- by 5-inch rectangles.

Arrange on prepared sheets.  Drizzle each round pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil or each rectangular pizza with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil.  Bake until crusts are brown, about 8 minutes.  Using metal spatula, loosen crusts from baking sheets.  Cut round pizzas in half.  Transfer pizza crusts to plates.  Top each with prosciutto, arugula, and Parmesan, dividing equally.  Drizzle each with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Called bianca, or "white," because they are sauceless, these crispy pizzas are the essence of clean flavor.  The toppings are added after the crusts come out of the oven, melting the cheese slightly.  This recipe makes two round pizzas or four rectangular ones.

  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- thawed
                        = (half of 17.3-oz package)
  4             ounces  thinly-sliced prosciutto
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
     3/4           cup  finely-grated GruyÃ‹re cheese - (packed) -- abt 2 1/2 oz
  1                     egg -- beaten to blend

Place pastry sheet on work surface.  Cut in half, forming two 9 1/2- by 4 3/4-inch rectangles.  Arrange half of prosciutto on 1 rectangle, leaving 1/2-inch border along 1 side.  Sprinkle prosciutto with half of basil, then top with half of cheese.  Brush plain border with egg glaze.

Starting at long side opposite border, roll up pastry jelly-roll style, pressing gently to seal long edges.  Wrap in plastic.  Repeat with remaining pastry, prosciutto, basil, cheese, and egg to form second log.  Refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours and up to 2 days.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Cut logs crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rounds.  Arrange rounds on prepared sheets, spacing 1 inch apart.  Bake 1 sheet at a time until pastries are golden brown, about 16 minutes.  Using metal spatula, transfer pastries to racks and cool slightly.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields about 30 pinwheels.

                     Puerto Nuevo-Style Lobster Tacos

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     live lobsters - (1 1/2 lbs ea) -- rinsed
  1                cup  butter - (2 sticks) -- melted
                        Toasted-Garlic Rice With
                        Fresh Herbs And Lime -- (see recipe)
                        Crunchy Pear Salsa -- (see recipe)
                        Warm flour tortillas
                        Lime wedges

Fill very large bowl with ice water.  Bring large stockpot of water to boil.  Plunge 2 lobsters headfirst into boiling water.  Cook 3 minutes (lobsters will not be fully cooked).  Using tongs, transfer lobsters to ice water to cool.  Repeat procedure twice more with remaining lobsters.  Using heavy cleaver or large knife, immediately cut each lobster lengthwise in half.  Remove intestinal tract and rinse away green tomalley.  Crack claws; remove claw meat.  Place claw meat in body cavities.

Preheat broiler.  Arrange 6 lobster halves, meat-side up, on each of 2 large baking sheets.  Brush lobster meat generously with some of melted butter.  Broil 1 sheet of lobster halves until meat is just opaque, about 3 minutes.  Repeat with second sheet.  Arrange lobster halves on platter.  Drizzle remaining butter over.

Spoon rice, then lobster meat and salsa onto warm tortillas.  Fold up tortillas and serve with lime wedges.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

What To Drink:  Assorted chilled Mexican beers.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  Warm tortillas in an ungreased skillet over medium heat, about 1 minute per side (do not brown).  Stack them on a plate, and cover with plastic wrap.

Comments:  Puerto Nuevo, a seaside village in Baja California, Mexico, is famous for its Pacific spiny lobster.  For food safety, be sure to broil the lobsters immediately after they have been boiled and split.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  pitted Kalamata olives - (abt 8 oz)
  4          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
  2                     garlic cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     roasting chicken - (abt 7 lbs)
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
     2/3           cup  low-salt chicken broth -- more or less

Combine olives, rosemary, garlic, crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper in processor.  Blend until olives and garlic are chopped finely.  With machine running, add 4 tablespoons oil through feed tube and blend until coarse paste forms.  (Olivada can be made 1 day ahead.  Transfer to small bowl, cover, and refrigerate.)

Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 425 degrees.  Starting at neck end of chicken, carefully slide hand under skin, loosening skin over breast, thighs, and top of drumsticks.  Spread olive paste as evenly as possible over meat under loosened skin.  Rub outside of chicken with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.  Fold wing tips under; tie legs together loosely to hold shape.  Place chicken on rack set in roasting pan.

Roast chicken until skin is golden brown and thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 180 degrees, about 1 hour 20 minutes.  Using carving fork, tilt chicken to empty juices from cavity into pan.  Place chicken on platter; tent loosely with foil.

Pour pan juices into 2-cup glass measuring cup; spoon off fat that rises to top.  Add wine and enough broth to juices to measure 1 1/3 cups.  Pour liquid back into same roasting pan.  Set pan over 2 burners and boil until sauce thickens and reduces to 3/4 cup, scraping up browned bits, about 5 minutes.  Season sauce with salt and pepper; pour into gravy boat.  Serve chicken with sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

What To Drink:  A crisp white wine or a light, fruity red works well with this menu.  For white, Pinot Grigio is a great choice; for red, try a Valpolicella Classico.

Comments:  A classic roast chicken enlivened with an herbed olivada (olive paste) that is rubbed under the skin.  The olivada can be prepared one day before you cook the chicken.

        Roast Pork Tenderloin, Creamed Corn, Apple-Raisin Chutney

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PORK ===
  1              bunch  fresh mint leaves -- chopped (2/3 cup)
  5                     garlic cloves
  3                     fresh rosemary sprigs
  2                     shallots
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  olive oil
  2                     pork tenderloins - (12 to 14 oz ea) -- trimmed
                        === CREAMED CORN ===
  6               cups  fresh corn kernels or frozen -- thawed
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  low-salt chicken broth
  2               cups  whipping cream
                        Apple-Raisin Chutney -- (see recipe)

For Pork:  Combine first 6 ingredients in processor and chop finely.  Blend in oil.  Transfer marinade to glass baking dish.  Add pork tenderloins to marinade, turning to coat.  Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

Meanwhile, prepare Creamed Corn:  Cook 1 cup corn kernels in heavy medium pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 2 minutes.  Drain well and set aside.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and garlic and sautÃˆ until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add flour and stir 2 minutes.  Slowly whisk in chicken broth; whisk until mixture thickens and boils.  Stir in cream.  Bring mixture to simmer.  Add remaining 5 cups corn kernels and simmer until mixture is thick, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Transfer to processor and coarsely puree.  Stir in 1 cup cooked corn kernels.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Chill.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Remove pork from marinade.  Add pork to skillet and sautÃˆ until brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Transfer skillet to oven and roast pork until a meat thermometer inserted into center registers 180 degrees, about 10 minutes.

Bring corn to simmer.  Spoon corn onto plates, dividing equally.  Slice pork tenderloins and place atop corn, dividing equally.  Top with Apple-Raisin Chutney and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Tonya Morrison of Lewis Center, Ohio, writes; "My husband and I had a wonderful time on our vacation to Kiawah Island, South Carolina.  One night we had dinner at Rosebank Farms CafÃˆ in Bohicket Marina Village.  The recipe for their roast pork tenderloin with apple and raisin chutney would make a delicious souvenir."

In this imaginative main course, the chutney adds a sweet, tart contrast to the herb-roasted pork and the rich, creamy corn.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/4           cup  frozen solid vegetable shortening -- cut 1/2" cubes
  3        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
     1/2      teaspoon  apple cider vinegar
                        === FILLING ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
  8              small  Granny Smith apples - (abt 3lbs) -- peeled, cored,
                        and each cut into 12 slices
  2          teaspoons  ground cardamom
     1/3           cup  honey -- plus
  2        tablespoons  honey
     2/3           cup  chopped assorted nuts
                        = (such as walnuts, almonds, and
                        pistachios)
  7              large  Medjool dates -- pitted, and
                        cut into matchstick-size strips
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  whole milk
  3        tablespoons  raw sugar
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream

For Crust:  Combine flour, salt, and sugar in large bowl.  Add butter and shortening; rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Mix 3 tablespoons ice water and vinegar in small bowl.  Pour over flour mixture.  Stir with fork until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.

For Filling:  Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add apples and sautÃˆ until brown and almost tender, about 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium; mix in cardamom.  Pour 1/3 cup honey over and cook 1 minute.

Position rack in top third of oven; preheat to 400 degrees.  Roll out dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper to 12-inch round.  Remove top sheet of paper.  Sprinkle crust evenly with nuts.  Replace paper atop crust and roll to 13-inch round, embedding nuts in dough (crust will be thin).

Invert crust onto rimless baking sheet.  Remove top paper.  Spoon half of apple mixture over crust, leaving 2-inch plain border.  Sprinkle dates over apples.  Top with remaining apple mixture.  Using paper as aid, fold outer edge of crust over apples (dough is delicate; press together any tears).  Whisk egg and milk in bowl.  Brush edges generously with egg mixture.  Sprinkle crust and apples with raw sugar.

Bake tart until crust begins to brown, about 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 375 degrees; bake until crust is golden brown, about 10 minutes longer.  Loosen tart from parchment paper with spatula.  Cool on baking sheet until warm, about 45 minutes.

Beat cream and 2 tablespoons honey in large bowl until peaks form.

Slide 9-inch-diameter removable tart pan bottom under tart and transfer to platter.  Serve with honeyed whipped cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Market Tip:  Medjool dates can be found in the produce section of some supermarkets, at Middle Eastern and natural foods stores, and at Trader Joe's markets.  If unavailable, substitute any variety of fresh date.

Comments:  Raw sugar crystals (sold at natural foods stores and some supermarkets) are baked onto the edges of the free-form crust.

     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1 1/4           cups  whipping cream
  2               cups  half and half
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  instant grits
  1                cup  grated Monterey Jack cheese
  4                     skinless salmon fillets - (7 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add capers and garlic and sautÃˆ until garlic begins to color, about 1 minute.  Add white wine and simmer until reduced by half, about 1 minute.  Add whipping cream and bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until sauce thickens enough to coat back of spoon, about 10 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm before using.)

Bring half and half, 1/2 cup water, and salt to boil in heavy large saucepan.  Gradually whisk in instant grits.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes.  Add Monterey Jack cheese and stir until melted and smooth.  Season grits to taste with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat.  Cover to keep warm.

Meanwhile, brush salmon with oil, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Heat heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add salmon and cook until opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side.

Place spoonful of grits in center of each of 4 shallow bowls.  Spoon sauce around grits.  Top grits and sauce with salmon and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Natalie Zschiesch of Woodstock, Georgia, writes; "When I was a student at the University of Georgia in Athens, I frequently walked across the street to The Last Resort, a restaurant located in the heart of downtown.  I'd treat myself to the delicious salmon, served atop creamy grits and surrounded by a rich caper-cream sauce.  If only I had the recipe, I wouldn't have to make the trip back to Athens every time the craving sets in."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RAGÅ¸ AND FILLING ===
  12            ounces  Italian sweet sausages with fennel seeds - -- (abt 3 1/2 sausage)
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                can  Italian plum tomatoes with basil - (28 oz)
     1/8      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  8              large  fresh basil leaves -- slivered
  2               cups  fresh whole-milk ricotta cheese
                        = (or one 15-oz container whole-milk
                        ricotta cheese)
  1                cup  cubed (1/4") mild imported provolone
                        cheese (provola) or sharp domestic
                        provolone cheese
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- plus
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  1              pound  manicotti (large tubular pasta)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

For RagË˜ And Filling:  Pierce each sausage several times with tip of knife.  Place sausages in heavy large saucepan; add onion.  Cover; cook over medium-low heat 5 minutes.  Turn sausages over; stir onion.  Cover and continue to cook until sausages release some fat and onion begins to color, about 5 minutes.  Uncover; increase heat to medium.  Add wine and simmer until wine evaporates and onion is golden, stirring often, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Fit food mill directly onto pan.  Add tomatoes with juices and puree through mill into pan, leaving only seeds behind and scraping all tomato pulp from underside of food mill into pan; or puree tomatoes with juices in processor, then strain out seeds and add puree to pan.  Add crushed red pepper.  Simmer very gently over low heat until sauce thickens and reduces to scant 2 cups, stirring sauce and turning sausages occasionally, about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Add slivered basil and simmer sauce 5 minutes longer.  Using tongs, transfer sausages to plate and cool.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Place ricotta in medium bowl.  Mix in provolone cubes, 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan, and black pepper.  Cut sausages into 1/4-inch cubes; stir into cheese mixture.  Season filling to taste with salt.  (Sauce and filling can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and chill.)

For Assembly:  Cook manicotti in large pot of boiling salted water until still somewhat firm to bite and about 3/4 cooked, about 7 minutes (depending on brand).  Using tongs, carefully transfer manicotti from pot to foil-lined baking sheet and cool.

Brush olive oil over bottom of 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish; spread 3 tablespoons sauce over.  Using teaspoon, fill each of 12 manicotti with about 1/3 cup cheese-sausage mixture.  Arrange stuffed pasta in single layer in prepared dish and spoon remaining sauce over.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Cover with plastic wrap; let stand at room temperature.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Sprinkle remaining 3/4 cup Parmesan atop sauce.  Bake manicotti uncovered until heated through and sauce is bubbling on bottom of dish, about 20 minutes.  Let manicotti stand 5 minutes and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  To bring out the best in this dish, buy or order the finest cheeses from a cheese shop or Italian deli: fresh ricotta, mild imported provolone, and Parmigiano-Reggiano.

                Shrimp Risotto With Baby Spinach And Basil

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  low-salt chicken broth -- more or less
  1              pound  uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onion
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2           cups  arborio rice - (abt 9 1/2 oz)
                        = (or medium-grain white rice)
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1            package  baby spinach leaves - (6 oz)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil
                        Additional grated Parmesan cheese

Bring 6 cups broth to simmer in medium saucepan.  Add shrimp.  Turn off heat, cover, and let stand until shrimp are just opaque in center, about 3 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to small bowl; cover with foil to keep warm.  Cover broth to keep warm.

Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add chopped onion and sautÃˆ until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add minced garlic and stir 1 minute.  Add rice and stir until edge of rice is translucent but center is still opaque, about 2 minutes.  Add wine and cook until wine is absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes.  Add 3/4 cup chicken broth.  Simmer until almost all broth is absorbed, stirring often, about 2 minutes.  Continue to add broth, 3/4 cup at a time, until rice is just tender and mixture is creamy, stirring often and allowing almost all broth to be absorbed after each addition, about 25 minutes total.

During last 5 minutes, add spinach in 4 batches, stirring and allowing spinach to wilt after each addition.  Mix in shrimp, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and basil.  Season risotto to taste with salt and pepper.  Spoon risotto into shallow bowls and serve, passing additional cheese separately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This risotto has the classic creamy yet al dente texture and features a combination of Parmesan cheese and seafood.  Contrary to popular belief, Italians do partner cheese with seafood in some dishes; we recommend it here without reservation.

Comments:  Sabrina writes; "After 17 years of making dinner for my family, I don't cook as much as I used to.  These days what I really enjoy doing is baking.  Not only is it more leisurely, but people enjoy the results so much.  About twice a month my husband takes some of my homemade cookies to his colleagues who always ask when I'm going to send something their way.  The staff in the doctor's office where I work will often ask me the same thing.  My zucchini bread is a special favorite.  I joke with people and tell them I'll bring it in, but only if they behave."

       Stir-Fried Tofu, Shiitake Mushrooms, Spicy Black Bean Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  18                    dried shiitake mushrooms
  3               cups  boiling water
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1                cup  vegetable broth
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  coarse salt
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1              small  leek, white and pale green parts only -- cut matchstick size
  2        tablespoons  Asian fermented black beans* -- minced
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  chili-garlic sauce*
     1/4      teaspoon  finely-crushed Szechuan peppercorns*
                        = (or coarsely-cracked black pepper)
  2                     containers soft tofu - (14 oz ea) -- drained, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
                        Fresh cilantro sprigs -- for garnish

* Available at Asian markets and specialty foods stores and in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets.

Place mushrooms in large bowl.  Pour 3 cups boiling water over; let soak until mushrooms soften, at least 25 minutes and up to 4 hours.  Drain.  Cut off stems and discard; finely chop caps.

Dissolve cornstarch in 2 tablespoons vegetable broth in 2-cup measuring cup.  Stir in remaining broth, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and salt.

Heat oil in heavy large wok or nonstick skillet over high heat until very hot.  Add mushrooms; stir-fry until browned, about 3 minutes.  Add leek; stir-fry until beginning to brown, about 1 minute.  Add black beans, ginger, garlic, chili-garlic sauce, and peppercorns; stir-fry 30 seconds.

Stir cornstarch mixture to blend, then stir into vegetable mixture.  Add tofu; toss gently to coat with sauce.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 4 minutes.

Spoon tofu mixture into serving bowl.  Garnish with cilantro and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

What To Drink:  The bit of heat here calls for a spicy white wine with ripe fruit and crisp acidity, such as a Riesling from Alsace or Germany's Rheingau.

Comments:  Beefy shiitake mushrooms stand in for the standard ground pork in this version of ma po tofu.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     container mascarpone cheese* - (8 oz)
  6        tablespoons  sweet Marsala (preferably imported)
  3        tablespoons  whipping cream
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  3               cups  sliced hulled strawberries - (abt 15 oz)
  2 1/4           cups  coarsely-crumbled amaretti cookies*
                        = (Italian macaroons; abt 4 1/2 oz)

* Mascarpone (Italian cream cheese) and amaretti cookies are available at Italian markets and many supermarkets.

Combine mascarpone, 3 tablespoons Marsala, cream, and 2 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl.  Stir gently until well blended.  Combine strawberries, remaining 3 tablespoons Marsala, and 1 tablespoon sugar in another medium bowl; toss to blend.  Cover mascarpone and berry mixtures; refrigerate 30 minutes.

Comments:  Hannah Levitz writes; "I'm always looking for good recipes that I can simplify.  I first became interested in cooking when my son, Paul, was growing up.  He was a picky eater and quite a challenge to cook for.  He's married now with children of his own, and thankfully, he has learned to love almost everything I make.  When we all get together, I like to do the cooking Ã³ it gives my daughter-in-law a break.  And because most of my recipes are speedy, I still have time to enjoy my three grandchildren."

Comments:  Hannah Levitz writes; &quot;I&apos;m always looking for good recipes that I can simplify.  I first became interested in cooking when my son, Paul, was growing up.  He was a picky eater and quite a challenge to cook for.  He&apos;s married now with children of his own, and thankfully, he has learned to love almost everything I make.  When we all get together, I like to do the cooking Ã³ it gives my daughter-in-law a break.  And because most of my recipes are speedy, I still have time to enjoy my three grandchildren.&quot;

Comments:  Elisa writes; "I love to entertain, but between coming home late Ã³ I just completed my Ph.D. in small animal clinical sciences Ã³ and feeding my husband, Adam, I haven't had the time to have friends over much.  I do manage to cook for holidays, though, and one of my favorite things is ricotta pie.  This version, from my grandma Elsie, is a traditional Easter sweet on both sides of my Italian family."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  fresh poblano chiles
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  8                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  ground cumin
  2                     turkey breast halves with skin and ribs
                        attached - (2 1/4 to 2 1/3 lbs)
  8             ounces  crumbled feta cheese
  6        tablespoons  chopped fresh oregano -- divided
  16             small  metal skewers
                        = (or rounded wooden toothpicks)
                        Kitchen twine
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  1                cup  dry white wine

Char chiles over gas flame or in broiler until blackened all over.  Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes, then peel and seed.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Whisk oil, garlic, and cumin in small bowl to blend.  Using small sharp knife, remove bones from 1 turkey breast; reserve bones.  Place breast, skin-side down, between 2 sheets of plastic wrap.  Pound with mallet to 1/2-inch thickness (about 12- by 9-inch irregular rectangle).  Remove top sheet of plastic.

Brush turkey with 1/4 of oil mixture; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Top evenly with half of flattened chiles.  Sprinkle chiles with half of feta, then 2 tablespoons oregano.  Starting at 1 long side, roll up turkey breast jelly-roll style.  Secure edge with skewers or toothpicks, then tie with kitchen twine.  Repeat with remaining turkey breast, 1/4 of oil mixture, chiles, feta, and 2 tablespoons oregano.

Oil two 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pans.  Transfer roulades to prepared pans, skewer-side down.  Brush roulades with remaining oil mixture.  Add reserved bones to pans.  Sprinkle rolls with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Roast roulades until thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 160 degrees, about 35 minutes.

Remove roulades from oven; let stand at room temperature 5 minutes.  Transfer roulades to cutting board; tent with foil.  Place same baking pans over burners on high heat.  Add 1 cup broth, 1/2 cup wine, and 1 tablespoon oregano to each pan; boil until liquid in each pan is reduced to 1 cup, scraping up browned bits, about 5 minutes.  Discard bones.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.

Remove string and skewers from roulades.  Cut each into eight slices; transfer to platter.  Pour sauce over and serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 16 servings as part of buffet.

Repeat with remaining turkey breast, 1/4 of oil mixture, chiles, feta, and 2 tablespoons oregano.

Oil two 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pans.  Transfer roulades to prepared pans, skewer-side down.  Brush roulades with remaining oil mixture.  Add reserved bones to pans.  Sprinkle rolls with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)
</DirT>

Remove roulades from oven; let stand at room temperature 5 minutes.  Transfer roulades to cutting board; tent with foil.  Place same baking pans over burners on high heat.  Add 1 cup broth, 1/2 cup wine, and 1 tablespoon oregano to each pan; boil until liquid in each pan is reduced to 1 cup, scraping up browned bits, about 5 minutes.  Discard bones.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove string and skewers from roulades.  Cut each into eight slices; transfer to platter.  Pour sauce over and serve warm or at room temperature.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  dried cannellini beans - (16 oz)
                        = (white kidney beans)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4          head  green cabbage -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2               cups  chopped fresh tomatoes
  4                     celery stalks -- cut 1/2" pieces
  3                     carrots -- cut 1/2" pieces
  10              cups  vegetable stock -- or more if needed
                        = (or canned vegetable broth)
  2             medium  potatoes -- cut 1/2" pieces
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh basil
     1/2          head  red cabbage -- cut 1/2" pieces
  4                     zucchini -- cut 1/2" pieces
  6             slices  seven-grain bread, 3/4"-thick -- toasted
  1                cup  grated Parmesan cheese - (abt 3 oz)
                        Additional olive oil

Place beans in heavy large pot.  Pour in enough water to cover beans by 3 inches.  Soak overnight.  Drain beans.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in very large pot over medium heat.  Add onion, thyme, and garlic; sautÃˆ 5 minutes.  Add green cabbage, tomatoes, celery, and carrots; sautÃˆ 10 minutes.  Add beans, 10 cups stock, potatoes, and basil.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat; cover and simmer 1 hour.

Add red cabbage and zucchini.  Cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes longer.  Uncover.  Add toasted bread slices to soup and remove from heat; let stand 10 minutes.  Stir in cheese.  Divide soup among bowls.  Top each serving with ground pepper and additional olive oil and serve.

This recipe yields 12 first-course or 6 main-course servings.

Comments:  Cheryl Zook of Ketchum, Idaho, writes; "After I graduated from college last fall, I spent a few months in Europe.  By far, my favorite stop was Florence.  I'll always remember the vegetable soup I had at Ristorante Mamma Gina near the Ponte Vecchio."

This is almost as thick as a stew.  If you prefer a thinner soup, simply add more vegetable stock.  Because the beans need to soak overnight, begin preparation a day ahead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BASE FROSTING ===
  3               cups  unsalted butter - (6 sticks) -- room temperature
  10 1/2          cups  powdered sugar - (2 1/2 to 2 3/4 lbs)
  3        tablespoons  whipping cream
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === VANILLA FROSTING ===
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === ALMOND FROSTING ===
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
  6              drops  yellow food coloring
                        === DECORATION ===
                        Unsprayed (nontoxic) mini roses

For Base Frosting:  Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Gradually beat in sugar, then cream and vanilla.  Divide between 2 bowls.

For Vanilla Frosting:  Mix 1 teaspoon vanilla into 1 bowl of base frosting.

For Almond Frosting:  Mix almond extract into second bowl of base frosting.  Mix in yellow food coloring, 1 drop at a time, until desired shade is reached.

Comments:  One buttercream base makes two frosting flavors.  Vanilla tops the orange cupcakes, and almond tops the devil's food.  Be sure to use unsprayed (nontoxic) roses for decoration.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  green beans -- trimmed
  1 1/2    tablespoons  oriental sesame oil
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds -- toasted

Cook green beans in large pot of boiling water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain.  Transfer green beans to large bowl of ice water to cool.  Drain again.  Pat green beans dry.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Wrap green beans in paper towels and enclose in resealable plastic bag.  Refrigerate.)

Heat oil in heavy large wok or nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add green beans and stir-fry until heated through, about 2 minutes.  Add soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and pepper.  Stir-fry until sauce reduces slightly and loosely coats green beans, about 2 minutes longer.  Add sesame seeds and toss to coat.  Transfer green bean mixture to bowl and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Chinese long beans cut into smaller lengths also work well in this recipe.
