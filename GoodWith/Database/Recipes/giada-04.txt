                Amaretto Chocolate Chip Cookie Sandwiches

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  old-fashioned oats
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1                cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature
     3/4      teaspoon  pure almond extract
  1                     bag semisweet chocolate chips - (12 oz)
  1                cup  whole almonds -- toasted and chopped
  3              pints  vanilla ice cream -- softened slightly
     1/3           cup  amaretto liqueur

Line heavy large baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Finely chop the oats in a food processor.  Mix in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Set aside.

Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugars in a large bowl until fluffy.  Scrape down sides of mixing bowl.  Beat in the eggs and almond extract.  Add the flour mixture in 3 parts and stir just until blended.  Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped almonds.

For each cookie, drop 1 rounded tablespoonful of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing 1-inch apart (do not flatten dough).  Bake until the cookies are golden (cookies will flatten slightly), about 13 minutes.  Cool the cookies on the baking sheets for 5 minutes.  Transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely.  The cookies can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.

To make the ice cream sandwiches:  Place the ice cream in a large bowl.  Mix in the amaretto.  Cover the ice cream mixture and freeze until firm, at least 3 hours.

Arrange 12 cookies, flat-side up, on a baking sheet.  Top each with a scoop of ice cream, then another cookie, flat-side down, pressing slightly to adhere.  Cover and freeze the sandwiches until they are firm, at least 3 hours.  Sandwiches can be made up to 4 days ahead.  Wrap each sandwich with plastic wrap and keep frozen.

This recipe yields 4 dozen individual cookies or 2 dozen ice cream sandwiches.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  3        tablespoons  ice water
                        === FILLING ===
  2              small  Golden Delicious apples -- peeled, halved,
                        cored, cut into 1/8"-thick slices
  1                     Pippin apple -- peeled, halved,
                        cored, cut into 1/8"-thick slices
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1              large  egg white -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for egg wash
  2        tablespoons  sliced almonds -- toasted

To make the Crust:  Mix the flour, sugar, and salt in a processor.  Add the butter.  Pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.  Add the ice water and pulse until moist clumps form.  Gather the dough into a ball; flatten into a disk.  (If the dough still crumbles and does not form into a ball, add another tablespoon of ice water.)  Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.

For the Filling:  Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Combine the apples, 1/4 cup of sugar, and lemon juice in large bowl; toss gently to blend.  Set aside for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, dust a large sheet of parchment paper with flour and roll out the dough on the paper to an 11-inch round.  Transfer the dough on the parchment paper to a heavy large baking sheet.  Spoon the apple mixture over the dough, leaving a 2-inch border.  Fold the dough border over the filling to form an 8-inch round, leaving the apples exposed in the center.  Pleat loosely and pinch the dough to seal any cracks.  Brush the crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar.

Bake the crostata until the crust is golden and the apples are tender, about 40 minutes.  Transfer the baking sheet to a rack; cool for 10 minutes.  Slide a metal spatula under the crust to free the crostata from the baking sheet.  Cool the crostata to lukewarm.  Sprinkle with the almonds and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/3           cup  olive oil -- plus
                        more for deep-frying
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12              cups  coarsely-torn arugula - (abt 10 oz)

Blend the Gorgonzola in a food processor until smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides of the work bowl occasionally.  Using 1 rounded teaspoon of cheese for each, form the cheese into 18 (1-inch) balls.  Working in batches, coat the balls with the egg then with the bread crumbs.  Repeat coating the balls in the egg and bread crumbs.  Arrange the balls on a small baking sheet.  Cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours or overnight.

Whisk the lemon juice, garlic, and lemon peel in a medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in 1/3 cup oil.  Season the dressing, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Set the dressing aside.

Add enough oil to a heavy small saucepan to come 2 inches up the sides of the pan.  Heat the oil over medium heat.  At this point, remove the refrigerated Gorgonzola balls from the refrigerator.  Working in batches, add the cold balls to the hot oil and fry just until golden brown, about 20 seconds.  (It is essential that the Gorgonzola balls be cold when they go into the oil, otherwise they will fall apart in the oil.  If they start to warm up at any point, return them to the refrigerator to firm back up.)  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried balls to paper towels to drain.

Toss the arugula in a large bowl with enough dressing to coat.  Season the salad, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Mound the salad on plates.  Top the salads with the hot fried Gorgonzola balls and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.  Add the pasta and cook for about 6 minutes.  Since you will be cooking the pasta a second time in the oven, you want to make sure the inside is still hard.  Drain in a colander.

In a large bowl, toss the drained pasta with the roasted vegetables, marinara sauce, cheeses, peas, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Using a wooden spoon, gently mix, until all the pasta is coated with the sauce and the ingredients are combined.

Pour the pasta into a greased 9- by 13-inch pan.  Top with the remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan and butter pieces.  Bake until top is golden and cheese melts, about 25 minutes.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  beef stock or broth
                        About 4 cups water -- enough to cover beef
  2                     onions -- peeled, quartered
  4                     celery stalks -- cut in halves
  1                     bay leaf
  4                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into thirds
  1              pound  small boiling potatoes
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Gorgonzola Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Salsa Verde -- (see recipe)

Heat a large braising pot over medium-high heat.  Season the beef with salt and pepper.  Sear the beef, browning it on both sides, about 5 minutes a side.  Carefully add the stock and enough water to just cover the meat.  Add the onion, celery, and bay leaf.  Bring the liquid to a boil.  Lower the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for 1 hour.  Add the carrots and potatoes and cook until the meat is tender, about another hour.

Carefully lift out the meat, place on a cutting board, and cover with foil.  Strain the vegetables from the stock.  Discard the celery, onion, and bay leaf.  Arrange the carrots and potatoes on a platter and cover with foil to keep warm.  Continue cooking the stock uncovered over medium heat until reduced by half, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, slice the meat against the grain, on an angle.  Arrange the meat alongside the carrots and potatoes on the platter.  When the stock has reduced, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and transfer to a gravy dish.  Serve the Bollito Misto with the gravy and bowls of the Gorgonzola Sauce and the Salsa Verde.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1              large  navel orange
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  semisweet chocolate chips

Using a vegetable peeler, cut the orange part of the peel from the stem end of the orange down to the navel end, forming long 3/4 to 1-inch-wide strips.  Bring a heavy small saucepan of water to a boil.  Add the peels and cook for 1 minute.  Drain and then rinse the peels under cold water.  Repeat cooking the peels in the saucepan with fresh boiling water and rinsing under cold water.

Stir the sugar and 1/2 cup of fresh water in a heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves.  Bring to a boil.  Add the orange peels and simmer over medium-low heat until tender, about 15 minutes.  Using tongs, transfer the peels to a sheet of parchment paper to dry slightly, about 1 hour.

Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper.  Stir the chocolate in a small bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water until melted and smooth.  Dip 1 1/2-inches of each candied orange peel into the chocolate then place them on the prepared baking sheet and refrigerate until the chocolate is set, about 15 minutes.

This recipe yields about 12 candied peels.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  finely-shredded mozzarella
     1/3           cup  grated Parmesan
  8             ounces  purchased pizza dough
                        Extra virgin olive oil -- for deep-frying

Mix the mozzarella cheese and Parmesan together in a medium bowl, then set aside.  Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to 1/4-inch thick.  Using a 2 3/4-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out dough rounds.

Add enough oil to a heavy large frying pan with 3-inch sides to come halfway up the sides of the pan.  Heat the oil over medium heat until hot.  Drop a scrap of dough into the oil to ensure the oil is hot enough.  If the dough sizzles, then the oil is hot enough.  Working in batches, add the dough rounds to the hot oil (being sure not to crowd them in the pan) and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the rounds to paper towels to drain the excess oil.  Immediately sprinkle the cheese mixture over the hot pizzas.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields about 16 pizzettes.

  2               cups  marinara sauce
     1/3           cup  mascarpone cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  10       tablespoons  cold unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks)
                        Ice water
  1 1/2           cups  marmalade or apricot preserves
                        Candied Orange Peel -- (see recipe)

Line a heavy large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Mix the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, orange peel, and salt in a food processor.  Add the butter.  Blend until clumps form.  Add 2 tablespoons of ice water and blend.  Add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough forms.  Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead briefly to form a smooth dough.  Gather the dough into a ball then divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.  Flatten each piece into a disk.

Press 1 dough piece on the prepared baking sheet into a 4 1/2-inch round.  Spoon 1 generous tablespoon of the marmalade into the center of the round.  Fold the dough border in to form a 3-inch round and allow the center of the crostata to remain uncovered.  Pleat loosely and pinch the dough to seal any cracks.  Repeat with the remaining dough pieces and marmalade, spacing the crostatas evenly apart.  Cover and refrigerate the crostatas until they are cold, at least 45 minutes and up to 4 hours.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Bake the crostatas until the crusts are set, about 18 minutes.  Cool for 10 minutes.  Slide a metal spatula under the crusts to free the crostatas from the baking sheet.  Garnish with the candied orange peel and serve warm.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  16                    wonton wrappers
  1                     egg -- beaten to blend
  1                cup  chocolate-hazelnut spread
                        = (Nutella recommended)
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  16                    fresh mint leaves
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
                        Granulated sugar -- for dredging
                        Powdered sugar -- for dusting

Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap.  Place 1 wonton wrapper on the work surface.  Brush the edges of the wrapper lightly with egg.  Spoon 1 tablespoon of chocolate-hazelnut spread into the center of the wrapper.  Fold the wrapper diagonally in half over the filling and press the edges of the wrapper to seal.  Place the ravioli on the prepared baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining wonton wrappers, egg, and chocolate-hazelnut spread.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  Add enough oil to a heavy large frying pan to reach a depth of 2 inches.  Heat the oil over medium heat to 350 degrees.

Working in batches, carefully add the ravioli to the hot oil and cook until they are golden brown, about 45 seconds per side.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the ravioli to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.  Then, transfer the cooked ravioli to another baking sheet and keep them warm in the oven while frying the remaining ravioli.  (The fried ravioli can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cool them completely, then cover and refrigerate.  Before serving, place them on a baking sheet and rewarm in a preheated 375 degrees oven just until they are heated through, about 7 minutes.)

Spray the top side of the mint leaves very lightly with nonstick spray.  Working with 1 leaf at a time, dredge the coated side of the leaves in sugar to coat lightly.

Arrange 2 fried ravioli on each plate.  Dust the ravioli with powdered sugar.  Garnish with the sugared mint leaves and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  cornmeal
     3/4           cup  pine nuts -- plus
     3/4           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
                        = (abt 8 oz in total)
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted, and
                        cooled slightly
     1/2           cup  water
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate chips - -- (abt 1 1/3 cups)
     3/4           cup  ricotta cheese
  3             ounces  cream cheese -- room temperature
  1              large  egg
  3              large  egg yolks

Blend the flour, cornmeal, 3/4 cup pine nuts, 1/4 cup sugar, and salt in a food processor until finely ground.  Add the butter and pulse, just until the dough forms.  Press the dough over the bottom and about 2 inches up the sides of an 11-inch-diameter tart pan with a removable bottom.  Refrigerate until the dough is firm, about 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Line the tart dough with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake the tart shell in the lower third of the oven until just set, about 25 minutes.  Carefully remove the foil and pie weights.  Bake the shell until golden, about 10 minutes longer.  Cool completely.

Combine the remaining 3/4 cup of sugar with 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves.  Cool the sugar syrup slightly.

In a double boiler, melt the chocolate over very softly simmering water.

Pulse the ricotta cheese and cream cheese in a food processor until smooth.  Add the egg and egg yolks, 1 at a time, and process until smooth.  Add the melted chocolate and process until combined.  With the machine running, add the sugar syrup in a thin steady stream and process until smooth.

Pour the custard into the tart shell and bake until the filling is almost set, about 30 minutes or until the custard has set.  Scatter the remaining 3/4 cup toasted pine nuts on top of the filling.  Let the tart cool completely before serving.

The tart can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 3 days.  Return the tart to room temperature before serving.

This recipe yields 1 (11-inch) tart.

  4             slices  bacon -- chopped
  4             slices  pancetta -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2               cups  whipping cream

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  fennel bulb -- thinly sliced
  1                     onion -- chopped
  3              large  shallots -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  salt
  4              large  garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     3/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper flakes -- plus
                        more to taste
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (28 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine
  5               cups  fish stock
  1                     bay leaf
  1              pound  manila clams -- scrubbed
  1              pound  mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
  1              pound  uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1 1/2         pounds  assorted firm-fleshed fish fillets -- cut into 2" chunks
                        = (such as halibut or salmon)

Heat the oil in a very large pot over medium heat.  Add the fennel, onion, shallots, and salt and saute until the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes.  Add the garlic and 3/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and saute 2 minutes.  Stir in the tomato paste.  Add tomatoes with their juices, wine, fish stock and bay leaf.  Cover and bring to a simmer.  Reduce the heat to medium-low.  Cover and simmer until the flavors blend, about 30 minutes.

Add the clams and mussels to the cooking liquid.  Cover and cook until the clams and mussels begin to open, about 5 minutes.  Add the shrimp and fish.  Simmer gently until the fish and shrimp are just cooked through, and the clams are completely open, stirring gently, about 5 minutes longer (discard any clams and mussels that do not open).  Season the soup, to taste, with more salt and red pepper flakes.

Ladle the soup into bowls and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             ounces  sliced pancetta or bacon -- finely chopped
  1                cup  finely-diced red bell pepper
     1/3           cup  chopped shallots
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  4        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  18            medium  littleneck clams - (2 1/2" dia) -- shucked, and
                        bottom shells reserved

Heat the oil in a heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add the pancetta and saute until crisp and golden, about 3 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a plate.  Add the bell pepper, shallots, garlic, and oregano to the same skillet and saute until the shallots are tender and translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the wine and simmer until it is almost evaporated, about 2 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat and cool completely.  Stir the reserved pancetta and 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese into the vegetable mixture.  Season the mixture, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Line a heavy large baking sheet with foil.  Arrange the clams in the reserved shells on the baking sheet.  Spoon the vegetable mixture atop the clams, dividing equally and mounding slightly.  Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of Parmesan.  Bake until the clams are just cooked through and the topping is golden, about 10 minutes.

Arrange the clams on the platter and serve.

* When blending hot liquids:  Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes.  Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway.  If using a blender, release one corner of the lid.  This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions.  Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  orzo (rice-shaped pasta)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  shallot -- finely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14.5 oz) -- juices drained
  1 1/4           cups  whipping cream
  1                cup  frozen peas -- thawed
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring a heavy large saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat.  Add the orzo and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring often, about 8 minutes.  Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a heavy large frying pan over medium heat.  Add the shallot and garlic, and saute until tender, about 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook until they are tender, about 8 minutes.  Stir in the cream and peas.  Add the orzo and toss to coat.

Remove the skillet from the heat.  Add the Parmesan to the pasta mixture and toss to coat.  Stir the pasta mixture until the sauce coats the pasta thickly, adding enough reserved cooking liquid to maintain a creamy consistency.  Season the orzo with salt and pepper, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  1                cup  buttermilk
  1 1/2         pounds  chicken tenders - (abt 18)
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5              large  eggs
  2               cups  mashed potatoes -- chilled
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  marinara sauce -- warmed
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.

Stir 1 egg in a large bowl to blend.  Mix in the potatoes, then the flour.  Using a generous 1/2 cup of potato mixture for each, form the potato mixture into 4 (4 1/2-inch) diameter pancakes.

Heat the oil in a large nonstick fry pan over medium heat.  Fry the pancakes until they are golden brown and heated through, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer the pancakes to paper towels to drain.  Keep the pancakes warm on a baking sheet in the oven.  Pour off the excess oil from the pan.

Heat the pan over medium-low heat.  Crack the remaining 4 eggs into the pan.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Cook until the white is firm, about 2 minutes.  Using a spatula, turn the eggs over and cook for 30 seconds longer.

Spoon the sauce onto 4 plates.  Place a pancake atop the sauce.  Top each pancake with a fried egg.  Sprinkle with the Parmesan and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY DOUGH ===
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2 2/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
                        === FILLING AND COOKIES ===
  9             ounces  dried Mission figs -- stems discarded
     1/2           cup  raisins
     3/4           cup  honey
     1/3           cup  orange juice
  1         tablespoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1                cup  walnuts -- chopped
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend

For the Pastry Dough:  Whisk the eggs and vanilla in a small bowl to blend.  Mix the flour, sugar, lemon zest, and salt in a large bowl.  Add the butter and rub in with your fingers until the butter is the size of small peas.  Add the egg mixture and mix with a fork until the dough comes together.  Gather the dough into a ball.  Divide the dough in 2 and flatten into disks.  Wrap the dough disks in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, for the Filling And Cookies:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Finely chop the figs and raisins in a food processor.  Add the honey, orange juice, cinnamon, and lemon zest, and pulse just to blend.  Scrape the fig mixture into a medium bowl.  Stir in the walnuts.  Transfer the fruit mixture to a pastry bag.

Roll out 1 disk of dough on a floured work surface to 1/8- to 1/4-inch thickness.  Using a 2 1/2-inch diameter biscuit cutter, cut out dough rounds.  Gather the dough scraps into a disk, then cover and refrigerate while assembling the cookies.  Spoon the fruit mixture in the center of each dough round.  Lightly moisten the edges of the dough with the egg wash.  Fold the dough over the filling and press the edges to seal.  Arrange the cookies evenly apart on the prepared baking sheets.  Brush the tops of the cookies with egg wash.  Bake until the cookies are pale golden, about 18 minutes.

Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes.  Transfer the cookies to a cooling rack and cool completely.  Repeat with the refrigerated dough scraps and remaining filling.

This recipe yields 4 dozen.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sliced almonds -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  grated orange zest
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces
     1/3           cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  honey
  8             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips

Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Line a heavy large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Stir the almonds, flour and zest in a medium bowl.  Stir the sugar, butter, cream, and honey in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves.  Bring the mixture to a boil.  Remove the pan from the heat.  Stir in the almond mixture.  Cool the batter for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Using 2 teaspoons of batter for each cookie, spoon 8 mounds of the batter onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing evenly apart (the cookies will spread).  Flatten the batter slightly with your finger.

Bake the cookies until they are lacy and golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Gently slide the parchment paper with the cookies onto a rack and cool completely.  Transfer the cookies to paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining batter, lining the baking sheets with clean parchment for each batch.  (The cookies can be made up to this point 2 months ahead.  Cool completely, then store airtight in the freezer.  Defrost before continuing.)

Stir the chocolate in a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water until the chocolate melts.  Spread the melted chocolate over the bottom of 1 cookie.  Top with a second cookie, bottom-side down, pressing lightly to adhere.  Repeat with the remaining cookies and chocolate.

This recipe yields 28 sandwich cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Olive oil -- for frying
  1                cup  buttermilk
  2               cups  Italian-style bread crumbs
  1                     box store-bought cheese ravioli - -- (abt 24 ravioli)
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1                jar  store-bought marinara sauce -- heated, for dipping

Pour enough olive oil into a large frying pan to reach a depth of 2 inches.  Heat the oil over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 325 degrees.

While the oil is heating, put the buttermilk and the bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls.  Working in batches, dip ravioli in buttermilk to coat completely.  Allow the excess buttermilk to drip back into the bowl.  Dredge ravioli in the bread crumbs.  Place the ravioli on a baking sheet, and continue with the remaining ravioli.

When the oil is hot, fry the ravioli in batches, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried ravioli to paper towels to drain.

Sprinkle the fried ravioli with Parmesan and serve with a bowl of warmed marinara sauce for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  roasting chicken - (5 to 6 lbs) -- neck and
                        giblets discarded
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     orange -- quartered
  1                     lemon -- quartered
  1               head  garlic -- halved crosswise,
                        plus
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2               cans  reduced-sodium chicken broth - (14 oz ea)
     1/4           cup  frozen orange juice concentrate -- thawed
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh oregano leaves
                        Kitchen string or butcher twine

Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.

Pat the chicken dry and sprinkle the cavity with salt and pepper.  Stuff the cavity with the orange, lemon, and garlic halves.  Tie the chicken legs together with kitchen string to help hold its shape.  Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper.

Place a rack in a large roasting pan.  Place the chicken, breast-side up, on the rack in the pan.  Roast the chicken for 1 hour, basting occasionally and adding some chicken broth to the pan, if necessary, to prevent the pan drippings from burning.

Whisk the orange juice, lemon juice, oil, oregano, and chopped garlic in a medium bowl to blend.  Brush some of the juice mixture over the chicken, after it has baked 1 hour.  Continue roasting the chicken until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the innermost part of the thigh registers 170 degrees, basting occasionally with the juice mixture and adding broth to the pan, about 45 minutes longer.  Transfer the chicken to a platter.  Tent with foil while making the sauce (do not clean the pan).

Place the same roasting pan over medium-low heat.  Whisk in any remaining broth and simmer until the sauce is reduced to 1 cup, stirring often, about 3 minutes.  Strain into a 2-cup glass measuring cup and discard the solids.  Spoon the fat from the top of the sauce.  Serve the chicken with the pan sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MILK CHOCOLATE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/3           cup  honey
  1                     bag milk chocolate chips - (11.5 oz)
                        === WHIPPED CREAM ===
  1 1/2           cups  whipping cream -- chilled
  3        tablespoons  powdered sugar
                        === SUNDAES ===
     1/2        gallon  vanilla, mint chip, or coffee gelato
     1/2        gallon  Neapolitan ice cream
                        Assorted toppings
                        = (coarsely crumbled chocolate sandwich
                        cookies, almond biscotti, amaretti
                        cookies, chopped toasted almonds, sliced
                        fresh strawberries, rainbow decors,
                        chocolate sprinkles, mini candy-coated
                        chocolates, and maraschino cherries)

To make the Milk Chocolate Sauce:  Combine the cream and honey in a small heavy saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat.  Remove from the heat and add the chocolate.  Let stand until the chocolate melts, about 2 minutes, then whisk to combine.  Cool the sauce slightly, then pour into a clear glass serving bowl or small pitcher.  (The sauce can be made 1 week ahead.  Cool completely, then cover and refrigerate.)  Re-warm the sauce in the microwave, if necessary.

To make the Whipped Cream:  Using an electric mixer, beat the cream and sugar in a large bowl until soft peaks form.  Transfer the whipped cream to a serving bowl.  (The whipped cream can be made 2 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

For the Sundaes:  Place each topping in a separate serving bowl.  Scoop the gelato or ice cream into dessert bowls and drizzle with the milk chocolate sauce.  Allow guests to sprinkle their desired toppings over their sundaes.  Top with the whipped cream and cherries, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter -- melted
     1/3           cup  hazelnuts -- toasted, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1              pound  loaf purchased frozen white bread dough -- thawed
                        = (Bridgeford recommended)
     3/4           cup  powdered sugar
  3        tablespoons  mascarpone cheese
  1         tablespoon  buttermilk

Brush 1 tablespoon of melted butter over the bottom and sides of an 8- by 8- by 2-inch baking dish.

Mix the nuts, brown sugar, sugar, cinnamon, and cloves in a small bowl.  Roll out the thawed dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12- by 9-inch rectangle.  Brush 1 tablespoon of butter over the dough.  Sprinkle the nut mixture over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border along the top and bottom sides.  Starting at 1 long side, roll up the dough jelly-roll style, forming a log.  Pinch the seam to seal.  Cut the log into 9 equal pieces.

Arrange the rolls, cut-side down, in the prepared baking dish, spacing evenly.  Cover the dish with plastic wrap.  Let the rolls rise in a warm draft-free area until puffed, about 45 minutes.

Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees.

Bake the cinnamon rolls uncovered until the tops are golden brown, about 25 minutes.  Meanwhile, whisk the powdered sugar, mascarpone cheese, and buttermilk in a medium bowl until smooth and creamy.

Brush the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter over the baked cinnamon rolls and then drizzle the cheese mixture over top.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  5                     beefsteak tomatoes
  1                cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves
     3/4           cup  Italian-style bread crumbs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  pistachios -- coarsely chopped
     2/3           cup  dried cranberries
  12            ounces  good-quality white chocolate -- chopped
                        Red and green sugar crystals -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Line a heavy large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Whisk the flour and baking powder in a medium bowl to blend.  Using an electric mixer, beat the sugar, butter, lemon zest, and salt in a large bowl to blend.  Beat in the eggs 1 at a time.  Add the flour mixture and beat just until blended.  Stir in the pistachios and cranberries.

Form the dough into a 13-inch long, 3-inch wide log on the prepared baking sheet.  Bake until light golden, about 40 minutes.  Cool for 30 minutes.

Place the log on the cutting board.  Using a sharp serrated knife, cut the log on a diagonal into 1/2- to 3/4-inch-thick slices.  Arrange the biscotti, cut-side down, on the baking sheet.  Bake the biscotti until they are pale golden, about 15 minutes.  Transfer the biscotti to a rack and cool completely.

Stir the chocolate in a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water until the chocolate melts.  Dip half of the biscotti into the melted chocolate.  Gently shake off the excess chocolate.  Place the biscotti on the baking sheet for the chocolate to set.  Sprinkle with the sugar crystals.  Refrigerate until the chocolate is firm, about 35 minutes.

The biscotti can be made ahead.  Store them in an airtight container up to 4 days, or wrap them in foil and freeze in resealable plastic bags up to 3 weeks.

Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (105 to 110 degrees)
  2          teaspoons  active dry yeast
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for kneading
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus more for bowl

Mix the warm water and yeast in a small bowl to blend.  Let stand until the yeast dissolves, about 5 minutes.

Mix the flour and salt in a food processor to blend.  Blend in the oil.  With the machine running, add the yeast mixture and blend just until the dough forms.  Turn the dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 1 minute.

Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl and turn the dough to coat with the oil.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm draft-free area until the dough doubles in volume, about 1 hour.

Punch the down dough and form into ball.  The dough can be used immediately or stored airtight in the refrigerator for 1 day.

This recipe yields 1 (16-ounce) ball of pizza dough.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  grated Fontina
  8             ounces  grated Gruyere
  5          teaspoons  cornstarch
  6             ounces  thinly-sliced pancetta -- chopped
  2               cups  dry white wine
                        = (such as Pinot Grigio)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives
                        === FOR DIPPING ===
                        Bite-size pieces of focaccia, sliced
                        salami, fresh fennel, Belgian endive,
                        steamed broccoli florets and asparagus
                        spears

Toss the Fontina and Gruyere cheese with the cornstarch in a medium bowl to coat.  Saute the pancetta in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat until crisp and golden, about 8 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a plate.  Pour off any excess oil.  Pour the wine into the same saucepan and bring to a boil.

Decrease the heat to medium.  Whisk 1 handful of the cheese mixture into the wine until it is almost melted.  Repeat with the remaining cheese mixture in about 4 more batches.  Continue whisking until the cheese is completely melted and the fondue bubbles, about 1 minute.  Stir in all but 2 tablespoons of the pancetta.  Season the fondue with pepper, to taste.

Transfer the cheese mixture to a fondue pot.  Sprinkle with the remaining pancetta and chives.  Set the pot over a candle or a canned heat burner.  Serve with focaccia and vegetables.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3             pounds  boneless leg of lamb -- trimmed of excess
                        fat and sinew, meat cut 1 1/2" to 2"
                        pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1 1/2           cups  dry red wine
  3 1/2           cups  beef broth
  1                can  diced tomatoes with juices - (15 oz)
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  18             small  cipolline onions
  12             small  red-skinned potatoes -- halved
  2              large  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces

Heat the oil in a heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle the lamb with salt and pepper.  Toss the lamb with the flour in a large bowl to coat.  Working in 2 batches, add the lamb to the pot and cook until brown, about 10 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the lamb to a bowl.  Pour off the excess oil.

Add the garlic to the same pot and saute over medium heat until tender and fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the wine and simmer over medium-high heat until reduced by half, stirring to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot, about 5 minutes.

Return the lamb to the pot.  Stir in the broth, tomatoes with their juices, and tomato paste.  Cover partially and simmer over medium-low until the lamb is just tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.

Meanwhile, cook the onions in a medium saucepan of boiling water for 2 minutes.  Drain and cool.  Peel the onions and cut off the root ends.  Add the onions, potatoes, and carrots to the stew.  Simmer until the lamb and vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes longer.  Season the stew, to taste, with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

       Mascarpone And Dark Chocolate Cream In White Chocolate Cups

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  good-quality white chocolate -- chopped
  4             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  1                cup  whipping cream
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  8             ounces  mascarpone cheese
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        White chocolate curls -- for garnish

Line 8 muffin cups with paper liners.  Melt the white chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring until smooth.  Spoon 1 tablespoon melted chocolate into each paper liner.  Using a pastry brush, coat the chocolate evenly over the bottom and up the sides of the liners.  Freeze until the chocolate is firm, about 30 minutes.  Remelt the white chocolate in the bowl.  Spoon 1 tablespoon into each cup and brush over the bottom and up the sides, forming a second coat.  Freeze until completely set, about 1 hour.

Melt the bittersweet chocolate in top of a clean double boiler over simmering water, stirring until smooth.  At this point, set aside to cool completely.

Using an electric mixer, beat the cream and sugar in a large bowl until soft peaks form.  Set the whipped cream aside.

Using an electric mixer, beat the mascarpone cheese, melted bittersweet chocolate, orange peel, and vanilla in a large bowl just until smooth and glossy, about 30 seconds (do not overmix).  Fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture in 2 batches.  Transfer the mousse to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip.  Pipe the mousse into the white chocolate cups.  Sprinkle the white chocolate curls over the mousse and serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate overnight, and then let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                 Mascarpone Cheesecake With Almond Crust

Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheesecake                      Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  slivered almonds -- lightly toasted
     2/3           cup  graham cracker crumbs
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  2           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  2                     containers mascarpone cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4              large  eggs -- room temperature
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  chocolate-hazelnut spread
                        = (Nutella recommended)
     1/4           cup  whipping cream

For the Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Tightly wrap the outside of a 9-inch diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides with 3 layers of heavy-duty foil.

Finely grind the almonds, cracker crumbs, and sugar in a food processor.  Add the butter and process until moist crumbs form.  Press the almond mixture onto the bottom of the prepared pan (not on the sides of the pan).  Bake the crust until it is set and beginning to brown, about 12 minutes.  Cool.  Decrease the oven temperature to 325 degrees.

For the Filling:  Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese, mascarpone cheese, and sugar in a large bowl until smooth, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.  Beat in the lemon juice and vanilla.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating just until blended after each addition.

Pour the cheese mixture over the crust in the pan.  Place the springform pan in a large roasting pan.  Pour enough hot water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan.  Bake until the center of the cheesecake moves slightly when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour 5 minutes (the cake will become firm when it is cold).  Transfer the cake to a rack; cool for 1 hour.  Refrigerate until the cheesecake is cold, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.

For the Topping:  Combine the chocolate-hazelnut spread and cream in a small bowl.  Heat in the microwave until warm, stirring every 20 seconds to blend, about 1 minute.

Cut the cake into wedges.  Drizzle the chocolate sauce over the wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

For the Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Tightly wrap the outside of a 9-inch diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides with 3 layers of heavy-duty foil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Finely grind the almonds, cracker crumbs, and sugar in a food processor.  Add the butter and process until moist crumbs form.  Press the almond mixture onto the bottom of the prepared pan (not on the sides of the pan).  Bake the crust until it is set and beginning to brown, about 12 minutes.  Cool.  Decrease the oven temperature to 325 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Filling:  Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese, mascarpone cheese, and sugar in a large bowl until smooth, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.  Beat in the lemon juice and vanilla.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating just until blended after each addition.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the cheese mixture over the crust in the pan.  Place the springform pan in a large roasting pan.  Pour enough hot water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan.  Bake until the center of the cheesecake moves slightly when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour 5 minutes (the cake will become firm when it is cold).  Transfer the cake to a rack; cool for 1 hour.  Refrigerate until the cheesecake is cold, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Topping:  Combine the chocolate-hazelnut spread and cream in a small bowl.  Heat in the microwave until warm, stirring every 20 seconds to blend, about 1 minute.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut the cake into wedges.  Drizzle the chocolate sauce over the wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter - (about)
  10            slices  bacon
  2                     round 7"-dia loaves focaccia bread - -- (8 oz ea)
  1                cup  purchased pesto
  8             ounces  thinly-sliced turkey
  4             ounces  thinly-sliced provolone cheese

Whisk the eggs, cream, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until well blended.  Heat a 6-inch-diameter nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.  Brush the skillet with some butter.  Pour 1/4 cup of the egg mixture into the pan, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan evenly.  Cover and cook until the egg crepe is just set, about 1 minute and 30 seconds.  Invert the skillet over a plate, and allow the egg crepe to drop onto the plate.  Repeat to make 4 crepes total, brushing the skillet with melted butter as needed and stacking crepes on the plate.

Cook the bacon in a heavy large frying pan until crisp.  Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain.

Preheat a griddle or grill pan over medium-high heat.  Cut the focaccia horizontally in half.  Place the focaccia cut-side down on the griddle and cook until the focaccia is heated through and golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes.  Spread the pesto over the toasted sides of each halved focaccia.  Cover the bottom halves of the focaccia with the egg crepes, turkey, provolone and bacon, dividing equally.  Cover with the top halves of focaccia, pesto-side down.  Cut the sandwich into bite-size wedges.  Arrange the sandwiches on a platter and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                cup  canned chopped tomatoes in juice
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1              pound  uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             pieces  Homemade Pizza Dough - (4 oz ea) -- (see recipe)
                        = (or purchased pizza dough)
  3               cups  shredded mozzarella
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend for
                        egg wash
                        Extra-virgin olive oil

Heat the oil in a heavy large skillet over medium-low heat.  Add the garlic and saute until fragrant and tender, about 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, thyme, parsley, and wine.  Increase the heat to medium and simmer until most of the liquid evaporates, about 8 minutes.  In a small bowl, season the shrimp with salt and pepper.  Add the shrimp to the skillet and saute until just cooked through, about 2 minutes.  Set aside to cool in a small bowl.

Position 1 oven rack in the center and the second rack on the bottom of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees.

Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Roll out each piece of pizza dough into a 7-inch-diameter floured round.  Sprinkle half of the mozzarella over the lower half of each pizza dough, dividing equally and leaving a 1-inch border.  Spoon the shrimp mixture over the cheese.  Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the shrimp mixture.  Brush the edge of the dough with egg wash.  Fold the plain dough halves over the filling, forming half circles.  Pinch the edges of dough firmly together and crimp to seal.

Transfer the calzones to the 2 prepared sheets.  Bake until the calzones puff and become golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes.  Brush extra-virgin olive oil over calzones and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  thinly-sliced smoked mozzarella
  12            slices  whole-wheat bread
  18                    fresh large basil leaves
  8              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Olive oil -- for deep frying
  2               cups  all-purpose flour - (about)
  1                cup  purchased pesto

Divide half of the cheese equally among 6 bread slices.  Top with the basil leaves then the remaining cheese.  Cover with the remaining bread slices, pressing gently, to form 6 sandwiches.

Whisk the eggs, salt and pepper in a large bowl until well blended and frothy.  Place the flour in a medium bowl.  Add enough oil to a heavy large frying pan to come 1/2-inch up the sides of the pan.  Heat the oil over medium heat.

Dredge the sandwiches in the flour to coat lightly, then dredge them in the egg mixture to coat completely and place in the hot oil.  Cook until the cheese melts and the sandwiches are golden, about 3 minutes per side.  Cut the sandwiches into triangles.  Transfer the sandwiches to a platter and serve with the pesto.

This recipe yields 6 to 12 servings.

                        === BISCUITS ===
     1/4         pound  pancetta -- diced
  1                     box store bought biscuit mix - (8 oz)
                        Buttermilk - (in place of the liquid in
                        the boxed biscuit mix recipe)
     1/4           cup  shredded Fontina
                        === CINNAMON-SUGAR BUTTER ===
     1/2                vanilla bean

  1              pound  linguine
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILET ===
  1                     petite filet of beef - (4 to 6 oz)
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
                        == GORGONZOLA & PORCINI MUSHROOM SAUCE ==
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4         pound  dried porcini mushrooms - (abt 1 cup) -- soaked and strained
  1                     shallot -- sliced
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3             ounces  Gorgonzola - (abt 3 tbspns)
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard

For the beef:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Sprinkle both sides of the beef with salt and pepper.  Heat the olive oil in an oven-safe medium skillet over high heat.  When the oil is hot, carefully place the filet in the pan.  Cook until browned on both sides, about 3 to 4 minutes a side.  Transfer the steak to the oven and bake until a meat thermometer reads 130 degrees for medium-rare, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove the beef from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes.

For the sauce:  Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and the shallots and cook until golden brown and tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the thyme, white wine, salt, and pepper and continue to cook until all of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 more minutes.

Meanwhile, put the Gorgonzola, mayonnaise, and mustard in a food processor and combine until smooth.  Transfer the Gorgonzola mixture to the skillet with mushrooms and shallots.  Gently stir the cheese mixture into the mushroom mixture.

Slice the beef and serve topped with a dollop of the cheese sauce.  Reserve leftover sauce for another use.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  boiling water
  3        tablespoons  butter -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  salt -- plus
                        more for seasoning
     1/2           cup  quick-cooking polenta
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  8             ounces  cremini mushrooms -- chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper -- plus
                        more for seasoning
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     3/4           cup  dry Marsala
     1/2      teaspoon  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves

Bring the water, 1 tablespoon butter, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil in a heavy medium saucepan.  Gradually whisk in the polenta.  Reduce the heat to medium-low.  Stir constantly until the polenta thickens, about 5 minutes.  Pour the polenta into a greased 9- by 9-inch baking pan, spreading so that it is 1/3-inch thick.  Cover and let stand at room temperature until set, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a heavy large frying pan over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms and onion.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper and saute until the juices evaporate, about 8 minutes.  Add the garlic and saute until the mushrooms are golden brown, about 2 minutes longer.  Decrease the heat to medium-low.  Add the Marsala.  Cover and simmer until the Marsala has reduced by about half, about 5 minutes.

Stir the flour and remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a small bowl to form a paste, then stir the paste into the mushroom mixture.  Cover and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Stir the parsley into the ragu.  Season the ragu, to taste, with more salt and pepper.

Cut the polenta into 36 bite-size squares.  Arrange the polenta squares on a platter.  Spoon the warm ragu atop the polenta and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 36 bite-size hors d'oeuvres.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  panko (Japanese bread crumbs)
     1/2           cup  finely-grated Parmesan
  2              large  eggs
  6                     boneless pork loin chops -- pounded 1/3"-thick
                        = (abt 1 1/2 lbs total)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  6                     lemon wedges

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.

Coarsely crush the panko into a large shallow bowl.  Stir the cheese into the panko.  Lightly beat the eggs in another large shallow bowl.  Sprinkle the pork generously with salt and pepper.  Dip the pork, 1 piece at a time, in the egg, allowing the excess to drip off, then dredge the pork in the crumb mixture, patting to coat completely.  Place the pork on a small baking sheet.

Heat 1/4 cup of oil in a heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add half of the pork to the hot oil and cook until golden brown and just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to paper towels to drain, then transfer them to a clean baking sheet and keep them warm in the oven.  Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil to the skillet and fry the remaining pork.

Transfer the pork to plates and serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  whole milk ricotta cheese
     1/4           cup  mascarpone cheese
  1              large  egg yolk
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar -- plus
                        more for dusting
  8             ounces  frozen strawberries -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     2/3           cup  chocolate-hazelnut spread -- room temperature
                        = (Nutella recommended)
  3        tablespoons  whipping cream -- room temperature
  6             pieces  homemade pizza dough  - (2 oz ea) -- cold
                        = (or purchased pizza dough)
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend

Blend the ricotta, mascarpone, egg yolk, and powdered sugar in a food processor until smooth and creamy.  Transfer the ricotta mixture to a small bowl, then cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, blend the strawberries and 1 tablespoon of sugar in a clean food processor until smooth.  Transfer the strawberry sauce to a small bowl and set aside.

Whisk the chocolate-hazelnut spread and cream in a medium bowl to blend.

Position the oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Line a heavy large baking sheet with parchment paper.

Roll out each piece of pizza dough into a 7-inch-diameter round.  Spoon the ricotta mixture atop the center of the lower half of each pizza dough.  Spoon the chocolate-hazelnut mixture atop the cheese mixture.  Brush the lower edges of the dough with egg wash.  Fold the plain dough halves over the filling, forming half circles.  Pinch the edges of dough firmly together to seal.  Using a pastry wheel, trim the edges.  Transfer the calzones to the prepared baking sheet, spacing evenly.

Brush the tops of the calzones with more egg wash.  Bake until the calzones puff and become golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Transfer the baking sheet to a rack and cool for 15 minutes.  Transfer the calzones to plates and dust with the powdered sugar.  Drizzle the strawberry sauce around the calzones and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  honey
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2               cups  pancake and waffle mix

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  sweet Italian turkey sausage
  2                     red bell peppers -- sliced
  2                     yellow onions -- sliced
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1                cup  Marsala wine
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (15 oz)
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes -- (optional)
  4                     fresh Italian sandwich rolls - (to 6) -- optional

Heat the oil in a heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add the sausages and cook until brown on both sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.  Remove from the pan and drain.

Keeping the pan over medium heat, add the peppers, onions, salt, and pepper and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Add the oregano, basil, and garlic and cook 2 more minutes.

Add the tomato paste and stir.  Add the Marsala wine, tomatoes, and chili flakes, if using.  Stir to combine, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to release all the browned bits.  Bring to a simmer.

Cut the sausages into 4 to 6 pieces each, about 1-inch cubes.  Add the sausage back to the pan and stir to combine.  Cook until the sauce has thickened, about 20 minutes.

Serve in bowls.  Or, if serving as a sandwich, split the rolls in half lengthwise.  Hollow out the bread from the bottom side of each roll, being careful not to puncture the crust.  Fill the bottom half of the roll with sausage mixture.  Top and serve sandwiches immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.  Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring often, about 5 minutes.  Drain pasta.  (Alternatively, you can use dried pasta, which will take 8 to 10 minutes to cook.)

Toss the pasta, squash mixture, and butter in a large bowl until the liquid thickens slightly and coats the pasta.  Transfer the pasta mixture to a wide shallow bowl and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     boxes store-bought chocolate pudding mix
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              small  orange -- zested
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
                        === CANDIED ORANGE PEEL ===
  1              large  navel orange
     3/4           cup  sugar

Make the pudding according to the package instructions.  Add the cinnamon, orange zest, and red pepper flakes before chilling in a large trifle dish.  Before serving, sprinkle the top with chopped Candied Orange Peel.

For the Candied Orange Peel:  Using a vegetable peeler, cut the orange part of the peel from the stem end of the orange down to the navel end, forming long 3/4- to 1-inch-wide strips.  Bring a heavy small saucepan of water to a boil.  Add the peels and cook for 1 minute.  Drain and then rinse the peels under cold water.  Repeat cooking the peels in the saucepan with fresh boiling water and rinsing under cold water 2 more times.

Stir the sugar and 1/2 cup of fresh water in a heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves.  Bring to a boil.  Add the orange peels and simmer over medium-low heat until tender, about 15 minutes.  Using tongs, transfer the peels to a sheet of parchment paper to dry slightly, about 1 hour.  (Makes about 10 candied peels)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings (8 cups).

(The sauce can be made 1 week ahead.  Cool the sauce completely, then transfer it to a container and freeze for future use.  Bring the sauce to a simmer before using.)

Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring often, about 8 minutes.  Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid.  Add the pasta to the sauce and toss to coat, adding enough reserved cooking liquid to moisten as needed.  Serve with the Parmesan.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHECCA SAUCE ===
  1               pint  cherry tomatoes -- halved
                        = (abt 2 cups, or 12 oz)
  3                     scallions (white and pale green parts) -- coarsely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  8                     fresh basil leaves
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
                        ===LENTIL LOAF ===
     3/4           cup  lentils - (abt 5 oz)
  3               cups  reduced-sodium vegetable broth
  1                cup  uncooked short-grain brown rice -- rinsed well
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped white onion
     1/2           cup  shredded carrots
  1                     celery rib -- sliced
     1/2           cup  frozen corn kernels
  2        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  10            ounces  fresh baby spinach leaves - (abt 4 cups)
  1 1/2           cups  cubed whole milk mozzarella cheese -- divided
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- plus
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     tomato -- sliced

For the Checca Sauce:  Combine the cherry tomatoes, scallions, garlic, basil, and oil in a processor.  Pulse the tomatoes until they are coarsely chopped, being careful not to puree.  Set aside.  Season the sauce with salt and pepper.

For the Lentil Loaf:  Place the lentils in a large saucepan of cold water.  Bring the water just to a boil over high heat.  Carefully drain the boiling water and rinse the lentils.

Meanwhile, in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat, bring the broth to a boil.  Add the rice and return the liquid to a boil.  Decrease the heat to low, cover the rice, and gently simmer without stirring for 10 minutes.  Stir in the lentils, onion, carrot, and celery.  Cover and continue cooking without stirring until the rice and lentils are tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes longer.  Turn off the heat.  Sprinkle the corn over the rice and lentils and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.  Uncover and fluff the rice with a fork.  Cover and let stand for 5 more minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Spread 1 tablespoon of the butter over a 10- by 4 1/2- by 3-inch loaf pan.  In a heavy, large skillet, cook the spinach over medium heat until the spinach wilts, about 3 minutes.  Drain and squeeze the excess liquid from the spinach.  Transfer the spinach to a work surface and coarsely chop.

In a large bowl, gently mix the lentil mixture, spinach, 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese, eggs, 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, basil, salt, pepper, and half of the checca sauce.  Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan.  Arrange the sliced tomatoes in a row over the lentil mixture.  Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese and 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese.  Dot the top with the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter.

Bake uncovered until the loaf is heated through and the topping is melted and starting to brown, about 30 minutes.  Let cool for 15 minutes.  Slice the loaf into 2-inch slices, arrange on plates, and serve with the remaining checca sauce.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     vanilla bean
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  ground cinnamon
  1              stick  butter
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  4                     eggs
                        Olive oil -- for frying

Cut open the vanilla bean lengthwise.  Using the back of a knife, scrape along the inside of the vanilla bean to collect the seeds.  Scrape vanilla bean seeds into a small bowl.  Add the 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon and stir to combine.  Set aside.

In a medium saucepan combine the butter, salt, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and water over medium heat.  Bring to a boil.  Take pan off the heat and stir in the flour.  Return pan to the heat and stir continuously until mixture forms a ball, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Transfer the flour mixture to a medium bowl.  Using an electric hand mixer on low speed, add eggs, 1 at a time, incorporating each egg completely before adding the next.  Beat until smooth.  If not frying immediately, cover with plastic wrap and reserve in the refrigerator.

Meanwhile, pour enough oil into a large frying pan to reach a depth of 2 inches.  Heat the oil over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375 degrees.

Using a small ice-cream scooper or 2 small spoons, carefully drop about a tablespoon of the dough into the hot olive oil, frying in batches.  Turn the zeppole once or twice, cooking until golden and puffed up, about 5 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.  Toss with cinnamon-sugar.  Arrange on a platter and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.
