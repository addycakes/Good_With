  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Riblets -- as desired
                        === BARBEQUE SAUCE ===
  1                cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/2           cup  corn syrup
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
  2          teaspoons  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  2        tablespoons  molasses
  2          teaspoons  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     1/4      teaspoon  liquid smoke flavor

Combine all Barbeque Sauce ingredients in saucepan and simmer for 20 minutes.

Riblet (Rib) Preparation:  For rib tips ("riblets") and full racks, first season ribs with salt, pepper and garlic to taste.  Then, sear the ribs on the grill/broiler until both sides are mahogany in color and the meat has begun to pull away from the bone (155 degrees internal temperature).

Place ribs on rack in deep pan/roaster.  Cover bottom of pan with mixture of water and liquid smoke flavoring (4:1 ratio of water to liquid smoke) without mixture touching the ribs (it will make them bitter).  Seal tightly with two layers of foil wrap to cover.

Slow cook in 275 degree oven until meat is tender.  Time varies with how many ribs are being cooked, pan used and your oven temperature.  Plan on anywhere from two to five hours, but check to be sure.  The slower, the better for this process.  Just make sure an internal food temperature of 155 degrees is maintained.  (To moderate cooking for small amounts of ribs, try covering ribs with chopped onions, peppers and tomatoes.  This also keeps them moist and adds a nice flavor).

When ribs are fully cooked and tender, remove from oven and finish off on grill/broiler until marrow in the bone tips "sizzles."  Brush with Honey Barbeque Sauce just before removing for service.

Serve with your favorite side dishes.  Applebee's serves their ribs with French fries, coleslaw and their special honey barbeque baked beans.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     boneless skinless chicken breasts -- (6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
  1                cup  flour
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  white wine
  4              large  lemons
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter -- softened
                        A small handful drained capers

Cut three lemons in half and use for fresh lemon juice.  Pour the juice through a fine strainer.  Cut the last lemon into wedges for garnish.

Begin to heat the olive oil in a 12-inch saut√à pan on medium-high heat.  While oil is getting hot, lightly season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt.  Lightly dust the chicken breasts in the flour.  Shake off excess flour.  Place chicken in the saut√à pan skin-side down.

When the chicken is golden brown, turn over and brown the other side as well.  It is important to brown both sides to insure the chicken is completely cooked through.  When both sides are nice and brown, add white wine and lemon juice.  Continue to cook for approximately two to three minutes.  The liquid should reduce approximately half.

Once the liquid is reduced, remove the chicken breasts from the pan and turn off heat.  Check to make sure the chicken breasts are cooked by turning each piece of chicken over and cutting it halfway through with a knife.  There should be no visible pink.  If the chicken is not completely cooked through, place in a 400 degree oven for five minutes to complete cooking.

Finish the sauce by placing the softened butter in the pan.  Using rubber spatula, work the butter into the sauce as it melts.  Pour sauce directly on top of chicken breasts.  Garnish with capers and lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     manicotti shells
                        === BECHAMEL SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

  2                     eggs
  12            ounces  ricotta cheese
     1/2           cup  shredded mozzarella cheese
     1/2           cup  shredded provolone cheese
     1/4           cup  grated Romano cheese
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf Italian parsley
                        === EGGPLANT PARMIGIANA ===
  1                     eggplant
  6                     eggs
     1/2           cup  milk
                        Flour -- as needed
                        Breadcrumb Mixture - (3 parts seasoned
                        breadcrumbs plus 1 part Romano cheese)
                        Olive oil -- for frying
                        Marinara sauce -- as needed
                        Bruschetta Mixture - (diced Roma tomatoes
                        diced onion, chopped garlic, fresh basil,
                        olive oil, and seasoned to taste)
                        Shredded provolone -- as needed
                        === FOR SERVING ===
  1               pint  marinara sauce
                        Chopped fresh flat-leaf Italian parsley

First make the B√àchamel Sauce:  Make a roux with butter and flour in a small saut√à pan.  Melt the butter over medium heat and add the flour.  Incorporate completely cooking for five minutes over medium heat.  Meanwhile, bring milk to a simmer in a sauce pan.  When the milk has come to a simmer, add salt, a dash of white pepper and a dash of ground nutmeg.  Add the roux.  Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for ten minutes.  Set aside.

Manicotti Filling:  Crack two eggs in a bowl.  Whip lightly.  Mix in ricotta cheese, mozzarella and provolone cheeses, Romano cheese, salt and parsley.

Manicotti shells:  Purchase manicotti shells, preferably imported Italian, at the store.  Prepare four shells according to package direction, subtracting two minutes of the recommended cooking time.  Remove pasta from boiling water and place shells in ice water until completely cold.

Fill the Manicotti shells:  Use a pastry bag fill the pasta shells with the manicotti filling.  Cover the bottom of a small casserole dish with marinara sauce.

Place the four stuffed manicotti on top of the marinara sauce.  Using a tablespoon cover the manicotti with the B√àchamel Sauce.  Sprinkle lightly with Romano cheese.  Bake at 425 degrees, uncovered, for 25 minutes, or until golden brown.

While the manicotti is baking, prepare your Eggplant Parmigiana.  Cut the top end (the stem) off of the eggplant and slice the eggplant lengthwise so that the slices are approximtely 1/4-inch thick.  Do not use the first or last slice.  You will want to retain the skin edging of the remaining slices.

Next, make an egg wash with six eggs and 1/2 cup of milk, lightly whip until incorporated.  Lightly flour the sliced eggplant, then dip the eggplant in the egg wash and cover completely with the bread crumb mixture.

Fill a saut√à pan with a 1/2 inch of olive oil; fry the eggplant on medium-high heat.  When the fried eggplant is golden brown, remove and place on a cooling rack.  Note: Place paper towel underneath the cooling rack.

Place six slices of cooled, fried eggplant on a baking sheet.  Top each slice with one ounce of marinara sauce, a small handful of Bruschetta Mixture, and shredded provolone cheese.  Bake in a 450 degree oven until the cheese melts.

When the eggplant is done remove from the oven.  Using a spatula stack the slices into two stacks of three slices each.

Take a large 15-inch serving platter, cover the bottom of the dish with approximately one pint of hot marinara sauce.  Using a spatula carefully remove the manicotti from the casserole dish and place on one half of the plate.  On the other half of the plate arrange the two stacks of eggplant parmigiana.  Garnish the manicotti with fresh chopped Italian parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings (four manicotti shells and two stacks of eggplant parmigiana).

<DirT>
First make the B√àchamel Sauce:  Make a roux with butter and flour in a small saut√à pan.  Melt the butter over medium heat and add the flour.  Incorporate completely cooking for five minutes over medium heat.  Meanwhile, bring milk to a simmer in a sauce pan.  When the milk has come to a simmer, add salt, a dash of white pepper and a dash of ground nutmeg.  Add the roux.  Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for ten minutes.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Manicotti Filling:  Crack two eggs in a bowl.  Whip lightly.  Mix in ricotta cheese, mozzarella and provolone cheeses, Romano cheese, salt and parsley.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Manicotti shells:  Purchase manicotti shells, preferably imported Italian, at the store.  Prepare four shells according to package direction, subtracting two minutes of the recommended cooking time.  Remove pasta from boiling water and place shells in ice water until completely cold.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill the Manicotti shells:  Use a pastry bag fill the pasta shells with the manicotti filling.  Cover the bottom of a small casserole dish with marinara sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the four stuffed manicotti on top of the marinara sauce.  Using a tablespoon cover the manicotti with the B√àchamel Sauce.  Sprinkle lightly with Romano cheese.  Bake at 425 degrees, uncovered, for 25 minutes, or until golden brown.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the manicotti is baking, prepare your Eggplant Parmigiana.  Cut the top end (the stem) off of the eggplant and slice the eggplant lengthwise so that the slices are approximtely 1/4-inch thick.  Do not use the first or last slice.  You will want to retain the skin edging of the remaining slices.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Next, make an egg wash with six eggs and 1/2 cup of milk, lightly whip until incorporated.  Lightly flour the sliced eggplant, then dip the eggplant in the egg wash and cover completely with the bread crumb mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill a saut√à pan with a 1/2 inch of olive oil; fry the eggplant on medium-high heat.  When the fried eggplant is golden brown, remove and place on a cooling rack.  Note: Place paper towel underneath the cooling rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place six slices of cooled, fried eggplant on a baking sheet.  Top each slice with one ounce of marinara sauce, a small handful of Bruschetta Mixture, and shredded provolone cheese.  Bake in a 450 degree oven until the cheese melts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the eggplant is done remove from the oven.  Using a spatula stack the slices into two stacks of three slices each.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  beef tenderloin or sirloin tip
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              large  red onion -- chopped
     1/2         pound  white mushrooms -- sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  capers
  1           teaspoon  oregano
     1/3           cup  sherry
                        === MARINARA SAUCE ===
  1                can  tomato sauce - (15 oz)
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  1                     minced garlic clove
  1           teaspoon  basil
  1           teaspoon  oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  beef broth - (to 1/3) -- if available
                        === GARLIC MASHED POTATOES ===
  8                     red-skinned potatoes -- cut into quarters
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  2          teaspoons  salt
  4        tablespoons  butter
     3/4           cup  milk or potato cooking water

Cut meat into 4 serving pieces.  Season pieces with salt and pepper.

In a large saut√à pan, heat olive oil on medium-high until it shimmers.  Add meat; brown about 3 minutes on both sides and remove from the pan.  Lower heat to medium, add onions and mushrooms and cook slowly for about 4 minutes, or until the onions are translucent.  Add garlic, capers and oregano and cook 1 minute more.

Raise heat to medium-high and pour the sherry into the pan to loosen juices that stick to the pan during cooking.  Bring sherry to a boil, add Marinara Sauce to the pan and simmer uncovered for about 5 minutes, or until sauce is thickened.  Return beef to the pan and heat thoroughly.

Marinara Sauce:  Combine ingredients in small saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer gently, uncovered, 10 minutes.  (Makes 2 cups)  Leftover tomato paste can be frozen.   Place in ice cube tray in 1- or 2-tablespoon amounts.  When frozen, pop out and freeze in plastic bag or container suitable for freezer.

Garlic Mashed Potatoes:  Boil potatoes, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt in enough water to cover the potatoes.  Drain, reserving water if you prefer.  Remove garlic cloves and discard.  Smash potatoes, butter and milk together with a large fork until fluffy.  The dish should not be smooth and creamy -- you want a thick, homey texture.  Otherwise, the marinara sauce will merge with the potatoes, making a runny mess.  Season to taste with remaining salt.  (Makes about 3 cups)

Mound the Garlic Mashed Potatoes on platter, pour Marinara Sauce over and then top with beef.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Remove mussels and set aside.  Reduce the sauce by half.  Toss cooked pasta in with the sauce and mound onto a large plate.  Place mussels around the outside of the pasta.  Garnish with lemon wedges and serve to impressed guests.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Southern Italians, surrounded by coastline, love to cook seafood.  This dish features the "fruit of the sea" -- including clams, squid and mussels -- tossed with linguini in a spicy marinara sauce.  This dish is guaranteed to turn heads and fill the room with its robustly spicy aroma.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  Calamata olives -- pitted
  2             ounces  white wine
  2                     lemon wedges
  4             ounces  bruschetta mixture

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3         pound  ground beef
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  sesame seed bun
  3          teaspoons  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  mustard
  2          teaspoons  ketchup
  2             slices  American cheese
  3                     bread and butter pickle slices - (to 4)
                        Iceberg lettuce -- as needed
  2              large  tomato slices
  4                     red onion rings - (to 5)

Preheat barbecue or indoor grill to medium heat.  Form the ground beef into a patty with a slightly larger diameter than the sesame seed bun.  Grill the burger on the grill for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until done.  Be sure to generously salt and pepper each side of the patty.

While the patty grills, brown the faces of the bun in a hot skillet over medium heat.  After the buns have browned, spread about 1 1/2 teaspoons of mayonnaise on the face of the top bun, as well as on the bottom bun.

Spread 1 teaspoon of mustard on the face of the top bun, followed by 2 teaspoons of ketchup.

Arrange 3 or 4 bread & butter pickles slices on the bottom bun.  Arrange lettuce on pickles followed by the tomato slices and red onion.

When the beef is cooked arrange two slices of American cheese on the patty, let it melt a bit, then place the top bun on the cheese and scoop up the whole thing with a spatula and place it on the bottom half of the burger.

This recipe yields 1 hamburger.

Comments:  This west coast chain came up with a great idea: clone the type of burger you'd get at Chili's or T.G.I. Friday's for around six bucks, but sell it for just $3.95.  It's 1/3-pound of ground beef stacked on top of plenty of fixings including red onion and those sweet tasting bread & butter pickle slices.  And check this out: cloning your own six dollar burger at home will cost you less than 2 bucks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  Extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2         pound  Italian sausage
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onion
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- 1/4" julienne
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  4               cups  finely-chopped canned whole peeled
                        tomatoes -- with their juice
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  crushed red pepper
  2        tablespoons  freshly-torn basil leaves
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated pecorino romano cheese
  4             ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
  1              pound  papardelle pasta

Remove sausage from the casing and break into coarse pieces (about 5 to 6 pieces from each link).  Put olive oil in a large skillet over a medium flame.  Add sausage and cook until the sausage has browned slightly.  Add onion and red bell peppers and cook until they soften and onion turns a rich golden color.  Add the wine and let evaporate for 3 minutes.  Add garlic, and cook 1 minute more.

Add the tomatoes and season lightly with salt and pepper and crushed red pepper flakes.  Raise heat and bring sauce to a boil, stirring frequently.  Reduce heat and let simmer until the sauce has thickened.  Stir in basil and set sauce aside.

Meanwhile bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot, add 1 tablespoon of salt and drop in the pasta all at once, stirring well.

When the pasta is almost done, return the skillet with the sauce to a medium heat.  When the pasta is al dente, drain it and toss it with the sauce, adding the grated cheese and tossing again.  Place the pasta in a serving platter and top with the crumbled goat cheese.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 entree or 6 appetizer servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === EGG ROLLS ===
  1              large  avocado
  2        tablespoons  chopped oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  minced red onion
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh cilantro
  1              pinch  salt
  3                     eggroll wrappers
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  cashew nuts -- chopped
     2/3           cup  fresh cilantro
  2                     garlic cloves -- quartered
  2                     green onions -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  cumin
  4          teaspoons  white vinegar
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  tamarind pulp
     1/2           cup  honey
  1              pinch  ground saffron
     1/4           cup  olive oil

Peel avocado, remove pit and dice into bite-size pieces.  Gently combine avocado with the tomatoes, red onion, 1/2 teaspoon cilantro, and pinch of salt.  Be careful not to smash the avocado.

Spoon 1/3 of the filling into an eggroll wrapper.  With wrapper positioned so that one corner is pointing toward you, place the filling about 1 inch from the bottom corner and 1 inch from each side.  Roll the bottom corner up over the filling, then roll the filling up to about the middle of the wrapper.  Brush the remaining corners and edges of the wrapper with the beaten egg.  Fold the left and right corners over the filling and "glue" the corners to the wrapper.  Finish by rolling the wrapper and filling up over the top corner.  Press on the wrapper to ensure it is sealed.  Repeat with the remaining two eggrolls and keep them covered in the refrigerator while you make dipping sauce.

For Dipping Sauce:  Combine cashews, cilantro, garlic, green onions, sugar, black pepper and cumin in a food processor or blender.  Blend with short bursts until the mixture is well blended.  The cashews and garlic must be well chopped.  They should be about half the size of a grain of rice.

Combine the vinegars, honey, tamarind and saffron in a small bowl.  Heat mixture for about 1 minute in microwave and stir until tamarind pulp dissolves completely.  Pour tamarind mixture into blender or food processor with the cashew mixture and mix with short bursts until well combined (about 20 seconds).  Pour blended sauce into small bowl and add oil.  Stir by hand.  Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving.

Heat oil in a deep fryer or a deep pan over medium heat.  You want the oil to be deep enough to cover the eggrolls.  When oil is hot, fry eggrolls for 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels.

When eggrolls can be safely touched, slice once diagonally across middle of each one and serve them arranged around a small bowl of the dipping sauce.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  tamarind pulp
     1/2           cup  honey
  1              pinch  ground saffron
     1/4           cup  olive oil

Combine cashews, cilantro, garlic, green onions, sugar, black pepper and cumin in a food processor or blender.  Blend with short bursts until the mixture is well blended.  The cashews and garlic must be well chopped.  They should be about half the size of a grain of rice.

Combine the vinegars, honey, tamarind and saffron in a small bowl.  Heat mixture for about 1 minute in microwave and stir until tamarind pulp dissolves completely.  Pour tamarind mixture into blender or food processor with the cashew mixture and mix with short bursts until well combined (about 20 seconds).  Pour blended sauce into small bowl and add oil.  Stir by hand.  Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped pecans
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped almonds
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped walnuts
     3/4           cup  graham cracker crumbs
  2        tablespoons  melted butter
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2         pounds  cream cheese -- room temperature
  1 1/3           cups  sugar -- room temperature
  5              large  eggs -- room temperature
  16            ounces  sour cream -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  flour
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice -- room temperature

Crust:  Mix all nuts and crumbs together with melted butter.  Spread in bottom and 1 inch up sides of 9-inch springform pan that has been sprayed or coated with butter.  Set aside.

Filling:  These ingredients MUST be at room temperature.  Beat the cream cheese until light and fluffy.  Add the sugar a little at a time and continue beating until creamy.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each.  Add the flour, vanilla, lemon juice and beat well.  Add the sour cream and beat well.

Pour mixture into pan and place in the middle of a 325 degree preheated oven for 1 hour 15 minutes.  When time is up, turn oven off and prop open the door and leave cheesecake in oven for 1 hour.

Remove from oven and continue to cool completely before refrigerating for 24 hours.  The wait is well worth it -- the flavors ripen beautifully.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheesecake                      Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  graham cracker crumbs
  5        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- softened
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1                cup  canned pumpkin
  3                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  allspice
                        Whipped cream -- as desired

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Make the crust by combining the graham cracker crumbs with the melted butter and 1 tablespoon sugar in a medium bowl.  Stir well enough to coat all of the crumbs with the butter, but not so much as to turn the mixture into paste.  Keep it crumbly.

Press the crumbs onto the bottom and about two-thirds of the way up the sides of a springform pan.  You don't want the crust to form all of the way up the back of each slice of cheesecake.  Bake the crust for 5 minutes, then set it aside until you are ready to fill it.

In a large mixing bowl combine the cream cheese, 1 cup sugar, and vanilla.  Mix with an electric mixer until smooth.  Add the pumpkin, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice and continue to beat until smooth and creamy.

Pour the filling into the pan.  Bake for 60 to 70 minutes.  The top will turn a bit darker at this point.  Remove from the oven and allow the cheesecake to cool.  When the cheesecake has come to room temperature, put it into the refrigerator.

When the cheesecake has chilled, remove the pan sides and cut the cake into 8 equal pieces.  Use dental floss to make a clean cut.  Serve with a generous portion of whipped cream on top.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  4        tablespoons  butter
     3/4           cup  graham cracker crumbs
     1/2           cup  crushed gingersnaps
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
                        = (or your favorite substitute)
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  heavy cream -- chilled
  24            ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  mashed pumpkin
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     3/4      teaspoon  powdered ginger
     3/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4           cup  pecan halves

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees, or 300 degrees in convection oven.

To make the crust:  Place the butter in a small saucepan and melt over moderate heat.  Mix the graham cracker crumbs, gingersnaps, brown sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl.  Add the melted butter and mix together with a fork.

Line bottom and side of 10-inch springform pan with parchment or wax paper.  Spray with nonstick pan spray.  Press the crumb mixture into the bottom.

Filling:  Pour the heavy cream into a medium bowl and beat just until soft peaks form.  Refrigerate.

Beat the cream cheese (in large bowl)with an electric mixer until fluffy.   Gradually add the sugar, beating well.  Add the eggs one at a time, and beat the mixture until it is fluffy and pale.  Stir in the pumpkin, cinnamon, ginger and cloves.

Remove the whipped cream from the refrigerator and whisk lightly to re-blend.  Using a spatula or flat spoon, fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese-pumpkin mixture.  Pour the mixture into the prepared crust.  Wrap one continuous sheet of aluminum foil around the springform pan and press firmly.

Put wrapped pan in a baking pan and fill with hot water halfway up the springform pan.  Bake for 60 to 70 minutes.  Cool the cheesecake to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 3 hours to chill thoroughly.

Remove the sides of the springform pan.  Just before serving, place the pecan halves on top of the cheesecake, in a ring around the edges, to garnish.

  2             pounds  all-purpose flour -- plus
  4             ounces  all-purpose flour
  5             ounces  sugar
  2 1/2         ounces  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  salt
  14            ounces  butter
  1               pint  cream
  1               pint  buttermilk
                        === PER SERVING ===
  2             scoops  vanilla ice cream

Sugared Strawberries:  Wash and drain strawberries.  Slice strawberries, cutting from the tip to the base.  Place sugar evenly over strawberries.  Gently mix the sugar into the strawberries, ensuring that all strawberries are covered with sugar.  Let chill for 2 hours.

Whipped Cream:  Combine ingredients in stainless steel bowl.  Whip to stiff peaks.

Shortcake Biscuits:  Mix flour, sugar, baking powder and salt thoroughly in a 6-quart stainless steel bowl.  Cut in butter until mixture appears mealy and crumbly.  Add cream and buttermilk, mix gently for 20 to 30 seconds.  Don't over mix, it will become sticky.  Lightly flour work surface, place dough out to approximately 1/2-inch thick.  Cut 4 to 6 ounces per round, place on non-stick baking pan, approximately 2 to 3 inches apart.  The biscuits will triple in size.  Bake at 375 degrees for approximately 15 minutes.

To serve:  Cut the biscuit in half horizontally, separating the top from the bottom half.  Place the bottom half of the biscuit in a medium bowl.  Cover the biscuit bottom with 4 ounces of strawberry mixture.  Place two scoops of vanilla ice cream in the center of the biscuit bottom.  Place the remaining biscuit half on top of the ice cream.  Pour 4 additional ounces of the  strawberry mixture over the biscuit top to moisten it, allowing some of the berries to fall into the bowl.  Finish with a dollop of whipped cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     portobello mushroom cap - (5" to 6" dia) -- stem removed
  1 1/4         ounces  canola oil
     1/8      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  savory herb mix
  7             ounces  angel hair pasta
  2             ounces  olive oil blend
  1         tablespoon  minced blanched garlic
  1         tablespoon  shallots -- minced
  1              ounce  shiitake mushrooms - (to 1 1/2) -- sliced 1/4" by 2"
  4             ounces  marsala wine
  1              ounce  cream
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  fresh parsley -- chopped
     1/2         ounce  Parmesan/Romano mix
  1              ounce  butter
     1/4         ounce  Parmesan/Romano mix
  1 1/2      teaspoons  balsamic glaze

Carefully make a series of thin incisions ("gill like slits") evenly across the top of the mushroom cap (approximately 4 to 6).  Brush canola oil on both sides of the mushroom cap.  Place mushroom, stem-side down, onto the charbroiler and cook for 1 minute.  Turn the mushroom 45 degrees and repeat to "mark" and prevent burning.  Continue to cook for 1 more minute.

Turn the mushroom over, season with salt and pepper and fresh herbs.  Cook for another minute, then rotate 45 degrees and repeat the "marking" process.  Cook the mushroom until it is hot throughout and soft to the touch.  When the mushroom is done, cut into 1/4- by 2-inch strips.

Cook angel hair pasta until "al dente" then drain well.

In a saute pan, heat olive oil to a "sizzle".  Add garlic and shallots and toss.  Add the  shiitake mushrooms, regular mushrooms and salt and pepper.  Toss and cook until mushrooms are tender and heated through.  Add marsala wine, cream, thyme, parsley and Parmesan/Romano mix to the mushroom mix.  Stir to incorporate.  When the sauce has slightly thickened, swirl in the butter.

Add pasta and toss.  Place pasta in a bowl.  Sprinkle parmesan/romano mix over the pasta.  Mound the mushroom slices (centered) on top of the pasta.  Drizzle the balsamic glaze over the pasta and Portobello mushroom slices.  Garnish with chopped parsley, sprinkled evenly over the pasta Portobello mushroom slices.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SUGARED PECANS ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  oil
  2             ounces  pecan pieces
  4        tablespoons  sugar
                        === PLUMPED RAISINS ===
     1/3           cup  raisins
  1                cup  boiling water
     1/2           cup  packaged shredded coconut
                        === DUMPLINGS ===
  6               cups  water
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3               cups  Bisquick baking mix
  1                cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)

Sugared Pecans:  In small skillet combine butter and oil over medium-low heat; add pecan pieces.  Stir only till heated and barely bubbly.  Sprinkle with sugar.  Stir briskly only till sugar dissolves, on low heat, AS THESE BURN QUICKLY!  Work fast.  Dump them into paper towel-lined plate.  Spread out to cool while you prepare the rest.

Plumped Raisins:  In small saucepan combine raisins and boiling water.  Cover pan with lid 20 minutes.  Drain and discard water.  Add shredded coconut to raisins.  Set aside.

Dumplings:  In Dutch oven combine water and 1/2 cup sugar.  Bring to boil.  While you wait for that to boil, combine in medium bowl, Bisquick, milk, 1 tablespoon sugar, stirring with fork to moisten thick dough.

When water comes to boil, drop dough by rounded tablespoonful into boiling water, making about 14 dumplings.  Cover pan with lid.  Simmer dumplings very gently 20 minutes.  Uncover and let cook another 10 minutes gently.  Baste often in the liquid, which is now becoming thickened and creamy looking.  Remove pan from heat.  With slotted spoon remove HALF of dumplings to greased 8-inch square baking dish.  Sprinkle with pecans and raisins/coconut.  Arrange rest of dumplings over that.  Set aside.  Make sauce next.

Caramel Sauce:  Strain remaining liquid into heavy 2 1/2-quart saucepan.  Bring to boil.  Stir constantly.  Add light brown sugar, stirring vigorously over medium-heat until it boils briskly, 2 or 3 minutes, or until sugar is completely dissolved and sauce drops from spoon in large drops rather than like water.  It should be the consistency of smooth gravy.

Spoon sauce over dumplings filling dish right to the rim.  Cool 15 minutes.  Cover; refrigerate to serve within few days.  Microwave warm servings or use cold with a scoop of ice cream on top of each.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                      Kraft's Stove-Top Stuffing Mix

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Stuffings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  minced fresh celery
  4             slices  white bread - (to 5)
  3             slices  wheat bread - (to 4)
  3                     chicken bouillon cubes -- crushed
  2          teaspoons  dried chopped onions
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried parsley
     1/8      teaspoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  onion powder
                        === TO MAKE STUFFING ===
  1 2/3           cups  water
     1/4           cup  margarine

Arrange the celery pieces on a plate and set the plate in a warm place -- a sunny window is best -- for 24 hours or until the celery is thoroughly dry.  This is the best way to dry the tiny pieces of celery for the instant stuffing mix.  You must be sure to remove all moisture from the celery.  You should end up with 2 teaspoons of dried celery for every 1/3 cup of freshly minced.

Prepare bread crumbs by stacking the bread slices on top of each other and squishing them down flat with the palms of your hands.  This will create denser bread crumbs that will not become soggy and pasty when cooking.  Use a sharp knife to dice the bread into little pieces.  You should have about 2 1/2 cups of white bread and 1 1/2 cups of wheat for a total of around 4 cups of bread.

Preheat oven to 250 degrees.  Spread the bread crumbs on a cookie sheet.  Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until bread is completely dry.  You should now have around 2 2/3 cups of dry bread crumbs.

To make the vegetable/seasoning mix, combine the dried celery with chicken bouillon powder, onions, parsley, sugar, and onion powder in a small bowl.  You now have a stuffing kit that can be sealed up and stored in a dry place until you are ready to use it.

To make the stuffing, mix the vegetable/seasoning mix with 1 2/3 cups water in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.  Stir in the bread crumbs, cover, and remove from heat.  Let stuffing stand 5 to 7 minutes.  Fluff it with a fork before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This recipe clones the common 6-ounce box of Stove Top stuffing mix you find in any grocery store.  This secret formula duplicates the chicken variety, the brand's most popular version.  You know, it's nice to be able to make as much of this as you want prior to the holiday crunch and just keep it sealed up in the pantry until you're ready to use it.  Besides, you have enough to worry about deciding which fruits to use in the Jell-O mold.  When it's time to cook, it's just a matter of adding some water and margarine, and in 10 easy minutes the stuff is all ready to go up a turkey's backside.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  red apples -- diced
     1/8           cup  celery -- diced
     1/2         pound  button mushrooms -- sliced thin
     1/4         pound  raw bacon -- diced
  1              pound  day-old seven-grain bread -- diced
  3               cups  chicken broth
  2         tablespoon  minced oregano

Place all but 1 teaspoon butter into a skillet.  Add the onions, garlic, apples, and celery.   Cook over medium heat, stirring while the onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and bacon and simmer until the mushrooms have released some of their liquid and the bacon is cooked (3 to 4 minutes).

With the remaining tablespoon of butter, coat a medium-sized baking pan, and place the stuffing in it.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake until the stuffing is soft (about 35 minutes).

Remove the foil and continue baking until the stuffing is crisp and golden on top (another 10 minutes).  Remove from oven and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

              Logan's Texas Roadhouse's Buttery Dinner Rolls

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  2           packages  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz ea)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  nonfat dry milk
  1 1/4           cups  warm water -- (105 to 115 deg)
  1              large  egg -- slightly beaten
  8        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  2        tablespoons  butter-flavored vegetable shortening

Place 2 cups flour in a large mixing bowl.  Add yeast, salt, sugar and dry milk.  Set aside.

In a mixing bowl, combine water and egg and stir to blend.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.  Pour water mixture into well.  Mix by hand, beating 150 strokes and frequently scraping bottom and sides of bowl.

Add half of the melted butter and beat to incorporate.  Add remaining flour, about 1/3 cup at a time, beating to incorporate each addition.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap.  Set dough in a warm, draft-free place such as oven with pan of hottest tap water on rack below.  Allow batter to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Coat cups, bottoms and sides of a 12-cup muffin pan (or two small round pans) with butter-flavored vegetable shortening.  Punch down batter (batter will be extremely soft and sticky).  Drop by hand or spoonful into prepared muffin pan cups to make 12 rolls (if in pan, each roll touching the next).  Brush dough with half of the remaining melted butter.  Let rise, uncovered, in warm, draft-free place until almost doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes.

In preheated 400 degree oven, bake rolls on middle rack 16 to 18 minutes.  Brush tops of cooked rolls with remaining melted butter.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Logan's dinner rolls, prepared in huge quantities using commercial products, are difficult to duplicate, so taste and texture may vary slightly in this scaled-down recipe adapted for home cooks.  Still, this recipe is speed-scratch fabulous.

  1 1/2         pounds  granulated sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Sift flour, baking soda, cocoa powder and sugar so there are no lumps and texture is smooth.

Make sure that brewed coffee is at room temp and not warm.  This will prevent a reaction with the baking soda.  Mix ingredients, but do not over mix.

Restaurant manager could not advise on the cooking time as they make this commercially, but said to use a toothpick to check doneness and make allowances for different oven usage.

Frosting is a Ganache Frosting; the ingredients are heavy cream and semisweet cocoa or use any good Ganache Frosting recipe.

As far as the presentation of the cake, drizzle frosting on the plate, place the square of cake on the frosting and top with a mint leaf.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Pies


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  butter -- softened
     1/4           cup  shortening
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg yolk
  2        tablespoons  ice water
                        === FILLING ===
  2                     eggs
  1                can  pumpkin - (15 oz)
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves -- plus
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
     3/4           cup  whole milk

Prepare the crust by beating together the butter and shortening until smooth and creamy.  Chill until firm.

Sift together the flour, sugar and salt in a medium bowl.  Using a fork, cut the chilled butter and shortening into the dry ingredients, until the mixture has a consistent texture.  Mix egg yolk and ice water into the dough then form it into a ball.

Roll dough flat on a floured surface and line a 9-inch pie pan.

Prepare filling by beating two eggs.  Add pumpkin and stir well to combine.  Combine sugars, cinnamon, ginger and cloves in a small bowl.  Stir spice mixture into the pumpkin.  Stir in milk until well blended.

Pour filling into pie shell.  Bake in a preheated 425 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350 degrees and bake for another 45 to 55 minutes or until the edge of the pie and the crust is turning light brown.  Slice into 6 pieces to serve restaurant-size portions.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The vittles from Marie Callender's have made an impression beyond the chain's west coast roots with home style packaged entrees and side dishes available in frozen food sections of supermarkets across the country.  But pie-making is where the chain excels.  A fresh slice of Marie Callender's is a close as you'll get to homemade heaven this side of grandma's porch window.  This clone was an obvious selection, since the restaurant sells more pumpkin pies than any other, even in non-holiday months.

                      P. F. Chang's Temple Longbeans

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  Chinese longbeans - (6 to 8 oz) -- cut 3" lengths
  4             ounces  five-spice pressed tofu -- cut thin slices
     1/2           cup  finely-julienned carrot
  1                cup  Chinese yellow chives in 3" lengths
                        === TEMPLE SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  vegetarian oyster sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  soy sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar - (to 1/2)
     1/2           cup  hot water
  2          teaspoons  canola oil
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cold water
                        Several drops Japanese sesame oil -- (optional)

Separately blanch the longbeans and carrots until tender-crisp in plain boiling water.  Drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking.  Drain again.

Combine the Temple Sauce ingredients.  Taste and adjust the soy sauce and sugar to your liking.

Heat a wok or wide skillet over high heat until hot.  Add the canola oil, swirl to glaze the pan.  Then add the longbeans, carrots and tofu.  Stir-fry until hot, about 2 minutes.

Stir the sauce and add it to the pan.  Bring it to a simmer, tossing to bathe the veggies.  Stir the cornstarch mixture to recombine and add it to the pan.  Stir until the sauce turns glossy, about 10 seconds.  Shower in the chives, stir to blend, then turn off the heat.  Add the sesame oil and toss to mix.  Serve with steamed rice.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Comments:  This simple stir-fry of Chinese longbeans in a vegetarian oyster sauce is true to the spirit of Chinese Buddhist cuisine, hence the name, "Temple Longbeans."

Pressed five-spice tofu, vacuum-packed and with the consistency of a firm cheese, is sold in the refrigerator cases of many Asian groceries.  If you cannot find it or the fragrant Chinese yellow chives, simply double the amount of longbeans.  String beans can also be substituted for the longbeans.

                Rocky Point Amusement Park's Clam Chowder

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 20    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  ground or finely-diced salt pork
  1              pound  onions
  1             gallon  clam juice
  1              pound  potatoes -- diced
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  2               cups  canned tomato puree
  1 1/2         quarts  chopped quahogs (large hard-shell clams)
                        Water -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Pilot crackers -- crumbled

In a large dutch oven, heat the salt pork until the fat melts.  Add the onions.  Cook over gentle heat until very soft.

Add the clam juice, potatoes, seasonings, tomato puree and a little water.  Simmer until the potatoes are soft, then add the quahogs.  Heat and taste for seasoning.  Add water if needed.  It is best to use old, not new, potatoes, because they thicken the chowder with their starch.

Crush some pilot crackers and stir them into the chowder to thicken it further, near the end of the cooking.  Happy Eating.

This recipe makes about 20 (8-oz) servings.

Comments:  In the 1920s and 1930s, there was a large and very popular amusement park located on Narragansett Bay in Warwick, Rhode Island.  The chief attraction of the park, called "Rocky Point Amusement Park" was a huge shore dinner hall which could seat over 1000 diners at a time.  The hall was built right on the Bay and was advertised as the largest shore dinner hall in the world.

The main item on the menu was Rocky Point Clam Chowder which was prepared according to the shore dinner hall's owner's well kept secret recipe.  The diners were seated at both sides of very long tables as they arrived, usually in groups (there was no preferential seating) and the hot chowder was brought in in large metal pots and placed on the tables about six feet apart -- about 50 pots to each table.  The chowder was served with hot "Rocky Point Clam Cakes" (see recipe), sweet corn and watermelon.  Beer and soft drinks were available for purchase nearby.

Unfortunately, the shore dinner hall and the rest of the amusement park were totally destroyed in the hurricane of September 1938.  No attempt was made to rebuild the park and the shore dinner hall until after World War II, and it reopened for business in 1946.  Tragedy struck again when the new park and shore dinner hall were destroyed by another hurricane in 1954.  Again the amusement park and shore dinner hall were rebuilt.  However, the park and the shore dinner hall were closed down for good a few years ago (1996) and they are now just a memory.  But the famous Rocky Point Clam Chowder and Rocky Point Clam Cakes are still available from Rocky Point Chowder House, 1759 Post Rd, Warwick, RI (401-739-4222).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  3 1/2    tablespoons  potato flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chopped dates
     1/2           cup  hot double-strength Starbucks Christmas
                        Blend
                        = (or other dark roast coffee)
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  orange marmalade

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line baking sheets with parchment paper or lightly grease.  Sift together flour, potato flour, baking powder and salt; set aside.

Soak the dates in the hot coffee for at least 30 minutes.  Drain coffee but reserve 1 teaspoon of the liquid.

Cream butter and sugar in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy.  Add the egg, milk, reserved coffee and vanilla and mix until blended.

Add soaked dates into the flour mixture and toss just to coat lightly.  Add flour into the creamed mixture and mix until smooth.

Form approximately 2 tablespoons of dough into a ball by rolling between palms.  Make an indentation in the center of each ball and place on prepared baking sheet at least 3 inches apart.  Fill each indentation with 1/2 teaspoon of orange marmalade.

Bake cookies in preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly golden.  Cool thoroughly on racks before serving.  Garnish with orange peel or a stick of cinnamon.

This recipe yields 36 cookies.

Comments:  These versatile, soft, buttery cookies are as fun to make as they are to eat.  They can also be made in a chocolate version by substituting 2 tablespoons of cocoa for the flour.  For a dressier presentation, add 1 teaspoon of Turkish (finely) ground coffee, form into balls, roll into confectioners' sugar, following baking, for miniature Italian wedding cakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BISCOTTI ===
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- at room temperature
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  shelled pistachios -- roasted, and
                        coarsely chopped
                        === LEMON ICING ===
  2               cups  sifted confectioners' sugar
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/4           cup  lemon juice

Preheat an oven to 375 degrees.  In a large bowl, beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest until well blended.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in the vanilla.   In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt.  Add to the butter mixture and blend thoroughly.  Stir in the nuts.  The dough will be soft.

On a lightly floured work surface, divide the dough in half.  Lightly flour each piece and shape it into a log about 1 1/2 inches in diameter and 9 inches long.  Place the logs about 3 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet.  Press each log down to make it about 3/4-inch thick and 3 inches wide.  Bake until puffed and lightly browned on top, about 20 minutes.

Cool 10 minutes on the pan, then slide the logs onto a work surface.  Using a long, sharp knife, cut each log crosswise into 3/4-inch thick slices.  Make each cut with a single swipe of the blade.  Don't use a sawing motion, which will break the cookies.

Place the cookies, cut-side down, on the baking sheet.  (The cookies can be touching.)  Bake 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and, using tongs, turn each cookie over.  Bake until the biscotti are golden, 10 minutes more.  Transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

To make the icing, in a small bowl, combine the sugar, lemon zest and lemon juice and beat until smooth.  Beat in additional drops of lemon juice if necessary to make an icing that will coat the biscotti lightly.  Dip one end of each biscotti in the icing, turning to coat the tip evenly.  Place on a wire rack until the icing sets.

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 dozen biscotti.

<DirT>
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees.  In a large bowl, beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest until well blended.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in the vanilla.   In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt.  Add to the butter mixture and blend thoroughly.  Stir in the nuts.  The dough will be soft.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On a lightly floured work surface, divide the dough in half.  Lightly flour each piece and shape it into a log about 1 1/2 inches in diameter and 9 inches long.  Place the logs about 3 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet.  Press each log down to make it about 3/4-inch thick and 3 inches wide.  Bake until puffed and lightly browned on top, about 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cool 10 minutes on the pan, then slide the logs onto a work surface.  Using a long, sharp knife, cut each log crosswise into 3/4-inch thick slices.  Make each cut with a single swipe of the blade.  Don&apos;t use a sawing motion, which will break the cookies.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the cookies, cut-side down, on the baking sheet.  (The cookies can be touching.)  Bake 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and, using tongs, turn each cookie over.  Bake until the biscotti are golden, 10 minutes more.  Transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the icing, in a small bowl, combine the sugar, lemon zest and lemon juice and beat until smooth.  Beat in additional drops of lemon juice if necessary to make an icing that will coat the biscotti lightly.  Dip one end of each biscotti in the icing, turning to coat the tip evenly.  Place on a wire rack until the icing sets.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 2 1/2 dozen biscotti.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  russet potatoes
     1/3           cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  snipped fresh chives
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
  1 1/2           cups  shredded Cheddar cheese
  5             slices  bacon -- cooked

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Bake the potatoes for 1 hour.  Let the potatoes cool down enough so that you can touch them.

As the potatoes are baking, make the sour cream dip by mixing the sour cream and the chives. Place the mixture in a covered container in your refrigerator.

When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, make 2 lengthwise cuts through each potato, resulting in three 1/2- to 3/4-inch slices.  Discard the middle slices or save them for a separate dish of mashed potatoes.  This will leave you with two potato skins per potato.

With a spoon, scoop out some of the potato from each skin, being sure to leave about 1/4 inch of potato inside of the skin.  Brush the entire surface of each potato skin, inside and out, with the melted butter.  Place the skins on a cookie sheet, cut-side up, and broil them for 6 to 8 minutes or until the edges begin to turn dark brown.

Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of cheddar cheese into each skin.  Crumble the cooked bacon and sprinkle 1 to 2 teaspoons of the bacon pieces onto the cheese.  Broil the skins for 2 more minutes or until the cheese is thoroughly melted.  Serve hot, arranged on a plate surrounding a small bowl of the sour cream dip.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  1              pound  ground pork
  2        tablespoons  lite soy sauce

Take one wonton wrapper and brush a little water over the circles and place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center.  Fold circles in half and press to seal, making sure to squeeze out any air.  Stand dumplings up on folded side and press slightly so that they stand up.

To cook, bring pot of salted water to a boil, and boil dumplings until cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Drain well.  The dumplings may be frozen at this time for future use.

Heat a skillet with about 2 tablespoon oil and fry dumplings on one side only, until nicely browned.  Drain on paper towels.  Serve with dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 dozen dumplings.
