  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  butter or margarine -- softened
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1                     egg

  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  ground almonds, hazelnuts, or pecans
                        Sifted powdered sugar -- as needed

In a large mixing bowl beat the butter or margarine with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds.  Add the sugar; beat until combined.  Beat in the egg and almond extract.  Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer.  Stir in any remaining flour and the ground nuts with a wooden spoon.  Do not chill dough. 

Pack dough into a cookie press fitted with a 1/2-inch-wide round or star tip.  Force dough through the cookie press 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets forming crescent shapes. 

Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes, or until edges are firm and bottoms are lightly  Remove cookies from pans and cool on a rack.  Sprinkle cookies with powdered sugar. 

This recipe yields about 70 cookies. 

Comments:  These crisp little cookies, reminiscent of Chinese almond cookies, will taste great in any shape your cookie press makes, but be sure to choose a tip with at least a 1/2-inch opening.  Otherwise, the ground nuts might get caught in the opening.

                             Beef Fried Rice

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Chinese
                Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  sirloin steak -- cut 1/2" cubes
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce -- plus
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  Asian sesame oil -- plus a few drops
                        Dried red pepper flakes
  1 1/2           cups  long-grain rice
  1              bunch  watercress - (abt 5 oz) -- tough stems removed
  1                     egg -- beaten to mix
  3        tablespoons  cooking oil
  2                     scallions including green tops -- chopped

In a medium bowl, combine the sirloin with 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce, 1 teaspoon of the sesame oil, and a pinch of red-pepper flakes.  Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.  Stir in the rice and boil until just done, about 10 minutes.  Drain the rice and return it to the pot. 

Meanwhile, heat a large nonstick frying pan over moderately-high heat.  Put the beef mixture in the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and just cooked, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove.  Put the watercress and the teaspoon of soy sauce in the pan and cook until the watercress is just wilted, about 30 seconds.  Remove. 

Reduce the heat to moderate.  Put a few drops of sesame oil in the frying pan.  Add the egg to the pan and cook until just done, about 30 seconds.  Remove from the pan and cut into thin strips. 

Heat the cooking oil in the pan over moderately-high heat.  Add the scallions and 1/8 teaspoon red-pepper flakes and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the cooked rice to the pan and heat, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, the beef, watercress, and egg.  Heat, stirring, 1 to 2 minutes longer.  Drizzle the remaining teaspoon of sesame oil over the top. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Stir-fry the sirloin, watercress, and egg while the rice cooks, so that you'll be ready to assemble the dish at the last moment.  Soy sauce and a drizzling of sesame oil flavor the combination perfectly.  If you prefer, use strips of pork tenderloin instead of beef.

Categories    : Chinese                         Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  dried fine noodles
                        === SAUCE ===
  5             ounces  chicken stock
  2          teaspoons  cornflour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  rice vinegar or white vinegar
     1/8      teaspoon  crushed dried chilies - (to 1/4 tspn)
  1         tablespoon  cooking oil
  2          teaspoons  toasted sesame oil
  10            ounces  broccoli florets

In a large saucepan bring 2 quarts water to boiling.  Add noodles and boil, uncovered, 5 to 7 minutes or until just tender, stirring occasionally.  (Or, cook according to package directions.)  Drain. 

Meanwhile, for sauce, in a small bowl combine stock, cornflour, soy sauce, vinegar, and crushed dried chilies.  Set aside. 

In a wok or large frying pan heat cooking oil and sesame oil over medium-high heat.  Add broccoli; stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until crisp-tender.  Stir sauce; add sauce and cooked noodles to wok or frying pan.  Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly.  Cook and stir for 1 minute more.  Serve. 

This recipe yields 6 servings as an accompaniment. 

Comments:  Thin noodles look best in this sesame-flavoured stir-fry.  Look for fine noodles, nested vermicelli, or capellini in the Asian foods or pasta section of your supermarket.

                        Juice of 1 lemon
                        === GARNISHES ===
  2        tablespoons  fried shallot flakes
                        Chopped fresh cilantro (fresh coriander)
  2                     green (spring) onions -- thinly sliced
  1                     lemon -- cut into 6 wedges

Bring a large pot three-fourths full of water to a boil.  Gently pull the strands of noodles apart, then drop them into the boiling water, stirring to separate the strands.  Bring to a second boil and cook for 1 minute longer.  Pour the noodles into a colander and rinse thoroughly with cold running water.  Drain well, shaking off excess water. 

Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a small saucepan and heat to 375 degrees on a deep-frying thermometer.  Meanwhile, pat dry 1 cup (6 oz) of the cooked noodles with paper towels.  When the oil is hot, add the noodles.  Using a pair of long chopsticks or tongs, stir gently to separate the strands and fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds.  Lift out the noodles and place on paper towels to drain.  Remove the pan from the heat.  Crumble the noodles into small chunks and set aside. 

Measure out 2 tablespoons of the oil used to fry the noodles and place in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Add the garlic and sautÈ until browned, about 1 minute.  Do not shake the cans of coconut milk before opening.  There should be a thick layer of cream on top of each.  Spoon off 1/2 cup of the thick cream from the top of each can and add it to the garlic.  Raise the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring frequently, until the cream boils gently.  Add the Red Curry Paste, curry powder and turmeric and stir until smooth.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the mixture is thick and the oil begins to separate around the edges and rises to the surface, about 5 minutes. 

Add the chicken, breaking it up into small pieces.  Cook until the chicken becomes white, about 2 minutes.  Raise the heat to high.  Add the remaining coconut milk, the chicken stock, fish sauce, palm or brown sugar and cabbage and stir well.  When the mixture begins to boil, adjust the heat to maintain a gentle boil and continue cooking for 8 minutes longer. 

Divide the boiled noodles evenly among 6 warmed deep soup bowls.  Stir the lemon juice into the hot soup and ladle equal amounts of the soup over the noodles.  Garnish with the crumbled fried noodles, fried shallots, cilantro and green onions.  Place a lemon wedge on top of each serving and serve hot. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Although this noodle soup from Thailand is delicious served plain, a variety of crispy, tasty toppings delivers an exciting flavor boost and lively textures.

              Chicken Breasts With Peanut-Ginger-Honey Sauce

Recipe By     :Michel Stroot, "The Golden Door Cookbook"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Chinese
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  Chinese toasted sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  low-sodium tamari or soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  cracked Szechwan peppercorns
                        or Thai or Vietnamese chili paste
  2                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- fat trimmed,
                        cut into 3/4" pieces
  2          teaspoons  canola oil
     1/2                red bell pepper -- cut 1/4" strips
  5                     shiitake mushrooms -- cleaned, trimmed,
                        and thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  vegetable broth or water
  1                cup  broccoli florets
  16                    snow peas
  8                     baby carrots
  1 1/2           cups  hot cooked brown rice
                        Peanut-Ginger-Honey Dressing Or Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro

In a small glass or ceramic bowl, whisk together the ginger, oil, tamari, lime juice, and peppercorns.  Add the chicken, toss, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and no longer than 8 hours. 

In a large saucepan or wok, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and any marinade and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes, until just slightly underdone.  Add the bell pepper and mushrooms and stir-fry for another 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the vegetable broth and scrape up any browned bits sticking to the pan. 

Meanwhile, in a steaming basket set over boiling water, steam the broccoli, snow peas, and carrots just until fork-tender. 

Spoon the rice onto warmed plates.  Spoon the chicken and stir-fried vegetables over the rice and ladle 2 tablespoons of the sauce over each serving.  Garnish with the steamed vegetables and cilantro. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Nothing could be easier than these chicken breasts served with an addictive peanut sauce that gives the simple chicken an Asian flair.  When making the sauce, double the recipe so you can serve it with cold seafood or chicken salad -- but be careful not to eat much more than recommended, as the calories add up quickly.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (3 lbs) -- cooked, bones
                        removed, meat cut bite-size pieces

     1/4           cup  coriander (cilantro) sprigs -- for garnish

  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed
  1         tablespoon  curry powder

             Chinese Poached Chicken Breasts With Star Anise

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Chinese
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  canned low-sodium chicken broth
                        or homemade stock
  2                     carrots -- cut diagonally
                        into 1/2" slices
  6                     scallions including green tops -- 5 cut 4" lengths,
                        and the sixth chopped
  6                     half-inch slices peeled fresh ginger -- smashed, plus
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  4                     garlic cloves -- smashed
     1/4           cup  brown sugar, preferably dark
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  5              whole  star anise
  3                     cinnamon sticks
  6                     black peppercorns
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  dry sherry
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts -- (abt 1 1/3 lbs total

In a large saucepan, combine the broth, carrots, the 5 scallions, the smashed ginger, the garlic, brown sugar, soy sauce, star anise, cinnamon sticks, peppercorns, and salt.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. 

Add the sherry and chicken and bring back to a simmer over moderately-low heat, covered.  Turn the chicken and simmer, covered, until the chicken is just done, about 5 minutes. 

With a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken, carrots, and star anise to large shallow bowls.  Strain the broth and add the minced ginger and 2 tablespoons of the chopped scallion.  Ladle the broth over the chicken and top with the remaining chopped scallion. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Chicken breasts poached in a broth flavored with star anise, cinnamon, ginger, scallions, and soy sauce is a Chinese classic.  Traditionally you would save, not serve, the broth -- it improves each time you use it -- but we can never resist serving it with the chicken as a light sauce.  If you like, boil noodles separately and add them to the broth for a meal in a dish.

                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     3/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2                     garlic cloves -- flattened
     1/4           cup  honey
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  molasses
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  12            ounces  boneless skinless chicken breast halves
                        Cooking oil -- for deep-fat frying
  1         tablespoon  cooking oil
  3               cups  broccoli flowerets

In a medium mixing bowl stir together flour, baking powder, 3/4 cup water, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, and flattened garlic; let stand for 15 minutes.  Remove and discard garlic. 

Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl combine honey, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, vinegar, molasses, 2 tablespoons water, dry sherry, minced garlic, and cornstarch; set aside. 

Rinse chicken; pat dry.  Cut chicken into 1 1/2 by 1/2-inch strips.  Add to flour batter. 

In a wok or 2-quart saucepan heat 2 inches of oil to 365 degrees.  Remove chicken from flour batter, allowing excess to drain off.  Fry chicken strips, a few pieces at a time, in hot oil for 30 to 60 seconds, or until golden.  Drain on paper towels. 

Pour 1 tablespoon cooking oil into a large skillet.  (Add more oil as necessary during cooking.)  Preheat over medium-high heat.  Add the broccoli and stir-fry for 4 to 5 minutes, or until crisp-tender.  Arrange broccoli around the edge of a serving platter; keep warm. 

Stir honey-soy mixture; add to the skillet.  Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly.  Cook and stir for 1 minute more.  Return cooked chicken to skillet; heat through.  Pour chicken and sauce into center of broccoli-lined serving platter. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  To vary the colors and flavors of this dish, use 3 cups mixed vegetables in place of the broccoli.  Red sweet peppers, carrots, and asparagus are good choices.

Recipe By     :Ken Hom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Sandwiches
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon fillets - (4 oz ea)
     1/4           cup  ginger juice -- squeezed from 5 oz
                        of fresh ginger
     1/2           cup  mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)
                        Salt -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  Ken Hom's Peppercorn-Allspice Mix -- (see below),
                        or more to taste
  4             pieces  fresh French bread
  12                    spinach leaves -- well washed
  16                    dark opal basil leaves or regular basil
                        leaves - (to 20)
  2              large  ripe tomatoes -- thinly sliced
                        === EAST-WEST PERSILLADE ===
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh ginger
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped scallions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh curly parsley
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped garlic
                        === KEN HOM'S PEPPERCORN-ALLSPICE MIX ===
  2          teaspoons  Sichuan peppercorns -- toasted
  2          teaspoons  black peppercorns
  2          teaspoons  white peppercorns
  2          teaspoons  pink peppercorns
  2          teaspoons  green peppercorns
  2          teaspoons  whole allspice

To make the peppercorn-allspice mixture:  Grind each ingredient, using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle, and mix together in a small bowl.  It's a potent spice mixture, and since you'll probably grind more than you need, reserve the rest for another use.  Store in a tightly sealed container at room temperature.  (Makes 1/4 cup) 

Rub the salmon fillets with the ginger juice and mirin.  Add salt to the peppercorn-allspice mixture, mix together and sprinkle evenly on both sides of the salmon.  Let the salmon marinate in a nonreactive dish at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. 

Prepare the persillade mixture.  In a small heatproof bowl, combine the ginger, scallions, salt, and pepper.  In a small skillet, heat the olive oil until it is quite hot but not smoking.  Pour the hot oil over the ginger-scallion mixture.  Scrape the mixture into a blender with the cilantro, both parsleys, and garlic, and purÈe.  Set aside. 

Gently steam the salmon fillets over simmering water in a covered wok with a trivet or in a bamboo or metal steamer for 5 minutes, just until done.  Or cover the fillets with plastic wrap and microwave at full power for 3 minutes.  Let the salmon cool. 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and warm the bread for 5 minutes.  Cut each piece in half lengthwise and scrape out the inside.  Spread the persillade on the inside of the bread.  Lay in the salmon, spinach, basil, and tomato.  Serve at once. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This is a sandwich I created for the two-hundredth anniversary of Lord Sandwich's death, an event sponsored by the famous Parisian bread baker, Lionel Poil‚ne.  The sandwich paired many of the flavors I've enjoyed with my friends and family from Hong Kong to Paris, and it's easy to make.

<DirS>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To make the peppercorn-allspice mixture:  Grind each ingredient, using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle, and mix together in a small bowl.  It&apos;s a potent spice mixture, and since you&apos;ll probably grind more than you need, reserve the rest for another use.  Store in a tightly sealed container at room temperature.  (Makes 1/4 cup) 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Rub the salmon fillets with the ginger juice and mirin.  Add salt to the peppercorn-allspice mixture, mix together and sprinkle evenly on both sides of the salmon.  Let the salmon marinate in a nonreactive dish at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Prepare the persillade mixture.  In a small heatproof bowl, combine the ginger, scallions, salt, and pepper.  In a small skillet, heat the olive oil until it is quite hot but not smoking.  Pour the hot oil over the ginger-scallion mixture.  Scrape the mixture into a blender with the cilantro, both parsleys, and garlic, and purÈe.  Set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Gently steam the salmon fillets over simmering water in a covered wok with a trivet or in a bamboo or metal steamer for 5 minutes, just until done.  Or cover the fillets with plastic wrap and microwave at full power for 3 minutes.  Let the salmon cool. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and warm the bread for 5 minutes.  Cut each piece in half lengthwise and scrape out the inside.  Spread the persillade on the inside of the bread.  Lay in the salmon, spinach, basil, and tomato.  Serve at once. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  This is a sandwich I created for the two-hundredth anniversary of Lord Sandwich&apos;s death, an event sponsored by the famous Parisian bread baker, Lionel Poil‚ne.  The sandwich paired many of the flavors I&apos;ve enjoyed with my friends and family from Hong Kong to Paris, and it&apos;s easy to make.

                  Ginger Chicken With Peas And Shiitakes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Chinese
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fresh pea pods -- tips and
                        strings removed
  1                cup  frozen peas - (loosely packed)
     3/4           cup  half-and-half or light cream
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  cooking oil
  2          teaspoons  grated fresh gingerroot
  8             ounces  fresh shiitake or other mushrooms -- stems removed
                        and sliced
  12            ounces  boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- cut into thin
                        bite-sized strips
     1/4           cup  snipped fresh parsley

In a medium saucepan cook pea pods and green peas in boiling water for 1 minute, or until pea pods are crisp-tender.  Drain and set aside. 

In a bowl stir together half-and-half or light cream, cornstarch, salt, and pepper.  Set aside. 

Pour oil into a wok or large skillet.  (Add more oil as necessary during cooking.)  Preheat over medium-high heat.  Stir-fry gingerroot in hot oil for 30 seconds.  Add mushrooms; stir-fry for about 2 minutes, or until tender.  Remove vegetables from wok. 

Add chicken strips to hot wok.  Stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until no pink remains.  Push chicken from center of wok.  Stir half-and-half mixture; add to the center of wok.  Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly.  Return cooked vegetables and parsley to wok.  Stir all ingredients together to coat with sauce.  Cook and stir for 1 minute more, or until heated through.  Sprinkle with parsley. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Although you'll pay more for shiitake mushrooms, their flavor is woodier and richer than white mushrooms and well worth the extra expense.  Many supermarkets carry a wide selection of fresh mushrooms.

  1         tablespoon  honey
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder

Combine all the marinade ingredients and the chicken in a dish and mix well.  Cover and refrigerate for several hours or overnight.  Drain the chicken from the marinade, reserve marinade. 

Add the noodles to a pan of boiling water and simmer, uncovered for 3 minutes; drain. 

Heat the oil in a wok or large pan, add the chicken in batches and cook, stirring, until the chicken is browned and tender; remove from the wok.  Reheat the wok, add the onions and garlic and cook, stirring, until the onion is soft.  Add the bok choy and bell peppers and cook, stirring, until the bok choy is wilted.  Add the noodles, toss well and then transfer to serving plates. 

Blend the reserved marinade with the cornstarch and water.  Add to the wok and cook, stirring, until the mixture boils and thickens.  Return the chicken to the wok and stir-fry until heated through.  Spoon onto the bok choy mixture on the serving plates. 

This recipe can be prepared a day ahead.  Fresh egg noodles are available from Asian supermarkets.  If using dried noodles, boil them first until tender. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

              Honey-Glazed Pork With Garlic Mashed Potatoes

Recipe By     :Burt Wolf, "Good To Eat"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     pork tenderloins - (abt 1 3/4 lbs total)
     1/3           cup  honey
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  Chinese five-spice powder
  6             medium  Idaho potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  6              whole  garlic cloves -- peeled
  3        tablespoons  butter - (to 6 tbspns) -- plus
  4        tablespoons  cold butter
  3        tablespoons  half-and-half - (to 6 tbspns)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Set the pork tenderloins in a roasting pan and roast for 15 minutes.  While they are roasting, in a small mixing bowl, combine the honey, soy sauce, and Chinese five-spice powder. 

After 15 minutes, remove the pork from the oven, baste the tenderloins with the honey sauce, lower the heat to 350 degrees and return them to the oven.  Continue to roast, basting on occasion with the honey sauce, for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. 

In a medium saucepan, place the potatoes and garlic covered by 2 inches of cold water.  Simmer, partially covered, for 25 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. 

Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot, off the heat.  Add 3 to 6 tablespoons of butter and half-and-half to the potatoes (add as little or as much as you like) and mash them with a masher or potato ricer.  Or, puree the potatoes in a food mill (do not use a food processor; this will turn the potatoes gummy), and then whisk in the butter and half-and-half.  Season with salt and pepper.  Keep the potatoes warm in a double boiler until serving time or reheat right before serving in a microwave oven. 

When the pork is done, transfer the tenderloins to a cutting board.  Pour the pan and basting juices into a skillet and boil them down until 3/4 cup remains.  Remove the sauce from the heat and whisk in the cold butter, tablespoon by tablespoon; season with salt and pepper. 

Cut the tenderloins on a diagonal into thin slices and set them on a plate; garnish with mashed potatoes.  Brush 2 to 3 tablespoons of sauce over the pork slices. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Sticky measuring.  When you have to measure honey, molasses, corn syrup, or other sticky liquids, coat the surface of the measuring tool with a little butter or corn oil.  The liquid will pour out easily, as you will have a more accurate measure.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Chinese
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3         pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts (abt 4) -- cut 1/2" pieces
  5        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  sherry
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- plus
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar or rice vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Asian sesame oil
     1/3           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
     1/2           cup  peanuts
  4                     scallions, white bulbs and green tops -- cut separately
                        into 1/2" pieces
     1/4      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes

In a medium bowl, toss the chicken with 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of the sherry, and the 1 tablespoon cornstarch. 

In a small bowl, combine the sugar, vinegar, sesame oil, water, and the remaining 4 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of sherry, and 2 teaspoons cornstarch. 

In a wok or large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderately-high heat.  Add the peanuts and stir-fry until light brown, about 30 seconds.  Remove from the pan. 

Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil.  Add the white part of the scallions and the red-pepper flakes to the pan and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the chicken with its marinade and cook, stirring, until almost done, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the soy-sauce mixture and the scallion tops and simmer until the chicken is just done, about 1 minute longer.  Stir in the peanuts. 

Variation:  For Cashew Chicken, substitute the same amount of cashews for the peanuts. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Quick Asian stir-fries make especially satisfying weeknight dinners.  Kung pao is traditionally a seriously spicy dish, but we've given ours a moderate level of heat; feel free to adjust the quantity of red-pepper flakes to suit your taste.  Serve with steamed rice.

                          Lobster Lo Mein Salad

Recipe By     :Marcia Kiesel for Food & Wine Magazine
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Salads/Dressings
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     live lobsters - (1 to 1 1/4 lbs ea)
                        (or 1 to 1 1/4 pounds cooked lobster meat)
  1         tablespoon  dried Japanese hijiki seaweed
     1/2           cup  boiling water
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/4      teaspoons  Asian sesame oil
     1/4         pound  snow peas
                        Ice water -- as needed
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated fresh ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper -- or more to taste
  5        tablespoons  Asian fish sauce
  2 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1              pound  dried Chinese lo mein noodles
     1/4           cup  fresh cilantro leaves
     1/4           cup  salted peanuts

If using live lobsters, plunge them head first into a large saucepan of boiling water and cook until they are bright red all over, about 8 minutes.  Using tongs, remove the lobsters to a bowl.  When they are cool enough to handle, crack the claws and tail and remove all the meat.  Slice the tail and claw meat 1/4-inch thick and refrigerate until ready to use. 

Put the hijiki in a small bowl, add the boiling water and set aside until softened, about 15 minutes.  In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce with the 1 teaspoon sugar and 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil.  Drain the hijiki and add it to the bowl.  Set aside for at least 10 minutes. 

In a medium saucepan of boiling water, blanch the snow peas until bright green, about 1 minute.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the snow peas to the ice water to stop the cooking.  Drain and pat dry, then slice the snow peas lengthwise into thin strips. 

In a bowl, combine the garlic, ginger, crushed red pepper, fish sauce, lime juice and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon sesame oil.  Stir in 5 tablespoons of water. 

Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil.  Add the noodles and cook, stirring, until al dente, about 4 minutes.  Drain the noodles in a colander and return them to the saucepan.  Fill the pan with cold water and swirl the noodles around, then drain.  Repeat the process one more time.  Drain the noodles well. 

In a large bowl, combine the noodles with the lobster, snow peas and the hijiki and its marinade.  Toss well, using clean hands or tongs.  Add the fish sauce dressing and the cilantro leaves, season with pepper and toss well.  Turn the salad out onto a large platter, sprinkle the peanuts on top and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Asian wheat noodles have a tender texture that befits this delicate salad.  Look for dried Chinese lo mein or Japanese somen or hiyamugi noodles.  The noodles and fish sauce are available at well-stocked supermarkets and Asian markets, and the seaweed at Asian markets and health food stores.

<DirS>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;If using live lobsters, plunge them head first into a large saucepan of boiling water and cook until they are bright red all over, about 8 minutes.  Using tongs, remove the lobsters to a bowl.  When they are cool enough to handle, crack the claws and tail and remove all the meat.  Slice the tail and claw meat 1/4-inch thick and refrigerate until ready to use. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Put the hijiki in a small bowl, add the boiling water and set aside until softened, about 15 minutes.  In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce with the 1 teaspoon sugar and 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil.  Drain the hijiki and add it to the bowl.  Set aside for at least 10 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a medium saucepan of boiling water, blanch the snow peas until bright green, about 1 minute.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the snow peas to the ice water to stop the cooking.  Drain and pat dry, then slice the snow peas lengthwise into thin strips. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a bowl, combine the garlic, ginger, crushed red pepper, fish sauce, lime juice and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon sesame oil.  Stir in 5 tablespoons of water. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil.  Add the noodles and cook, stirring, until al dente, about 4 minutes.  Drain the noodles in a colander and return them to the saucepan.  Fill the pan with cold water and swirl the noodles around, then drain.  Repeat the process one more time.  Drain the noodles well. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a large bowl, combine the noodles with the lobster, snow peas and the hijiki and its marinade.  Toss well, using clean hands or tongs.  Add the fish sauce dressing and the cilantro leaves, season with pepper and toss well.  Turn the salad out onto a large platter, sprinkle the peanuts on top and serve. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Asian wheat noodles have a tender texture that befits this delicate salad.  Look for dried Chinese lo mein or Japanese somen or hiyamugi noodles.  The noodles and fish sauce are available at well-stocked supermarkets and Asian markets, and the seaweed at Asian markets and health food stores.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  sifted glutinous rice flour
  1                cup  boiling water
                        === SWEET FILLING ===
  1                cup  mung beans -- skins removed
                        and steamed
  2        tablespoons  grated white coconut
     3/4      teaspoon  salt -- divided
     1/2           cup  roasted sesame seeds
     1/2           cup  fine granulated sugar
  2               cups  white shredded coconut
                        === SHRIMP FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped shrimp
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped grated coconut
  1         tablespoon  well-pounded mixture of
                        coriander root, pepper and garlic
  1         tablespoon  cooking oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar
  2                     kaffir lime leaves -- finely sliced
  1                cup  coconut milk

Sift 3 cups glutinous rice flour into mixing bowl and add, a little at a time, 1 cup boiling water, stirring with wooden paddle.  When the dough can be worked with the hands, knead until soft and uniform, then form into balls about 3/4-inch in diameter.  Place on tray, cover with damp cloth, and set aside. 

For the Sweet Filling:  Mix mung beans, 2 tablespoons grated coconut, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together.  This is for filling the pods.  Break the sesame seeds open in mortar, then mix the sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  This is for sprinkling on the pods.  Steam shredded coconut for 5 minutes.  This is used for coating the pods. 

For the Shrimp Filling:  Fry the coriander root-pepper-garlic mixture in the oil until fragrant, then add the shrimp and finely chopped coconut and mix well.  If cakes form, remove pan from heat and break them up, then continue cooking.  Add salt and sugar to taste (this needs to taste sweet).  Then remove the shrimp filling from pan and spinkle with kaffir lime leaf.  Bring coconut milk to a boil, then remove from heat.  This is poured onto the pods. 

Filling the Pods:  Press the dough balls out into discs 1/4-inch thick.  Place in the center about a teaspoonful of (whichever) filling, fold over, and pinch securely closed along the edge (shape to look like a bean pod).  Fill a large pan with water and bring to a boil.  Drop pods into the water, boil until they float to surface (about 2 to 3 minutes), then dip up from the water. 

Upon removal, pods with sweet filling are shaken to remove excess water, immediately tossed with the steamed shredded coconut to coat them completely, then placed on a dish and sprinkled with the sesame and sugar mixture.  Pods with shrimp filling are drained, placed on a dish, topped with coconut milk and served with coriander.

Categories    : Chinese                         Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  bok choy - (abt 1 head)
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  Chinese oyster sauce
     1/2    tablespoon  reduced-sodium soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/2          cups  chicken stock
  1              small  dried hot pepper
  6             ounces  sliced portobello mushrooms -- (abt 16 slices)
  1                cup  shredded carrots

Cut the bok choy on the diagonal into thin strips (about 6 cups). 

In a bowl, mix together the wine, oyster sauce, soy sauce, cornstarch, and 1 cup of the chicken stock and set aside.  Meanwhile, preheat a nonstick wok or a large nonstick skillet over high heat. 

Put 1/4 cup of the remaining chicken stock and the dried pepper into the hot wok or skillet and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring constantly and turning the mushrooms periodically, until they brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Remove and reserve the mushrooms. 

Add the remaining 1/4 cup of chicken stock and the bok choy to the wok or skillet.  Stir and add the carrots.  Cook and stir for about 1 minute, until the carrots are limp.  Add the reserved sauce mixture and stir to coat.  Add the reserved mushrooms and any juice they have given off.

                               Pot Stickers

Recipe By     :Vicki Liley, "Noodles - The Essential Kitchen"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Dim Sum
                Dumplings                       Potstickers


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  ground (minced) lean pork
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  1                cup  finely-shredded green cabbage
  2          teaspoons  grated peeled fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  Asian sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  24                    round wheat wonton wrappers
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2               cups  chicken stock -- or as needed
                        Light soy sauce -- for serving

In a bowl, combine pork, oinion, cabbage, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce and pepper.  Mix well. 

Place wonton wrappers on work surface and cover with damp kitchen towel.  Working with one wrapper at a time, lay it on work surface and place 1 teaspoon filling in middle.  Brush edges with water, fold wonton in half and press edges together to seal.  Using your fingertips, pinch frill around each folded wonton if desired.  Set aside, covered with plastic wrap.  Repeat with remaining wrappers. 

Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat.  Swirl to cover entire bottom of pan.  Working in batches, fry filled wontons until golden brown on both sides, about 1 minute.  Coat pan as needed with remaining 3 tablespoons vegetable oil. 

Return pot stickers to pan and add enough stock to come halfway up the sides of pot stickers.  Cover and simmer until stock is almost absorbed, about 10 minutes.  Uncover and cook until stock is completely absorbed and bottoms of pot stickers are crisp.  Repeat with remaining pot stickers. 

Serve pot stickers warm with soy sauce. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                      Red Curry Mussels Over Noodles

Recipe By     :Joyce Jue, "Far East Cafe: The Best of Casual Asian Cooking"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Salt -- as needed
  1              pound  fresh thin Chinese egg noodles
  2               cans  coconut milk - (13 1/2 oz ea) -- unshaken
  2        tablespoons  Red Curry Paste -- or to taste, (see
                        recipe)
  2          teaspoons  palm sugar or dark brown sugar
  2 1/2    tablespoons  Thai fish sauce
  2 1/2         pounds  fresh mussels in the shell
  8                     kaffir lime or other citrus leaves
  1                cup  fresh Thai basil or regular basil leaves
  4              small  fresh red chili peppers -- seeded and sliced
                        Fresh cilantro sprigs

Fill a large pot three-fourths full with water, bring to a boil and salt it liberally.  Gently pull the strands of noodles apart, then drop them into the boiling water, stirring to separate the strands.  Bring to a second boil and cook for 1 minute longer.  Pour the noodles into a colander and rinse thoroughly with cold running water.  Drain well and transfer to a large bowl. 

Do not shake the cans of coconut milk before opening.  There should be a thick layer of cream on the top of each.  Spoon off 1/2 cup of the thick cream from the top of each can and place in a wok or heavy pot.  Place over medium-high heat and stir until the cream becomes oily and aromatic, about 3 minutes.  Add the Red Curry Paste and simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the sharp fragrances mellow, about 3 minutes.  Add the palm or brown sugar, fish sauce and the remaining coconut milk; stir well and simmer for 5 minutes longer. 

Meanwhile, scrub and debeard the mussels under cold running water.  Discard any mussels that do not close to the touch.  Bring the coconut milk sauce to a boil and add the mussels, lime or citrus leaves, basil and chilies.  Cover and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the shells open, about 2 minutes. 

Meanwhile, refill the large pot three-fourths full with water and bring to a boil.  Drop the reserved noodles into the water for a few seconds to reheat, then drain and divide the noodles among 6 warmed soup bowls. 

Ladle the mussels and sauce over the noodles, discarding any mussels that did not open.  Garnish with cilantro sprigs and serve hot. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  In Thailand, dishes like this one are commonly ordered in open-air seafood markets, where local vendors cook customers' just-purchased seafood and vegetables in whatever style they request.  At home, with premade curry paste on hand, this dish will take only about 10 minutes to prepare.

Categories    : Accompaniment                   Condiments
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dried red chilies
  8             pieces  dried kaffir lime rind
                        (or 1 tbspn chopped fresh lime zest)
  8                     fresh or 4 dried galangal slices -- abt 1" dia ea,
                        chopped
  6             stalks  lemongrass, tender heart section only
  1         tablespoon  whole coriander seeds or ground coriander
  1         tablespoon  whole cumin seeds or ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
                        (or 3/4 tspn freshly-ground black pepper)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sweet paprika
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  4                     shallots -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro roots or stems
  1           teaspoon  dried shrimp paste or anchovy paste

Cut the chilies in half crosswise, then shake out and discard the seeds.  In a small bowl, combine the chilies with warm water to cover.  In another small bowl, combine the dried lime rind and dried galangal, if using, and cover with warm water; let soak until soft and pliable, about 30 minutes.  Drain the galangal and lime rind, chop them and set aside.  Cut the lemongrass crosswise into thin slices; set aside. 

If using whole coriander and cumin seeds, toast them in a small, dry frying pan over medium heat, shaking the pan occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes.  Let cool and transfer the seeds and whole peppercorns, if using, to a spice grinder or mortar; grind or pulverize with a pestle to a fine powder.  Combine the ground spices with the salt and paprika and set aside. 

Drain the chilies, reserving about 1/4 cup of the soaking liquid, and place the chilies and soaking liquid in a blender or mini food processor.  Add the reconstituted or fresh galangal, lime rind or fresh lime zest, lemongrass, garlic, shallots, cilantro roots or stems, shrimp or anchovy paste and reserved dry spices.  Process into as smooth a paste as possible, about 30 seconds.  If the mixture remains coarse, transfer it to a mortar and mash with a pestle until smooth. 

This recipe yields about 1 cup. 

Comments:  Since this curry paste keeps well in the freezer for a few months, make a large batch and pack it in an ice-cube tray to use as needed.  To save time, look for prepared curry pastes in most Asian markets.

                      Red-Cooked Beef With Cinnamon

Recipe By     :Gordon Hamersley for Food & Wine Magazine
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Chinese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  medium-dry sherry
     3/4           cup  fresh orange juice
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  honey
  4                     cinnamon sticks
  1         tablespoon  five-spice powder
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  coriander seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  4              pound  boneless beef flanken or brisket
  1             medium  onion -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  wide or medium dried rice noodles -- see * Note
  6              heads  baby bok choy -- halved lengthwise,
                        (or 1 lb Napa cabbage cut into 1" pieces)
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- roasted, peeled,
                        seeded and thinly sliced, (optional)
                        Fresh cilantro and mint sprigs -- for garnish

* Note:  Rice noodles are available at Asian markets.  Or substitute any long, broad noodle. 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a medium nonreactive bowl, combine 3 cups of water and the sherry, orange juice, soy sauce, honey, cinnamon, five-spice powder, garlic, ginger, coriander seeds and crushed red pepper. 

In a large enameled cast-iron casserole, heat the oil over moderately-high heat.  Season the beef with salt and pepper.  Add the beef to the casserole and cook until browned, about 5 minutes per side.  Drain any fat. 

Add the onion and the sherry mixture to the meat, cover and bring to a boil.  Cook the meat in the oven for about 2 1/2 hours, or until very tender; turn the meat halfway through cooking.  (MAKE AHEAD: The beef can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.  Remove the fat from the surface and reheat in a 350 degree oven before proceeding.) 

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, cover the rice noodles with cold water and let soften, 20 to 30 minutes.  Drain and set aside. 

Transfer the beef to a large platter, cover with foil and keep warm.  Skim the fat from the broth and add the bok choy and red bell pepper, if using.  Simmer over moderate heat until the bok choy is just tender, 3 to 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the noodles and simmer just to heat through. 

To serve, cut the beef across the grain into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Transfer the noodles to 6 warm shallow bowls and top with slices of beef, red bell pepper and bok choy.  Ladle the broth over all and garnish with the cilantro and mint. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                 Sherry-Braised Duck With Aromatic Spices

Recipe By     :Burt Wolf, "Gatherings & Celebrations"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     Long-Island duck - (3 to 4 lbs) -- fresh, or frozen
                        and defrosted
  6                     scallions
  1 1/2           cups  dry sherry
     1/3           cup  soy sauce
  6                     quarter-size slices peeled ginger
  3              whole  star anise
  2 1/2           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  8                     dried shiitake mushrooms
  1             medium  turnip -- peeled, and
                        cut into half-moons

Remove the gizzards and neck from the cavity of the duck.  Trim the excess fat and skin from the duck's neck and tail.  Cut off and discard the wing tips and tail.  Pierce the duck skin all over with the tines of a fork to help render the fat. 

Heat a large skillet or wok.  Carefully lower the duck, breast-side down, into the pan and sear the duck over medium heat until it is golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Poke a wooden spoon into the duck and rotate the bird onto its side.  Brown the bird for 5 to 7 minutes.  Rotate and brown the bird on the other side and then the back, until all sides have been well browned and most of the duck fat has been rendered.  Transfer the duck to a plate and discard the rendered fat. 

Lay the scallions in the center of a casserole that will fit the duck snugly.  Place the duck breast-side down on the bed of scallions.  (The scallions provide a buffer so the duck skin doesn't scorch.)  Add the sherry, soy sauce, ginger, and star anise, bring to a boil, and then add 1 1/2 cups of the water.  Reduce the heat so the liquid simmers gently.  Baste the bird with the sauce, cover, and simmer the duck for 1 1/2 hours.  Check the duck periodically to make sure the sauce is not simmering too quickly, and to baste the bird. 

After the duck has simmered for 1 1/2 hours, poke a wooden spoon into the cavity and turn the bird onto its back.  Add the sugar to the braising liquid.  Baste the duck and continue to braise, covered, for another hour.  Check periodically to make sure the sauce is simmering gently and to baste the duck. 

Bring the remaining 1 cup of water to a boil and pour it into a bowl with the dried shiitake mushrooms.  Set aside for 20 minutes to hydrate.  Once the mushrooms are soft, trim and discard their tough stems. 

When the duck is fully tender, carefully remove it to a plate with a pair of tongs and cover it with foil to keep warm.  Strain the sauce and skim the fat from the surface, or pour the liquid through a degreasing cup. 

Return the sauce to the pan and simmer it with the mushrooms and turnip for 10 minutes. 

To serve, slice the duck into serving pieces and arrange it on a large platter.  Spoon the sauce and vegetables over the duck and serve warm or at room temperature. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Remove the gizzards and neck from the cavity of the duck.  Trim the excess fat and skin from the duck&apos;s neck and tail.  Cut off and discard the wing tips and tail.  Pierce the duck skin all over with the tines of a fork to help render the fat. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Heat a large skillet or wok.  Carefully lower the duck, breast-side down, into the pan and sear the duck over medium heat until it is golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Poke a wooden spoon into the duck and rotate the bird onto its side.  Brown the bird for 5 to 7 minutes.  Rotate and brown the bird on the other side and then the back, until all sides have been well browned and most of the duck fat has been rendered.  Transfer the duck to a plate and discard the rendered fat. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Lay the scallions in the center of a casserole that will fit the duck snugly.  Place the duck breast-side down on the bed of scallions.  (The scallions provide a buffer so the duck skin doesn&apos;t scorch.)  Add the sherry, soy sauce, ginger, and star anise, bring to a boil, and then add 1 1/2 cups of the water.  Reduce the heat so the liquid simmers gently.  Baste the bird with the sauce, cover, and simmer the duck for 1 1/2 hours.  Check the duck periodically to make sure the sauce is not simmering too quickly, and to baste the bird. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;After the duck has simmered for 1 1/2 hours, poke a wooden spoon into the cavity and turn the bird onto its back.  Add the sugar to the braising liquid.  Baste the duck and continue to braise, covered, for another hour.  Check periodically to make sure the sauce is simmering gently and to baste the duck. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Bring the remaining 1 cup of water to a boil and pour it into a bowl with the dried shiitake mushrooms.  Set aside for 20 minutes to hydrate.  Once the mushrooms are soft, trim and discard their tough stems.

                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  canned straw mushrooms
  1              pound  medium shrimp -- shelled and
                        deveined, heads and shells reserved
  3                     lemongrass stalks -- outer leaves and
                        tough green tops removed, root ends
                        trimmed and stalks lightly crushed
  3                     dried red chilies
  3                     lime leaves or peel
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
                        Coarse sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1             medium  ripe tomato -- cut 8 equal wedges
  2                     scallions -- trimmed, sliced thin
  1                cup  mung bean sprouts -- trimmed
     1/3           cup  julienned holy basil
     1/4           cup  Fried Garlic Oil -- see * Note

* Note:  See the "Scallion Oil - {Hanh La Phi}" recipe for the "Toi Phi Dau" variation. 

Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat.  Drain and rinse the mushrooms, then blanch them in the boiling water for 3 minutes.  Drain once again. 

Place the shrimp heads and shells in a pot with 7 cups water and bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the liquid is reduced by 1 cup, about 30 minutes. 

Stain the shrimp stock through a sieve over a pot, pressing the shells to extract any juices.  Discard the shells and add the lemongrass, chilies, lime leaves, lime juice, and fish sauce to the stock.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and simmer the stock, partially covered, over low heat for 15 minutes. 

Add the straw mushrooms and tomato wedges and simmer for an additional 5 minutes.  Add the shrimp and cook until opaque, about 2 minutes. 

Remove from the heat.  Serve hot -- in a communal bowl or individual soup bowls -- garnished with scallion, mung bean sprouts, holy basil, and Fried Garlic Oil. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                 Steamed Bean Curd With Chinese Mushrooms

Recipe By     :Eileen Yin-Fei Lo for Food & Wine Magazine
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5              large  dried Chinese black or shiitake mushrooms -- (1 1/2 oz)
  1                cup  boiling water
     1/2           cup  chicken stock or canned low-sodium broth
  1           teaspoon  white sesame seeds
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  black soy sauce -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  black soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1              pound  soft bean curd
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced scallions
  10                    coriander (cilantro) leaves

In a heatproof bowl, soak the mushrooms in the boiling water for 30 minutes.  Drain and rinse the mushrooms.  Cut off and discard the stems. 

In a small saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a boil.  Add the mushrooms, cover partially and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes.  Drain the mushrooms and cut them into 1/4-inch dice. 

In a small skillet, toast the sesame seeds over moderate heat, shaking the pan often, until the white sesame seeds turn a light tan, about 1 minute.  Transfer the seeds to a plate to cool. 

In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch with the black soy sauce and honey.  In another bowl, mash the bean curd with a fork.  Add the cornstarch mixture and diced mushrooms and mix well.  Transfer the bean curd to a 4-cup soufflÈ dish or other deep baking dish and smooth the top.  Set the dish in a steamer and cover with a plate.  Steam the bean curd until it has set, about 15 minutes.  Sprinkle the bean curd with the sesame seeds, scallions and coriander leaves and serve hot. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Bean curd is a cooling food, as are all forms soy.  The mushrooms are cool as well, and steaming is considered to be a cooling process.  The scallions, coriander and sesame seeds are warming, yet because they are garnishes, they do not alter this dish's essential yin nature.  Note that the addition of honey makes this dish slightly sweet.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  cellophane noodles
  4             ounces  ground beef
     1/2         pound  ground pork
  1             medium  onion -- chopped

                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam)

Soak the cellophane noodles in warm water for 20 minutes, then drain and chop fine.  Combine the beef and ground pork.  Add the cellophane noodles and the remaining ingredients and mix well with your hands.

     1/4           cup  cauliflower florets
     1/4           cup  broccoli florets
     1/4           cup  asparagus tips
  4        tablespoons  light soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  dark sweet soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  corn starch -- dissolved in
                        a little water
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Take two cakes of hard tofu, and cut them in quarters, then divide the squares in half diagonally, then divide each piece in half "height-wise" to yield 32 bite-sized pieces. 

Place a little peanut oil in a hot pan and stir-fry the tofu pieces until they turn golden brown.  Next saute the garlic, ginger and chilis (if used) in a little oil, and then add the soy sauces and then all the other ingredients except the bean sprouts.  Stir-fry for about a minute, then add the cornstarch and continue to stir-fry for a further minute. 

Add the bean sprouts, stir very briefly to warm them, but not cook them, and then serve with Thai jasmine rice. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is a basic vegetarian stir-fry.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             stalks  fresh lemon grass
                        (or 2 tbspns dried lemon grass)
  1              pound  firm bean curd (tofu)
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  4             ounces  cellophane (bean thread) noodles
  1                can  straw mushrooms - (10 oz) -- drained, with
     2/3           cup  of the mushroom liquid reserved
     1/4           cup  hoisin sauce
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste -- plus
  1           teaspoon  tomato paste
  2                     red chile peppers -- seeded, sliced thin
  2                     leeks, white part only -- thinly sliced
  1                     red bell pepper -- cut into 1" chunks
  1                     green bell pepper -- cut into 1" chunks
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Coriander sprigs -- for garnish

If you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and upper half of the stalk.  Cut into thin slices and finely chop.  If you are using dried lemon grass, soak in warm water for 1 hour.  Drain and finely chop. 

Cut the bean curd into 1-inch cubes.  Drain on a double thickness of paper towels. 

Pour 1 inch of oil in a wok or skillet and set over moderately-high heat.  Fry the bean curd cubes, without crowding, until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes, or until crisp and golden brown.  Remove the bean curd with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. 

Drop about one-fourth of the cellophane noodles into the hot oil (365 degrees).  As they puff and expand, push them down into the oil.  Turn the noodles and continue to cook until the crackling stops, 15 to 20 seconds in all.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Place on a serving platter and keep warm in a 200 degree oven.  Cook the remaining noodles in the same manner. 

Combine the reserved mushroom liquid, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, tomato paste and chiles in a bowl; stir to blend.  Set the sauce aside. 

Remove all but 3 tablespoons of the oil from the wok.  Drop in the leeks and lemon grass and stir-fry over moderately-high heat for 1 minute.  Add the bell peppers and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add the mushrooms and bean curd cubes and stir-fry for 1 minute longer.  Stir in the sauce and bring to a boil.  Stir until the sauce thickens, about 2 minutes. 

Pour the mixture over the cellophane noodles.  Sprinkle with white pepper and garnish with coriander sprigs. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

          Stir-Fried Beef With Lemon Grass - {Thit Bo Xao Xa Ot}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             stalks  fresh lemon grass
                        (or 2 tbspns dried lemon grass)
  1              pound  lean beef filet or eye of round
  2                     fresh red chile peppers -- seeded and minced
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1           teaspoon  arrowroot or cornstarch
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2             medium  onions -- cut into slivers
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  roasted peanuts -- coarsely ground
                        Coriander sprigs -- for garnish

If you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and upper half of the stalk.  Slice paper-thin and chop very fine.  If you are using dried lemon grass, soak in warm water for 1 hour.  Drain and chop very fine. 

Cut the beef across the grain into very thin 2- by 3-inch slices.  Pound the meat lightly with the flat side of a cleaver. 

In a bowl, combine the beef with the lemon grass, chiles, half of the garlic, 2 tablespoons of the fish sauce, the arrowroot, black pepepr to taste and 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Mix well.  Set aside for 30 minutes. 

Heat a large skillet over moderately-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the onions and the remaining garlic; stir-fry for about 3 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove the onions with a slotted spoon to a plate. 

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil.  When the oil is hot, add the beef, the remaining 1 tablespoon fish sauce and the sugar.  Saute over high heat for 1 or 2 minutes, or until the beef is just cooked.  Transfer the mixture to a heated platter. 

Arrange the sauteed onions around the meat mixture; sprinkle the peanuts and white pepper over all.  Garnish with coriander. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                 Stir-Fried Chicken With Chinese Cabbage

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Chinese
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3         pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts (abt 4) -- cut into 1" pieces
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce -- plus
  4          teaspoons  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  dry sherry
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1         tablespoon  wine vinegar
     1/2          head  Chinese cabbage - (abt 1 lb) -- sliced
     3/4           cup  drained sliced water chestnuts -- (from 8-oz can)
  2          teaspoons  tomato paste
     1/4      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
  3        tablespoons  water
  3        tablespoons  chopped cilantro or scallion tops
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

In a medium bowl, combine the chicken with the 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of the sherry, and the cayenne.  Let marinate for 10 minutes. 

In a wok or large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderately-high heat.  Add the chicken and cook, stirring, until almost done, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove. 

Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan.  Add the onion, garlic, and coriander.  Cook, stirring, until the onions are golden, about 4 minutes.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons sherry and the vinegar.  Cook, stirring, 1 minute longer. 

Add the cabbage, water chestnuts, the remaining 4 teaspoons soy sauce, the tomato paste, red-pepper flakes, and water and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes longer.  Add the chicken and any accumulated juices, the cilantro, and the salt and cook, stirring, until the chicken is just done, 1 to 2 minutes longer. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  A simple sauce of garlic, hot pepper, sherry, wine vinegar, and tomato, adds intense flavor to this quick stir-fry and it practically makes itself while the chicken and cabbage cook.  Steamed rice is an ideal accompaniment.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a medium bowl, combine the chicken with the 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of the sherry, and the cayenne.  Let marinate for 10 minutes.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a wok or large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderately-high heat.  Add the chicken and cook, stirring, until almost done, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan.  Add the onion, garlic, and coriander.  Cook, stirring, until the onions are golden, about 4 minutes.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons sherry and the vinegar.  Cook, stirring, 1 minute longer. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Add the cabbage, water chestnuts, the remaining 4 teaspoons soy sauce, the tomato paste, red-pepper flakes, and water and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes longer.  Add the chicken and any accumulated juices, the cilantro, and the salt and cook, stirring, until the chicken is just done, 1 to 2 minutes longer. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  A simple sauce of garlic, hot pepper, sherry, wine vinegar, and tomato, adds intense flavor to this quick stir-fry and it practically makes itself while the chicken and cabbage cook.  Steamed rice is an ideal accompaniment.

             Stir-Fried Chicken With Lemongrass - {Ga Xao Xa}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry                         Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2                     lemongrass stalks -- outer leaves and
                        tough green tops removed, root ends
                        trimmed, and stalks finely ground
  2              large  garlic cloves -- peeled and minced
  4                     boneless chicken thighs
  1                     or more bird's eye or Thai chilies -- seeded and thinly
                        sliced diagonally
                        Scallion Oil -- (see recipe)
                        Nuoc Cham -- (see recipe)

Whisk the fish sauce and sugar until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Stir in 1 tablespoon oil, the lemongrass, and garlic, then add the chicken and mix to coat the pieces evenly.  Allow to marinate, refrigerated, for 2 hours. 

Heat the remaining oil in a wok or nonstick pan over high heat.  Cook the chicken with the chili until the chicken is cooked through and crisp at the edges, 5 to 7 minutes per side.  Serve over rice, with Scallion Oil and Nuoc Cham on the side. 

Variation:  Ga xao xa can also be made with chicken breast.  Thinly slice 1 pound breast meat against the grain.  Then marinate it as in step 1, reducing the time to 30 minutes.  In step 2, stir-fry until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes total. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nuoc Cham -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  raw shrimp -- sheeled, deveined,
                        and halved lengthwise
  1         tablespoon  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  pork loin -- cut into 1" cubes
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  cooking oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  water
  1                     onion -- cut into thin slices
  3                     carrots -- cut 2"-long slices
                        about 1/2" wide and 1/8" thick
  3               cups  bok choy cut in 1" pieces - (abt 1/2 lb)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  celery seeds
     1/2           cup  canned low-sodium chicken broth
                        or homemade stock
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice

In a medium bowl, toss the pork loin with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and the pepper.  In a large frying pan or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderately-high heat.  Add half the pork and cook, stirring, until browned, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove.  Repeat with another tablespoon of the oil and the remaining pork.  Remove. 

In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and water.  Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the pan.  Add the onion, carrots, bok choy, garlic, and celery seeds.  Cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Stir in the broth and orange juice and bring to a simmer.  Add the pork and any accumulated juices and the remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and simmer until the meat is just done, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens, about 1 minute. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Celery isn't among the vegetables in this tasty pork stir-fry, but the celery seeds will make you think there's a generous quantity.  Serve the stir-fry with steamed rice.

         Stir-Fried Rice Noodles With Sate - {Banh Pho Xao Sate}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish
                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  medium dried rice sticks
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- plus extra
                        if necessary
  1         tablespoon  Peanut, Garlic, And Chili Paste -- (see recipe)
  10            ounces  beef sirloin -- sliced thinly
                        against the grain
  2                     scallions -- root ends and
                        tough green tops removed, cut 1 1/2"-long
                        pieces, and halved lengthwise
  1                cup  mung bean sprouts -- root ends trimmed
                        Fish sauce (nuoc mam) -- to taste

Put the rice sticks in a bowl with lukewarm water to cover.  Let stand until pliable, about 20 minutes, and drain. 

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over high heat.  Stir-fry the beef and scallions until just cooked, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to a plate. 

Heat the Sate in the wok until fragrant, about 1 minute, add the rice noodles, and stir-fry, making sure each strand is evenly coated (if the noodles start to stick to each other or the bottom of the wok, add a little more vegetable oil), until cooked through, about 7 minutes. 

Add the beef and scallions to the noodles, then the mung bean sprouts; season to taste with the fish sauce and continue stir-frying until well mixed, 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer to a platter and serve hot. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                     Stir-Fried Rice With Vegetables

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Rice/Grains


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16            ounces  water
  7             ounces  long-grain white or brown rice
                        (or 6 oz rinsed and drained wild rice)
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  10            ounces  cut-up mixed fresh vegetables, such as
                        mushrooms- peeled water chestnuts- bell
                        peppers, jÌcama, or zucchini- snow peas,
                        bean sprouts, broccoli florets- radish or
                        daikon- and/or carrots
  2                     spring onions -- sliced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/8      teaspoon  crushed dried chili
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry

In a medium saucepan bring water to boiling.  Add uncooked rice to the boiling water.  Return to boiling; reduce heat.  Cover and simmer until rice is tender and water is absorbed, allowing 15 minutes for long-grain white rice, 35 minutes for brown rice, and 40 minutes for wild rice.  Remove from heat.  Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.  Set aside. 

In a wok or frying pan heat 1 tablespoon of the oil.  Add beaten eggs and cook without stirring for about 2 minutes, or until set.  Invert pan to remove egg; cut into strips.  Set aside. 

To the same pan add 1 tablespoon oil; stir-fry desired vegetables until crisp-tender.  Allow 1 to 2 minutes for mushrooms, water chestnuts, pepper (capsicum), jÌcama (yam bean), zucchini (courgettes), snow peas (mangetouts), and bean sprouts; 3 to 4 minutes for broccoli, radish, or daikon; and 4 to 5 minutes for carrots.  Remove from wok. 

Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil; stir-fry spring onions, garlic, and crushed dried chili for 30 seconds.  Add rice; cook for 2 minutes more.  Return egg strips and cooked vegetables to wok; add soy sauce and sherry.  Cover and cook for 2 minutes more, or until heated through. 

This recipe yields 6 servings as an accompaniment. 

Comments:  Choose from long-grain white, brown, or wild rice, and allow more cooking time for brown or wild rice.  You may even want to cook the rice a day ahead to save time when you're ready to stir-fry.

                Stir-Fried Vegetables With Toasted Cashews

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  canned low-sodium chicken broth
                        or homemade stock
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  3        tablespoons  cooking oil
     2/3           cup  cashew nuts
                        Dried red pepper flakes -- to taste
  1              pound  mushrooms -- sliced thin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4                     scallions -- white sliced thin,
                        green tops chopped and reserved separately
     3/4      teaspoon  Asian sesame oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  broccoli -- thick stems removed,
                        tops cut small florets - (abt 1 quart)
  1 1/2         pounds  napa Chinese cabbage - (abt 1/2 head) -- shredded
  1         tablespoon  oyster sauce
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce

In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the broth with the cornstarch.  In a wok or a large nonstick frying pan, heat 1/2 tablespoon of the cooking oil over moderately-high heat.  Add the cashews; cook, stirring, until starting to char, 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer the nuts to a medium bowl and add a pinch of red-pepper flakes. 

In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil over moderately-high heat.  Add the mushrooms and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to the bowl with the cashews.  Stir the scallion greens and sesame oil into the mushroom mixture. 

Heat the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of cooking oil over moderately-high heat.  Add the scallion bulbs and garlic; cook, stirring, about 30 seconds.  Add the broccoli and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the cabbage; cook, stirring, until the cabbage wilts, about 2 minutes.  Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons broth and 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, and the oyster and soy sauces.  Stir the cornstarch mixture, add it to the pan, and bring to a boil.  Cook, stirring, until the sauce coats the vegetables, about 1 minute.  Serve topped with the mushroom mixture. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  The crunch of the charred cashews and the meaty texture of the mushrooms are retained by cooking them separately and saving them for a topping instead of cooking them with the rest of the vegetables.  Serve the stir-fry with either white or brown rice.

                  Stuffed Tomatoes - {Ca Chua Nhoi Thit}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nuoc Cham -- (see recipe)
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  chicken broth or water
  1         tablespoon  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)
     1/4           cup  oyster sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  tomato paste
                        === TOMATOES AND FILLING ===
  4              large  tomatoes
  2                     dried Chinese mushrooms
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried tree ear mushrooms
     1/2         ounce  cellophane (bean thread) noodles
  8             ounces  ground pork
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2                     shallots -- thinly sliced
  2                     scallions -- thinly sliced
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Prepare the Nuoc Cham.  Set aside. 

Combine all of the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. 

Cut off the stem end of each tomato.  Using a spoon, gently scoop out the pulp.  Discard the tops and pulp.  Dry the insides of the tomatoes with paper towels. 

Soak the mushrooms in hot water and the noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.  Drain well.  Squeeze out the excess water from the mushrooms.  Cut off the stems and discard.  Mince the caps.  Coarsely chop the noodles. 

In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped mushrooms and noodles with the pork, half of the garlic, the shallots, scallions, sugar, fish sauce and egg.  Blend with your hands; set aside to marinate for 30 minutes. 

Stuff the pork mixture into the tomatoes, pressing firmly.  Smooth the top into a mounded dome. 

Heat the oil in a wok or skillet over moderate heat.  Place the stuffed tomatoes, stuffing-side down, in the hot oil.  Cover the wok and fry for 5 minutes.  Using a large spatula, gently turn the tomatoes (try not to break the skins), meat-side up, and cook for 3 minutes longer. 

Make a small space in the center of the wok and add the reserved garlic; fry until fragrant.  Stir the sauce mixture and pour into the wok.  Bring the sauce to a quick boil.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes, turning the tomatoes frequently to coat with the sauce. 

The tomatoes are ready when the stuffing has absorbed half of the sauce and the tomatoes are nicely glazed.  Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with white pepper.  Serve with plain rice and Nuoc Cham as part of a family meal. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Chinese
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  juice-pack pineapple chunks - (15 1/4 oz)
     1/4           cup  catsup
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  water
  4          teaspoons  sugar
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  12            ounces  boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- cut into 1" cubes
     3/4           cup  finely-crushed saltine crackers
  1         tablespoon  cooking oil
  1                     green sweet pepper -- cut into 1/2" pieces
  1                     red sweet pepper -- cut into 1/2" pieces
  4                     green onions -- bias-sliced 1 1/2"
                        pieces
                        Hot cooked rice -- (optional)

Drain pineapple, reserving 3/4 cup juice.  In a small bowl stir together the reserved pineapple juice, the catsup, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, vinegar, water, and sugar.  Set aside. 

In a medium mixing bowl stir together egg and 1 tablespoon cornstarch until smooth.  Add chicken pieces and stir to coat chicken with egg mixture.  Pour cracker crumbs into a shallow dish.  Roll chicken pieces in cracker crumbs to coat evenly. 

Pour cooking oil into a wok or large skillet.  (Add more oil as necessary during cooking.)  Preheat over medium-high heat.  Add half of the chicken to the wok.  Stir-fry about 3 minutes, or until no pink remains.  Remove chicken from wok and keep warm in a preheated 300 degree oven.  Repeat with remaining chicken. 

Add sweet peppers and green onions to wok; stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until crisp-tender.  Remove vegetables from wok. 

Stir pineapple juice mixture; add to the center of the wok.  Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly.  Cook and stir for 2 minutes more.  Return chicken, vegetables, and pineapple chunks to wok.  Stir all ingredients together to coat with sauce.  Cook and stir about 1 minute more, or until heated through.  If desired, serve with rice. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  We used cracker crumbs instead of the customary batter to coat the chicken pieces for this perennial favorite.  This not only decreases the preparation time, it reduces the fat content of the finished dish as well.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  canned low-sodium chicken broth
                        or homemade stock
  3        tablespoons  ketchup
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  oyster sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  sherry
  2                     red bell peppers -- cut into 3/4" pieces
  1 1/4           cups  long-grain rice
  1 1/2         pounds  medium shrimp -- shelled
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch
  3        tablespoons  cooking oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  2                     scallions -- white part chopped,
                        and green tops sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  Asian sesame oil

In a small bowl, combine the chicken broth, ketchup, soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt, and 1 tablespoon of the sherry.  Heat a wok or large frying pan over moderately-high heat until very hot.  Add the bell peppers and stir-fry until starting to blacken, about 5 minutes.  Remove. 

Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.  Stir in the rice and boil until just done, about 10 minutes.  Drain. 

Meanwhile, toss the shrimp with the remaining 2 tablespoons sherry and the cornstarch.  Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil in the wok or frying pan over moderately-high heat.  Add the shrimp and stir-fry until just done, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove the shrimp and add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil.  Reduce the heat to moderate and add the charred bell peppers, the garlic, ginger, the chopped scallions, and the red-pepper flakes.  Cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes. 

Increase the heat to high.  Add the broth mixture and boil until thickened, about 2 minutes.  Add the shrimp and sliced scallions and just heat through.  Drizzle the sesame oil over the top.  Serve the shrimp with the rice. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Traditional Szechuan dishes are often quite spicy, but we've given this recipe only a slight dose of heat.  If your taste runs to the incendiary, make yours hotter by adding more red-pepper flakes.

</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.  Stir in the rice and boil until just done, about 10 minutes.  Drain. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Meanwhile, toss the shrimp with the remaining 2 tablespoons sherry and the cornstarch.  Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil in the wok or frying pan over moderately-high heat.  Add the shrimp and stir-fry until just done, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove the shrimp and add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil.  Reduce the heat to moderate and add the charred bell peppers, the garlic, ginger, the chopped scallions, and the red-pepper flakes.  Cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Increase the heat to high.  Add the broth mixture and boil until thickened, about 2 minutes.  Add the shrimp and sliced scallions and just heat through.  Drizzle the sesame oil over the top.  Serve the shrimp with the rice.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Traditional Szechuan dishes are often quite spicy, but we&apos;ve given this recipe only a slight dose of heat.  If your taste runs to the incendiary, make yours hotter by adding more red-pepper flakes.

                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken breast halves
  2               cups  fresh pea pods (snow peas)
                        (or one 6-oz pkg frozen pea pods, thawed)
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar or white wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  chili oil
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper - (to 1/2 tspn)
  5             ounces  dried Chinese egg noodles
                        (or 8 oz fresh Chinese egg noodles)
  1         tablespoon  cooking oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              large  red or green sweet pepper -- cut thin strips
     1/4           cup  slices green onions
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped peanuts

Rinse chicken and pat dry.  Cut into 3/4-inch pieces.  Coarsely chop the pea pods.  In a small bowl stir together the soy sauce, vinegar, chili oil, and crushed red pepper.  Set aside. 

For dried noodles, in a large saucepan or pasta pot bring 3 quarts water to boiling.  Add noodles.  Reduce heat slightly.  Boil, uncovered, 4 to 6 minutes, or until tender, stirring occasionally.  (Prepare fresh noodles according to package directions.)  Drain. 

Pour cooking oil into a wok or large skillet.  (Add more oil as necessary during cooking).  Preheat over medium-high heat.  Stir-fry the garlic in hot oil for 15 seconds.  Add the pea pods, red or green pepper, and green onions; stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes, or until crisp-tender.  Remove the vegetables from the wok. 

Add half of the chicken to the hot wok.  Stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until no pink remains.  Remove the chicken from the wok.  Repeat with remaining chicken.  Return all chicken to the wok.  Add the soy sauce mixture to the wok.  Add the cooked vegetables and noodles.  Stir ingredients together to coat with soy sauce mixture.  Cook and stir about 1 minute more, or until heated through.  Sprinkle with peanuts.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 5 main-dish servings. 

Comments:  Chinese egg noodles are made from wheat flour, water, and egg and are shaped either round or flat.  They are available fresh or dried.  Many well-stocked supermarkets carry fresh noodles in the produce department along with spring-roll wrappers.  You can substitute any fresh ribbon pasta for the fresh Chinese noodles, if you prefer.

          Taro Soup With Ground Pork - {Canh Khoai Mon Thit Heo}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SOUP ===
  6             ounces  ground pork
  2                     scallions, white part only -- chopped
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce (nuoc mam) -- plus
  1           teaspoon  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1              pound  taro root
  1              quart  water
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === GARNISH ===
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh coriander (Chinese parsley)
  2                     scallion greens -- chopped

Combine the pork, scallions, pepper, and 1 teaspoon fish sauce and shape into 1-inch meatballs. 

Peel the taro and slice 1/2-inch thick or, if you like, "slice" Vietnamese fashion, which is not really slicing, as follows: after peeling, using a rounded 1-inch measuring spoon, scoop out pieces.  (This is similar to using a melon baller, except that the pieces are shallower in depth and wider over all.) 

Bring the water to a boil.  Drop in the meatballs and taro and cook at a boil for 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes, test to make certain the taro is soft; if not, cook a few minutes more. 

When the taro is ready, add 1 tablespoon fish sauce and 1 teaspoon salt to the soup.  Sprinkle with the coriander and scallion greens and serve with rice. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                  Thai Chicken And Rice - {Khao Man Gai}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry                         Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  finely-sliced red jalapeÒo pepper
  2        tablespoons  white rice vinegar
  1              whole  chicken
  8               cups  chicken stock
                        A few slices winter squash (phak thong)
  1 1/2           cups  long-grain Thai jasmine rice -- washed
                        === BEAN SAUCE ===
  4        tablespoons  fermented yellow bean sauce
  4        tablespoons  chicken broth -- from cooking
                        chicken
  1         tablespoon  dark sweet soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  pickled jalapeÒos -- (prepared earlier
                        as above)
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  palm sugar

At least a day before you want to eat the khao man gai, finely slice some red jalapeÒos and discard the seeds, then mix them with about twice their volume of white rice vinegar, and leave to marinade (you need at least a tablespoon of jalapeÒo peppers).  When you are ready to cook, you need about 8 cups of chicken stock. 

Place the chicken in a large casserole, and cover with the stock.  Add a few slices of phak thong (winter squash), to the pot, and simmer or poach over a low heat until the chicken is thoroughly cooked and tender. 

Remove and drain the chicken, then when it is cool enough to handle cut off the wings and legs and reserve them for other dishes.  Remove the two chicken breasts, and smack them with a cleaver to dislodge the skin which may be discarded if you are watching you weight.  Cut the breasts into strips about half an inch wide, and cut the strips into bite-sized pieces. 

Place one and a half cups of washed long-grain Thai jasmine rice in a saucepan, and add two and half cups of the chicken broth from cooking the chicken.  Cook over moderate heat until the liguid is absorbed, and the rice is cooked (the finished rice should be slightly moist). 

Serve the chicken on a bed of the chicken steamed rice, garnished with coriander leaves, and accompanied by a good supply of sliced cucumber, with a cup of the chicken broth, and few pieces of squash as an accompanying soup, garnished with coriander leaves. 

This meal is accompanied by the following two sauces: 

Bean Sauce:  This is mixed and tasted, if required you can add extra sugar, and some of the vinegar used to pickle the jalapeÒos, for balance. 

The second "sauce" consists of half a cup of freshly ground ginger. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This dish is a common "fast food" in Thailand.  Thailand is awash with streetside vendors who serve everything from snacks and desserts to wholesome, nutritious meals.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  peanut oil
  6             ounces  sen mee instant rice noodles
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  3        tablespoons  thinly-sliced pickled garlic -- (see below)
  3        tablespoons  thinly-sliced shallots
                        (or small red or purple onions
  4             ounces  belly pork -- cut small dice
  4             ounces  medium shrimp -- shelled and deveined
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                     tomato
  2        tablespoons  tamarind sauce
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  palm sugar
  7                     fresh kaffir lime leaves - (to 8) -- shredded
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
                        === PICKLED GARLIC ===
     2/3           cup  sliced peeled garlic
  1           teaspoon  palm sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  MSG -- (optional)
                        Vinegar -- as needed
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Thinly-sliced green onions
                        Julienned red and green jalapeÒo peppers
     1/2           cup  cubed hard tofu

For the Pickled Garlic:  Peel and slice two thirds of a cup of garlic, place it in a 1 pint jar.  Add 1 teaspoon of palm sugar, one teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of MSG (optional but recomended) and top up with vinegar. 

Heat about 3 cups of peanut oil until very hot (preferably smoking), then while it is heating, crush the noodles in a large plastic bag.  Drop the noodles, a small quantity at a time, into the hot oil.  They immediately puff up and turn golden brown.  Remove at once with a slotted spoon, or a wire strainer. 

When all the noodles have been cooked and set aside to drain on kitchen paper, drizzle the egg into the oil to form a ribbon of cooked egg, then take it from the oil and chop it up.  Finally deep-fry the pieces of tofu until golden brown and set aside. 

Now pour off and reserve all but a little of the oil, and stir-fry the garlic pickle and shallots.  Next stir-fry the pork until the fat is firm and the meat cooked to your taste.  Stir-fry the shrimp briefly until they turn pink.  Mix the cooked ingredients, except the tofu, and transfer to a serving platter. 

Combine the ingredients of the sauce, and place it in a small bowl.  Ladle it over the food as required (if you do it too early the noodles will go soggy).  Garnish the dish with the green onions, jalapeÒo peppers and cooked tofu. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Mee krob is an easy dish that makes a pleasant snack, or a useful accompaniment to hotter foods.  The tangy sweet and sour sauce is optional though certianly normal, and hardened vegetarians could easily leave out the pork and shrimp.  In Thailand this is almost always prepared in a wok.  If you feel nervous about deep frying in a wok, feel free to use a saucepan or electric deep fryer.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  coconut milk
  1                cup  water
  4                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla or rosewater -- (optional)
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  shredded coconut -- (see below)
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- for garnish

Stir-fry the coconut until golden (optionally use a few pieces of fresh corn...  Thais often flavor ice cream with things considered unusual to western tastes). 

Heat the coconut milk and water over medium heat, stirring continuously for a couple of minutes.  Do not allow to boil. 

In a bowl beat two eggs, plus two yolks, then add the other ingredients, and whisk gently. 

Transfer the mixture to a double boiler over gently boiling water, and slowly blend in the hot coconut milk, stirring until the mixture thickens to form a continuous slightly sticky coat on the back of a spoon lifted from the mixture. 

Remove from the heat and allow to cool, then transfer to a metal ice cream tray or similar container and place in the coldest part of the freezer for one hour. 

Remove to a food processor and beat slowly until smooth (this incorporates some air into the mixture and prevents it becoming too hard), then return to the freezer and complete the freezing process. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Thai ice cream is made from coconut milk, and as such is a totally non-dairy (ie vegetarian) product.

  1                cup  sliced ginger
  2               cups  water
  1 1/2           cups  palm sugar
                        baking soda -- as needed
                        lime juice -- as needed
                        === ICE CREAM ===
  2        tablespoons  shredded coconut -- (see below)
  1                     pineapple
  2               cups  coconut milk
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  corn kernels -- pureed
  1           teaspoon  vanilla or rosewater -- (optional)
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  sugar - (to 1 cup)

If you are using tender young ginger you may leave the skin on.  Older ginger should be peeled.  This may be easier after it has been sliced. 

Slice the ginger into uniform roundels about an eighth of an inch thick, and then roll them until they are half the original thickness.  Dust the ginger lightly with the baking soda, and leave to stand for about 10 minutes. 

Remove the baking soda by vigorously brushing with a stiff bristled brush to produce a slightly matte texture to the surface, and then immerse in lime juice for an hour.  This has the effect of heightening the flavor, and also giving the ginger a delicate pink color. 

Bring the water to a boil, and stirring continuously add the sugar a little at a time until all is dissolved and forms a sticky, syrupy consistency.  If necessary add a touch more water to ensure all the sugar is dissolved.  Reduce the heat to very low and add the ginger slices and simmer, very gently, for 10 minutes, then turn off the stove and allow the ginger to cool naturally. 

Remove the ginger from the liquid and drain it (you don't have to be overly enthusiastic about this, but it shouldn't be too wet either), and put it in a sterile preserving jar.  Keep in the refrigerator for at least a week before use.  Reserve the ginger syrup in another sterilized jar, to pour over the ice cream. 

For the Ice Cream:  In a dry wok or skillet, over medium heat, toast the coconut 'meat' until golden brown, and set aside to cool. 

Split the pineapple in half lengthwise, and scoop out the woody heart of the fruit and then place the two halves in the refrigerator to cool. 

Combine the coconut milk and water, and warm it, then stir in the sugar, and stir until dissolved. 

In a blender, puree the corn kernels (or use a can of creamed corn), and then stir it into the coconut milk, combining thoroughly.  Add the rosewater if you are using it, and a dash of salt and taste for flavor balance. 

Transfer to a mixing bowl and, with a hand beater, whisk to thoroughly to incorporate air.  Pour the mixture into the two hollows in the pineapples and transfer to the freezer, and chill until set.  Any extra ice cream can be cooled in ramekin dishes or similar. 

Serving:  Slice the pineapple into slices, and serve with any excess ice-cream also shared out, decorating each slice with pieces of candied ginger.  Fold the fried coconut into the reserved ginger syrup, and pour over the slices of ice cream, decorate with mint and lime leaves.  Enjoy 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  In order to get the correct effect in the ginger it is 'distressed' a little first.  We do this by rolling it through a heavy roller designed to tenderize dried squid.  However you should be able to get a similar effect with a pasta roller or even a rolling pin.  The slices should be of uniform thickness so I suggest a sharp kitchen slicer rather than a hand held knife. 

For restaurant presentation the slices of ginger are cut to uniform pretty shapes using small confectioners' biscuit cutters, or the type used to cut out cake decorations. 

Two things about this ice cream are uniquely Thai; firstly it isn't made with animal milk, but with coconut milk, and secondly it is not usually flavored with fruit, but rather with savories such as corn, sweet potato, or herbs.

                        === DRESSING STAGE 2 ===
  1                cup  chopped tomatoes -- (see below)
     1/4           cup  lime juice
     1/4           cup  palm sugar
                        === SALAD ===
     1/3           cup  crispy deep-fried catfish pieces
     1/3           cup  chicken (preferably steamed, but any
                        cooked chicken will do)
     1/3           cup  pork (stir fried, but again any
                        cooked pork will do)
     1/3           cup  Raw green leaves, such as
                        spinach or cabbage
     1/3           cup  bean sprouts
     1/3           cup  mushrooms
     1/3           cup  pineapple chunks (preferably fresh)
     1/3           cup  mango
     1/3           cup  orange segments

The salad dressing - Stage 1 

Component 1, prik nam si-iew wan:  Place a quarter cup each of freshly grated ginger, chopped shallots (small red or purple onions) and sliced jalapeÒo peppers in a 1 cup container, and fill with sweet dark soy sauce.  Stir to make sure there aren't any air bubbles and top up if necesary.  Seal and keep in the refrigerator for a week. 

Component 2, prik nam pla:  Place a quarter cup each of chopped onions, sliced celery and julienned turnips in a 1 cup container.  Fill with fish sauce.  Stir briefly and top up if needed.  Keep in the fridge for a week. 

Component 3, prik dong:  Place a qurter cup of sliced red Thai chile peppers in a half cup container and fill with white rice vinegar.  Cover and keep in the fridge for a week. 

The salad dressing - Stage 2 

A couple of hours before you are ready to eat the salad, take some tomatoes and drop them briefly in boiling water, then skin them.  Discard the seeds, and coarsely chop them to yield one cup of chopped tomatoes.  Combine all the ingredients, and add a quarter cup of palm sugar and a quarter cup of lime juice. 

Now, if you wish the dressing to have a smooth sauce like consistency, put it in a liquidizer and blend until smooth.  If you want a more salsa like consistency, simply omit this step. 

Place the combined ingredients in a sauce pan and simmer until reduced to suit your tastes (you need about two cups of dressing). 

The salad:  Combine the salad ingredients, add enough dressing to coat thoroughly, and serve. 

Additional prepared dressing, prik nam siew wan, pak nam pla, and prik dong (above) as well as Thai chili powder and sugar complete the presentation. 

The dish can be served on its own "between meals", with sticky rice for lunch, or as part of a multi-course dinner. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

             Thai Noodle Soup With Pork - {Yum Wunsen Sai Mu}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE SOUP ===
  8             ounces  ground pork
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  4               cups  soup stock
  2             ounces  bean thread noodles (wunsen) -- soaked in warm water
                        for about 15 minutes
     1/4           cup  fish sauce
  1                cup  sliced cabbage or kale
  2                     spring onions (green onions/scallions) -- thinly sliced
                        including the green segment
     1/4           cup  chopped whole coriander plant -- including root
  1           teaspoon  Thai pepper powder - (about)
                        === FOR THE MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  Maggi seasoning sauce
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  Thai pepper powder
  1           teaspoon  rice flour

Mix the marinade ingredients, mix with the ground pork, and make the pork into small meat balls, then set aside and leave to marinate for 3 or 4 hours. 

Soak and drain the noodles. 

Bring the stock to a boil and add all the ingredients except the noodles, and continue to boil until the meatballs are cooked through, when they will float.  Remove from the heat, pour into a serving bowl and add the noodles (note the immersion in the near boiling soup is enough to cook the noodles). 

Serve with the usual Thai table condiments as well as Thai chili powder, and ground peanuts. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  When a soup is described as a "yam", it means that everything is just tossed into the stock as it simmers.  This soup is also sometimes called Kaeng Jued Wunsen (Kaeng Jued implies a rather bland soup -- by Thai standards!).  This can be made with a variety of ingredients, but the most interesting are probably pork (as here), beef, chicken, shrimp, meat balls, fish balls, shrimp balls, or one of the various Thai sausages, as well as vegetarian options (for a quick veggie variation try marinating some tofu in dark sweet soy sauce for about 3 hours and then using that instead of the pork).

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Bring the stock to a boil and add all the ingredients except the noodles, and continue to boil until the meatballs are cooked through, when they will float.  Remove from the heat, pour into a serving bowl and add the noodles (note the immersion in the near boiling soup is enough to cook the noodles).

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Serve with the usual Thai table condiments as well as Thai chili powder, and ground peanuts.

</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  When a soup is described as a &quot;yam&quot;, it means that everything is just tossed into the stock as it simmers.  This soup is also sometimes called Kaeng Jued Wunsen (Kaeng Jued implies a rather bland soup -- by Thai standards!).  This can be made with a variety of ingredients, but the most interesting are probably pork (as here), beef, chicken, shrimp, meat balls, fish balls, shrimp balls, or one of the various Thai sausages, as well as vegetarian options (for a quick veggie variation try marinating some tofu in dark sweet soy sauce for about 3 hours and then using that instead of the pork).

                Thai Red Pork With Rice - {Khao Mu Daeng}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pork                            Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  pork loin, pork steak, or pork chops
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/4           cup  chopped tomato from which the
                        seeds and skin have been discarded
  4        tablespoons  fish sauce
  4        tablespoons  honey
  2                     preserved plums -- chopped
                        (preserved Chinese plums are the
                        best for this recipe)

The marinade is made by mixing the ingredients in a blender.  Thoroughly paint the meat with it and leave to stand for several hours.  If you cannot cook in a suitably smoky atmosphere, add a little Liquid Smoke to the marinade.  If you want it a little redder use cochineal food coloring. 

Place the meat, and the marinade, in a casserole, and add about a cup of water or pork stock.  Bring it to a boil on the stove top, then reduce to low heat and cover, and continue to cook slowly until just about cooked.  The meat is then removed from the liquid in which it has cooked, drained, then placed under a grill or broiler on high heat and browned.  Allow it to cool and then slice it into strips, and the strips into bite-sized pieces. 

Bring the cooking liquid back to the boil, and add two tablespoons of dark sweet soy, and 2 tablespoons of honey and two tablespoons of vinegar, and reduce to a thick sauce like consistency, adding a little rice flour if necesary to thicken it. 

Serve the pork on a bed of steamed Thai jasmine rice, garnished with coriander leaves, with a supply of cucumber slices, and place the gravy in a small bowl for dipping. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Mu daeng is a complement to khao man gai.  Indeed in Thailand vendors that sell one very often sell the other, but nothing else.  Like khao man gai a good lunch time meal can be had for a dollar or so.  An interesting style for two people is to buy a portion of khao man gai and a portion of khao mu daeng, and to share the meals. 

Traditionally the pork was marinaded in a highly complex mixtrue of herbs and berries to turn it sweet and red.  Today the marinade at most street vendors stalls is water to which a little artificial red food dye and a dash of sugar is added. 

In Thailand the food is cooked by placing it on a grating in an iron bowl hanging from a tripod over a charcoal brazier, the whole being covered with a large metal drum, such as a 55 gallon oil drum, to trap the smoke and enhance the flavor of the meat.  If you have a domestic food smoker, or can improvise one with a barbeque, then go ahead, otherwise, add a little "Liquid Smoke" and cook the dish as directed.

       Thai Sticky Rice Steeped In Coconut Milk - {Khao Neeo Moon}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  sticky rice
  1         tablespoon  salt
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2 1/4            cup  coconut milk
                        === SHRIMP TOPPING ===
  1                cup  finely-chopped shrimp
  1                cup  grated coconut
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped coriander root
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
  2          teaspoons  salt - (to 3 tspns)
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh kaffir lime leaves
                        === CUSTARD TOPPING ===
  1                cup  coconut milk
     1/2         pound  palm sugar
  4                     eggs
                        === CANDIED COCONUT TOPPING ===
  2               cups  shredded coconut
  1 1/2           cups  palm sugar
  1 1/2           cups  water, scented with jasmine essence

Prepare the sticky rice as per detailed instructions.  Dissolve salt and sugar in the coconut milk, and heat stirring to prevent lumps.  When coconut milk boils, remove from heat and set 3/4 cup aside to be used when serving. 

Place cooked sticky rice in a container with tightly fitting lid, and pour in remaining coconut milk.  Stir vigorously, and cover, and set aside for awhile to allow coconut milk to mingle with the rice thoroughly. 

When serving, spoon some of the coconut milk set aside earlier over the rice before adding toppings (see below).  Note: be sure to mix warm coconut milk with sticky rice immediately after the sticky rice is finished cooking. 

Shrimp Topping:  Chop shrimp and coconut together and add a little yellow food coloring.  Pound pepper and coriander root in a mortar until ground and mixed thoroughly, and fry in the oil until fragrant, then add shrimp and coconut and fry until done, seasoning to taste with salt and sugar.  Remove from pan and sprinkle with chopped coriander. 

Custard Topping:  Mix coconut milk, palm sugar and eggs, beat and steam in double boiler over vigorously boiling water for 25 to 30 minutes. 

Candied Coconut Topping:  Mix palm sugar with the water, heat until dissolved, add coconut and cook over low heat to a thick, syrupy consistency.  Cool, then place in a lidded container scented with a fragrant candle. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This recipe calls for various toppings.  The toppings should be spooned over the prepared sweet rice.

Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pineapple
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots - (to 3 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  grated ginger - (to 2 tbspns)
  4                     jalapeÒo peppers - (to 5)
                        Green of 2 spring onions -- coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped coriander/cilantro
  2        tablespoons  dried shrimp
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped garlic - (to 3 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce - (to 2 tbspns)
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2               cups  cold steamed Thai jasmine rice
                        Coriander/cilantro leaves -- for garnish

Cut the pineapple in half lengthwise, and scoop out the fruit, then chop it into bite-sized chunks.  Put the fruit in a bowl and add the shallots, jalapeÒo, ginger, scallion and coriander, mix and set aside.  Add a pinch of salt to bring out the juice. 

In a wok, heat about a tablespoon of oil, and stir-fry the shrimp until crispy, and the oil is aromatic.  Remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon and drain, then set aside. 

Add a further tablespoon of oil, and stir-fry the garlic until golden brown.  Add the rice, and stir thoroughly.  Add the fish sauce and sugar, and continue stirring.  When the rice is heated through, add the pineapple mixture and cooked shrimp, and stir until thoroughly heated through.  Pour the mixture into the pineapple shells, garnish and serve.  (Note: If you prefer fried rice to be darkish brown in color, then replace half the fish sauce with dark sweet soy sauce.) 

Variation:  Do not cook the fruit mixture.  Instead put the fruit mixture and the stir fried rice in the fridge (separately) and chill all the ingredients.  Just before serving mix them and put them in the pineapple skins.  If you are serving cold then you can also add a few mareschino cherries as garnish.  This cold variant makes an excellent counterpoint to hot curries and spicy chilli dishes on a hot day. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is an unusual recipe for Thai food because it is essentially a vegetarian dish -- not common in Thailand, where even nominally vegetarian dishes often contain meat.  For two people you need a medium sized pineapple: choose carefully it should be sweet and juicy.

                        === MARINADE ===
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 5) -- minced
  1             medium  egg -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch/cornflour
  1         tablespoon  rice wine
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  3        tablespoons  sweet dark soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  oyster sauce
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground ginger
  1         tablespoon  chopped green onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped shallots or small red
                        or purple onions
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced Thai chile peppers -- (optional)
                        === BEEF AND NOODLES ===
  8             ounces  beef -- sliced paper thin
  8             ounces  fresh wide rice noodles
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar
  2        tablespoons  oyster sauce
  2        tablespoons  sweet dark soy sauce
  1                cup  broccoli florets
     1/2           cup  coconut milk -- (optional)

Combine marinade ingredients in a bowl.  Mix well.  Add the beef slices and mix well to thoroughly coat beef.  Marinate for about an hour. 

Cook the noodles until tender, in plain water, then put in cold water to halt the cooking process.  Heat a wok and a little oil to stir-fry the marinaded beef until it just begins to cook (because it is cut very thin, this is quite quick so be careful not to overcook).  Add the noodles and the remaining ingredients, and stir until blended and heated through.  Taste the sauce for balance of flavors (it should be just on the sweet side with a salty tang). 

Serve with rice and the usual Thai table condiments as well as ground Thai chili powder and sugar. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Si-iew (pronounce approximately "see yew") is the name for sweet dark soy sauce in the dominant local Chinese dialect.  Pad si-iew is a favorite lunch dish, a Thai version of fast food (you may omit the coconut milk if you want to reduce calories).

                Sauces                          Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  pineapple juice
  1                cup  coconut "nectar" (try to use the
                        watery liquid not the thicker cream)
  1                cup  tamarind sauce
     1/2           cup  lime juice
  3        tablespoons  coconut cream
  1         tablespoon  red curry paste
  1           teaspoon  grated ginger

Mix the juices in a saucepan and simmer to reduce to 2 cups of liquid.  In a wok or skillet over medium heat, warm the coconut cream, and add the curry paste and ginger, and stir until the mixture becomes aromatic.  Skim off and discard any oil that forms on the surface.  Stir the curry mix into the juices, and then cool. 

Will keep for 2 to 3 weeks in a refrigerator. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is a simple, Thai-style, sweet and sour sauce.  Note that it isn't pink! 

This is primarily a salad dressing, but, since salads in Thailand are often cooked, even made from meats, the uses are somewhat wider than a simple dressing.

           Thai Vegetarian Coconut Soup With Galanga And Squash

Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             stalks  lemongrass
  2               cans  coconut milk
  1 1/2           cups  Vegetable Stock
  20                    quarter-sized slices fresh galanga
                        or 10 large pieces dried galanga
  10                    peppercorns
  20                    fresh kaffir lime leaves
  1                     squash - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
                        (butternut squash is great
                        for this recipe)
  6             ounces  fresh mushrooms -- sliced
  8             ounces  firm tofu -- cut into
                        bite-sized chunks
  1         tablespoon  thin soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  3                     green onions -- thinly sliced

Clean the lemongrass stalks by removing and trimming dried hard root and brown leaves, reducing to clean stalks about 6 inches long including the bulbous base.  Using the blunt edge of a cleaver blade or the side of an unopened can, bruise each stalk by whacking it firmly at 2-inch intervals and rolling it over to bruise on all sides.  Cut into 2-inch lengths. 

In a large saucepan combine the coconut milk and vegetable stock, and bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat.  Stir in the lemongrass, galanga, peppercorns, and half of the lime leaves; adjust the heat to maintain an active simmer. 

Cut the squash into bite-sized (peeled) pieces; you should have 3 to 4 cups.  Add to the simmering soup along with the mushrooms.  Increase the heat to medium-high and bring soup back to a gentle boil.  Cook for 10 minutes.  Add the tofu and cook until the squash is tender but still firm and the tofu is heated through, about 5 minutes longer. 

Remove the soup from the heat and use tongs to remove and discard the lemongrass, galanga or ginger, and lime leaves.  Stir in the soy sauce, salt, lime juice, cilantro, green onions, and the remaining lime leaves.  Taste and add more salt, soy sauce, or lime juice if you like.  Transfer to a serving bowl and serve hot.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              piece  fresh ginger root - (1" long)
  3                     scallions (green onions) -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  lemon grass -- chopped
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- sliced
     3/4         pound  broccoli -- cut small chunks
  2                     carrots -- cut small chunks
  1              quart  vegetarian "chicken" broth
  1         tablespoon  Thai red curry paste - (to 2 tbspns)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     lemon -- sliced thin
                        Shredded fresh basil

Heat the oil in a wok or saucepan, and fry the garlic until it starts to brown (to make a spicy version of this dish, start by frying one tablespoon Thai chile paste with garlic and sweet basil in the oil instead of garlic). 

Stir-fry broccoli and carrots until crisp-tender.  Remove and set aside.  Fry the ginger, scallons, and lemongrass for a few minutes, then add the mushrooms and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes. 

Add the broth, red curry paste, salt, and black pepper.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat.  Simmer, covered, for 5 minutes.  Add broccoli and carrots.  Heat briefly. 

Serve in bowls and sprinkle with Thai pepper powder and fried garlic.  Eat with steamed Thai jasmine rice.  Garnish with fresh lime and a pinch of basil.

                Sauces                          Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  roasted unsalted peanuts
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4) -- chopped
  1              ounce  chopped onion
  1         tablespoon  red or massaman curry paste -- (to 2 tbspns)
  1           teaspoon  fish sauce
  8        tablespoons  coconut milk
  4          teaspoons  lime juice - (to 6 tspns) -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  palm sugar - (to 3 tspns)

First grind or crush the peanuts to a fairly fine powder.  Then combine them with the remaining ingredients (except the lime juice), to form a smooth sauce.  If the sauce is too thick, you can thin it with a little chicken stock.  Now add the lime juice, tasting as you progress to check the balance of flavors is correct. 

Note; use red curry paste with beef or pork satay, massaman (as above) with chicken.  If you are doing shrimp satay then use half the quantity of massaman paste. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Peanut sauce is actually of Malaysian or Indonesian origin.  Very few dishes served in Thailand actually use peanut sauce but it has become a very popular part of American-Thai food.  The peanut sauce above is our favorite variation.  If you prefer, peanut butter can be used rather than fresh peanuts. 

A fine accompaniment to any Thai dish served with peanut sauce is "A jad", an authentic Thai cucumber sauce.

<IngR name="fish sauce" unit="teaspoon" qty="1"></IngR>

<DirS>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;First grind or crush the peanuts to a fairly fine powder.  Then combine them with the remaining ingredients (except the lime juice), to form a smooth sauce.  If the sauce is too thick, you can thin it with a little chicken stock.  Now add the lime juice, tasting as you progress to check the balance of flavors is correct. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Note; use red curry paste with beef or pork satay, massaman (as above) with chicken.  If you are doing shrimp satay then use half the quantity of massaman paste. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields ?? servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Peanut sauce is actually of Malaysian or Indonesian origin.  Very few dishes served in Thailand actually use peanut sauce but it has become a very popular part of American-Thai food.  The peanut sauce above is our favorite variation.  If you prefer, peanut butter can be used rather than fresh peanuts. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;A fine accompaniment to any Thai dish served with peanut sauce is &quot;A jad&quot;, an authentic Thai cucumber sauce.

        Thai-Style Wide Noodles In Thick Sauce - {Kuaitiao Radna}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  thinly-sliced bite-size poirk loin pieces
  1                cup  rice noodles -- soaked in warm
                        water until soft (10 minutes)
  1 1/2           cups  broccoli
  4                     fresh kaffir lime leaves - (to 5) -- shredded
     1/4           cup  fresh basil leaves -- shredded (optional)
     1/4           cup  mushrooms
  1                cup  water or pork stock
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce
  2        tablespoons  sweet soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  Maggi seasoning
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  tapioca starch -- mixed in
                        a little water
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced garlic
  1           teaspoon  MSG -- (optional)
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Combine the Maggi sauce, fish sauce and soy sauce, and add the pepper and MSG, and marinade the meat for about one hour, before draining, reserving the marinade. 

While the noodles are soaking to soften them, prepare the broccoli by cutting up three quarters of a cup of florets, and peeling then slicing the stems, and chopping the leaves to form three quarters of a cup of thinly sliced stems and leaves. 

In a large skillet or wok, over medium heat, saute the garlic in a little oil, and then stir-fry the noodles until they begin to turn brown.  Stir continuously to avoid the noodles sticking together.  Remove them, and turn the heat to high, and briefly stir-fry the pork to seal it. 

In a large saucepan, heat the water or stock, stir in and boil briefly the marinade.  Add the tapioca starch to thicken, then add the meat and other ingredients except the noodles.  Stir occasionally until the meat and vegetables are nearly cooked to your taste.  Add the noodles and continue to cook for about 3 to 4 minutes to complete the dish. 

Serve in individual bowls. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Recommendation:  Add 1 tablespoon Thai chili powder, and a tablespoon of pickled chili sauce (prik dong -- see below), and a little more sugar.  Then taste, and if necesary add fish sauce, sweet soy, and additional fresh chilis and pickled chilis.  You might also add a little pickled ginger and pickled garlic (kratiem dong --see below). 

The obvious cautions apply to following this last stage blindly: at this point the clear sauce has turned fiery red and the heat of the chilis is accentuated by the vinegar.  The general method however is appropriate, but you might care to procede more cautiously. 

Prik dong:  Put two thirds of a cup of finely sliced Thai chile peppers in a 1 pint jar, and fill with white rice vinegar. 

Kratiem dong:  Peel and slice two thirds of a cup of garlic, place it in the 1 pint jar, add 1 teaspoon of palm sugar, and one teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of MSG (optional but recomended) and topped up with white rice vinegar. 

Comments:  The lime leaves and basil leaves are optional.  The MSG is of course optional as well.  Kuaitiao dishes are common 'hawker' food in Thailand and are usually prepared fairly blandly.  The bowl of noodles is then seasoned to taste from the seasonings on the table.

Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  dried shiitake mushrooms
  6               cups  chicken stock or vegetable stock
  20                    polygonum (rau ram) leaves -- plus extra
                        for garnish
                        (or 10 cilantro sprigs, plus extra leaves
                        for garnish)
  6             ounces  baby bok choy or spinach -- root ends trimmed,
                        and leaves separated
  10            ounces  medium-firm tofu -- rinsed, drained,
                        and cut into 1/2" cubes
                        Coarse sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                     scallion -- trimmed, and thinly
                        sliced diagonally

Put the mushrooms in a bowl with hot water to cover, and set a plate over the bowl to prevent steam from escaping.  Let stand until the mushrooms rehydrate, about 20 minutes.  Squeeze the mushrooms between the palms of your hands to get rid of the excess water.  Using a paring knife, remove any stems from the mushrooms and julienne the caps. 

Pour the stock into a pot and bring it to a gentle boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the rau ram leaves, and simmer partially covered until ready to use. 

Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil.  Wash the bok choy under cold running water, then drain.  Blanch the leaves in the boiling salted water until cooked but still firm, about 1 minute. 

With a slotted spoon, remove the bok choy, drain, and add to the stock along with the tofu.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, and simmer over low heat until the tofu is heated through, about 2 minutes. 

Serve hot -- in a communal bowl or individual soup bowls -- garnish with fresh rau ram leaves and scallion. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                Vegetable Stir-Fry With Ginger Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                         Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  cooking oil
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         large head  bok choy - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- stalks cut
                        into 1/2" pieces, leaves shredded
     1/2         pound  snow peas
  10                    radishes -- quartered
  4          teaspoons  soy sauce
     1/2         pound  spinach -- stems removed,
                        and leaves washed well
     1/2         pound  firm tofu -- cut into 3/4" dice

In a small glass or stainless-steel bowl, combine the ginger, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil, the sesame oil, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and the pepper.  Set aside. 

In a wok or a large nonstick frying pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons cooking oil over moderately-high heat.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the bok-choy stalks and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the snow peas and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the radishes and the soy sauce and cook, stirring, for 1 minute longer. 

Add the bok-choy leaves, the spinach, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt to the pan.  Cook, tossing gently, until the leaves just wilt, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add all but 1 tablespoon of the vinaigrette and toss to coat.  Remove the vegetables from the pan. 

In the same pan, heat the remaining tablespoon of vinaigrette over moderately-high heat.  Add the tofu and cook, turning occasionally, until warmed through, about 2 minutes.  Return the vegetables to the pan and stir gently to mix. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Fresh and green and bursting with flavor, this stir-fry is like a little taste of springtime that you can serve any time of year.  Carrots, red bell pepper, or asparagus (if it really is springtime) will make the dish even prettier.  Serve the medley with rice.

Categories    : Accompaniment                   Vegetables
                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam) -- plus
  2        tablespoons  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1              large  turnip
  2             medium  carrots
  1         tablespoon  salt
  12             small  shallots -- peeled
  12             whole  garlic cloves -- peeled
  12                    fresh red chile peppers

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. 

Combine the fish sauce, sugar and 1 1/2 cups of water in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil and boil for 2 minutes over high heat.  Cool thoroughly. 

Peel the turnip and carrots and cut into sticks 1/2 by 1/2 by 1 1/2 inches long.  Rub the vegetables with the salt; let stand 30 minutes in the sink.  Rinse under cold running water to remove all the salt.  Squeeze out the water and pat dry. 

Spread the turnip and carrot sticks on a baking sheet or roasting pan.  Place in the oven and leave the door ajar.  Let dry out for about 2 hours, turning the vegetables every 30 minutes.  The vegetables are ready when they have shrunk by two thirds.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool thoroughly.  (Note: It is very important to let the boiled liquid and the vegetables cool before combining.  The cooling prevents the vegetables from fermenting.) 

Place the dried turnip and carrot sticks in the bottom of a 1-quart Mason jar.  Layer the shallots, garlic and chiles on top.  Pour the fish sauce-sugar mixture over the vegetables and close the jar tightly.  Refrigerate. 

After 2 weeks, the vegetables are ready.  They can be eaten at once or refrigerated for several months.  Drain before serving. 

This recipe yields 2 cups.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Chinese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Chinese dried mushrooms
  2             ounces  cellophane (bean thread) noodles or rice
                        vermicelli
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  grated peeled fresh ginger
  2               cups  shredded green cabbage
  2                     carrots -- peeled and grated
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh cilantro (fresh coriander)
  1                cup  fresh bean sprouts -- rinsed
  2          teaspoons  fish sauce
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch (cornflour) -- mixed in
  2        tablespoons  water
  18                    frozen spring roll wrappers - (to 20) -- thawed
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying
                        Thai sweet chili sauce -- for serving

Place mushrooms in small bowl, add boiling water to cover and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes.  Drain and squeeze out excess liquid.  Thinly slice mushrooms, discarding tough stems. 

Soak noodles in boiling water for 10 minutes.  Drain and roughly chop into short lengths. 

In wok or frying pan over medium-high heat, warm 2 tablespoons oil.  Add onion, garlic and ginger and cook until softened, about 2 minutes.  Add cabbage and stir-fry until cabbage is softened, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in carrots, cilantro, bean sprouts, noodles, mushrooms and fish sauce.  Mix well and cool completely. 

Separate spring roll wrappers, place on a work surface and cover with damp kitchen towel.  Working with one wrapper at a time, place on work surface.  Using your fingertips, wet edges with cornstarch and water mixture.  Place 1 heaped tablespoon filling in middle of wrapper.  Roll up diagonally, tucking in edges.  Seal edge with cornstarch and water mixture.  Repeat with remaining wrappers. 

Heat oil in wok or frying pan until it reaches 375 degrees on deep-frying thermometer or until small bread cube dropped in oil sizzles and turns golden.  Working in batches, add rolls and fry until golden, 1 to 2 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, remove from pan and drain on paper towels. 

Serve hot, accompanied with chili sauce. 

This recipe yields 18 to 20 rolls.

                  Vietnamese Fried Chicken - {Ga Chien}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry                         Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nuoc Cham -- (see recipe)
  6                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  4                     shallots -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  4                     chicken legs with thighs attached -- (abt 2 lbs)
                        all-purpose flour -- for dredging
                        vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

Prepare the Nuoc Cham.  Set aside. 

In a mortar or blender, pound or grind the garlic, shallots and sugar to a fine paste.  Add the fish sauce, soy sauce and white pepper to taste.  Stir to blend. 

Rub the paste on the chicken legs.  Marinate for at least 1 hour in a shallow pan. 

Halve the chicken legs at the joint and dredge them with flour; shake to remove any excess flour. 

Heat 3 inches of oil in a wok or deep fryer to 375 degrees.  This temperature must be maintained for the entire frying process.  Deep-fry the chicken pieces, a few at a time, turning once, until golden and tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels; keep warm. 

Continue frying the remaining chicken pieces.  The skin of the chicken should be crispy and the meat very tender and highly aromatic.  If a crispier skin is desired, deep-fry briefly a second time. 

Hack the chicken pieces into bite-size morsels and reassemble on a serving platter.  Serve hot or at room temperature, with rice and Nuoc Cham. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Vegetables                      Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nuoc Cham -- (see recipe)
  2                     Idaho potatoes
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  2                     scallions -- minced
     1/2        medium  onion -- minced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
                        Freshly-ground white pepper
     2/3           cup  vegetable oil -- for frying

Prepare the Nuoc Cham. Set aside. 

Shred the potatoes in a food processor and place in a colander.  Sprinkle with the salt and mix well.  Let stand in the sink for 15 minutes.  Squeeze the potatoes dry and place in a mixing bowl.  Add the cornstarch and mix thoroughly.  Add all the remaining ingredients except the oil and mix well. 

Divide the oil between two 9-inch skillets over moderately-high heat.  Drop the potato mixture by tablespoonfuls into the hot oil, forming individual patties about 2 1/2 inches in diameter.  The patties should not be too thick.  Fry until golden brown on the bottom, about 5 minutes.  Turn and cook the other side until brown and crispy.  Drain on paper towels, then transfer to a serving platter. 

Serve immediately with Nuoc Cham. 

This recipe yields about 15 patties. 

Comments:  You can substitute sweet potatoes or taro root for Idaho potatoes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
  1             medium  red onion -- peeled, and cut
                        into paper-thin strips
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === BEEF ===
  1              pound  beef sirloin or other tender cut
                        such as eye of round or filet of beef
  10                    garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1               head  chicory (frisee)
     1/2          head  soft lettuce, such as Boston,
                        red leaf or oak leaf
  1        small bunch  watercress
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil

Prepare the beef:  Cut the beef against the grain into thin 1- by 2-inch strips.  In a bowl, combine the beef, half of the minced garlic (reserve remaining half for frying), fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar and ground white pepper to taste.  Let stand for 30 minutes. 

Clean the lettuces and watercress.  Drain and pat dry with paper towels.  Add the greens to the dressing, but do not toss. 

Preheat a large skillet over high heat and add the vegetable oil.  Fry the remaining minced garlic until fragrant and golden.  Add the beef and saute quickly, shaking the pan, over high heat to sear, about 1 minute (the beef should be medium-rare). 

Pour the seared meat over the greens and toss gently.  Divide the warm salad among 4 individual plates.  Sprinkle with freshly ground white pepper and serve with French bread, if desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  dried tiger lilies
  6               cups  pork stock made with dried shrimp
                        (or use chicken stock)
  12            ounces  winter melon or cucumber -- seeded, peeled,
                        and sliced thinly or cut into 1" cubes
  1                cup  shredded cooked pork or chicken from stock
                        Coarse sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  cilantro leaves
  1                     scallion -- trimmed, and
                        thinly sliced diagonally

Put the tiger lilies in a bowl with hot water to cover, and set a plate over the bowl to prevent the steam from escaping.  Let stand until the lilies rehydrate and soften, about 20 minutes.  Squeeze the lilies between the palms of your hands to get rid of the excess water.  With a paring knife, remove any hard stems and tie each lily in a knot. 

Pour the pork or chicken stock into a pot and bring it to a gentle boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the winter melon and shredded pork or chicken, and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Simmer partially covered, until the melon is cooked, about 15 to 20 minutes. 

Serve hot in communal bowl or individual soup bowls -- garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and scallion. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.
