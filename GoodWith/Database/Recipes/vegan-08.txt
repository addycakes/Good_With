  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  dry lentils
                        Filtered water -- as needed
     1/2           cup  sliced lengthwise-quartered cucumber
     1/2           cup  diced seeded green pepper
     1/2           cup  sliced lengthwise-quartered radishes
     1/2           cup  diced seeded tomato
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard

Begin by soaking and sprouting the lentils according to the instructions in the recipe for Sprouted Beans, it should take 3 to 5 days for the lentils to sprout 1 to 2-inch long tails.  Then place the sprouted lentils in indirect sunlight for several hours to create chlorophyll and to turn the sprouted tails green before using.  Using 1/4 cups dry lentils should yield 4 cups sprouted lentils.

Carefully rinse the sprouted lentils in a colander to remove any of the loose hulls -- the hulls should sink to the bottom of the colander as you rinse -- then transfer the sprouted lentils to a bowl and discard the loosened hulls.

Add the chopped vegetables to the bowl and lightly toss them with the sprouted lentils.  In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining ingredients.  Drizzle the dressing over the vegetable mixture and toss gently again.  Allow the flavors to blend for 20 to 30 minutes before serving.

This crunchy salad also makes an excellent sandwich or roll up filling.  Loosely cover any leftover salad and store in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields 7 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  sliced almonds
  1                     avocado -- peeled, pitted,
                        and diced
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
     1/2           cup  mung bean sprouts -- rinsed, patted dry
     1/3           cup  shredded carrot
     1/4           cup  diced dried apricots
  3        tablespoons  thinly-sliced green onion
                        Dried Apricot Vinaigrette -- (see recipe)
  4               cups  Boston or bibb lettuce -- washed well,
                        patted dry, and torn bite-sized pieces

Place the almonds on a cookie sheet and bake at 325 degrees for 3 to 5 minutes or until lightly browned and fragrant.  Remove the cookie sheet from the oven and set aside.

In a small glass bowl, place the diced avocado, drizzle the lemon juice over the top, and toss gently to thoroughly coat the avocado with the juice to prevent discoloration.  Add the mung bean sprouts, carrot, dried apricots, green onion, and 3 to 4 tablespoons of the Dried Apricot Vinaigrette (enough to thoroughly moisten), and toss gently to combine.

Divide the Boston lettuce evenly between two salad plates.  Divide the avocado mixture in half and mound it in the center of the lettuce.  Drizzle a little of the Dried Apricot Vinaigrette over the top of the lettuce.  Sprinkle the toasted almonds over each salad and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  finely-diced onion
  1         tablespoon  safflower oil
     1/2           cup  finely-diced celery
     1/2           cup  finely-diced seeded red pepper
     1/2           cup  finely-diced seeded green pepper
     1/4           cup  finely-diced seeded jalapeÒo pepper
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic -- minced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2               cans  red beans - (15 oz ea) -- rinsed, drained
  3        tablespoons  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce or Bragg Liquid Aminos)
  3        tablespoons  ketchup
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  rolled oats (not instant)
                        Safflower oil -- for oiling skillet
  8                     hamburger buns or large rolls -- split
                        = (or slices of whole grain bread)
                        Leaf lettuce, onion and tomato slices, or
                        other toppings of choice
                        Condiments of choice

In a non-stick skillet, saute the onion in the safflower oil for 1 minute over medium heat.  Add the celery, red pepper, green pepper, and jalapeÒo pepper, and saute an additional 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, basil, oregano, paprika, and cayenne pepper, and saute an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until the vegetables are lightly browned.  Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.

In a large bowl, place the red beans, and using a potato masher or spoon, roughly mash the beans.  Add the tamari, ketchup, mustard, salt, and pepper, and stir well to combine.  Add the sauteed vegetables, fold them into the bean mixture, then add the oats, and stir thoroughly to combine.  Wipe out the non-stick skillet with a clean, lint-free towel, and reuse the skillet for cooking the burgers.

Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Using a plastic 1/2-cup measuring cup, portion out 8 burgers on to the parchment paper, and press the burgers with a burger press (or your hands) to flatten them slightly.  Place the cookie sheet in the refrigerator and chill the burgers for 30 minutes.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) the non-stick skillet.  In batches, cook the burgers until well-browned on each side, about 3 to 5 minutes per side.  Add more oil to the pan, if needed, to prevent the burgers from sticking.  Serve on hamburger buns or large rolls (or slices of whole grain bread) with your choice of toppings and condiments.

This recipe yields 8 burgers.

Comments:  You can make these burgers in larger batches, pre-cook them, and freeze them for later use.  Then simply reheat them in the oven or in a nonstick skillet until heated through.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Vegan

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  onion -- finely diced
  3        tablespoons  Rosemary And Garlic Infused Oil -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped rosemary
  1         tablespoon  garlic -- minced
     1/2           cup  black olives -- pitted, and
                        roughly chopped
  1 1/4           cups  warm water
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  1           teaspoon  unbleached cane sugar
  3               cups  unbleached flour - (to 3 1/2)
  1           teaspoon  salt -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- divided
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
     1/4           cup  cornmeal -- divided

In a non-stick skillet, cook the onion in 1 tablespoon Rosemary and Garlic Infused Oil over low heat for 5 minutes, to soften.  Add 1 tablespoon chopped rosemary and garlic and continue to cook the mixture an additional 2 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat, add the black olives, and set aside to cool.

In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar.  Stir to dissolve the yeast and sugar, and set aside until bubbly, about 10 to 15 minutes.

In a large bowl, combine the 3 cups flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes, and stir well to combine.  Add the yeast mixture and cooled onion mixture and stir well to form a soft dough.  Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead, adding additional flour if needed, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.

Place a little of the remaining Rosemary and Garlic Infused Oil in a bowl, place dough in the bowl, give it a twist, and turn the ball over to coat the other side.  Cover, place the bowl in a warm place, and let rise for 1 hour or until doubled.

Using a little of the remaining Rosemary and Garlic Infused Oil, lightly oil a 15 1/2- by 10 1/2-inch pan, sprinkle with 3 tablespoons cornmeal, and set aside.

When the dough has doubled, punch it down and transfer it to a floured work surface.  Knead the dough a few times.  Sprinkle the work surface with the remaining cornmeal and roll the dough in it to coat the surface.

Transfer dough to the oiled pan, and stretch it, as needed, to fit the pan.  Using your fingertips, make "dimples" across the top of the dough.  Brush remaining Rosemary and Garlic Infused Oil over the top of the dough, then sprinkle with the remaining chopped rosemary, salt, and black pepper.  Allow to rise uncovered for 45 minutes.

Bake at 425 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until slightly golden brown.  Transfer the focaccia to a rack to cool.  Serve warm or at room temperature and cut as desired.

This recipe yields one 15 1/2- by 10 1/2-inch focaccia.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  bulgur -- rinsed
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  shoyu
                        = (or other soy sauce of choice)
     1/2           cup  Basil-Parsley Pesto Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  asparagus -- ends trimmed
  1 1/2           cups  diced peeled cucumber
  1 1/2           cups  diced seeded red pepper
  1                cup  radishes -- quartered
                        lengthwise, and thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  9               cups  red-tipped loose-leaf lettuce -- roughly chopped

In a large bowl, place the bulgur, pour the water, olive oil, and shoyu over the top, and stir well to combine.  Set the bulgur mixture aside for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until all of the liquid has been absorbed and the bulgur is tender.  Add the Basil-Parsley Pesto Sauce and stir well to combine.

Peel the stems of the asparagus and then thinly slice the asparagus on the diagonal.  Add the asparagus, cucumber, red pepper, radishes, and green onions to the bulgur mixture, and toss gently to combine.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

Divide the chopped lettuce between 6 plates and then place the salad mixture on top of the bed of lettuce, dividing it evenly among the plates.  The bulgur and spring vegetable salad mixture can also be used as a sandwich or roll up filling.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
  2        tablespoons  raw almonds
                        Water -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  water
  2          teaspoons  nutritional yeast flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1               dash  cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  safflower oil
     1/3           cup  freshly-chopped cilantro
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
                        === SALAD ===
  1                cup  bulgur -- rinsed
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1         tablespoon  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce or Bragg Liquid Aminos)
  8             ounces  asparagus -- tough ends trimmed
  1                cup  cut corn
  1                cup  diced fennel -- including frond tops
     3/4           cup  diced seeded orange or red pepper
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced green onions

Begin the dressing by placing the almonds in a small bowl, cover them with water, place them in the refrigerator, and leave them to soak overnight to loosen their skins.  Remove the almonds from the water, squeeze each almond between your thumb and forefinger to remove the skin, place them on a towel, and set them aside to dry.

In a blender or food processor, place the almonds and process for 1 to 2 minutes to finely grind them.  Scrape down the sides of the container, add the lime juice, water, nutritional yeast flakes, sea salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper, and process for 30 seconds.

Add the safflower oil and process for 1 minute to form a smooth puree.  Add the cilantro and parsley, pulse several times to combine, and set the dressing aside.

Next, prepare the bulgur by placing it in a large bowl, pour the water and tamari over the top, and stir well to combine.  Set the bulgur mixture aside for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until all of the liquid has been absorbed and the bulgur is tender.  Add the reserved dressing to the bulgur and toss well to thoroughly coat the bulgur with the dressing.

Using a vegetable peeler, peel the stems of the asparagus, and then slice the asparagus spears diagonally into 1/2-inch pieces.  Add the asparagus, corn, fennel, orange/red pepper, and green onions to the bulgur mixture, and toss gently to combine.  Taste and adjust the seasonings, as desired.  The bulgur salad mixture can also be served as a sandwich or wrap filling.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  finely-diced shallots
  2        tablespoons  safflower oil
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
     1/4           cup  sherry
  3             pounds  cooking apples of choice -- peeled, cored,
                        and diced
  4               cups  vegetable stock
  1                cup  apple juice
  1                cup  Sweet Apple Cider-Nut Milk -- (see recipe)
                        = (or soy milk or other non-dairy milk)

Whisk in the Sweet Apple Cider-Nut Milk, a little of the lemon juice, and season to taste with salt and pepper.  If desired, add additional curry powder, apple juice, or lemon juice to the soup to adjust the sweetness or spicy flavor of the soup to your own personal taste.  Serve hot or cold.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm tofu -- patted dry
     1/2           cup  Almond Mayonnaise or Soy Mayonnaise -- (see recipes)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/4      teaspoon  turmeric
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  diced seeded red pepper
     1/2           cup  diced celery
     1/3           cup  radishes -- quartered
                        lengthwise, and sliced
     1/4           cup  sliced green onions
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley

Wrap the block of tofu in a clean, lint-free towel.  Place a colander in the sink or over a bowl, place the towel-wrapped tofu in the colander, and place a large plate over the top of it.  Place a large can or something very heavy on top of the plate and leave tofu to sit for 30 minutes.  This technique makes the texture of the tofu much firmer.

Using your fingers, crumble the pressed tofu into a bowl.  Add the Almond Mayonnaise, lemon juice, salt, onion powder, turmeric, and pepper, and stir well to thoroughly coat the tofu.  Add the remaining ingredients and stir well to combine.  Cover and chill for 1 hour to allow the flavors to blend.

The color of the eggless egg salad will turn more yellow also as it chills.  Use as a filling for sandwiches, salads, and vegetables.

This recipe yields 3 cups.

Categories    : Sandwiches                      Vegan

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  eggplant -- sliced into 8 rounds
                        Salt -- as needed
  1                cup  unbleached flour
     1/3           cup  cornmeal
  2          teaspoons  Creole Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1                     French bread - (abt 20")
                        Non-dairy Remoulade Sauce -- (see recipe)
  2               cups  shredded lettuce
  8                     tomato slices

Place the eggplant slices in a colander and sprinkle the slices with salt.  Place the colander in the sink and leave the eggplant slices to drain for 1 hour.  Rinse the salt off the eggplant slices and pat them dry.

On a large plate, stir together the flour, cornmeal, and Creole Seasoning, and set aside.  In a shallow bowl, stir together the soy milk and mustard, and set aside.  Line a cookie sheet with a piece or parchment paper or aluminum foil, lightly oil with vegetable oil of choice, and set aside.

To bread each of the eggplant slices: coat the eggplant slice on both sides with the flour mixture, dip the slice into the soy milk mixture, place the eggplant slice back into the flour mixture and coat evenly on both sides, dip the eggplant slice back into the soy milk mixture, and then back into the flour mixture to evenly coat on both sides again.  Place the breaded eggplant slice on the prepared cookie sheet.

Repeat the breading procedure for the remaining eggplant slices.  This 5 step breading procedure will provide a nice crisp crust for the eggplant slices.

Bake at 400 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until crust is crisp and lightly browned.  Remove the cookie sheet from the oven and set aside.

Cut the French bread into 4 even pieces and then split each piece in half lengthwise.

To assemble the Eggplant Poor Boys:  Open the piece of French bread, generously spread the Non-dairy Remoulade Sauce on each half of the French bread.  On the bottom half of the bread, place 1/2 cups shredded lettuce and 2 slices of tomato, then place 2 slices of the breaded eggplant, and replace the top piece of French bread.  Repeat the assembly procedure for the remaining Eggplant Poor Boys.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The breaded eggplant slices can also be fried in oil, if desired, and drained on toweling before serving.  You can also substitute other vegetables for the eggplant in the breading procedure and add additional vegetables and condiments to the Poor Boys, as desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  rye berries
  1         tablespoon  wheat berries
  1         tablespoon  sunflower seeds
                        Filtered water -- as needed
  3        tablespoons  sesame seeds
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  caraway seeds
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1 1/2       teaspoon  salt -- (optional)
                        = (or 1/2 tspn powdered kelp)

Begin by soaking the rye berries, wheat berries, and sunflower seeds for 12 hours, as described in the Sprouted Seeds and Grasses recipe.  Then, sprout each one separately, as also described in the recipe, for 2 to 3 days or until they have a "tail" of 1/4- to 1/2-inch long.

Transfer the sprouted rye berries, wheat berries, and sunflowers seeds to a food processor.  Add the remaining ingredients and puree until smooth.

Transfer the pureed dough mixture to a solid food dehydrator sheet (like the ones used to make fruit leather or rolls) and form it into a loaf that is 3 inches wide and 6 inches long.  Place it in the dehydrator and dehydrate for 12 to 16 hours, the loaf should be crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.

Slice as you would baked bread and use as a base for sandwiches and spreads.  Slices of the essene bread can be dehydrated further to create a toasted-like texture.

This recipe yields one 3- by 6-inch loaf.

                        Water -- as needed
  8             ounces  green beans -- ends trimmed,

     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley

  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a large pot of salted, boiling water, cook the green and yellow wax beans for 3 minutes or until crisp-tender.  Add the edamame and cook an additional 1 minute.  Drain, rinse the beans with cold water, and drain well again.  Transfer the beans to a large bowl, add the black soybeans, Roman beans, onion, and jalapeÒo, and toss well to combine.

In a small bowl, place the remaining ingredients and whisk well to combine.  Pour the dressing over the bean mixture and toss gently.  Cover and chill for 30 minutes or more to allow the flavors to blend.  Gently toss the salad again before serving.

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  diced red onion
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3               cups  butternut or acorn squash -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
  2               cups  diced patty pan squash
  2               cups  diced red skin potatoes
  1                cup  diced carrot
  1                cup  diced seeded red pepper
  1                cup  diced seeded orange or yellow pepper
  3        tablespoons  freshly-chopped parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6                     flour tortillas - (8" dia)
                        = (white, whole wheat, or flavored)
     1/2        recipe  Sun-dried Tomato and Basil Aioli -- (see recipe)
  1              bunch  spinach -- triple washed,
                        stemmed, and patted dry

In a large non-stick skillet, saute the red onion in olive for 3 minutes to soften.  Add the butternut, patty pan, and potatoes, and saute for 7 minutes.  Add the carrot and both types of peppers, and saute an additional 3 to 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.  Add the parsley, salt, and pepper, stir well to combine, remove the pan from the heat, and set aside.

To assemble each roll up: place a flour tortilla on a flat surface.  Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons of the Sun-dried Tomato and Basil Aioli over the entire surface of the tortilla, cover the aioli with a generous layer of spinach leaves, then top with 1 cup of the sauteed vegetable mixture, and spread it evenly over the spinach.  Carefully roll up the tortilla to enclose the filling, leaving the ends open, and place them seam-side down on a lightly-oiled cookie sheet.

Repeat the assembly procedure for the remaining tortillas.  Brush the tops of the tortillas with a light layer of olive oil, or spray with a light mist of oil.  Bake at 375 degrees for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown on top.

Remove the cookie sheet from the oven, carefully turn over the roll ups, return the cookie sheet to the oven, and bake an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown on the other side.  Cut each roll up in half diagonally before serving.

This recipe yields 6 roll ups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  red skin potatoes -- washed well
  1                can  soybeans - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed
  1                can  hominy - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed
  1                cup  thinly-sliced green onion
  1                cup  finely-diced seeded red pepper
  1                cup  finely-diced celery
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  relish
                        Non-dairy Remoulade Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  shredded soy cheese -- cheddar flavor
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large pot, place the potatoes, cover with water, and cook over medium heat for 20 to 25 minutes or until the potatoes are fork tender.  Drain in a colander and allow to cool completely.  (The potatoes can be cooked ahead and cooled overnight, if desired.)

Cut the cooled potatoes into 1-inch cubes and transfer them to a large bowl.  Add the soybeans, hominy, green onion, red pepper, celery, parsley, and relish, and toss lightly to combine.

Add 1 cup Non-dairy Remoulade Sauce and soy cheese, toss lightly to evenly coat the vegetables with the sauce, and add additional Non-dairy Remoulade Sauce, if needed, to achieve desired creamy consistency.

Taste and season with salt and pepper to taste, as needed.  Cover and chill for several hours to allow the flavors to blend.

This recipe yields 3 quarts.

               Hot Tofu And Curried Apple Salad Sandwiches

Recipe By     :Beverly Lynn Bennett
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches                      Vegan
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm tofu
                        Safflower oil -- for frying
  1                cup  vegan soy mayonnaise
  1 1/2      teaspoons  curry powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  finely-diced peeled cored apple
     3/4           cup  finely-diced celery
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
  8             slices  whole-grain bread
     1/2           cup  breadcrumbs
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped parsley

Cut the block of tofu in half lengthwise.  Turn each half cut-side down on the board, and cut through the outer edge of the block of tofu 3 times to yield 4 tofu cutlets from each half.  This means that the block of tofu will yield 8 tofu cutlets.

On a large cookie sheet, place a clean, lint-free towel, or a layer of natural, unbleached paper towels, then all of the tofu cutlets in a single layer, followed by another layer of toweling, and finally place another large cookie sheet on top.  Place several large cans or something very heavy on top of the cookie sheet and leave tofu to sit for 1 hour.  This process is known as cutting tofu into cutlets and pressing.  I use this technique a lot as it makes the texture of the tofu much firmer.

In a non-stick skillet, in batches, saute the pieces of pressed tofu in a little of the oil, for 2 to 3 minutes per side or until lightly browned.  Pat them with clean toweling to absorb any excess oil.

In a small bowl, combine the soy mayonnaise, curry powder, salt, and pepper, and stir well to combine.  Fold the apples, celery, and green onions into the curry mayonnaise mixture.  Taste the mixture and adjust the seasonings as needed.

On a non-stick cookie sheet, place the slices of bread, and top each with a piece of tofu.  Evenly divide the curried apple mixture between the 8 sandwiches, and spread it to cover the tofu.  Sprinkle each of the sandwiches with 1 tablespoon of the breadcrumbs and a little chopped parsley.

Place the cookie sheet under the broiler, broil the sandwiches for 5 to 7 minutes or until heated through, and lightly browned on top.

Serve 1 sandwich per person and each one may be cut diagonally in half for presentation and easier eating.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Variation:  You can also add 1/2 cups of chopped nuts or sliced almonds, or 1/2 cups seedless grapes cut in half to the curried apple salad mixture.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  water
                        = (or vegetable stock)
     1/2           cup  lentils -- sorted, rinsed
     1/2           cup  brown rice -- rinsed, drained
  2          teaspoons  dried basil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4           cup  finely-diced onion
     1/4           cup  finely-diced seeded green pepper
     1/4           cup  finely-diced seeded red pepper
  2        tablespoons  minced green onion
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce or Bragg Liquid Aminos)
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Safflower oil -- as needed
  3               cups  Easy Marinara Sauce -- (see recipe)
  6                     submarine rolls - (6" long)
                        = (or other soft rolls or hot dog buns)
                        Shredded vegan soy mozzarella cheese -- (optional)
                        = (or other vegan cheese of choice)

Begin by placing the water in a medium saucepan and bring it to a boil.  Add the lentils, brown rice, and dried herbs, cover the saucepan, reduce the heat to low, and simmer the mixture until the lentils are tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.

If there is any liquid remaining in the pan, drain it off.  Add the diced onion, green pepper, red pepper, green onion, parsley, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper to the lentil-brown rice mixture.  Using a potato masher, mash the mixture well to combine all of the ingredients.  Taste, adjust seasonings, as needed, and set mixture aside to cool slightly.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil a non-stick cookie sheet, and set aside.  Using your hands or a small scoop, shape the cooled lentil-brown rice mixture into 24 - 1 1/4-inch balls, and place them on the prepared cookie sheet.  Using your fingers, rub a little safflower oil over the top of each lentil ball.

Bake at 400 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the lentil balls are dry to the touch and lightly browned on the outside.  Remove the cookie sheet from the oven.  Prepare the Easy Marinara Sauce according to the recipe instructions.

To assemble each Italian Lentil Ball Submarine Sandwich:  Split open the submarine roll, if needed, spoon a little of the Easy Marinara Sauce in the bottom of the roll, place 4 of the baked lentil balls in the roll, top with some additional Easy Marinara Sauce, and if desired, sprinkle a little shredded vegan soy mozzarella cheese over the top.  Serve immediately.  The baked lentil balls can also be served with pasta as a main dish.

This recipe yields 6 sandwiches.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Water -- as needed
     1/3           cup  raw almonds
  1 1/2           cups  water -- divided
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
  3        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  safflower oil
  4          teaspoons  nutritional yeast flakes
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
     3/4      teaspoon  sea salt
     1/4           cup  finely-diced seeded Cubanelle pepper
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped basil
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes

Begin by blanching the almonds:  In a small saucepan, place 2 inches of water, and bring to a boil.  Add the almonds and cook for 1 minute to blanch them.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside for 3 minutes to cool.  Remove the almonds from the water, squeeze each almond between your thumb and forefinger to remove the skin, and set them aside for 5 to 10 minutes to dry and cool.

Place the almonds in a blender or food processor and process for 1 to 2 minutes to finely grind them.  Scrape down the sides of the container.  Add 3/4 cup water and process for 1 minute to combine.  Add the remaining water, cornstarch, lemon juice, safflower oil, nutritional yeast flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt, and continue to process the mixture an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until very smooth and creamy.

Transfer the mixture back to the small saucepan and place it over medium heat.  Cook the mixture, while whisking constantly, for 3 to 5 minutes or until the mixture becomes very thick.  Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the remaining ingredients, stir well to combine, and set the mixture aside to cool for 10 minutes.  Pour the cheese mixture into a 2-cup (16 ounces) plastic container, cover, and chill the cheese for several hours or until firm.

Unmold the cheese and use slices on sandwiches or in place of commercially made cheese in your favorite recipes, or as a spread with crackers, breads, or fruit.  Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 5 to 7 days.  Note that this is a semi-soft style cheese, not a brick style cheese, so it can not be shredded.

This recipe yields one 2-cup loaf of non-dairy cheese.

Add the remaining water, cornstarch, lemon juice, safflower oil, nutritional yeast flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt, and continue to process the mixture an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until very smooth and creamy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the mixture back to the small saucepan and place it over medium heat.  Cook the mixture, while whisking constantly, for 3 to 5 minutes or until the mixture becomes very thick.  Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the remaining ingredients, stir well to combine, and set the mixture aside to cool for 10 minutes.  Pour the cheese mixture into a 2-cup (16 ounces) plastic container, cover, and chill the cheese for several hours or until firm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Unmold the cheese and use slices on sandwiches or in place of commercially made cheese in your favorite recipes, or as a spread with crackers, breads, or fruit.  Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 5 to 7 days.  Note that this is a semi-soft style cheese, not a brick style cheese, so it can not be shredded.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields one 2-cup loaf of non-dairy cheese.

  3               cups  water
     3/4           cup  brown basmati rice -- rinsed, drained
     3/4           cup  wild rice -- rinsed, drained
  1                can  black-eyed peas - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained

     1/2           cup  finely-diced celery
     1/2           cup  finely-diced seeded green pepper
     1/3           cup  finely-diced red onion
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
     1/3           cup  white wine vinegar
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme

  1           teaspoon  chile powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Remove the pan from the heat, leave covered, and set aside for 5 minutes to allow the rice to steam.  Using a fork, fluff the cooked rice, and set aside to cool completely.

Transfer the cooled rice to a medium bowl.  Add the black-eyed peas, carrot, celery, green pepper, red onion, and parsley, and toss gently.

In a small bowl, place the remaining ingredients, and whisk well.  Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.  Set the salad aside for 15 minutes or more, to allow the flavors to blend before serving.

     1/2           cup  diced cucumber
     1/2           cup  diced Roma tomatoes
     1/3           cup  diced celery
     1/4           cup  roughly-chopped black olives

  2        tablespoons  Tomato And Herb Paste -- (see recipe)

Categories    : Sandwiches                      Vegan
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  peanuts
  1         tablespoon  safflower oil - (to 2)
  3              large  bananas -- peeled
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice - (to 2)
  8             slices  whole-grain bread

In a food processor or blender, place the peanuts, and pulse a few times to finely chop.  Remove 4 tablespoons of the chopped peanuts and set aside.  Process the remaining peanuts with a little of the safflower oil to form a thick paste.

Break 2 of the bananas into 2-inch pieces, add them along with 1 teaspoon of lemon juice to the food processor, and process until smooth and creamy.  Transfer the mixture to a glass bowl.  Thinly slice the remaining banana and, with your fingers, coat the slices with the remaining lemon juice to prevent discoloration.

To assemble the sandwiches:  Place 4 slices of bread on a cutting board, evenly divide the banana-peanut butter spread between the 4 slices of bread, sprinkle the reserved peanuts evenly over the spread, then evenly divide and layer the slices of banana.  Top with remaining slices of bread.  For ease in eating, cut each sandwich in half and wrap in waxed paper or plastic cling film, or place in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 4 sandwiches.

Variation:  Raisins or granola can also be used as a layer in this sandwich.

                        and torn bite-size pieces
  4               cups  red-tipped oak leaf lettuce -- washed well,
                        patted dry, and torn bite-size pieces
  4               cups  green loose leaf lettuce -- washed well,
                        stems trimmed, patted dry, and torn
                        bite-size pieces

In a medium saucepan, place the apple juice and water, and bring to a boil.  Add the wild rice, thyme, orange peel, and bay leaf, and stir to combine.  Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer the rice for 35 to 40 minutes or until the wild rice is just tender.

Remove the saucepan from the heat, leave covered, and set aside for 5 minutes to allow the rice to steam.  Remove the bay leaf and orange peel and discard them.  Transfer the wild rice to a large bowl, fluff with a fork, add the golden raisins, and set aside to cool for 20 minutes.

Drizzle 1/3 cup of the Orange-Walnut Vinaigrette over the wild rice and toss gently to combine.

In a non-stick skillet, place the walnuts, and cook them over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes or until lightly toasted and fragrant.  Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside to cool.  When walnuts are cool to the touch, roughly chop them, and set aside.

In a glass bowl, place the cubed pear and apples, drizzle them with the lemon juice, and toss gently to thoroughly coat the fruit with the juice.

To the bowl of wild rice, add the pear-apple mixture, celery, and green onion, and toss gently to combine, and set aside.

In a large bowl, place the Boston lettuce, oak leaf lettuce, and green loose leaf lettuce, and toss gently to combine.  Transfer the tossed greens to a large platter or bowl, arrange the wild rice salad mixture in the center of the greens, and sprinkle the reserved walnuts over the top.  Drizzle additional Orange-Walnut Vinaigrette over individual servings.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  red skin potatoes -- washed well,
                        and left whole
                        Water -- as needed
  1              pound  asparagus -- tough ends trimmed
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Crushed red pepper flakes -- to taste
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  Asparagus And Herb Pesto -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
     1/4           cup  snipped chives
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped dill

Begin by placing the whole red skin potatoes in a large pot, cover them with water, and cook them over medium heat for 20 to 25 minutes or until easily pierced with a knife.  Remove the pot from the heat, drain the water, and allow the potatoes to cool.  Place the potatoes in the refrigerator and chill them for several hours or overnight.

Slice the asparagus spears diagonally into 1-inch pieces and place them on a non-stick cookie sheet.  Drizzle the asparagus with a little olive oil and season to taste with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes.  Roast the asparagus in a 450 degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until crisp tender.  Remove the cookie sheet from the oven and set aside to cool.

Cut the chilled red skin potatoes into 1-inch pieces and place them in a large bowl.  In a small bowl, place the red wine vinegar, Asparagus and Herb Pesto, water, and olive oil, and stir well to combine.  Pour the dressing over the potatoes and toss gently to thoroughly coat the potatoes.

Add the roasted asparagus, along with the remaining ingredients, season to taste with salt and pepper, and toss gently to combine.  Allow the flavors to blend for 15 minutes or more before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  8                     sun-dried tomatoes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  dry black beans -- sorted, rinsed
     1/4           cup  dry red lentils -- sorted, rinsed
                        Water -- as needed
     1/2           cup  diced seeded Roma tomatoes
     1/2           cup  diced seeded red pepper
     1/2           cup  diced seeded green pepper
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped cilantro
     1/4           cup  tomato juice
  2        tablespoons  diced seeded jalapeÒo pepper
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  lime juice -- to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12             large  red-tipped loose leaf lettuce leaves -- washed well,
                        and patted dry

Begin by soaking and sprouting the black beans and red lentils, each separately, according to the instructions in the recipe for Sprouted Beans; it should take 3 to 5 days for the black beans and red lentils to sprout 1- to 2-inch long tails.  Then place the sprouted black beans and red lentils in indirect sunlight for several hours to allow the creation of chlorophyll, causing the leaves (if present) on the sprouted tails to turn green.

Using 1/4 cup dry black beans and red lentils should yield between 3 to 4 cups when fully sprouted.  Remove 1 cup each of the sprouted black beans and red lentils for use in the burrito filling and set the remainder aside for use in other recipes.

Carefully rinse the sprouted black beans and red lentils in a colander to remove any of the loose hulls, which should sink to the bottom of the colander as you rinse.  Transfer the sprouted black beans and red lentils to a medium bowl and discard the hulls.

Add the chopped vegetables, lime juice, chili powder, and cumin, and lightly toss the mixture together.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss gently.

Place 1/3 cup of the sprouted bean mixture in the center of each lettuce leaf, fold sides of each leaf towards the center, and then starting from the stem end of the leaf, roll to enclose the filling.  Place seam-side down on a platter.  Repeat for remaining lettuce leaves.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 burritos.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  dry beans of choice
                        = (such as lentils, soybeans,
                        red beans, black beans, etc.)
                        Filtered water -- as needed

Sort and rinse the beans.  Transfer the beans to a bowl, cover them with 2 cups water, and leave them to soak at room temperature for 8 hours or overnight.  Drain the soaked beans in a colander and gently rinse them with cold water.  Place the colander over a bowl and leave the beans to drain.

Place the colander in a dark place, such as a kitchen cabinet, to encourage sprouting.  Repeat the "rinsing/leaving to drain/returning to a dark place" procedure twice a day or more, for 3 to 5 days, or until the beans sprout a tail that is an 1-inch or more long.  Place the sprouted beans in indirect sunlight for several hours, to create chlorophyll and to turn the sprouted tails green before using.

Or, if you have a sprouter jar, use it to soak and sprout the beans in.  Invert it at an angle in a bowl to drain, and place in a dark place to encourage sprouting.  One can easily be made with a large, wide mouthed jar, covering the top with cheesecloth or a mesh screen, and securing it with a rubber band or jar ring.

Store the sprouted beans in the refrigerator and use within 3 days.  Carefully rinse the sprouted beans in a colander to remove any of the loose hulls -- the hulls should sink to the bottom of the colander as you rinse -- then transfer the sprouted beans to a bowl and discard the loosened hulls.  Use to add flavor and crunch to salads, sandwiches, and grain dishes.

This recipe yields 4 cups or more.

Comments:  Do not attempt to sprout potato or tomato seeds as they are poisonous.  Also note that seeds may fail to sprout for many reasons such as: being too old or improperly stored, improper rinsing and draining, not enough or too much moisture, and insufficient air circulation.  If this happens, discard, and start again.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whole almonds
  2               cups  pecans
  2               cups  walnut pieces
  1 1/2      teaspoons  onion powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chili powder
  1 1/4      teaspoons  garlic powder
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/3           cup  water
     1/3           cup  unbleached cane sugar
                        = (or white sugar from sugar beets)

In a large bowl, place the almonds, pecans, and walnuts, and toss to combine.  In a small bowl, place all of the spices, stir well to combine, and set aside.

In a small saucepan, place the water and sugar, and bring the mixture to a boil to dissolve the sugar and form a simple syrup.  Continue to boil the simple syrup to the soft ball stage (240 degrees, use a candy thermometer).

Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the spice mixture.  Pour the spiced simple syrup over the mixed nuts and toss well to thoroughly coat the nuts with the mixture.

Transfer the mixed nuts to a non-stick cookie sheet and spread them out to form a single layer.  Bake at 350 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes or until nuts are lightly toasted and fragrant.  Remove the cookie sheet from the oven and set nuts aside to cool.

Break the nuts into small pieces and store in an airtight container.  Serve as a snack, or garnish for salads, grains, or rice dishes.

This recipe yields 6 cups.
