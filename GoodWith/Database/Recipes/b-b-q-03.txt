                      Chunky Chewy Chocolate Cookies

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts
                Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
  1            package  semi-sweet chocolate chunks - (11 1/2 oz) -- divided
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  cocoa
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped walnuts
  1                cup  flaked coconut
  1                cup  raisins or dried cherries
                        = (or use half of each)

In a saucepan over very low heat, melt the butter with 1/2 package (about 1 cup) of the chocolate chunks, stirring constantly until smooth.  Set aside to cool to lukewarm.

In a large bowl using an electric mixer, beat the eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla until light and fluffy.  Beat in the cooled butter-chocolate mixture.

In a medium bowl, sift the flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt together.  Gradually stir into the large bowl of batter.  Add the walnuts, coconut, raisins and/or cherries, and the remaining 1 cup of chocolate chunks; stir to blend.  Batter will be stiff.

Use a tablespoon and wet fingertips to drop 1-inch mounds of the batter onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, keeping the mounds about 2 inches apart (the cookies do not spread when baked).  Grill the cookies in batches over Indirect Medium heat for 20 minutes, keeping the grill's temperature as close to 350 degrees as possible.

Remove from the grill and let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet until they are easy to remove with a spatula, 2 to 3 minutes.  Transfer the cookies to a cooling rack and allow them to cool completely.

This recipe yields about 36 cookies.

Wine Recommendation:  A wine that is a bit sweeter than these cookies -- such as a late-harvest Riesling from Germany or a ruby port -- hits the spot here for grown-ups.  Children of all ages cheer for milk.

Comments:  To bake these fabulously chocolatey cookies on your grill, use a heavy-duty baking sheet that you can place over Indirect heat.  By adjusting the amount of sweet raisins or dried cherries in the batter, you can suit your own preference for chewiness.

Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HONEY-LIME DRESSING ===
     1/4           cup  lime juice
  3        tablespoons  oil
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
                        === FOR THE HENS ===
  2                     Cornish Game Hens - (2 lbs ea) -- completely thawed,
                        and split in half
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro

To make the Honey-Lime Dressing:  In a medium glass or ceramic bowl, whisk together the lime juice, oil, honey, thyme, rosemary, and garlic.  Set aside.

Remove and discard giblets from hens; rinse hens, and pat dry with paper towels.

To split hens, place each hen breast-side-up on cutting board.  With a sharp butcher knife, cut through ribs along one side of backbone; repeat on other side and discard backbone.  Turn hen over and cut through along one side of breastbone.

Place hen halves in a resealable plastic bag.  Pour blended honey-lime dressing over hens and refrigerate for 2 hours, turning bag occasionally to distribute marinade.

Remove hens from bag and reserve dressing.  Season hens with paprika, salt, and pepper.  Place cut-side up in center of cooking grate and grill for 25 to 30 minutes until no longer pink inside and juices run clear.

Pour reserved dressing into a small saucepan and bring to a boil; boil for one full minute.  Place grilled hens on a platter and pour hot dressing over them.  Sprinkle with cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  An oaky FumÈ Blanc from Napa or Sonoma Valley will provide the right level of creamy richness for the hen and the right amount of snappy, fruit-driven acidity for the sweet and sour dressing.

Beer Recommendation:  A dark, rich Bock beer is just the ticket to match the sweetness of the young hens and balance the flavors of the sweet and sour dressing.

Comments:  Grilled game hens make an easy dinner that's elegant enough for guests.  The honey-lime dressing in this recipe makes them delectable!

                   Cornish Hens With Garlic-Mint Butter

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Cornish hens - (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 lbs ea) -- wingtips removed
                        === GARLIC-MINT BUTTER ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh mint
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     1/4      teaspoon  grated lime zest
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

To make the Garlic-Mint Butter:  Place the softened butter in a small bowl.  Combine the garlic and salt on a cutting board.  Finely chop them and, using the side of the knife, crush the mixture into a paste.  Add the paste to the bowl along with the remaining butter ingredients.

Remove the giblets from the hens and discard.  Rinse the hens, inside and out, under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Working from the cavity end of each hen, run your fingers between the skin and flesh of the breasts and legs to loosen the skin without tearing.

Push half of the butter mixture under the skin and massage from the outside to spread the butter mixture evenly over the breasts and legs.  Spread the remaining butter over the entire surface of the hens.

Truss the hens with cotton string.  Grill over Indirect Medium heat until the juices run clear and the meat is no longer pink at the bone, 35 to 45 minutes.

Transfer the hens onto a cutting board.  Loosely cover with foil and allow to rest for about 5 minutes.  Using poultry shears or a sharp knife, remove the strings.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A cool Australian chardonnay makes for a dreamy match.

Beer Recommendation:  These hens call for an American Pilsener with mild malt flavor.

Comments:  A little seasoned butter nestled between the skin and flesh keeps these beauties savory and succulent.

Remove the giblets from the hens and discard.  Rinse the hens, inside and out, under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Working from the cavity end of each hen, run your fingers between the skin and flesh of the breasts and legs to loosen the skin without tearing.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Push half of the butter mixture under the skin and massage from the outside to spread the butter mixture evenly over the breasts and legs.  Spread the remaining butter over the entire surface of the hens.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Truss the hens with cotton string.  Grill over Indirect Medium heat until the juices run clear and the meat is no longer pink at the bone, 35 to 45 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the hens onto a cutting board.  Loosely cover with foil and allow to rest for about 5 minutes.  Using poultry shears or a sharp knife, remove the strings.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  A cool Australian chardonnay makes for a dreamy match.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beer Recommendation:  These hens call for an American Pilsener with mild malt flavor.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  A little seasoned butter nestled between the skin and flesh keeps these beauties savory and succulent.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3                     egg yolks -- beaten
  3        tablespoons  lemon juice
                        = (juice of 1 lemon)
  1                cup  flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  3             ounces  milk
  3              large  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced
     1/2           cup  cranberries -- fresh or frozen
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
                        Powdered sugar -- (optional)
                        Vanilla ice cream -- (optional)

Whip sugar and egg yolks until creamy; add lemon juice and mix well.  Fold in flour and baking powder; add milk and mix to make a smooth batter.

Grease an 8- by 8- by 1 3/4-inch heavy-duty aluminum pan (or fireproof casserole, or 9-inch springform pan).

Place apples and cranberries in a medium bowl.  Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar; toss to coat.

In baking pan, layer half of the batter, half of the fruit mixture, remaining half of batter, then the remaining fruit mixture.

Place an empty baking pan upside down in the center of the cooking grate.  Place cake on inverted baking pan.  Grill for 35 to 40 minutes or until a knife tip inserted in the center comes out clean.

Remove from grill and let rest for about 5 minutes.  Dust with powdered sugar and serve with vanilla ice cream, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The warm baked scent of this fruit-studded cake is the stuff memories are made of.  Cake can be made with pears, peaches, or plums instead of apples, and blackberries in place of cranberries.

        Dry-Rubbed Pork Tenderloin With Fire-Roasted Tomato Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  8                     ripe  plum tomatoes -- stems removed
  1                     jalapeÒo -- stemmed, seeded
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves - (tightly packed)
     1/3           cup  roughly-chopped red onion
     1/4           cup  fresh cilantro leaves - (tightly packed)
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === THE RUB ===
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  dark brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  chile powder
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
                        === TENDERLOIN ===
  2                     pork tenderloins - (abt 1 lb ea)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed

To make the Sauce:  Grill the tomatoes and jalapeÒo over Direct High heat until black and blistered in spots, turning as needed.  The tomatoes will take 4 to 6 minutes and the jalapeÒo will take 2 to 3 minutes.

Put the tomatoes and jalapeÒo in a food processor along with the other sauce ingredients, including salt and pepper to taste, and process until smooth.

Transfer the sauce to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer and allow to cook until the sauce has thickened slightly, 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

To make the Rub:  In a small bowl combine the rub ingredients and crush them together with your fingertips.

Trim excess fat and silver skin from the tenderloins.  Lightly brush or spray the tenderloins with olive oil.  Spread the rub all over the tenderloin and press the spices into the surface of the meat.

Grill the tenderloins over Direct Medium heat until the centers are barely pink, 15 to 20 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove the tenderloins from the grill and cover loosely with foil.  Allow to rest for about 5 minutes before slicing.  Serve warm with the sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  All this flavor calls for a fruity Pinot Noir.

Beer Recommendation:  Bring on a cold Mexican lager.

Comments:  The truth is, the rub in this recipe is so good that the meat doesn't even need a sauce, but if tomatoes are in season, whip up this cooked salsa for a colorful flourish.  Fire-roast the vegetables over Direct High heat, then cook the meat over Direct Medium heat.

             Dry-Rubbed Porterhouse With Barbecue Steak Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE RUB ===
     1/2    tablespoon  black peppercorns
     1/2    tablespoon  mustard seeds
  1         tablespoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2          teaspoons  granulated garlic
  1         tablespoon  course salt
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire
  1         tablespoon  steak sauce
  1         tablespoon  molasses
     1/2    tablespoon  red wine vinegar
     1/2    tablespoon  Dijon-style mustard
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  2                     garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  diced onion
  6                     black peppercorns
  1                     bay leaf
                        === FOR THE STEAKS ===
  2                     Porterhouse steaks, 1 1/2" thk -- (abt 1 3/4 lbs ea)
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
                        Hickory chips -- soaked in water
                        for at least 30 minutes

To prepare the Rub:  Using a mortar and pestle, crush the peppercorns and the mustard seeds.  Pour into a small bowl and combine with the paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic, salt, and brown sugar.  Set aside.

To prepare the Sauce:  In a small saucepan, combine the ketchup, water, Worcestershire, steak sauce, molasses, vinegar, mustard, and brown sugar.  Add the garlic, diced onion, peppercorns, and the bay leaf.  Simmer for 15 minutes until thickened.  Strain, cover, and set aside at room temperature until ready to serve.

Rub the steaks with the spices and allow it to stand at room temperature for 20 minutes before grilling.  Follow the grill's instructions for using wood chips.

Sear the steak over Direct High heat for 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Continue grilling over Indirect Medium heat until medium-rare, about 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve the steak warm with the sauce.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  There is just no better match with this hunk-o-beef than a muscular, aged Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.  Such a rich cut of beef -- especially one with a sauce of many flavors -- needs a red with big fruits, big tannins, and big acids.  Look for vintages '95, '94, '90, '87, '85, '79, '78, '75 and, best of all, '74.

Beer Recommendation:  If you're the beer-and-steak type, don't reach for just any beer.  This special steak deserves something new.  Try a 50/50 blend of a rich and creamy Irish Stout with a serious India Pale Ale.  This inventive spin on the Black & Tan will create another seasoned sauce of malty citrus.

Comments:  Nothing hits the grill with force like a thick, juicy Porterhouse.  Sssssssssss...steak lover's paradise.  Go over the top with a zesty dry rub and a homemade sauce that's to die for.  And you thought you knew steak!

Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  asparagus -- tough ends removed
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/8      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground pink peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  4                     filets mignon, 2" thk - (abt 6 oz ea)
  2                     king crab legs -- precooked
                        = (thawed, if frozen)
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped shallots
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh tarragon -- divided
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     egg yolks
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- melted

Put the asparagus on a plate or platter.  Drizzle the olive oil over the asparagus and season with the salt and pepper.

In a small bowl mix together the salt with the pink peppercorns and black pepper.  Lightly brush or spray both sides of the filets with the olive oil.  Season with the salt and pepper mixture.  Allow the filets to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling.

Meanwhile, make the Sauce:  In a small saucepan combine the vinegar, shallots, 1/2 tablespoon of the tarragon, salt, and pepper along with 1 tablespoon water.  Bring to a simmer over medium heat and continue cooking until the mixture is reduced to 3 tablespoons.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool for a few minutes.

In a small bowl whisk together the egg yolks.  Whisk 1 tablespoon of the vinegar mixture into the eggs.  Pour the egg mixture into the saucepan with the vinegar mixture and whisk until smooth.  Place the pan over low heat and whisk the mixture constantly until it thickens to the consistency of mustard.  Then, immediately start drizzling the melted butter in a thin stream into the pan, whisking constantly, until the mixture reaches the consistency of thin mayonnaise.  If at any time the sauce looks like it is separating, remove the pan from the heat and continue whisking to cool it down.  Set the sauce aside at room temperature.

Sear the filets over Direct High heat for 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Continue grilling over Indirect Medium heat until the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees for medium rare, 5 to 8 minutes.  Grill the asparagus, and crab legs over Direct Medium heat, for 6 to 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Remove the filets from the grill and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the asparagus and the crab legs from the grill.  Cut the asparagus into 2-inch lengths and keep warm.  Crack open the crab legs with a mallet or cut them open with kitchen shears and remove the meat.

To serve, place one filet on each plate and top with some of the asparagus and crab meat.  Drizzle bÈarnaise sauce over each plate.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  For this seductive meal, try Saint-Amour, a Beaujolais that will marry the steak and the crab in the rich butter sauce.  No wonder this red is named after love.

Beer Recommendation:  Serve a romantic beer from a voluptuous bottle; BiËre de Garde from France is strong but delicate.  Like love, it demonstrates sweetness on the attack and bitterness in the finish.  Perfect for both the earthy steak and the briny crab.

Comments:  Even if you've never made a bÈarnaise sauce before, our recipe will walk you through it with grace.  The trick is to thicken the egg yolks in the reduced vinegar mixture over very low heat so that they don't scramble and add the butter slowly -- in a thin stream -- so it has a chance to emulsify with the yolks.

                       Fresh Figs With Honey Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit
                Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  honey
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1               pint  fresh figs - (abt 8 to 12) -- stems trimmed,
                        halved lengthwise

In a small saucepan combine the honey and lemon juice and stir until blended.

Lightly brush the cut sides of the figs with some of the honey mixture.  Leave the remaining honey mixture in the pan.  Grill figs, cut-side down, over Direct High heat until golden, 2 to 3 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Use a spatula to lift figs from the grate and transfer to a plate to cool slightly.  If the figs are large, cut them into 1/2-inch wedges.

Add the figs to the remaining honey mixture in the saucepan.  Heat gently over low heat.  Serve over ice cream, yogurt, or angel food cake.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Try a Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise from the southern RhÙne Valley with this unique dessert.  It's sweet and luscious enough to match the intense sweetness of the figs.

Beer Recommendation:  A fruity lambic-style beer from Belgium or from an American craft brewery will deliver commensurate sweetness but add and a slightly bitter finish, making the dish decadently rich.

Comments:  There are many varieties of fresh figs.  Mission figs are small and black.  The large Brown Turkey figs are green with a purple blush.  Calimyrna are large and yellow-green, related to the similar Smyrna.  Kadota are also yellow-green but smaller.  All are luscious, with a soft, sweet center.

         Fresh Raspberry "Shortcake" With Chocolate Whipped Cream

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Grilling


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  3               cups  sifted all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2         pound  very soft butter - (2 sticks)
  1                cup  sugar
                        Zest of one lemon
  4              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  milk
                        === RASPBERRY SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  tangerine or orange juice
  1           teaspoon  arrowroot
  3           packages  fresh raspberries - (6 oz ea)
                        === CHOCOLATE WHIPPED CREAM ===
  1                cup  heavy cream -- very cold
     1/4           cup  chocolate syrup

To make the Cake:  In a medium bowl, combine flour and baking powder.  Set aside.  In a large mixing bowl, cream butter, sugar, and lemon zest together until well blended.  Add eggs one at a time, beating constantly until eggs are well blended into mixture.  Continue beating and pour in milk.  Slowly add dry ingredients, beating until incorporated, then beat at high speed for 1 minute.  Scrape sides of bowl and continue beating batter at high speed for another 2 minutes.  Pour batter into a 5- by 9-inch loaf pan lined with parchment paper.

Place loaf pan atop a small, inverted baking sheet with sides.  Place in center of cooking grate, and cook for 50 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the cake's center comes out clean.  Remove from grill and allow cake to rest in the pan for 10 minutes, then invert onto a cooling rack.

To make the Raspberry Sauce:  In a large saucepan, stir the water and sugar together.  Simmer for 5 to 8 minutes; remove from heat and cool for 10 minutes.  Whisk arrowroot into the tangerine juice until dissolved; pour slowly into the sugar water.  Return to a simmer and simmer for 10 minutes, whisking constantly.  Fold in the raspberries.  Allow to marinate for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Chocolate Whipped Cream.  In a large mixing bowl, stir cream and syrup together.  Whip to soft peaks.

Place a slice of batter cake on a plate, top with raspberry sauce, and mound with the chocolate whipped cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Chocolate whipped cream is a challenge for the grape, but a Sparkling Shiraz from Australia will do the trick.  It's perfectly balanced to lift the semi-sweet raspberries and to cleanse the palate of the chocolate cream.

Beer Recommendation:  A raspberry Lambic from Belgium (where it's called Framboise) or a similar beer from an American craft brewer will create a rich and subtly refreshing sauce for the sensual chocolate cream.

Comments:  This sultry dessert is a decadent tower of flavors and textures.  Crumbly shortcake, made the easy way, is draped with a beautiful fruit sauce, then crowned with velvety rich chocolate cream.

  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        Juice from 6 large tangerines -- (1 1/2 cups)
     1/4           cup  Major Gray's Chutney
                        Salt -- to taste

To make the Marinade:  In a large small bowl, combine the tangerine juice, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, and 1 tablespoon of the Thai spice blend.  Place duck breasts in a resealable plastic bag set inside a bowl.  Pour marinade over duck breasts.  Refrigerate for 4 hours, turning occasionally to distribute marinade.

Meanwhile, prepare the Sauce:  In a heavy-bottomed one-quart saucepan, heat the sesame oil.  SautÈ the ginger and the tangerine zest for 1 minute; add the vinegar and sugar and simmer, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes, until the vinegar is absorbed into the ginger.  Pour in the tangerine juice and simmer for 20 minutes, until the juice is reduced to one half.  Whisk in the chutney; simmer for another 5 minutes and strain.

Remove the duck breast from the marinade, reserving the marinade.  Pour the marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Boil for one full minute.  Remove from heat.

Coat each breast with 1 tablespoon of the Thai spice blend and season with salt to taste.  Place the breasts over Direct Medium heat, fat-side down, and grill for approximately 20 minutes for medium-rare, turning the breasts every 4 to 5 minutes, basting with the reserved marinade after each turn.

Allow the grilled breasts to rest for 5 minutes before cutting into slices.  Serve the duck with the sauce and sugar snap peas, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  For the zesty citrus and ginger flavors coupled with the tender richness of the duck, try a fruit-driven Zinfandel from Sonoma's Dry Creek Valley.  It will wrap the duck in a robe of intense cherries and red currants, and add just the right black-pepper snap to the heady sauce.

Beer Recommendation:  A creamy and rich India Pale Ale with a semi-bitter finish will allow these intense flavors to happily commingle.  The finish on the palate will be sweet and sour, with a touch of pleasing astringency.

Comments:  Duck makes a rich and hearty meat for the grill.  Here the bright flavors of tangerine and ginger make the perfect complement.  Try the deep-red and meaty Mallard duck breasts, or a wild variety, for their full flavor.

                           Greek Garlic Chicken

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  chicken - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs) -- cut 8 pieces
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  black olive tapenade
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

To make the Marinade:  In a medium bowl whisk together the marinade ingredients.

Rinse the chicken pieces under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Place in a large, resealable plastic bag and pour in the marinade.  Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly.  Turn the bag to distribute marinade, place in a bowl, and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours, turning occasionally.

Remove the chicken from the bag, reserving the marinade.  Pour the marinade into a small saucepan, bring to a boil, and boil for 1 full minute.  Set aside.

Grill the chicken, skin-side up, over Indirect Medium heat until the juices run clear and the internal temperature reaches 180 degrees in the thickest part of the thighs and 170 degrees in the breasts.

The leg and thigh pieces will take 40 to 50 minutes and the breast and wing pieces will take 30 to 40 minutes.  Baste with the marinade during the last 10 to 20 minutes of grilling time.  Remove from the grill and serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A tapenade is a thick paste typically made from olives, anchovies, capers, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and seasonings.  Here it adds deep flavor to the chicken.  Look for it in stores with a good olive selection.

                        Grilled Asian Flank Steak

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     flank steaks - (abt 1 1/4 lbs ea)
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  plum sauce
     1/2           cup  pineapple juice
     1/2           cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  finely-sliced scallions
  3        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh garlic

Combine all marinade ingredients.  Mix well.

Place flank steak in a resealable plastic bag and add marinade.  Refrigerate for 3 to 6 hours, turning occasionally to distribute marinade.

Remove flank steak from the marinade.  Reserve marinade.  Place steak in center of cooking grate and grill for 15 to 20 minutes, or until desired doneness, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Occasionally brush lightly with remaining marinade while grilling.  Remove steak when done and hold in a warm place for 5 to 7 minutes.  Slice thinly on the bias for serving.

Meanwhile, bring remaining marinade to a boil and simmer rapidly for 5 minutes.  Serve with steak.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  To celebrate the steak's grilled earthiness and the marinade's smoked fruit flavors, try a Pinot Noir from Oregon's Willamette Valley.

Beer Recommendation:  Pale Ale -- with its assertive flavor profile, hoppy finish, and citrus overtones -- is our brew of choice for this complex grilled beef dish.

Comments:  The marinade in this recipe adds tenderness and special flavor to a popular cut of beef.  Just add steamed rice with black sesame seeds, some green beans, and you have an easy, delicious dinner!

                         Grilled Asparagus Spears

Recipe By     :Bob Blumer
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh asparagus
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt

Look for firm asparagus stalks with deep green or purplish tips.  Also check the bottom of the spears.  If they are dried up, chances are they have been sitting around for too long.

Trim off the tough bottom of the spear by grasping each end and bending it gently until it snaps at its natural point of tenderness -- usually two thirds of the way down the spear.  If the spear is less than 6-inches long, chances are it has already been trimmed for you.  Then take a vegetable peeler and peel off the outer skin of the lower half of the remaining stalk.

Place asparagus on a plate.  Drizzle oil over top and turn spears until they are coated.  Sprinkle with salt (this may seem like a lot -- just trust me) and turn again.

Grill asparagus for 5 minutes over Direct Medium heat.  Each minute or so, roll each spear 1/4 turn.  Asparagus should begin to brown in spots (indicating that its natural sugars are caramelizing) but should not be allowed to char.

Remove from grill and serve immediately (eating spears with your fingers enhances the experience).

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This easy recipe is actually just a foolproof technique for grilling one of summer's great treasures.  Brought to you courtesy of our friend Bob Blumer, a.k.a. The Surreal Gourmet, cookbook author and bon vivant extraordinaire.

Tips from The Surreal Gourmet:

Le secret:  Thicker spears fare better on the grill.

The adventure club:  Wrap grilled spears with slices of prosciutto -- a perfect appetizer for your next cocktail party.

     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced prosciutto

To make the Orange Mayonnaise:  In a small bowl whisk together the mayonnaise ingredients.

Place the asparagus on a plate or platter.  Drizzle the olive oil over the spears and turn to coat evenly.  Season with the salt and pepper.

Grill the asparagus over Direct Medium heat until browned and tender, 6 to 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill and keep warm.

Grill the prosciutto slices over Direct Medium heat just until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill and cut each slice into pieces about 2 inches across.

Arrange the prosciutto and asparagus on four plates and spoon the mayonnaise over the top.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                 Grilled Chicken Breasts With Bread Crust

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             slices  white bread -- crust removed
  4        tablespoons  butter -- softened
  1           teaspoon  spicy brown mustard
  2                     shallots -- finely diced
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh herbs
                        = (parsley, chervil, chives, dill)
  6                     boneless skinless chicken breasts
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2                     portobella mushrooms -- stems removed
  2              large  tomatoes -- thickly sliced

In a food processor, process bread into soft, coarse crumbs.  In a medium bowl, mix bread crumbs, butter, mustard, shallots, and herbs into a paste.  Set aside.

Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper and brush with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Place chicken in center of cooking grate over Direct High heat and sear for 4 minutes, turning once halfway through searing time.

Remove from grill just long enough to spread bread crumb paste evenly over chicken breasts.  Reduce grill temperature to Medium.  Place chicken on a sheet pan and bake over Direct Medium heat for about 15 minutes.  Remove from grill and keep warm.

Season mushrooms and tomatoes with salt and pepper; brush with remaining 2 tablespoons of oil.  Place in center of cooking grate.  Grill mushrooms for 6 minutes and tomatoes for 2 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Arrange chicken, mushrooms, and tomatoes on a platter.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A California Pinot Noir with a good fruit-to-acid balance will accommodate the tomatoes and mushrooms while toasting the chicken.

Beer Recommendation:  A light ale with a pronounced touch of yeast will bow to the mustardy bread crust on the lightly herbed chicken.

Comments:  A hearty family dinner that's sure to become a Sunday favorite.

              Grilled Chicken Wings With Asian Dipping Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Chicken
                Grilling                        Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  18             whole  chicken wings - (abt 4 lbs)
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry wine
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2              drops  hot sauce - (to 3)
                        === ASIAN DIPPING SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
  1                     green onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  3          teaspoons  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry wine

To make chicken wings:  Cut off and discard small wing tips from chicken wings.  Cut each wing at the joint to make 2 sections.

In a small bowl combine soy sauce, wine, vegetable oil, sesame oil, and hot sauce.  Place chicken wing pieces in a large plastic resealable bag.  Pour marinade over chicken; close bag and marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, make the Asian Dipping Sauce:  In a small saucepan heat oil.  Add ginger and green onion; cook 1 minute or until browned.  Add chicken broth, soy sauce, brown sugar, chili powder, and red pepper.  Bring to a boil.  Dissolve cornstarch in wine; add gradually to liquid, stirring constantly until slightly thickened.  Keep warm.

Remove chicken wings from marinade; discard marinade.  Place chicken wings in center of cooking grate.  Grill 15 minutes or until tender, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Brush with sauce.  Continue grilling 2 to 3 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve with remaining sauce for dipping.

This recipe yields 6 servings or 18 appetizers.

Wine Recommendation:  A Napa FumÈ Blanc with light oak will support the tang of the sauce and boost the lip-smacking qualities of the wings.

Beer Recommendation:  Load up the picnic basket and grab a cooler full of Hefe-Weizen.  From the floral to the hoppy, it's the perfect beer for this saucy treat.

Comments:  This Asian spin on a popular appetizer is so tasty, you'll watch it fly!

                          Grilled Fruit Compote

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit
                Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5              small  ripe peaches -- quartered, pitted
  6              small  ripe plums -- quartered, pitted
  1                cup  water
     3/4           cup  orange-flavored liqueur
     3/4           cup  sugar
                        Zest from 1 lemon
  2          teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
                        Angel food cake or
                        low-fat vanilla frozen yogurt -- (optional)

Place fruit pieces in center of cooking grate.  Grill for 4 to 6 minutes, just until fruit is warmed through and grill marks have begun to appear, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from grill and set aside.

Combine water, liqueur, and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Meanwhile, cut the zest from the lemon and add it in strips to the pan, along with the vanilla.  Continue boiling until liquid is reduced and syrupy, about 15 minutes.

Transfer syrup to a serving bowl.  Cut grilled fruit into bite-size pieces and add to syrup; stir.  Chill at least two hours to allow fruits to absorb the flavor of the syrup.  Compote may be prepared a day in advance and kept in the refrigerator overnight.

Serve compote with a little of the syrup spooned over Angel Food Cake or frozen yogurt, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A light sparkling wine with angel food cake and grilled fruit?  A heavenly idea!

Beer Recommendation:  The caramelized grilled fruit makes this dish a match for malt.  Try an apricot ale.

Comments:  The perfect homage to summer; grilled fresh fruit in a light liqueur sauce.

Compote can also be made with 3 apples and 3 ripe pears, all quartered and cored.  Change grilling time to 6 to 8 minutes and turn once halfway through grilling time.

Place fruit pieces in center of cooking grate.  Grill for 4 to 6 minutes, just until fruit is warmed through and grill marks have begun to appear, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from grill and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine water, liqueur, and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Meanwhile, cut the zest from the lemon and add it in strips to the pan, along with the vanilla.  Continue boiling until liquid is reduced and syrupy, about 15 minutes.

<DirT>
Transfer syrup to a serving bowl.  Cut grilled fruit into bite-size pieces and add to syrup; stir.  Chill at least two hours to allow fruits to absorb the flavor of the syrup.  Compote may be prepared a day in advance and kept in the refrigerator overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve compote with a little of the syrup spooned over Angel Food Cake or frozen yogurt, if desired.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  A light sparkling wine with angel food cake and grilled fruit?  A heavenly idea!
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beer Recommendation:  The caramelized grilled fruit makes this dish a match for malt.  Try an apricot ale.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The perfect homage to summer; grilled fresh fruit in a light liqueur sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Compote can also be made with 3 apples and 3 ripe pears, all quartered and cored.  Change grilling time to 6 to 8 minutes and turn once halfway through grilling time.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHALLOT SAUCE ===
  12                    shallots - (abt 1 1/4 lbs) -- sliced
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1                cup  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper -- or to taste
                        === BACON VINAIGRETTE ===
  6             ounces  lean bacon -- cubed
  6        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
                        Sugar -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE POTATO DISKS ===
  1              pound  potatoes -- peeled, julienned
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  melted butter
                        === FOR THE HALIBUT ===
  6                     halibut fillets - (abt 5 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

To make the Sauce:  In a heated skillet place shallots and white wine; simmer and reduce liquid to one-third.  Add chicken broth and simmer for 20 minutes or until shallots are cooked.  In a blender or food processor combine shallot mixture, butter, salt, and pepper.  PurÈe until smooth.

To make the Bacon Vinaigrette:  In a skillet, sautÈ bacon until crisp.  Discard all but 1 tablespoon fat; add balsamic vinegar and lime juice.  Season with sugar, salt, and pepper to taste.

To make the Potato Disks:  Place potatoes on paper towels to remove moisture.  Sprinkle with balsamic vinegar.  Combine chives, salt, pepper, and butter; add to potatoes and toss to coat.

Coat a baking sheet with butter.  On baking sheet spoon julienned potatoes into 12 equal portions.  Flatten to form thin disks.  Place baking sheet in center of cooking grate.  Grill potatoes 12 minutes or until crisp, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Keep warm while halibut is grilling.

Season halibut pieces with salt and pepper and brush with oil.  Place fish on cooking grate.  Grill 6 to 8 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork, turning carefully once halfway through grilling time.

Gently warm shallot sauce and bacon vinaigrette.  Arrange one warm potato disk on each plate.  Top with one piece of halibut, then top with a second potato disk.  Pour some shallot sauce around disks and sprinkle with bacon vinaigrette.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A dry and elegant FumÈ Blanc will weave its way through the many distinct flavors of this dish with grace and ease.

Beer Recommendation:  A lighter ale with a spicy but balanced hop finish will make a great platter for the recipe's many flavors.  Try one from Oregon.

Comments:  A kaleidoscope of flavors and textures you won't soon forget.  Orange roughy, Chilean sea bass, or red snapper can be used in place of halibut.

                          Grilled Lemon Lobster

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     frozen lobster tails - (4 to 6 oz ea) -- thawed
     1/2           cup  butter -- melted
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  white wine Worcestershire sauce
  2              drops  hot pepper sauce

Rinse lobster tails and pat dry.  Split lengthwise through back shell and lobster meat to separate in half.

Combine remaining ingredients; brush on lobster meat.

Place lobster tails shell-side down in center of cooking grate.  Grill 8 to 10 minutes or until meat is opaque.  Serve lobster with remaining butter sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Just the right amount of seasoning to optimize the sweet, delicate flavor of tender lobster!

Two 1-pound live whole lobsters may be used in place of frozen tails.  To prepare live lobsters: pick up 1 lobster at a time, hold the body near the top, and plunge headfirst into 6 quarts of boiling water.  Return water to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Using tongs, lift lobster from pot and let cool briefly.  Repeat with other lobster.  Split lobsters lengthwise through back shell.  Remove and discard stomach sac, intestinal vein, green tomalley (liver) and any coral-colored roe from each lobster.  Rinse lobsters well and drain.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  new potatoes -- washed
  2          teaspoons  salt -- divided
  3        tablespoons  oil
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2         pound  slab bacon -- cut 1/4" by 1/4"
  4             medium  Vidalia onions
  1              bunch  scallions -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  oil
     1/4           cup  sherry vinegar
     1/4           cup  water
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a large saucepan, boil the potatoes with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt until tender.  Drain.  Cut potatoes in half and place into a large bowl and toss with the oil, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper.

Grill the potatoes over Direct Medium heat until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove potatoes from the grill and allow to cool.

Cut each half into bite-sized pieces.  Put in a large bowl, cover, and hold at room temperature.

Cook bacon in a skillet over low heat (low heat allows the fat to render completely, leaving crisp bacon bits).  Periodically pour off the bacon fat and reserve.  When bacon is crisp, add to the bowl of potatoes.

Peel the onions, and push skewers through the onions at 1/2-inch intervals.  Slice through the onion between the skewers (this holds the onion rings together during grilling).  Brush the onion slices with the reserved bacon fat and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Grill the onions over Direct Medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning and basting with the reserved bacon fat once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from grill, slide off of the skewers, and cut each slice into quarters.  Add to the potatoes with the scallions, thyme, and parsley.

To make the Dressing:  In a medium bowl, whisk the dressing ingredients together.  Pour over the potatoes and toss gently to distribute ingredients.  Cover and allow to marinate for 1 hour at room temperature before serving.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Spruce up your next cookout with this fresh twist on an old standby.  Crunchy scallions and fresh herbs make all the difference.  If you skewer the potato halves before grilling, they'll be easier to turn.

  4             medium  peaches
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
                        === FOR SERVING ===
  1                cup  vanilla ice cream
  4                     cookies

To make the Cherry Sauce:  In a sautÈ pan over medium-high heat, combine the pitted cherries, sugar, red wine, and balsamic vinegar.  Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the fruit is soft, 6 to 8 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a food processor and purÈe until completely smooth.  Return the mixture to the sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.  Add the kirsch.  Simmer until reduced to about 1/4 cup, 1 to 2 minutes.

Cut the peaches in half and remove and discard the pits.  Place the halves in a medium bowl.  In a small saucepan set over low heat, melt the butter and brown sugar together.  Coat the peaches with the butter mixture.

Grill the peaches over Direct Medium heat until grill marks are clearly visible and the peaches are soft, 10 to 12 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

While the peaches are still warm, layer each serving glass with 2 peach halves, 1 scoop ice cream, and 1 tablespoon cherry sauce.  Tuck a cookie into each glass.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In the late 1800s, famous French chef Auguste Escoffier created a dessert for Dame Nellie Melba, a celebrated Australian opera singer.  Called peach Melba, the immediately popular recipe consisted of poached peaches, vanilla ice cream, and raspberry sauce.  Here is a twist on that classic summertime dish.

                       Grilled Pork Shoulder Steaks

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Hungarian paprika
  1         tablespoon  ground coriander
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated lemon zest
                        = (zest from 1 lemon)
  1         tablespoon  dried marjoram
  2          teaspoons  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  caraway seeds -- crushed
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  8                     boneless pork shoulder steaks, 3/4" thk -- (abt 6 oz ea)

In a small bowl combine paprika, coriander, lemon zest, marjoram, garlic powder, salt, pepper, cumin, caraway seeds, and cinnamon.  Rub herb mixture on both sides of steaks, pressing into surface.

Place steaks in center of cooking grate.  Grill 10 minutes for medium (160 degrees) or 12 to 14 minutes for well-done (170 degrees), turning once halfway through grilling time.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A drier Riesling will support the herbs in this dish without competing with them.  Try one from the Mosel valley.

Beer Recommendation:  Try a dark, creamy beer with fortitude to support these spicy flavors; a German Altbier or an American old style.

Comments:  Ask your butcher to cut these steaks 3/4-inch thick.  Serve with Hot German Potato Salad (see recipe) and a cucumber salad.

Note:  Three to four pounds of country-style spareribs can be substituted for pork shoulder steaks.  For 3 to 4 pounds of country-style ribs, prepare as above and grill 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours or until well-done (170 degrees).

                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GREEN GODDESS DRESSING ===
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  sour cream
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh chives
  1         tablespoon  minced scallions
  1         tablespoon  tarragon vinegar
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  3                     anchovy fillets -- minced
                        === FOR THE SALMON ===
  4                     skin-on salmon fillets, 1" thk -- (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed

To make the Green Goddess Dressing:  In a food processor blend the dressing ingredients together.

Season the flesh side of the salmon fillets with salt and pepper to taste.  Generously brush or spray the flesh with olive oil.

Grill the fillets, flesh-side down, over Direct Medium heat until you can lift them with tongs off the grate without sticking, 7 to 8 minutes.

Turn the fillets and finish cooking them, skin-side down, for 2 to 3 minutes.

Slide a spatula between the skin and flesh, and transfer the fillets to serving plates.  Spoon the dressing over the fillets.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  You'll be happy to devour this with a soft California Pinot Noir.

Beer Recommendation:  A pale ale has the right amount of intensity for this dish.

Comments:  There are a couple of key points here.  Make sure you leave the salmon grilling on the flesh side long enough that it comes easily off the grill.  And don't forget the anchovies in the sauce; they make all the difference in flavor.  The chef at San Francisco's Palace Hotel created the sauce in the 1920s to honor actor George Arliss, who was performing locally in a play called "Green Goddess."

             Grilled Shrimp With Tomatillo And Avocado Salsa

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALSA ===
  12                    tomatillos -- husked, washed
  1                     ripe Haas avocado -- cut 1/4" dice
  1             medium  ripe tomato -- cut 1/4" dice
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped white onion
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
  1           teaspoon  minced jalapeÒo
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR THE SHRIMP ===
  16                    to 20 jumbo shrimp - (1 1/2 to 2 lbs) -- peeled, deveined
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Paprika -- to taste

To prepare the Salsa:  Grill the tomatillos over Direct High heat until charred in spots and softened, 4 to 6 minutes, turning occasionally.  Place the tomatillos in a food processor and process until smooth.  Pour the tomatillos into a medium bowl.  Add the remaining salsa ingredients and mix well.  Set aside until ready to serve.

Lightly brush or spray the shrimp with oil.  Season to taste with salt, pepper, and paprika.  Grill over Direct High heat until the shrimp are just opaque in the center and firm to the touch, 2 to 4 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Serve warm or at room temperature with the salsa.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A semi-sweet sparkling wine should bring some smiles to the table.

Beer Recommendation:  Stay with the regional theme and pour a cold Mexican lager.

Comments:  Salsa -- it's Mexico's answer to America's quest for convenience without compromise.  Here, tangy, grill-roasted tomatillos form a pureed base for sweet, savory, and spicy vegetables.  Dip in with some grilled shrimp for a spirited appetizer or main course.

To prepare the Salsa:  Grill the tomatillos over Direct High heat until charred in spots and softened, 4 to 6 minutes, turning occasionally.  Place the tomatillos in a food processor and process until smooth.  Pour the tomatillos into a medium bowl.  Add the remaining salsa ingredients and mix well.  Set aside until ready to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly brush or spray the shrimp with oil.  Season to taste with salt, pepper, and paprika.  Grill over Direct High heat until the shrimp are just opaque in the center and firm to the touch, 2 to 4 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve warm or at room temperature with the salsa.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  A semi-sweet sparkling wine should bring some smiles to the table.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beer Recommendation:  Stay with the regional theme and pour a cold Mexican lager.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Salsa -- it&apos;s Mexico&apos;s answer to America&apos;s quest for convenience without compromise.  Here, tangy, grill-roasted tomatillos form a pureed base for sweet, savory, and spicy vegetables.  Dip in with some grilled shrimp for a spirited appetizer or main course.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  salted water
  2              small  sweet potatoes - (abt 1 lb total)
                        Ice water -- as needed
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  salt

In a 2-quart saucepan bring salted water to a boil.  Peel and slice sweet potatoes into 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick disks.  Add disks to boiling water; blanch for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove sweet potatoes from water and plunge into a bowl of ice water to chill.

Remove from water, dry, and place in bowl or large plastic bag.  Pour oil over sweet potatoes; toss to coat.

Place sweet potatoes in center of cooking grate.  Grill 4 to 6 minutes, turning once during cooking time.  Remove sweet potatoes from grill; sprinkle with salt.

Comments:  Blanching is the secret here; it locks in flavor and color for exceptionally flavorful sweet potatoes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VEGETABLES ===
  1                     red bell pepper
  1              bunch  asparagus
  2              small  zucchini -- halved
  4                     plum tomatoes -- halved
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        === SAUCE ===
  2                     eggs -- well beaten
  1                cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  Parmesan cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === TO FINISH ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     shallot -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  spaghetti

To prepare the Vegetables:  Grill the bell pepper over Direct Medium heat until evenly charred on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes, turning every 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove the pepper from the grill and place in a paper bag; close tightly.  Let stand 10 to 15 minutes to steam off the skins.

Meanwhile, brush the asparagus, zucchini, and tomatoes with the olive oil and season with salt.  Grill over Direct Medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill.

Take the pepper out of the bag and peel away the charred skin.  Cut off the top and remove the seeds.  Coarsely chop all the vegetables and set aside.

To make the Sauce:  In a small bowl mix together the sauce ingredients.  Set aside.

In a large sautÈ pan over medium heat warm the olive oil and sautÈ the shallot and garlic until tender, about 4 minutes.  Add the grilled vegetables and stir to combine.

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the spaghetti according to package directions until al dente.  Drain the noodles and transfer to a large serving bowl.

Immediately add the sauce to the hot noodles and toss well to coat.  Add the grilled vegetables, sautÈed shallot and garlic, and toss to combine.  Serve immediately and top with additional cheese, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  This is an excellent place for a full-bodied white wine with obvious acidity, such as an Italian Pinot Grigio or a Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.

Beer Recommendation:  Try a wheat beer from Belgium or Germany.

Comments:  Add the sauce immediately to the noodles when they're still steaming hot, so the heat will thoroughly cook the eggs.  The result is one creamy dish!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === THE RUB ===
  2        tablespoons  chili powder
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR THE HAM STEAKS ===
  1         tablespoon  butter -- melted
  2                     center-cut ham steaks/ 3/4" thick

To make The Rub:  In a small bowl, combine all rub ingredients.

Brush melted butter on both sides of steaks; sprinkle rub on both sides of the steaks.  Grill ham over Direct Medium heat for 6 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve with mashed sweet potatoes and green beans, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  This dish is deliciously simple, so pick a simply elegant wine.  Try a Chablis Premier Cru, which is a Chardonnay unadorned with oak -- go for a select vineyard.  The spicy ham will benefit from the wine's medium body, long finish, and thirst-quenching acidity.

Beer Recommendation:  Try a Festbier from Germany; particularly a M‰rzen lager.  The sweeter malts and diminished hoppiness will bring out the subtly sweet flavors of the ham and the earthy spiciness of the rub.

Comments:  Ask the butcher to cut the ham steaks for you for the tastiest, easiest dinner you've made in a long time (try it for brunch, too!)

           Herb-Rubbed Rotisserie Ham With Southern Comfort Mop

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Ham
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pounds  sugar-cured butt-end smoked ham - (to 8)
                        === THE RUB ===
  3        tablespoons  mixed peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  mustard seeds
  1         tablespoon  fennel seeds
  1         tablespoon  ground cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh marjoram
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh sage
                        === THE MOP ===
  2               cups  Southern Comfort
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
     1/2           cup  molasses
     1/4           cup  prepared mustard

To make The Rub:  Using a spice grinder, mill the peppercorns, mustard seeds, and fennel seeds.  In a small bowl, combine the ground spices with the cinnamon, salt, sugar, marjoram, and sage.

Rub the mixture thoroughly into the ham, especially the fat, and refrigerate, covered, overnight.

To prepare The Mop:  Whisk together the mop ingredients.  Set aside

Center the ham lengthwise on the spit and adjust on the rotisserie.  Score the fat if desired.  Let the ham rotate over Direct Low heat, for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until internal temperature registers 140 degrees.

If you do not have a rotisserie, grill the ham over Indirect Low heat for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.

Baste the ham three times with the mop during the last 30 minutes of grilling time.  Remove from rotisserie or grill and let stand 15 minutes before carving.  Serve any remaining mop with the ham, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 to 12 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  With such intense flavors derived from bold spices and a spirited mop, there are few wines that will enhance this dish.  But you can't miss with an off-dry Chenin Blanc-based French white, especially one with a Loire Valley appellation -- try Saumur or Vouvray.

Beer Recommendation:  Let's make a detour, if only for this moment.  Try a hard draft cider, as local and as fresh as possible, to work through all these wonderfully complex flavors.  What's better than slightly sweet green apples paired with fruity spirit-drenched ham to enliven the palate and slake the thirst?

Comments:  This Southern-inspired ham is loaded with fragrant fresh herbs and basted with a deliciously sweet concoction.  For best results, pick a round ham so it cooks evenly on the rotisserie.  Don't have a rotisserie?  You can still grill this with great results.

                          Herb-Stuffed Veal Rack

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  garlic head -- roasted
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     five-bone veal rack - (abt 5 lbs) -- loin cut away from
                        the bone but still attached

Cut top off of garlic head to expose cloves; drizzle olive oil over the cloves.  Replace top and place on a large square of heavy-duty aluminum foil.  Fold up sides and seal to make a packet, leaving a little room for the expansion of steam.  Grill over Indirect Medium heat until cloves are soft, about 45 minutes.

Remove garlic from grill and let cool.  Squeeze out garlic cloves into a small bowl; mash with a fork and add mustard, soy sauce, thyme, and rosemary.  Salt and pepper to taste.

Pull back the meat from the rib bones and spread half of the garlic mixture between the bones and meat; fold meat back over, secure with kitchen string, and spread the rest of the garlic mixture over the top of the veal rack.

Grill over Indirect Medium heat until veal is medium-rare and a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the veal reads 145 degrees, about 50 to 60 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from grill and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing into individual chops.

This recipe yields 4 to 5 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  To really pick up the flavor of the herbs and bring out the succulent sweetness of the veal chops, serve an old-vines Petite Sirah from Mendocino's majestic Redwood Valley.  This California old-timer has picked up herbaceous minerals in the vine and cherry-ripeness in the berry to make a classic May-September match with these baby chops.

Beer Recommendation:  A German-style Amber Lager will marry perfectly with the green herb flavors and the sweet char of the grilled chops, leaving a subtle but lovely ring of bittersweet grain on the palate.  Like wrapping the chop in sourdough bread.

Comments:  This delicious and tender roast should be cooked only to medium-rare.  Serve with grilled asparagus to complete the spring-inspired theme.

Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GLAZE ===
  1                cup  hoisin sauce
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  grated fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
                        === FOR THE RIBS ===
  4             pounds  pork baby back ribs - (to 6)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds

To make the Glaze:  In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the hoisin sauce, honey, vinegar, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, and curry powder.  Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, and cook over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes to blend the flavors.  Remove from the heat.

Season the ribs liberally with salt and pepper.  Grill over Indirect Medium heat, turning once halfway through grilling time.  When the ribs have cooked for 1 hour, start basting them every 15 minutes or so with the hoisin glaze until the meat is very tender and has shrunk from the ends of the bones, 15 to 30 minutes more.  A few minutes before the ribs are finished, sprinkle them with the sesame seeds.

Remove the ribs from the grill and cut between the bones.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A fruity red -- Gamay Beaujolais, young Zinfandel, or Australian Shiraz -- will stand up to the sweetness and spice of the glaze on these succulent ribs.

Comments:  Baby back ribs have less fat and cook more quickly than spare ribs.  For an attractive presentation, tie the ribs together in pairs with bok choy and scallions.  They can be served as a starter or as a main course.

                       Hoisin-Glazed Barbecued Duck

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  barbecue sauce
     1/4           cup  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/2                lime -- juice only
  4                     boneless duck breasts
                        Olive oil cooking spray -- as needed

In a small bowl, blend barbecue sauce, hoisin sauce, cilantro, and lime juice well.

Rinse duck breasts and pat dry with paper towels.  Spray lightly with olive oil.  Place on cooking grate over Direct Medium heat.  Grill for 4 minutes, then brush liberally with glaze and turn.

Place glazed-side down in center of cooking grate over Indirect Medium heat.  Brush tops with glaze and grill for an additional 5 to 8 minutes or until internal temperature registers 160 degrees.  Brush with glaze once again just before removing from grill.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Try one of the new "Super Tuscan" reds, particularly a blend of Sangiovese and Merlot grapes.  It will bring out the richness and sweetness of the duck while emphasizing the complex nexus of fruit and ripe tannins in the wine.  East meets West in a blaze of glory.

Beer Recommendation:  Ever try a Barley Wine?  Well, now's your chance.  This potent pale ale will stand up to the intensely rich flavor of the duck and subdue the sweetness of the hoisin sauce, making for a big and earthy gustatory pleasure.

Comments:  Tired of chicken?  Indulge in some delicious duck.  This recipe makes it quick and easy -- just grab your favorite barbecue sauce and you're almost done!

                         Holiday Beef Tenderloin

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTE ===
  1              whole  garlic head
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
                        === BEEF ===
  1                     beef tenderloin - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs)
  3        tablespoons  whole pink peppercorns
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

To make the Paste:  Remove the loose, papery outer skin from the head of garlic.  Cut about 1/2 inch off the top to expose the cloves.  Place the garlic head on an 8-inch square of aluminum foil and drizzle 1 teaspoon of the olive oil over the cloves.  Fold up the foil sides and seal to make a packet, leaving a little room for the expansion of steam.  Grill over Indirect Medium heat until the cloves are soft, 30 to 45 minutes.

Remove from the grill and allow to cool.  Squeeze the garlic from the individual cloves into a small bowl.  Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil and mash the garlic and oil together with a fork to form a paste.

Trim the tenderloin of any excess fat and silver skin.  Spread the paste on the tenderloin, rubbing it into the meat.

In a small bowl combine the peppercorns, rosemary, salt, and pepper.  Mix well and press into the paste on the top and sides of the tenderloin.

Allow the tenderloin to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling.  Grill over Indirect Medium heat until the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees for medium-rare, 30 to 40 minutes.

Remove from the grill and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.  The temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees during this time.  Cut into 3/4- to 1-inch slices and serve warm.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Before you reach for the Cabernet Sauvignon, may we suggest a South African wine called Pinotage?  This marvelously peppery, herbaceous full-bodied red is unique to this country.  Look for wines from the glorious Stellenbosch region.

Beer Recommendation:  Enjoy one of life's simple pleasures; rich red meat and good strong beer.  Try a regional American Winter Ale -- such as Leinenkugel or Sam Adams -- for a round, full, and nutty counterpart to this wonderful garlic-infused beef.

Comments:  Wrap a tender beef roast in garlic, rosemary, and pink peppercorns and you've got a dinner party.

Hint:  You can roast the garlic a day or two ahead of time while you are grilling something else.

                       Horseradish-Marinated Salmon

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  prepared horseradish
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Olive oil spray -- for spraying foil
  6                     salmon fillets - (abt 5 oz ea)

In a blender or food processor, purÈe horseradish, onion, balsamic vinegar, oil, rosemary, and garlic.  Add salt and pepper; blend.

Place each salmon fillet in center of a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil sprayed with olive oil.  Spoon 2 tablespoons horseradish mixture over each fillet.  Bring up edges of each piece of foil and seal, leaving a little space for expansion of steam.

Place foil packets in center of cooking grate.  Grill 6 to 10 minutes or until fish is opaque and flesh flakes easily with a fork.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A Sauvignon Blanc will not only balance the horseradish, but also draw out the sweetness in the balsamic vinegar and onions.

Beer Recommendation:  This interesting contrast of bitter (horseradish) and sweet (salmon flesh) is best negotiated with an Irish red ale.  Cheers!

Comments:  You've never really tasted salmon until you've paired it with horseradish.  Exquisite!

                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              large  French baguette -- halved lengthwise
  1              bunch  arugula -- washed, dried
  1                cup  grated Fontina cheese

In a small bowl, mix together the sour cream, horseradish, and mustard.  Set aside.

Lightly brush or spray the tenderloin with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Allow the tenderloin to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling.

Sear over Direct High heat until well marked, 8 to 10 minutes.  Continue grilling over Indirect Medium heat until the internal temperature reaches 140 degrees for medium-rare, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the grill, and let rest for 3 to 5 minutes. The internal temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees during this time.  Cut into 1/8-inch slices.

Lightly brush the cut side of the baguette with olive oil and grill, cut-side down, over Direct Medium heat until lightly toasted, about 30 seconds.

Spread the baguette with the sour cream mixture, layer with arugula and sliced tenderloin, then top with the grated cheese.  Cut crosswise into individual sandwiches.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Bring out a big, bold red wine, something like a California Cabernet or Zinfandel, to pour with these equally rich, meaty masterpieces.

Beer Recommendation:  Treat your guests to some cold bottles of a pilsner made with full-flavored hops.

Comments:  Thin slices of supple grilled beef give this simple recipe most of its glory and glamour.  The sour cream dressing, grated cheese, and peppery arugula add their own spectacular touches but remember, it's still a sandwich.  Plates are optional.

                          Indonesian Duck Breast

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce - (to 4)
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds -- toasted
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed
                        === FOR THE DUCK ===
  4                     duck breasts -- boned with skin on
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  1           teaspoon  hoisin sauce
     1/2    tablespoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  sake wine
                        Polenta or mashed potatoes -- for serving

In a small bowl, combine marinade ingredients and mix well.  Place duck breasts in a resealable plastic bag; pour marinade over breasts and marinate in refrigerator for 24 hours, turning twice.

Remove breasts from marinade; reserve marinade.

Place breasts in center of cooking grate.  Grill for 10 minutes or until juices run clear, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from grill.  Cover and let rest for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine chicken broth, hoisin sauce, and reserved marinade; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer.  In a small bowl, whisk cornstarch and sake together to form a thin paste; whisk into sauce.  Continue simmering until sauce is slightly thickened, about 1 to 2 minutes.

Slice duck breasts diagonally and arrange on individual plates or a large platter with the sauce.  Serve with polenta or mashed potatoes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  The wonderful grilled, savory, and herbaceous flavors of this dish will marry well with the earthy and fruit-driven flavors of a red CÙtes-du-RhÙne.

Beer Recommendation:  Each sip of the citric, pleasantly acidic flavors of a true Weissbier will refresh you as you enjoy another bite of this flavorful dish.  Add a wedge of lemon to this wheat-based brew to heighten the flavors of the duck.

Comments:  This extraordinary dish is amazingly delicious and deceptively simple.  An excellent recipe for entertaining!

                Main Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  firm tomatoes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  hot or mild Italian sausage
     1/3           cup  cooked rice
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  2                     fresh basil leaves -- julienned
                        Olive oil cooking spray -- as needed
                        === SAUCE ===
                        Pulp from tomatoes
  1                     small can tomato sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Sugar -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  sour cream

Cut off top quarter of each tomato; set tops aside.  Carefully scoop out and reserve tomato pulp.  Season empty tomato cavities with salt and pepper.  Set aside.

Mix sausage with rice, parsley, and basil.  Fill tomato cavities with sausage mixture and replace tomato tops.  Spray tomatoes lightly with oil and place on a baking sheet.  Place baking sheet in center of cooking grate and grill for 20 to 25 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Sauce:  Combine reserved tomato pulp with tomato sauce.  Add salt, pepper, and sugar to taste; bring to a boil.  Remove from heat.  Add sour cream and adjust seasoning to taste.

Place some sauce on individual plates; top each plate with a stuffed tomato.  Serve warm with grilled zucchini and crusty baguettes, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A wine match for this dish is easier than you might think; a zesty Dolcetto from Piemonte, Italy.  Light-to-medium and fruit-forward, this red will match the meaty intensity of the sausage and the sweet acidity of the tomatoes.

Beer Recommendation:  If you prefer a beer, try a classic Italian lager, such as a Peroni or a Moretti.  Both are perfect examples of the simple, thirst-quenching properties needed for to help this dish sing out its flavors.

Comments:  This delicious take on the tomato makes the most of summer's bounty with ingredients fresh from your garden.  Serve as an appetizer for eight or a light lunch for four.

                        === MANGO-CUCUMBER SALSA ===
  2               cups  chopped peeled mango
  2               cups  chopped peeled cucumber
  1 1/4           cups  chopped red bell pepper
     3/4           cup  chopped shallots
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the Marinade:  In a medium bowl, combine all marinade ingredients.  Set aside.

With a sharp knife, score the fillets lengthwise in parallel lines about 3/4-inch apart.  Place the fillets in a resealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over them.  Press out the air and seal the bag tightly, then turn the bag several times to distribute the marinade.  Set in a large bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or preferably overnight, turning the bag occasionally.

Just before grilling the snapper fillets, prepare the Salsa:  In a large bowl, mix the mango, cucumber, red pepper, shallots, cilantro, lime juice, and jalapeÒo.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Set aside.

Remove the snapper from the marinade and pat dry.  Lightly brush the fillets with the oil and place them skin-side down on the cooking grate.  Grill over Direct Medium heat for 8 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork, turning one halfway through grilling time.

Serve warm with the mango salsa.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Prepare this fragrant dish one day ahead... it does wonders for the fish.  (This recipe is from the repertoire of Fletcher Morgan.)

Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GINGER-BANANA CHUTNEY ===
  1             medium  red onion -- minced
  2        tablespoons  oil
  3                     ripe small bananas -- peeled, and
                        cut into small cubes
  1                cup  pitted dates -- coarsely diced
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar
  1                cup  pineapple juice
     2/3           cup  raisins
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped crystalized ginger
  1           teaspoon  Madras curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  Kosher salt
                        === PINEAPPLE CHUTNEY ===
  1                can  crushed pineapple - (20 oz)
  1                cup  white balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  1              small  red onion -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  1                     red finger chile pepper -- seeded, veined,
                        and minced
                        === JERK PORK ===
  1             medium  yellow onion -- minced
  6                     green onions with 1/2" green tops -- trimmed, and
                        finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     red finger chile peppers -- seeded, veined,
                        and finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  cider or distiled white vinegar
  1           teaspoon  ground allspice
  1           teaspoon  brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  4             pounds  boneless pork loin or
                        pork shoulder roast (Boston butt)

To make the Ginger-Banana Chutney:  In a 2-quart saucepan cook the onions in oil 5 to 10 minutes or until translucent.  Add bananas, dates, and vinegar; mix well.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes.

Add pineapple juice, raisins, ginger, curry powder, and salt.  Continue cooking 5 to 10 minutes or until mixture is the consistency of marmalade.  Remove from heat and chill.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use or up to 3 days.

To make the Pineapple Chutney:  In a 2-quart saucepan combine pineapple chutney ingredients.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer uncovered about 30 to 40 minutes.  Remove from heat and chill.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use or up to 3 days.

To make the Jerk Pork:  In a small bowl mix together all remaining ingredients except pork roast.  Place pork roast in large resealable plastic bag.  Pour marinade over roast, rubbing and pressing it into meat surface.  Close bag.  Marinate in the refrigerator 6 to 8 hours or overnight, turning bag occasionally to distribute marinade.

Remove roast from marinade; discard marinade.  Place roast in center of cooking grate and grill 2 1/2 to 3 hours for well-done (170 degrees), or until tender.

Remove from grill and let stand, covered, 5 minutes before slicing or "jerking" (shredding or cutting into 1-inch slivers).  Serve with 2 tablespoons Ginger-Banana Chutney or Pineapple Chutney, if desired.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  The spices and intensely flavored condiments urge you to "go red" with this one.  Look for one loaded with berries and cherries, like you'll find in a Barolo from Italy.

Beer Recommendation:  Don't waste your time guessing.  For jerk pork there's really only one beer; Red Stripe Lager from Kingston, Jamaica.

Comments:  This authentic Caribbean recipe is incredibly flavorful.  Make the chutneys a day or two in advance to allow the flavors to blend.  In a hurry?  Use your favorite bottled chutney.

Madras curry powder is a sweeter blend than standard curry powder, sometimes available in the spice section of the grocery store.  If you can't find Madras curry powder at your local grocer's, add a pinch of sugar with the regular curry powder.

        Kansas City-Style Pork Spareribs With Weber Barbecue Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE RIBS ===
  3        tablespoons  Kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  Hungarian paprika
  1 1/2    tablespoons  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  ground Mediterranean oregano
  2          teaspoons  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  3                     slabs pork spareribs - (to 4) -- abt 2 lbs ea
                        === WEBER TANGY BARBECUE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
  3        tablespoons  chopped onion
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  catsup
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper

In a small bowl combine salt, paprika, cumin, oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, allspice, and cinnamon.  Rub seasoning mix onto ribs, pressing into surface.  Place ribs in jumbo resealable plastic bag.  Close bag and marinate in refrigerator 2 hours.

Place ribs in center of cooking grate.  Grill 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until tender.

Meanwhile, make the Weber Tangy Barbecue Sauce:  In a skillet cook celery and onion in butter until tender.  Add remaining ingredients.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat.  Cover and simmer 15 minutes.

Brush ribs with barbecue sauce during last 20 minutes of grilling time.  Cut into 2- or 3-rib portions.  Serve with remaining heated sauce, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A low-tannin wine like a slightly chilled Beaujolais will let the many spices come through.

Beer Recommendation:  To carry all this spice and goodness, you need a beer with big shoulders; a deep and honeyed Porter.

Comments:  Serious rib fans use a rub and a sauce for unmistakable barbecue flavor.  This recipe features two classic concoctions.

Wine Recommendation:  A low-tannin wine like a slightly chilled Beaujolais will let the many spices come through.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beer Recommendation:  To carry all this spice and goodness, you need a beer with big shoulders; a deep and honeyed Porter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Serious rib fans use a rub and a sauce for unmistakable barbecue flavor.  This recipe features two classic concoctions.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  unsweetened pineapple juice
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3          teaspoons  arrowroot
  1         tablespoon  water
  6                     kiwi fruit -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  6             slices  lemon pound cake - (2 oz ea)
  3                     firm bananas -- peeled, and
                        cut in half crosswise
     1/4           cup  butter -- melted
  6             scoops  vanilla ice cream
  1           teaspoon  black sesame seeds

In a small saucepan combine pineapple juice and sugar.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes.  Dissolve arrowroot in water and add gradually to liquid, stirring constantly until slightly thickened.  Remove from heat to cool.  Gently fold kiwi slices into sauce.

Brush cake slices and banana halves lightly with butter; place on cooking grate.  Grill 3 to 4 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Serve each cake slice topped with a banana half.  Arrange kiwi sauce around cake and serve with a scoop of ice cream.  Sprinkle with black sesame seeds.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A demi-sec dessert wine with plenty of citrus notes will cushion the pound cake and cuddle the sauce.  Try one from the Loire Valley.

Comments:  This tropical dessert is the perfect closure for any Polynesian or Asian meal.  You can also make it with orange pound cake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              whole  boneless skinless chicken breasts
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing chicken
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil - (to 3)
  2        tablespoons  ground coriander
  2        tablespoons  minced lemongrass
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar

In a small bowl combine all marinade ingredients.  Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag set in a shallow dish.  Pour marinade over chicken; close bag.  Marinate in refrigerator 4 hours, turning occasionally to distribute marinade.

Lightly brush chicken with oil.  Place in center of cooking grate.  Grill 10 to 12 minutes until tender and no longer pink inside, turning once halfway through grilling time.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A light- to medium-bodied dry white is in order here.  A Sauvignon Blanc from, say, Napa will stand up to the lime and coriander without overwhelming them.

Beer Recommendation:  The natural match for this authentic Thai dish?  A lager like no other; Singha, straight from Bangkok.

Comments:  Tropical fruit meets earthy herb and piquant spice in this white meat paradise.

                Sausage

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2        medium  yellow onion -- finely chopped
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  shredded carrot
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1                can  peeled whole tomatoes - (28 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     hot Italian sausage, 1" thk -- (abt 4 oz ea)
     1/4                cup-finely chopped fresh basil
  1              pound  linguine
  1                cup  toasted breadcrumbs -- (optional)

To make the sauce:  In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and garlic.  Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the carrot and oregano.  Cook for 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally.

In a large bowl crush the tomatoes in your hands and add them, along with all the juices, to the saucepan.  Season with the salt and pepper.  Simmer for 10 minutes.

Grill the sausages over Direct Medium heat until no longer pink in the center, 6 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove the sausages from the grill.  Slice them thinly crosswise and then roughly chop them.  Add the sausages and basil to the saucepan.  Stir.  Keep warm.

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the linguine until barely tender.  Drain the linguine and return it to the pot.  Add the sauce.  Stir to combine.  Cover the pot for 1 minute to allow the pasta to absorb some sauce.  Sprinkle toasted breadcrumbs on top, if desired.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  This dish calls for a "big" red wine like Zinfandel.

Beer Recommendation:  A pale ale with a little sweetness hits the spot.

Comments:  This pasta will soothe you right down to your soul.  Grilled sausages are the key to the tomato sauce's hearty character.  If you prefer a milder dish, use sweet (not hot) Italian sausages.

                        for at least 30 minutes
                        === MEDITERRANEAN SALAD ===
  4                     tomatoes -- large dice

Combine chilies and all other marinade ingredients in a food processor.  PurÈe until smooth.  Chill until ready to use (jam may be made up to 3 days ahead of time).

Rub the steaks with the jam, place in a resealable plastic bag, and marinate for one hour at room temperature.

Meanwhile, make the Mediterranean Salad:  Combine tomatoes, onion, olives, lemon juice, and oil.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Toss lightly and refrigerate.

Follow the grill's instructions for using wood chips for smoking.  Place steaks in center of cooking grate and grill for 8 to 10 for medium-rare, or until desired doneness, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Let steaks rest for 5 minutes before serving.  Slice thinly on the diagonal against the grain.  Serve warm with the salad on the side.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A Pinot Noir from South Australia is balanced and fruit-forward enough to work with the tomato/lemon flavors of the salad and the sweet/sour flavors of the Ancho chili jam.

Beer Recommendation:  This Southwest/Mediterranean hybrid dish needs a multifaceted brew.  Try a Pedigree Ale from Burton County in Great Britain.  It, too, is a hybrid -- of Pale Ale and Bitter -- with nutty, malty flavors.

Comments:  Ancho chilies pick up smoky tones in this recipe from the chef at Lovells of Lake Forest in Illinois.  It's great thinly sliced in a sandwich and, paired with this salad, it's a fusion dish brimming with flavor.

               Maple-Glazed Pear, Endive, And Arugula Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Salads/Dressings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PEARS ===
  2                     firm ripe Bartlett pears -- trimmed, halved
  4        tablespoons  maple syrup -- divided
  5        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice -- divided
                        === SALAD ===
     1/2           cup  pecan halves
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  2            bunches  arugula -- rinsed, trimmed
                        = (abt 6 cups)
  4              heads  Belgian endive -- rinsed, trimmed
  2             ounces  saga blue or other
                        mild blue veined cheese -- crumbled, or
                        cut small dice
     1/4           cup  pomegranate seeds

To prepare the Pears:  Remove the core from the halved pears with a measuring teaspoon or melon baller.  In a pie plate combine 1 tablespoon of the maple syrup and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice; stir until blended.

Dip the pears into the juice and turn to coat.  Grill over Direct Medium heat until lightly browned, about 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Transfer to a side dish.

To make the Salad:  In a 9-inch-square metal or disposable heavy-duty aluminum baking pan, spread pecans in a single layer and grill over Direct Medium heat until toasted, about 8 minutes, stirring once.  Remove from the grill and when cool, coarsely chop.

In a large bowl whisk together the remaining 3 tablespoons of the maple syrup, 4 tablespoons of the lemon juice, and the salt.  Add the arugula and endive; toss to coat.

Divide evenly among 4 salad plates.  Place a pear half, cut-side up, in the center of each plate.  Sprinkle with the toasted pecans and top with the cheese and pomegranate seeds, distributing evenly.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Honey-glazed pears, bitter greens, and blue cheese make a wonderful combination, and the grill adds just the right touch to tie it all together.

Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE
  2        tablespoons  fresh orange juice
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  tamari
  2          teaspoons  grated orange zest
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/8      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
                        === FOR THE CUTLETS ===
  8                     thin boneless pork cutlets - (abt 1 3/4 lb -- trimmed of fat,
                        and slightly pounded
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === DRESSING ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  rice wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Asian sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  tamari
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
                        === SALAD ===
  2              large  navel oranges
  3                     plum tomatoes -- cored, diced
     1/2           cup  julienned peeled jicama
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped cilantro
  2                     Romaine hearts -- trimmed, and
                        cut crosswise into 1/2" slices

To make the Marinade:  In a small bowl whisk together the marinade ingredients.

Lightly season the pork cutlets on both sides with salt and pepper.  Place the cutlets in a large, plastic resealable bag and pour in the marinade.  Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly.  Turn the bag to distribute the marinade, place the bag on a plate, and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours, turning the bag occasionally.

To make the Dressing:  In a small bowl whisk together the dressing ingredients.  Set aside

To make the Salad:  Section the orange by first slicing off the top and bottom of the fruit just down to the juicy pulp.  Stand the fruit on one flat end and, using a sharp paring knife, slice off the rind and all the whitish pith in curved, vertical strips.  Cut just to where the juice and the pith meet.  Turn the fruit as you go, following the curve of the fruit as you slice downward.

Proceed with the following cuts over a medium bowl to catch the juice and segments:  Slice along the length of one side of a membrane dividing two sections.  Cut just to the tapered inner edge of the section.  Repeat on the other side of the segment, separating the fruit from the membrane.  Give the knife a slight twist to pop out the clean section.  Repeat with all remaining sections.  Add the rest of the salad ingredients, except lettuce, add the dressing, and set aside until ready to serve.

Remove the cutlets from the bag and discard the marinade.  Grill over Direct Medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

To serve, place two cutlets on each serving plate.  Add the lettuce to the salad mixture and toss to combine.  Spoon salad on top of the cutlets, dividing evenly.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Pull the cork on a fruity, light-bodied Pinot Noir from Sonoma.

Beer Recommendation:  A graceful wheat beer, preferably a microbrew from Washington State, tastes just right here.

Comments:  Tamari is a dark sauce made with soybeans but it has a richer, less salty taste than soy sauce.  Mix it in the marinade with orange juice, though be sure to remove the orange zest (for both the marinade and the dressing) before squeezing the juice.

Proceed with the following cuts over a medium bowl to catch the juice and segments:  Slice along the length of one side of a membrane dividing two sections.  Cut just to the tapered inner edge of the section.  Repeat on the other side of the segment, separating the fruit from the membrane.  Give the knife a slight twist to pop out the clean section.  Repeat with all remaining sections.  Add the rest of the salad ingredients, except lettuce, add the dressing, and set aside until ready to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the cutlets from the bag and discard the marinade.  Grill over Direct Medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, place two cutlets on each serving plate.  Add the lettuce to the salad mixture and toss to combine.  Spoon salad on top of the cutlets, dividing evenly.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  Pull the cork on a fruity, light-bodied Pinot Noir from Sonoma.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beer Recommendation:  A graceful wheat beer, preferably a microbrew from Washington State, tastes just right here.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Tamari is a dark sauce made with soybeans but it has a richer, less salty taste than soy sauce.  Mix it in the marinade with orange juice, though be sure to remove the orange zest (for both the marinade and the dressing) before squeezing the juice.

             Marinated Pork Strips In Lettuce Packages - ...

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  pork shoulder blade -- cut 1/2" slices
  1               head  green or red leaf lettuce
     1/2           cup  hot bean paste -- (optional)
  2               cups  kimchi (pickled cabbage)
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/3           cup  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  Asian sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  grated ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce

To make the Marinade:  In a medium bowl whisk together the marinade ingredients, making sure to dissolve the sugar.

Place the pork in a large, resealable plastic bag and pour in the marinade.  Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly.  Turn the bag to distribute the marinade, place in a bowl, and refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours, turning occasionally.

Remove the pork from the bag and discard the marinade.  Grill the pork slices over Direct Medium heat until no longer pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Transfer the pork to a cutting board.  Allow the meat to rest for 1 to 2 minutes.  Slice the meat into bite-size pieces.

Allow each guest to pick a whole lettuce leaf, spread a little bean paste on top (if desired), arrange some pork and kimchi in the middle, and roll it up!

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Look for smooth, voluptuous red wine like Merlot.

Beer Recommendation:  A crisp wheat ale makes a refreshing companion here.

Comments:  Bulgogi is the national barbecue dish of Korea.  Thin slices of marinated beef, pork, or chicken are grilled over charcoal or gas, and then wrapped in lettuce leaves along with pickled vegetables and, sometimes, hot bean paste.  It is eaten with your fingers, like a spring roll.  Kimchi can be purchased in Korean markets.

            Marinated Sirloin With Red Peppers And Artichokes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  artichokes
  2              large  red bell peppers
  1                     sirloin steak, 1 1/2" thk - (abt 2 lbs)
                        === MARINADE/DRESSING ===
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the Marinade/Dressing:  In a small bowl whisk together the marinade ingredients.

To prepare the artichokes:  Trim the tops and tip of stems, remove the tough outside leaves, and halve the artichokes lengthwise.  Steam the artichokes in a vegetable steamer over boiling water, covered, until tender, about 20 minutes.  Transfer to a plate.  When cool enough to handle scoop out the fuzzy choke and prickly center leaves and discard.

Cut the bell peppers in half lengthwise and remove the stems and seeds.  Flatten the pepper halves with the palm of your hand.

Lightly brush the artichokes and bell peppers with about 1 tablespoon of the marinade.

Trim the steak of nearly all fat and place on a platter.  Spoon 1 tablespoon of the marinade over each side of the steak, cover, and let stand at room temperature for about 20 minutes.

Grill the steak, peppers, and artichokes over Direct High heat, turning once halfway through grilling time.  The steak will take 12 minutes for medium-rare, the peppers will take 10 to 12 minutes, and the artichokes will take 5 minutes.  Remove from grill.  Place the steak on a platter and cover lightly with aluminum foil.  Allow grilled steak to stand for 5 minutes.

To serve:  Cut the steak into thin slices, arrange on a heated platter, and surround with red peppers and artichokes.  Spoon the remaining marinade/dressing over the meat and vegetables.  Garnish platter with sprigs of fresh rosemary, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  For this rustic dish, just grab your favorite Cabernet blend and have at it!

Comments:  This home-made vinaigrette and the flame of the grill bring out the best in both the steak and the hearty vegetables.  To save time, marinate the meat and cut up the peppers while the artichokes are steaming.

Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  sweet potatoes -- scrubbed
  1              large  yellow onion -- cut 1/2" slices
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter -- softened

Grill the sweet potatoes over Indirect Medium heat until tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour, turning three or four times during grilling time.  Remove from the grill and allow to cool slightly.

When cool enough to handle, cut the potatoes in half lengthwise.  Remove and discard the skins.  Place the potatoes in a medium bowl and cover with aluminum foil.

Brush or spray the onion slices with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill over Direct Medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill and allow to cool, then cut into 1/4-inch dice.

Using a heavy-duty mixer or potato masher, mash the potatoes with the butter until smooth.  Add the diced onions and mix well.  Season with more salt and pepper, if desired.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  How sweet it is!  This easy recipe uses the grill to reinvent a traditional holiday side dish.  Choose similar-sized potatoes for even cooking.

Note:  The sweet potatoes are grilled over Indirect Medium heat and the onion slices over Direct Medium heat.

Categories    : Grilling                        Sandwiches
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  red bell peppers -- halved lengthwise
  4             medium  portobello mushroom caps - (abt 8 oz)
  1             medium  eggplant -- cut 1/2"-thk slices
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  4             ounces  goat cheese - (abt a 3" log)
                        = (or soft pepper cheese)
  8             slices  crusty French or Italian bread -- cut 1/2" thk,
                        and toasted
     1/4           cup  sliced fresh basil

Brush peppers, mushrooms, and eggplant with oil.  Place peppers in center of cooking grate and grill for 2 minutes.  Add mushrooms and eggplant and continue grilling an additional 8 to 10 minutes or until all vegetables are tender, turning occasionally during grilling time.

Season vegetables with salt and pepper to taste.  Drizzle vinegar over vegetables.  Spread 1 tablespoon cheese on one side of each toasted bread slice.  Evenly arrange vegetables and basil on 4 bread slices.  Close sandwiches.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Nothing "sauces" grilled vegetables and goat cheese as nicely as Merlot.  Pick your favorite velvety one and let the night smolder on....

Beer Recommendation:  For these Medi-veggies, a malty beer from the region; a Moretti Doppiomalto from Italy.  Or any double bock full of nutty sweetness.

Comments:  These vegetables and goat cheese make a simple, classic, and wonderful combination.

<DirT>
Beer Recommendation:  For these Medi-veggies, a malty beer from the region; a Moretti Doppiomalto from Italy.  Or any double bock full of nutty sweetness.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  These vegetables and goat cheese make a simple, classic, and wonderful combination.

                          Mediterranean Sea Bass

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     skinless Chilean sea bass fillets, 1" thk -- (abt 6 oz ea)
                        Lemon wedges -- (optional)
                        === PASTE ===
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
  2          teaspoons  dried lavender
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

To make the Paste:  In a small bowl whisk together the paste ingredients.

Spread the paste evenly on both sides of the fish fillets.  Grill over Direct High heat until the flesh is opaque throughout and starting to flake, 5 to 7 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Serve warm and garnish with lemon wedges, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  The fish is from New World and the rub is from the Old World.  What better choice than an exciting RhÙne-style white from California or Australia?  Viognier, Marsanne, or Rousanne are the grapes to look for, either as varietal labels or as blends.

Beer Recommendation:  Try one of the world's finest ales from the six Trappist monasteries of Belgium and the Netherlands.  The finest "Triple Ales" from the Chimay, Westmalle, Westvleteren, Rochefort, Orval, or  Schaapskooi abbeys will enliven the delicate flavors of this dish, bringing out texture and spice.

Comments:  This recipe is all about Provence, and these are the ingredients that make the region's food sing.  Keep it simple and enjoy.  (Suitable substitutes; red snapper, striped bass.)

                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  fennel bulb
  2              large  onions
  1             medium  zucchini
  1              large  bell pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                     dried ancho chili -- deseeded, soaked in
                        water until soft, then chopped coarsely
  1                     jalapeÒo -- seeded, chopped
  4         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  tomatoes -- chopped

  2             slices  toast
  2          teaspoons  red wine vinegar - (to 3)

To make the vegetables:  Cut fennel in half from leaf end.  Lay fennel on cut side and cut into 1/2-inch thick slices through the root end but leaving the root intact.

Cut the zucchini 1/3-inch thick on a bias; cut the bell pepper into 1-inch thick strips from top to bottom.  Season the vegetables with the salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder.  Brush with oil.

Grill the fennel and onions over Indirect Medium heat for 30 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Grill the zucchini and peppers over Direct Medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes.  Occasionally brush the vegetables with oil during grilling time.

To make the Sauce:  Place all sauce ingredients in a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped.

Arrange vegetables on a platter and serve with the romesco sauce and pita bread.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Add a zesty and intriguing dimension to earthy veggies with this classic sauce from Catalonia, Spain.

            Monkfish, Shrimp, Scallop, And Apricot Mixed Grill

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  maple syrup
     1/4           cup  lime juice
                        = (juice of 2 medium limes)
  2        tablespoons  chopped seeded red finger chile pepper
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR THE SEAFOOD ===
  1              pound  monkfish -- cut 1" cubes
  6                     fresh apricots -- halved, pitted
  12                    raw large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  6                     sea scallops
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground peppercorns

To make the Sauce:  In small bowl, whisk together maple syrup, lime juice, chile pepper, basil, parsley, salt, and black pepper.  Cover and store in refrigerator 1 hour or until ready to use.

Thread six 12-inch skewers with pieces of monkfish, apricot, shrimp, scallop, shrimp, apricot, and monkfish.  Brush with oil.  Sprinkle skewers with salt and peppercorns.

Place skewers on cooking grate.  Grill 8 to 10 minutes or until scallops are opaque and shrimp are pink, turning once halfway through grilling time.

To serve, sprinkle each skewer with about 1 tablespoon sauce.  Pass with remaining sauce for dipping.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  For this elegant and special dinner, only a brut sparkling wine will do.  Choose a fine one from California and the clean, tiny bubbles will let all the flavors come through.

Beer Recommendation:  A mixed seafood grill is a challenge to match, but an English Porter will do the trick.  Especially when it's Samuel Smith's Famous Taddy Porter.

Comments:  The firm and succulent monkfish makes an exceptional grill companion, especially when teamed with sweet shellfish and apricots.

Note:  If using wooden skewers, soak in water thirty minutes before using so ends won't burn during grilling time.

                  Mussels Stuffed With Ratatouille Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh mussels - (abt 3 dozen)
                        === SALAD ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/3           cup  finely-diced green bell peppers
     1/3           cup  finely-diced yellow bell peppers
     1/3           cup  finely-diced red bell peppers
     1/3           cup  finely-diced onions
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/3           cup  finely-diced yellow squash
     1/3           cup  finely-diced tomato
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  white wine
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh basil
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh tarragon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Kosher salt -- as nedded for bed
                        Coarsely-chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

Scrub, rinse, and debeard the mussels.  Spread the mussels in a single layer in a 13- by 9-inch heavy-duty aluminum foil pan.  Pour 1/4 cup water over the mussels.  Cover the pan with aluminum foil.  Grill over Direct High heat until the mussels are opened, 5 to 6 minutes.

Remove from the grill; chill mussels.  Remove mussels from shells and discard one half of the shell. (Note:  Discard any unopened mussels as they are not safe to eat.)

To make the Salad:  In a large sautÈ pan, warm the oil and sautÈ the bell peppers, onions, and garlic for 2 to 4 minutes; add the squash and continue sautÈing for 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and add the remaining ingredients.  Mix well and chill completely.

Place about 1 tablespoon ratatouille salad in each mussel shell and place the shell on a bed of kosher salt.  Top each salad-filled shell with a chilled mussel.  Sprinkle with coarsely chopped parsley.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Find harmony with a crisp, dry rosÈ, especially a Tavel from France's RhÙne Valley or an earthier rosado from the Navarra region of Spain.  The wine's refreshing acidity will do the mussels and the salad justice.

Beer Recommendation:  Beer with mussels is a national obsession in Belgium, so try one of Belgium's five true Trappist Abbey ales; Afflagem, Chimay, Orval, Rochefort, or Westmalle.  You'll have an almost-creamy sweet and sour sauce for the mussels that emphasizes the freshness of the vegetables.

Comments:  Chilled mussels perched atop crisp fresh veggies splashed with wine and vinegar?  Talk about refreshing!

<DirT>
Scrub, rinse, and debeard the mussels.  Spread the mussels in a single layer in a 13- by 9-inch heavy-duty aluminum foil pan.  Pour 1/4 cup water over the mussels.  Cover the pan with aluminum foil.  Grill over Direct High heat until the mussels are opened, 5 to 6 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the grill; chill mussels.  Remove mussels from shells and discard one half of the shell. (Note:  Discard any unopened mussels as they are not safe to eat.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Salad:  In a large sautÈ pan, warm the oil and sautÈ the bell peppers, onions, and garlic for 2 to 4 minutes; add the squash and continue sautÈing for 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and add the remaining ingredients.  Mix well and chill completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place about 1 tablespoon ratatouille salad in each mussel shell and place the shell on a bed of kosher salt.  Top each salad-filled shell with a chilled mussel.  Sprinkle with coarsely chopped parsley.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 appetizer servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  Find harmony with a crisp, dry rosÈ, especially a Tavel from France&apos;s RhÙne Valley or an earthier rosado from the Navarra region of Spain.  The wine&apos;s refreshing acidity will do the mussels and the salad justice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beer Recommendation:  Beer with mussels is a national obsession in Belgium, so try one of Belgium&apos;s five true Trappist Abbey ales; Afflagem, Chimay, Orval, Rochefort, or Westmalle.  You&apos;ll have an almost-creamy sweet and sour sauce for the mussels that emphasizes the freshness of the vegetables.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Chilled mussels perched atop crisp fresh veggies splashed with wine and vinegar?  Talk about refreshing!

                         N'Awlins Barbecue Shrimp

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  32             large  shrimp in shells - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
                        === MARINADE ===
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh thyme
  2          teaspoons  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/4      teaspoon  turmeric

To make the Marinade:  In a small sautÈ pan over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the remaining marinade ingredients.  Stir and allow to cool at room temperature.

Using a sharp knife split open the back of each shrimp and devein it.  Place the shrimp in a large, resealable plastic bag and pour in the marinade.  Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly.  Turn the bag to distribute the marinade, place in a bowl, and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes.

Remove the shrimp from the bag and discard the marinade.  Grill over Direct High heat until the shrimp are just opaque in the center and firm to the touch, 2 to 4 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill and serve warm or at room temperature with rice, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A Pinot Blanc from Alsace, France, with its clean flavors of minerals and citrus, is just what this dish needs.  Its refreshing acidity and low alcohol profile will allow the spicy sauce to work its magic.

Beer Recommendation:  Let the good times roll with a N'Awlins brew called Blackened Voodoo.  A very dark beer with a surprisingly light profile, this Voodoo is a blessing that bathes the shrimp in a bittersweet malt and finishes with a cooling licorice bite.

Comments:  The herbs and spices of this peel-and-eat shrimp taste great on a bed of rice pilaf.  And you can forget about being dainty -- this one's a finger-lickin' feast!

Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ROQUEFORT BUTTER ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- softened
  2             ounces  Roquefort blue cheese -- crumbled (1/3 cup)
                        = (or other blue cheese)
     1/4      teaspoon  granulated garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === STEAKS ===
  4                     New York strip steaks, 1" thk -- (abt 3/4 lb ea)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     lemon wedges

To make the Roquefort Butter:  In a small bowl combine all the butter ingredients.  With the back of a fork mash the butter mixture together until evenly distributed.

Allow the steaks to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling.  Lightly brush or spray both sides of the steaks with olive oil.  Season them with salt and pepper to taste.  Grill over Direct High heat until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees for medium-rare, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Remove from the grill and allow to rest for about 5 minutes.  Serve warm with the butter smeared over the top and lemon wedges served on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  There are many wine choices here, but Merlot outshines the rest.

Beer Recommendation:  Grab an assertive American pale ale with a creamy texture.

Comments:  Butter is great on a steak but butter blended with blue cheese and garlic takes steak to the level of America's great steakhouses.  Prepare to dine.

                          Old-World Chicken Stew

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Poultry                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     chicken legs
  6                     chicken thighs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     red onions -- cut 1/2" cubes
  6                     celery ribs -- thinly sliced
  2              large  carrots -- thinly sliced
  1              quart  chicken stock
  1             bottle  red wine - (750 ml) -- divided
  10                    black peppercorns -- crushed
  6                     juniper berries -- crushed
  1                     bay leaf
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing chicken
  2                     potatoes -- peeled, cubed
     1/4         pound  lean slab bacon -- cut small cubes,
                        and cooked crisp
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- quartered
  3        tablespoons  ketchup
  6                     garlic cloves -- crushed
     1/4           cup  flour

Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper.  In a roasting pan place chicken pieces, red onions, celery, and carrots.  Add chicken stock.  Reserve 1 cup wine; add remaining wine to roasting pan.  Combine peppercorns, juniper berries, bay leaf, and thyme; tie in a cheesecloth sachet.  Add sachet to pan; cover and marinate in refrigerator overnight.

Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry.  Reserve marinade.

Lightly brush chicken pieces with oil.  Place chicken on cooking grate and sear over Direct High heat 4 to 8 minutes, turning once halfway through searing.  Remove chicken from cooking grate just long enough to boil marinade.

Place roasting pan on cooking grate, close cover, and bring marinade to a boil over Direct High heat.  Add seared chicken, potatoes, cooked bacon, mushrooms, ketchup, and garlic to roasting pan.  Move pan to center of cooking grate.  Continue grilling over Indirect Medium heat for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until vegetables are tender.

Combine flour and remaining 1 cup red wine; mix until smooth.  Remove chicken from roasting pan.  Add red wine mixture and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes or until slightly thickened.  Return chicken to pan.  Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Remove pan and let rest for 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Is there anything better than a rustic old-fashioned chicken stew served with crusty bread and a brimming glass of red Rioja?

Beer Recommendation:  For this humble dish, choose an unpretentious American lager to let the hearty flavors shine through.

Comments:  The recipe that proves that comfort food is a universal concept.  Searing the chicken first seals in all the flavor.

                One-Minute Veal Paillard With Lemon Butter

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LEMON BUTTER ===
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  1 1/2      teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  finely-grated lemon zest
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
     3/4      teaspoon  capers
  1              pinch  salt
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
                        === FOR THE VEAL ===
  4                     thinly-sliced veal top round steaks -- (4 to 5 oz ea)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Finely-ground sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the Lemon Butter:  Put the butter, olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, capers, and salt in a food processor.  Pulse until the butter mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Transfer to a small bowl.  Stir chopped parsley into butter mixture and set aside at room temperature to keep it soft.

Place the veal steaks on a large piece of plastic wrap moistened with water or brushed with olive oil.  Cover with another piece of plastic wrap and, using the flat side of a wooden mallet, pound the steaks to a 1/8-inch thickness (you should be able to see light through the meat).

Brush or spray the veal with olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Grill over Direct High heat for 45 to 60 seconds on one side only.  Remove from grill and brush with lemon butter.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  This delicate dish calls for a light-bodied white wine with a refreshing, citrus-like acidity.  Try a stylish Gr¸ner Veltliner from Austria.

Beer Recommendation:  The lemon butter makes a perfect foil for a true White Ale, beautifully carbonated and enlivened by its zesty citrus flavor and floral hops.  With a clean, refreshing finish, this warm weather beer is sure to complement, not overwhelm.

Comments:  A super-easy dish for a busy weeknight dinner or even a casual gathering (just double everything to serve a crowd).  Grill the steaks as soon as you've flattened them.  Don't blink -- dinner's ready!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  apricot preserves
     1/4           cup  orange juice

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  6                     shallots -- chopped
  2               cups  chicken stock
  2               cups  dry white wine
  2             pounds  center-cut salmon fillet, 1 1/2" thk -- skin on
  12                    oysters -- cut 1/2" pieces
  3        tablespoons  chopped chives
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
                        = (juice of one lime)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Walnut oil -- as needed
  4                     egg yolks -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  spicy brown mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  saffron
  3        tablespoons  heavy cream -- whipped
                        Fresh dill -- (optional)

In a skillet heat oil.  Add shallots and sautÈ until golden.  Add chicken stock and white wine; simmer until liquid is reduced to one-third.  Set aside.

Remove skin from salmon; discard.  Cut filet into 6 equal pieces.  Cut a pocket into one side of each salmon piece.

In a small bowl, combine oysters, chives, lime juice, salt and pepper to taste, and enough walnut oil to help mixture hold together; mix well.  Place equal amounts of stuffing into each salmon pocket.  Season salmon with salt and pepper; brush with walnut oil.

Place salmon in center of cooking grate.  Grill 6 to 8 minutes until salmon is opaque and stuffing is heated through, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Meanwhile, return sauce to a simmer.  Mix together egg yolks, mustard, and saffron; gently fold into sauce.  Return to a simmer.  Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Fold in whipped cream.

Place an equal amount of sauce on individual plates.  Top each with one salmon fillet and garnish with dill, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A round, full-bodied, mouth-filling white, please.  Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, or a white RhÙne.  You may just purr.

Beer Recommendation:  A rich, silky stout will act like a thick, burnt cream sauce for the smoky oysters and sultry salmon.

Comments:  Tonight try a grilled center-cut salmon steak made even more enticing with an oyster stuffing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     pork rib chops, abt 1 1/4" thick
                        === MARINADE ===

                Paprika-Rubbed Steaks With Pickled Onions

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PICKLED ONION ===
  1              small  red onion
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
                        === FOR THE STEAKS ===
  4                     New York strip steaks, 1" thk -- (abt 3/4 lb ea)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

To prepare the Pickled Onion:  Cut the onion in half through the root end.  Trim off the ends.  Slice the onion as thinly as possible and place the slices in a nonreactive, shallow glass dish.  Add the remaining onion ingredients and toss together to dissolve the salt and sugar.  Set aside at room temperature for about 3 hours, stirring the onion occasionally.

Allow the steaks to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling.  Lightly brush or spray both sides of the steaks with oil.  Mix the paprika, brown sugar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and sprinkle the seasonings on both sides of the steaks.

Grill the steaks over Direct Medium heat until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees for medium-rare, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove the steaks from the grill and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes.

Strain the onions in a sieve.  Serve the steaks warm with the pickled onions on top and mashed sweet potatoes on the side, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Zinfandel, the red one, fits like a glove around this meal.

Beer Recommendation:  It may be time for a dark ale with some underlying sweetness, such as a Guinness.

Comments:  An expertly grilled steak is often more than enough for good eating, but for a bit of the unexpected, serve some pickled onions, which contribute a sweet-sour quality and easy crunch.

Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit
                Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  fresh pineapple, abt 1/2" thk
  1           teaspoon  cracked dried green peppercorns
                        = (or cracked black peppercorns
  4             scoops  vanilla ice cream
                        === GLAZE ===
     3/4           cup  fresh orange juice
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch

To make the Glaze:  In a small saucepan combine the glaze ingredients and whisk until smooth.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes.  Keep the glaze warm or reheat when ready to serve.

Season both sides of the pineapple slices with the peppercorns.  Grill over Indirect Medium heat until well marked, 6 to 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Serve each pineapple slice with a scoop of ice cream and some of the glaze drizzled over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A demi-sec champagne from Reims, France, is worth the splurge -- one of the few wines that can handle the acidic pineapple.

Comments:  Pepper on pineapple?  Yes!  It adds an exciting burst of flavor to the juicy fruit.  The quality/freshness of the pineapple is all-important.

               Peaches With Raspberry Sauce And Lemon Cream

Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit
                Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RASPBERRY SAUCE ===
  3               cups  fresh raspberries
                        = (or a 12-oz bag frozen
                        raspberries, thawed)
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  tequila or raspberry liqueur -- (optional)
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar - (to 4)
                        === LEMON CREAM ===
  1                cup  heavy cream -- cold
  1         tablespoon  superfine instant dissolving sugar
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated lemon zest
                        === FOR THE PEACHES ===
  6              large  firm but ripe peaches
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar

To make the Raspberry Sauce:  In a food processor purÈe the raspberries with 1/3 cup water.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing on the pulp to extract the liquid.  (A few seeds may pass through the sieve and remain in the sauce.)  Add the lemon juice, tequila, and sugar to taste.  (Fresh raspberries will likely need the full amount of sugar; sweetened frozen berries will require less.)  Stir or whisk until the sugar dissolves.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.

To make the Lemon Cream:  In a mixing bowl mix together the cream and sugar.  Whip at high speed until soft peaks form.  Add the lemon juice and grated lemon zest and continue whipping at high speed until stiff peaks form.  Set aside in the refrigerator while you prepare the peaches.

Halve and pit the peaches; set aside.  In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter, then add the sugar and stir until the sugar is dissolved.  Remove from the heat.

Brush the peach halves all over with the butter mixture.  Grill over Direct Medium heat until browned in spots and warm throughout, 8 to 10 minutes, turning every 2 or 3 minutes.  Serve the peaches warm with the raspberry sauce and lemon cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Raspberry sauce makes a seductive topping for these peaches, but a dollop of lemon-flavored whipped cream is the "piËce de rÈsistance."  A flavor combination you could call triumphant.

                     Pear Strudel With Dried Cherries

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Grilling


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  3             medium  Bartlett pears -- peeled, sliced
     1/4           cup  dried cherries -- soaked in hot water
                        to plump, then drained
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon -- divided
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped walnuts
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs
  4                     sheets phyllo dough -- thawed
  1         tablespoon  sugar

In a large sautÈ pan melt 2 tablespoons of the butter.  Add pears and sautÈ for 3 minutes.  Add plumped cherries, brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon, and the walnuts.  Continue cooking for an additional 3 to 5 minutes or until pears are soft.  Remove from pan and chill completely.

In the same pan the pears were sautÈed in, melt 2 more tablespoons of the butter.  Add the bread crumbs and sautÈ until golden brown.  Add the toasted bread crumbs to the chilled pear mixture.  Mix well.

Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.  Place a sheet of phyllo dough on a clean work surface.  Lightly brush with melted butter.  Place second sheet of phyllo on top of first and brush with melted butter.  Repeat with the remaining phyllo sheets.

Spread the chilled pears along the long edge of the phyllo.  Carefully roll into a strudel by folding short ends over filling and rolling dough up along long end.  Brush with butter.  Sprinkle with sugar and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.

Place seam-side down on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.  Place pan into another identical sheet pan (doubling the sheet pans keeps the phyllo from burning).

Grill for 20 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.  Allow to cool slightly before cutting and serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This delicious and buttery dessert is good anytime.

In a large sautÈ pan melt 2 tablespoons of the butter.  Add pears and sautÈ for 3 minutes.  Add plumped cherries, brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon, and the walnuts.  Continue cooking for an additional 3 to 5 minutes or until pears are soft.  Remove from pan and chill completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the same pan the pears were sautÈed in, melt 2 more tablespoons of the butter.  Add the bread crumbs and sautÈ until golden brown.  Add the toasted bread crumbs to the chilled pear mixture.  Mix well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.  Place a sheet of phyllo dough on a clean work surface.  Lightly brush with melted butter.  Place second sheet of phyllo on top of first and brush with melted butter.  Repeat with the remaining phyllo sheets.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the chilled pears along the long edge of the phyllo.  Carefully roll into a strudel by folding short ends over filling and rolling dough up along long end.  Brush with butter.  Sprinkle with sugar and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place seam-side down on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.  Place pan into another identical sheet pan (doubling the sheet pans keeps the phyllo from burning).

<DirT>
Grill for 20 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.  Allow to cool slightly before cutting and serving.

                   Pepper-Crusted, Maple-Glazed Salmon

Recipe By     :Bob Blumer
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  maple syrup
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  4                     salmon fillets - (abt 6 oz ea) -- skin removed
     1/4           cup  freshly-cracked black pepper
                        Vegetable oil spray -- as needed

To prepare the marinade:  In a small bowl whisk together the syrup and soy sauce.  Pour the marinade into a large plastic resealable bag, and add the fillets.  Press out the air and seal the bag tightly, then turn the bag several times to distribute the marinade.  Set in a large bowl and refrigerate for as long as possible (a minimum of 4 hours, but ideally 24 hours to do it justice).  Turn salmon every few hours.

Place pepper on a small plate.  Remove salmon from marinade and generously spray both sides of each fillet with oil.  Pat top side only into cracked pepper to coat.

Grill fillets, pepper-side up, over Direct High heat for about 6 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Avoid overcooking the fillets.  Salmon is best when the color has turned to a pale pink, but the fish is still moist throughout.  Serve immediately on warmed plates.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Try a young Riesling from Alsace, France, with this one.  With little residual sugar, its fruitiness will play off the maple sweetness of the salmon.

Comments:  This easy marinade creates a candied salmon fillet that melts in your mouth under a black pepper crust.  This recipe is from our friend Bob Blumer, author of The Surreal Gourmet cookbook series.

Le Secret:  The longer the salmon marinates (up to 48 hours) the better it is.

Note:  When multiplying the recipe for larger groups, it is not necessary to increase the marinade proportionately.  Just mix enough marinade (in the same 3 parts maple syrup to 1 part soy sauce proportions) to cover all the fillets.

Tips for advance prep:  Although the fish can be placed in its marinade up to 48 hours in advance, it should only be peppered and cooked just before serving.

                   Pork Chops With Mango-Miso Marinade

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  shallots -- finely diced
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  to 3 hot bean paste (miso)
                        = (or chili bean sauce)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1                cup  mango juice
                        = (or apricot juice or orange juice)
  4        tablespoons  rice wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     bone-in pork chops - (abt 10 oz ea)

In a medium pan, sautÈ shallots in oil for 2 minutes.  Add garlic and sautÈ 1 minute more.  Add hot bean paste, cumin, mango juice, rice wine, and salt and pepper to taste.  Bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and chill.

Place pork chops in a large resealable plastic bag; pour chilled marinade over chops and marinate in refrigerator for 4 hours, turning occasionally to distribute marinade.

Remove chops from marinade, reserving marinade.  Pour reserved marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Boil one minute; remove from heat.

Place chops in center of cooking grate.  Grill for 16 minutes or until juices run clear, turning once halfway through grilling time and occasionally basting with marinade.  Serve with black beans and rice, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  So many flavors -- sweet, hot, savory, salty -- call for a wine that can unify the palate without upping the ante with high alcohol.  Try a semi-dry (halbtrocken) Riesling from the Rheingau region.

Beer Recommendation:  Oatmeal Stout is perfect with this dish, as it creates an elegantly grainy contrast to the assertive sweet and hot flavors.  Think of it as polenta in a glass.

Comments:  Tired of the same old pork chops?  Try this hot and spicy version and add some zest to your plate.

              Pork Spareribs With Delectable Barbecue Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     slabs to 4 pork spareribs - (abt 2 lbs ea)
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1              large  red onion -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1                cup  tomato purÈe
  4                     tomatoes -- peeled, chopped
     1/2           cup  orange juice
  5        tablespoons  vinegar
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  prepared spicy brown mustard
  1         tablespoon  molasses
     1/2    tablespoon  paprika
     1/2    tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2    tablespoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  chili powder

To make the Sauce:  In a saucepan or large skillet heat oil.  Add onion and garlic and sautÈ 5 minutes or until translucent.  Add remaining sauce ingredients.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer uncovered 1 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.  Process in a blender or food processor until smooth.  Chill in refrigerator until ready to use or up to 3 weeks.

Place ribs in a jumbo resealable plastic bag.  For each slab of ribs, pour 1/2 cup sauce over ribs; spread to coat.  Close bag and marinate in refrigerator overnight.  Reserve remaining sauce.

Remove ribs from bag; discard used sauce.  Place ribs in center of cooking grate.  Grill 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until tender.  Brush with some of reserved sauce during last 20 minutes of grilling time.

Cut into 2- or 3-rib portions.  Serve with heated remaining sauce.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Break the rules with an oaky Chardonnay -- after all, why should the sauce have all the fun?  You'll really taste the ribs and the wine will accommodate the orange juice and other tangy ingredients.

Beer Recommendation:  Try something different -- a pale Bock -- or a Pilsener with a lengthy hop finish.

Comments:  For sumptuous ribs made fast, make the sauce a few days ahead of time.  Marinating the ribs in sauce the night before makes them that much more tender.

                  Pork Tenderloin With Silky Chile Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     dried pasilla chiles - (abt 1 oz total)
                        Canola oil -- as needed
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- crushed
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     pork tenderloins - (abt 1 lb ea)
     1/4           cup  ketchup
     1/2           cup  heavy cream

Remove the stems and seeds from the chiles.  Cut the chiles into sections about 2 inches long.  In a medium skillet warm 2 tablespoons of canola oil over high heat.  Add the chiles carefully (the oil might splatter) and toast them until fragrant, 3 to 5 seconds per side.

Transfer the chiles and oil to a small bowl.  Cover with 1 1/2 cups of hot water.  Use a smaller bowl or plate to submerge the chiles.  Allow to rehydrate for 20 minutes.

Pour the mixture, chiles and water and all, into a blender or food processor.  Add the vinegar, garlic, sugar, cumin, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.  Process until smooth.  Press the mixture through a medium-mesh strainer set over a bowl.  Discard the solids left in the strainer.

Trim the pork tenderloins of any excess fat and sinew.  Place them in a large, plastic resealable bag and pour in 1 cup of the chile mixture, reserving the rest of the mixture.  Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly.  Turn the bag to distribute the marinade, place the bag in a bowl and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours, turning the bag occasionally.

Pour the reserved chile mixture into a medium saucepan.  Whisk in the ketchup and cream.  Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until it reaches a sauce consistency, 3 to 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Set the saucepan aside.

Remove the pork tenderloins from the bag, discarding the marinade.  Lightly brush or spray the tenderloins all over with canola oil.  Season generously with salt and pepper.

Grill the tenderloins over Indirect Medium heat until the centers are barely pink and the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees, 25 to 30 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Remove from the grill, loosely cover with foil, and allow to rest for 3 to 5 minutes before cutting into slices.  Reheat the sauce over medium heat and spoon it over the meat.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  The soft, round flavors of this chile sauce call for a red wine with elegance, preferably a California Syrah.

Beer Recommendation:  A Hefewiesen, with its smooth fruitiness and a faint note of spiciness, nicely mirrors the characteristics of this recipe.

Comments:  This dish is mostly about chiles, but not in a fiery, spicy way.  When you toast the dried chiles in a thin layer of oil, they develop a fruity richness that works its way gently into both the marinade and the sauce.  Delicioso.

                Prime Rib Of Beef With Juniper Cream Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PRIME RIB ===
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground coffee beans
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     beef rib roast - (7 to 8 lbs)
                        Olive oil -- for brushing roast
                        === CREAM SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  sliced fresh mushrooms
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped shallots
  1              quart  beef gravy or brown sauce
  2               cups  dry white wine
  10                    juniper berries - (to 20) -- tied in cheesecloth
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2                cup heavy whipping cream
  3        tablespoons  red currant jelly
  2        tablespoons  gin

To prepare the Prime Rib:  In a small bowl combine ground coffee, salt, and pepper.  Rub mixture on beef roast, pressing into the surface.  Brush lightly with oil.

Place roast in center of cooking grate.  Grill 2 1/4 to 2 3/4 hours for rare (140 degrees), 2 1/2 to 3 hours for medium (160 degrees).  Remove from grill and let roast rest 10 minutes before carving.  Make cream sauce in last half-hour of roast cooking time.

To make the Cream Sauce:  In a medium saucepan melt butter.  Add mushrooms and shallots; cook over medium heat 5 minutes or until tender.  Add gravy, wine, and juniper berry sachet.  Simmer over medium heat until liquid is reduced by half.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, with mixer at medium speed, beat heavy cream until stiff peaks form.

Strain reduced sauce; return to saucepan.  Stir in red currant jelly and cook over low heat until jelly is dissolved.  Stir in gin.  Remove from heat.  Gently fold in whipped cream.  Add salt and pepper to taste.

To serve, place a little cream sauce on a plate; top with a slice of beef roast.

This recipe yields about 12 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A Pinot Noir will highlight the lovely texture of the prime rib and accommodate the gin in the cream sauce.

Beer Recommendation:  A deep porter with a nose of coffee and hazelnuts makes a warm and welcome companion to this dish.

Comments:  Juniper berries add an irresistible accent to this classic roast.  Find them in your grocer's spice rack or in specialty gourmet shops.

              Prime Rib With Garlic And Blue Cheese Dressing

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     standing prime rib roast -- excess fat trimmed
                        = (2 to 3 ribs, 5 to 6 lbs)
  6              large  garlic cloves
     1/4           cup  fresh rosemary leaves
     1/4           cup  fresh basil leaves
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === BLUE CHEESE DRESSING ===
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  1             medium  garlic clove -- thinly sliced
  6             ounces  blue cheese -- crumbled
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Remove the roast from the refrigerator 30 to 40 minutes before grilling.

In a food processor finely mince the garlic, rosemary, basil, salt, and pepper.  Add the mustard and olive oil, and process to form a paste.  Smear the paste all over the top of the roast, above the trimmed layer of fat.

Grill the roast, with the bone side facing the cooking grate, over Indirect Medium heat until the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees  for medium-rare, 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 hours.

Transfer the roast from the grill to a cutting board.  Cut the strings and remove the bones.  Cover the roast loosely with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 20 to 30 minutes.  The internal temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees during this time.

Meanwhile, make the dressing.  Place the cream and garlic in a small saucepan.  Bring the cream to a boil, and then simmer until it easily coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat.  Add the cheese, stirring to help it blend into the cream.  Season with pepper to taste.  Set aside.

Carve meat into slices.  Serve warm with the dressing.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A soft Merlot complements this festive meal nicely.

Beer Recommendation:  A glass of dark, fruity ale also tastes terrific here.

Comments:  Ask your butcher to remove the bones from the prime rib and tie them back on, so you get both the irreplaceable flavor of roasted bones and the convenience of easily removing them prior to carving.

            Pulled Pork Barbecue With Hot Pepper Vinegar Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Pork
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  boneless pork shoulder roast - (to 5)
                        = (Boston butt)
  12                    to 16 hamburger buns -- for serving
                        Coleslaw -- (optional)
                        === THE RUB ===
  2        tablespoons  paprika
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  ground red pepper
                        === SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
     3/4           cup  white vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the Rub:  In a small bowl combine all rub ingredients.  Rub mixture over pork roast, pressing into surface.

Place pork in center of cooking grate.  Grill 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours for well-done (170 degrees), or until very tender.  Remove meat from grill; cover and let stand for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Sauce:  In a medium saucepan combine apple cider vinegar, white vinegar, sugar, red pepper flakes, hot pepper sauce, and salt and pepper to taste.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer 10 minutes.  Keep warm.

Shred, chop, or "pull" pork into shreds with two forks.  Add hot pepper vinegar sauce; mix well.  Serve on buns with extra sauce and coleslaw, if desired.

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

Comments:  Tender shreds of spiced pork are all the more delectable when drenched in this hot pepper vinegar sauce.

                       Pumpkin Seed-Crusted Grouper

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  coarsely-ground roasted shelled
                        pumpkin seeds
     1/2           cup  plain bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  walnut oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4                     grouper fillets - (abt 1/4 lb ea)
                        = (or halibut steaks)

Combine the ground pumpkin seeds, bread crumbs, walnut oil, and salt in a flat pan or pie plate.  Rinse fillets and pat dry.  Roll fish in the seed mixture to coat them completely.  Refrigerate for 10 minutes.

Grill over Direct Medium heat until golden brown and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 6 to 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve with mashed sweet potatoes and green beans, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A FumÈ Blanc from California will offer luscious depth and viscosity to complement the crunchy texture of the fish, and create a vanilla-lemongrass sauce for its flavors.

Beer Recommendation:  A "cask-conditioned" or "bottle-conditioned" ale will enliven your senses with the fresh aroma of hops while its flavor of nutty sweet malt will match the fish.

Comments:  This gourmet spin on a common fish is deceptively simple and enticingly delicious.

                Rack Of Lamb With Orange-Cranberry Chutney

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     racks lamb - (1 to 1 1/2 lbs ea) -- frenched
                        === PASTE ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  whole-grain mustard
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === CHUTNEY ===
  1                cup  sun-dried cranberries
     1/2           cup  cranberry juice
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  cranberry jelly
     1/2    tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  ground cinnamon

To make the Paste:  In a small bowl mix together the paste ingredients.

Spread the paste all over the lamb racks.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 8 hours.

To make the Chutney:  In a medium saucepan combine the chutney ingredients.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries are plump and juicy and the chutney has thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature.

Loosely cover the bones of the racks of lamb with aluminum foil to keep them from burning.  Grill over Direct Medium heat until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees and the lamb is medium-rare, 20 to 30 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill and allow to rest for 5 minutes before cutting into chops.  Serve hot with the chutney.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  For the savory lamb -- with its crisp, sweet crust -- and the piquant chutney that blends sweet and sour, only one wine will do; Pinot Noir.  Try one from Oregon's Willamette Valley, Burgundy's CÙte d'Or, or Carneros in California.

Beer Recommendation:  Lamb and Lambic!  A Belgian fruited Lambic beer will highlight the orange and cranberry notes in the lamb.  We recommend a framboise, a wonderfully refreshing and complex raspberry-tinged brew.

Comments:  Lay the racks on their sides to get as much surface area on the cooking grate as possible.  During grilling, the marinade forms an herb crust that underscores the sweetness of the lamb.  The tangy chutney offers just enough bite to cut the meat's richness.  Beautiful.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     red snapper fillets, 1/2" thk -- (abt 5 oz ea)
                        Juice of 1 lemon
     1/4           cup  melted butter
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  plain bread crumbs
  6                     lemon wedges

Brush red snapper fillets with lemon juice; let stand 5 minutes.  Pat dry with paper towels.

Brush each fillet on both side with butter; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roll in bread crumbs, pressing lightly to coat both sides with crumbs.

Place fish on lightly oiled cooking grate, flesh-side down.  Grill 8 minutes or until fish flakes when tested with a fork, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  For the red fish, a crisp rosÈ wine made of Grenache grapes; try a Rosado from Navarro, Spain and let the flavor-fest begin.

Beer Recommendation:  A cherry or berry beer will create a nice sauce to bring forth the supple richness of the snapper flesh.

Comments:  The breadcrumbs and the grill's heat create a wonderfully crisp crust for this tender fish, which needs very little seasoning when fresh.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RED SNAPPER ===
  2                     red snapper fillets - (1 to 1 1/4 lbs ea) -- skin on
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        === SALSA ===
  1                     fresh pineapple -- sliced, cored,
                        and peeled
  2             medium  peaches -- peeled, halved,
                        and pitted
  1              small  onion -- diced
  2                     jalapeÒo chiles -- seeded, diced
  8             sprigs  fresh cilantro - (to 10) -- chopped
                        Salt -- totaste
                        Sugar and/or lime juice -- if needed
                        === MANGO "GUACAMOLE" ===
  3                     ripe mangos
     1/2         small  onion -- very finely chopped
  1                     jalapeÒo or habanero chile -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  1                     ripe tomato -- cored, and
                        finely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh mint
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  5             sprigs  parsley -- chopped
                        === TO FINISH ===
                        Olive oil -- for brushing fillets
                        Warm flour tortillas

To prepare the Red Snapper:  Rinse fish and pat dry.  Combine orange juice, oil, salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic in a resealable plastic bag.  Add fish and seal bag; turn to coat fish.  Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.

While fish is marinating, make the Salsa:  Place the pineapple rings and peach halves in the center of the cooking grate and grill 5 to 7 minutes, turning once halfway through cooking time.  Remove from grill and allow to cool.

Dice fruit and place in a small bowl.  Add the onion, jalapeÒo, and cilantro; mix well.  Season with salt.  Adjust tartness with either sugar or lime juice.  Let rest for 30 to 60 minutes before serving so flavors can blend.

To make the Mango "Guacamole":  Peel mangos and cut fruit off each side and ends of the pit.  In a medium-sized bowl, mash mango with a fork and combine with the remaining guacamole ingredients until well mixed but still lumpy.  Chill until ready to serve.

Remove fish from marinade and blot on a paper towel.  Lightly brush both sides of fish with oil to prevent sticking to cooking grate.  Place fish skin-side down in center of cooking grate.  Grill 8 to 10 minutes or until fish is opaque and flakes with a fork, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Remove from grill and serve with the salsa, guacamole, and tortillas.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Do the fish a favor and bathe it in a Sauvignon Blanc.  It will rise to the surface buoyed up by the peach, pineapple, and mango and gratefully kiss your palate.

Beer Recommendation:  A crisp, cold Pilsener makes the perfect, polite backgrounder for the many colorful flavors dancing in this dish.

Comments:  Tropical flavors mingle with just enough chile to make this light snapper dish exotically intriguing.

Note:  Always wear gloves when handling chiles, especially the extra hot habanero, and be careful not to get any in your eyes.  Wash hands thoroughly after handling chiles and keep chiles out of the reach of children.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STUFFING ===
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2                     apples -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
     1/4           cup  apple juice
     3/4           cup  soft rye or pumpernickel bread cubes
     1/3           cup  chopped almonds
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  caraway seed
                        === FOR THE ROAST ===
  1                     eight-rib pork loin center-rib roast -- (4 to 5 lbs),
                        back bone loosened
                        Red apple -- (optional), cut
                        into wedges
                        Celery leaves -- (optional)

To make the Stuffing:  In a medium saucepan cook onion and celery in butter until tender.  Add apples and apple juice.  Cover and simmer 5 minutes.  Uncover and simmer 5 minutes more or until liquid evaporates.  Remove from heat.  Stir in bread cubes, almonds, salt, and caraway seed.

Place roast, bone-side down, on a cutting board.  On the meaty side, cut a pocket above each rib, making 8 pockets total.  Spoon stuffing into pockets.

Place roast with tips of ribs upward in center of cooking grate.  Cover stuffing area loosely with foil.  Grill 1 to 2 1/4 hours for medium (or until a meat thermometer inserted into meatiest part of roast registers 160 degrees) or 1 3/4 to 2 1/2 hours for well-done (170 degrees).  Remove foil halfway through grilling time.

Cover and let stand 10 minutes before carving.  Garnish with fresh apple slices and celery leaves, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This hearty entrÈe is the perfect remedy for the cold-weather blahs.

             Rosemary Lamb Chops With Grill-Roasted Potatoes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SEASONING ===
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh thyme
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === POTATOES AND LAMB ===
  2             pounds  new potatoes - (abt 1 1/2" dia) -- washed, quartered
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus more
                        for brushing the chops
  8                     lamb loin chops, 1 1/4" thk - (4 oz ea) -- excess fat trimmed

To make the Seasoning:  Place the chopped garlic on a cutting board and sprinkle the salt on top.  Using the side of a knife, crush the garlic and salt together to create a paste.  Add the rest of the seasoning ingredients and chop them together for even distribution.

Place the cut potatoes in a medium bowl.  Drizzle the 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the top and add about half of the seasoning mixture.  Stir the potatoes to evenly coat them.  Grill the potatoes over Direct Medium heat until tender and browned on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally.  Remove the potatoes from the grill and keep them warm while you grill the lamb.

Lightly brush or spray the lamb chops on both sides with olive oil.  Use the remaining half of the seasoning mixture to spread on both sides of the lamb chops.  Grill the lamb chops over Direct Medium heat until medium-rare, 9 to 11 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve warm with the potatoes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The juices that drip from lamb chops through a sizzling hot grate turn to a type of smokiness that makes serious carnivores a little weak in the knees.  Here we brush the chops with extra-virgin olive oil and a savory medley of garlic and fresh herbs for an authentic taste of Italy.

To make the Seasoning:  Place the chopped garlic on a cutting board and sprinkle the salt on top.  Using the side of a knife, crush the garlic and salt together to create a paste.  Add the rest of the seasoning ingredients and chop them together for even distribution.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the cut potatoes in a medium bowl.  Drizzle the 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the top and add about half of the seasoning mixture.  Stir the potatoes to evenly coat them.  Grill the potatoes over Direct Medium heat until tender and browned on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally.  Remove the potatoes from the grill and keep them warm while you grill the lamb.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly brush or spray the lamb chops on both sides with olive oil.  Use the remaining half of the seasoning mixture to spread on both sides of the lamb chops.  Grill the lamb chops over Direct Medium heat until medium-rare, 9 to 11 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve warm with the potatoes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The juices that drip from lamb chops through a sizzling hot grate turn to a type of smokiness that makes serious carnivores a little weak in the knees.  Here we brush the chops with extra-virgin olive oil and a savory medley of garlic and fresh herbs for an authentic taste of Italy.

                      Rotisserie Five-Spice Chicken

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  chicken - (abt 4 lbs)
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/4           cup  orange juice concentrate
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  Asian sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

To make the Marinade:  In a medium bowl whisk together the marinade ingredients.

Remove and discard the neck, giblets, wing tips, and any excess fat from the chicken.  Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Place the chicken in a large, resealable plastic bag and pour in the marinade.  Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly.  Turn the bag to distribute the marinade, place the bag in a bowl, and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours, turning the bag occasionally.

Remove the chicken from the bag and discard the marinade.  Truss the chicken with cotton string.  Center the chicken lengthwise on the spit and adjust on the rotisserie.  Let the chicken rotate over Indirect High heat until the juices run clear and the meat is no longer pink at the bone, 1 to 1 1/4 hours (check the chicken after 30 minutes; if the skin is browning too quickly, reduce the heat to Indirect Medium).

When the chicken is fully cooked, turn off the rotisserie and, using barbecue mitts, remove the spit from the rotisserie and slide the chicken from the spit onto a cutting board.  Be careful not to splatter yourself with the hot juices.  Allow the chicken to rest for a few minutes.  Cut the chicken into serving pieces.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  An off-dry Chenin Blanc is equally refreshing.

Beer Recommendation:  A Chinese beer such as Tsing Tao fits right in.

Comments:  Unlike allspice, which is made from just one spice (a dried berry ground into powder), five-spice powder is a true blend.  Usually it is made of equal parts of ground cinnamon, cloves, fennel seed, star anise, and Szechuan peppercorns.  It plays a large role in Chinese cooking.

                Sage, Orange, And Clove Rotisserie Turkey

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Poultry                         Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === THE RUB ===
  2        tablespoons  granulated orange peel
  1         tablespoon  dried sage
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
                        === FOR THE TURKEY ===
  1                     turkey - (12 to 14 lbs)
  2              small  oranges -- washed, dried
  12                    whole cloves
  6             medium  garlic cloves -- crushed
  1              bunch  fresh sage -- tied with string

To make the Rub:  In a small bowl combine the rub ingredients.  Set aside.

Remove the pop-up timer, as well as the neck, giblets, and any excess fat from the turkey and discard.  Rinse the turkey, inside and out, under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.

Pierce the oranges several times with a knife and insert six whole cloves into each of them.  Put the clove-studded oranges, garlic, and sage into the turkey cavity.  Truss the turkey with cotton string.  Pin the neck skin flap to the body with two or three small trussing needles.

Skewer the turkey lengthwise through the oranges and center on the spit.  Rub the entire exterior with the rub mixture, pressing it into the skin.  Set the spit on the rotisserie and let the turkey rotate over Indirect Medium heat until the internal temperature reaches 170 degrees in the breast and 180 degrees in the thickest part of the thigh, 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 hours.

Turn off the rotisserie.  Wearing barbecue mitts, carefully remove the spit from the rotisserie and place it on a cutting board.  Loosely cover the turkey with aluminum foil and allow to rest for at least 20 minutes.

Remove the spit and discard the oranges, garlic, and sage.  Carve the turkey into serving pieces.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 12 to 14 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A fine single-vineyard Zinfandel from California's Sonoma or Mendocino appellations will equal the flavors and aromas of this turkey.  Look for one with intense blackberry fruit, black pepper, and clove spiciness.

Beer Recommendation:  Grolsch's Wintervorst ("Winter Frost") -- a strong ale from the Eastern Netherlands that's spiced with orange peel, cloves, and honey -- is just the match for this bird.  Its anise overtones, smooth body, and floral finish will enhance all the flavors on the plate.

Comments:  One whiff of the orange, clove, and sage in this recipe is guaranteed to drive the neighbors wild.  If you don't have a rotisserie, grill this 12- to 14-pound turkey over Indirect Medium heat for 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 hours.

                    Salmon Burgers With Smoked Cheese

                Sandwiches                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  skinless salmon
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chives
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Nonstick cooking spray -- for spraying patties
  6                     sesame seed burger buns
     1/2         pound  smoked Gouda, Farmer's, or
                        Jarlsberg cheese -- cut into 6 slices
  6        tablespoons  pickle relish

Cut salmon into small pieces.  In a blender or food processor, pulse in batches for about 10 to 15 seconds each, until coarsely ground.  In a mixing bowl mix together ground salmon, heavy cream, cornstarch, shallots, chives, parsley, salt, and white pepper until well blended.

Shape salmon mixture into six 1/2-inch thick patties.  Place patties on waxed paper.  Spray with nonstick cooking spray and place in refrigerator for 5 minutes.

Place patties, sprayed-side down, in center of cooking grate.  Grill 6 to 8 minutes or until well-done, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Place each patty on a bun; top with one slice of smoked cheese and 1 tablespoon of pickle relish.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A light- to medium-bodied red will accommodate the smoked cheese and bolster the salmon.  Try chilling the wine!

Beer Recommendation:  The smoky notes from the grill and the cheese call out for a serious and sultry ale.  Try a complex copper brew with a bitter, clean finish.

Comments:  Serve these at your next barbecue and everyone will wonder why they didn't think of it themselves.

In small bowl combine water and cornstarch.  Add cornstarch mixture to beet sauce; stir until slightly thickened.  Stir in chives and season with salt and pepper.

Season salmon steaks with salt and pepper.  Spray with nonstick cooking spray.

Place salmon steaks in center of cooking grate.  Grill 8 to 10 minutes or until fish is opaque and center bone can be removed easily, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Remove bones from salmon steaks.  Spoon some beet sauce onto individual plates; top each plate with a salmon steak.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A Pinot Noir from Oregon's Willamette Valley will have the fruit to coax the sweetness from the salmon and reflect the juiciness of the beets.

Beer Recommendation:  A raspberry wheat ale with a refreshing zip of acidity (not sugar) will complement -- not compete with -- this sauce.

Comments:  The beet sauce adds an attractive dimension, both for the eye and the palate, to a fish that's excellent for grilling.

       Salmon With Wilted Chard, Grilled Pineapple, And Mole Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MOLE SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  6              whole  garlic cloves -- peeled
  1                cup  chopped red onions
  4             medium  dried Ancho chilies
  6                     sun-dried tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  aged balsamic vinegar
  3               cups  chicken stock
  3                     whole cloves
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
  2             slices  white bread -- cubed
     1/4           cup  dried cherries
     1/4           cup  dried currents
     1/4           cup  dried apricots
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- roughly chopped
                        === THE RUB ===
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns
  2          teaspoons  fennel seeds
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  3        tablespoons  dark chili powder
  1         tablespoon  course salt
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  6                     salmon fillets - (abt 6 oz ea) -- skinned
  6             slices  red onion, abt 1/2" thk
  6             slices  fresh pineapple, abt 1" thk -- cored
                        Olive oil spray -- as needed
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4           cup  sliced red onion
  1              bunch  Swiss chard -- cleaned, chopped
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
                        Coarse salt -- to taste

First, make the Mole Sauce:  In a heavy-bottom 2-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  SautÈ the garlic, turning every minute until evenly browned.  Add the onions, chilies, and tomatoes.  Continue to sautÈ for 3 to 4 minutes, until the chilies and tomatoes are softened.

Drizzle the balsamic vinegar over the vegetables, then add the chicken stock, cloves, cinnamon, allspice, bread, cherries, currents, and apricots.  Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes.  Remove pan from heat, cover, and allow mixture to steep for 30 minutes.

In a blender, purÈe the mixture and strain, pressing on the solids to extract all the liquid.  Return the strained sauce to the saucepan and whisk in the chocolate.  If sauce is too thick, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to attain desired consistency.  Set aside and keep warm.

Next, make the Rub:  Using a mortar and pestle, crush the peppercorns and the fennel seeds.  Blend in the cumin, cinnamon, chili powder, and salt.  Liberally coat each fillet with the rub, reserving some for the pineapple and onions, then spray each fillet with olive oil.  Spray the onion and pineapple slices with olive oil and sprinkle lightly with the remaining rub.

Place the salmon fillets and onions over Direct Medium heat for 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time, or until the salmon is opaque and flesh flakes easily with a fork and the onions are nicely caramelized.  Grill the pineapple over Direct Medium heat for 4 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove salmon, onions, and pineapple from grill and keep warm.

Next, prepare the chard:  In a heavy skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  SautÈ the onion slices until just translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the chard and continue sautÈing until chard is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add in the vinegar, toss lightly, and season with salt to taste.

To serve, arrange the wilted chard and sautÈed onions in the center of each plate and place a grilled pineapple slice on top.  Set a grilled salmon fillet on the pineapple.  Garnish the dish with the grilled onion slices and the mole.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  For this complex Veracruz-style dish, we recommend trying a soft, not-too-tannic Merlot from Baja California, Mexico (look for Monte Xanic), or a slightly heartier Merlot from the North Coast of California.

Beer Recommendation:  This dish was made to harmonize with Mexican Pale Lager.  The refreshing, cleansing bitterness leaves your palate ready to taste more food, while its sparkling simplicity lets each ingredient sing.

Comments:  The Aztecs gave the world chocolate.  While we usually associate it with dessert, chocolate is used throughout Mexico to make the rich and sensual sauce called mole (MOH-leh).  Here salmon, supported by the contracting sweetness of the grilled pineapple and onions, stands up to the sauce's intensity.

                Sausage Burgers With Grill-Roasted Peppers

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Pork
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  red bell pepper
                        === BURGERS ===
  2             pounds  coarsely-ground pork shoulder
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  ground red pepper
  1           teaspoon  ground fennel
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  4                     hamburger buns
  4             slices  fontina cheese
  1              bunch  arugula or soft lettuce

Grill the bell pepper over Direct Medium heat until evenly charred on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes, turning every 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove the pepper from the grill and place in a paper bag; close tightly.  Let stand 10 to 15 minutes to steam off the skin.

Remove the pepper from the bag and peel away the charred skin.  Cut off the top and remove the seeds.  Cut the pepper into strips.  Set aside.

To make the Burgers:  In a small bowl combine the burger ingredients.  Add 1/4 cup of water and mix.  Shape the meat into four patties of equal size and thickness.  Grill over Direct Medium heat until the juices run clear, about 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

During the last 30 seconds, grill the buns over Direct Medium heat until lightly toasted.

Serve the burgers hot on the toasted buns and top with cheese, grilled peppers, and lettuce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A red Zinfandel is clear winner here.

Beer Recommendation:  Grab a cold, crisp lager.

Comments:  Pork shoulder has a richness and depth that most ground chuck just can't match.  Grilled until the juices run clear, it still makes a succulent burger every time.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               ears  fresh sweet corn -- in their husks
  4                     strips bacon
     1/3           cup  bacon drippings
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     shallot -- minced
  2        tablespoons  sherry wine vinegar
  16             large  sea scallops - (abt 1 lb)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  baby spinach leaves
  2                     tomatoes -- cut in wedges
  1                     avocado -- sliced

Soak the corn in cold water for 30 minutes or more.  If necessary, use a weight to keep the ears submerged.  Drain.  Grill the corn over Direct Medium heat for 20 to 25 minutes, turning three or four times during grilling time.  Remove from the grill and allow to cool slightly.  When cool enough to handle, carefully pull back the husks and remove the silk.  With a sharp knife, cut the kernels from the cobs.  Set aside.

In a 9- or 10-inch skillet over medium heat, fry the bacon until the fat is rendered and the bacon is crisp, 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove the bacon and set aside on paper towels to drain.  Remove all but 1/3 cup of the fat from the bacon drippings in the skillet.  Add the garlic and shallot and cook over medium heat until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the sherry wine vinegar and continue cooking over low heat for 3 more minutes.  Set aside.

Wash the scallops and remove the small, tough side muscle.  Place in a medium bowl.  Add enough olive oil to lightly coat.  Season with salt and pepper.  Grill over Direct High heat until just opaque in the center, 4 to 6 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

In a large bowl combine the spinach leaves and dressing.  Toss to evenly coat the spinach.  Divide among four plates and add tomato wedges, avocado slices, corn, and scallops.  Crumble a piece of bacon over each salad.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Dazzle your dinner mates with a ripe, fruity Pinot Noir.

Beer Recommendation:  Pour a light-bodied imported lager for a sure winner.

Comments:  The smokiness of a bacon dressing works in harmony with the grilled corn and scallops here.  Serve the dressing slightly warm to wilt the spinach and warm the other vegetables.

Note:  The corn is grilled over Direct Medium heat and the scallops over Direct High heat.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry
                Smoking

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  water
     1/3           cup  salt
     1/4           cup  pickling spice - (half of 1 1/2-oz jar)
  4                     Cornish game hens - (1 to 1 1/2 lbs ea)

In a Dutch oven, combine water, salt, and pickling spice; bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and chill completely.

Thaw Cornish game hens, if frozen.  Rinse hens and pat dry.  Submerge hens in chilled pickling marinade.  Marinate in refrigerator 12 hours.

Prepare charcoal or gas grill or traditional smoker for Indirect smoking on Low Heat (follow instructions in owner's manual).  Use two layers of charcoal for smoker.  For best results for this recipe, use wine barrel chips, hickory or mesquite chips or chunks, or fruit woods (such as cherry or peach).

Remove hens from marinade; discard marinade.  Pat hens dry with paper towels; brush off excess pickling spice.

Place hens on cooking grate of fully smoking grill or smoker.  Smoke 3 to 4 hours over charcoal or 45 to 60 minutes over gas, or until meat thermometer inserted into thigh registers 180 degrees.  Hens should be tender and juices should run clear.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Nestle these tender birds in a rich, honeyed Chardonnay.

Beer Recommendation:  Something malty for the salty; a rich blond ale will complement the crispy skin and tender meat of these brined beauties.

Comments:  An exquisite little bird meets an extraordinary preparation.  Your guests will be amazed.

           Spicy Chicken And Plantain Skewers With Tomato Salsa

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SKEWERS ===
     1/3           cup  white wine
  1         tablespoon  ketchup
  1         tablespoon  peanut butter
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Hungarian paprika
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  Kosher salt
  2              whole  chicken breasts - (2 lbs total) -- skinned, boned,
                        and cut into 1" pieces
  2                     ripe plantains -- peeled, and
                        sliced into 1/2" pieces
                        === TOMATO SALSA ===
  2              large  tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              small  red onion -- finely chopped
  1                     red finger chile pepper -- seeded, veined,
                        and finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        === FOR GRILLING SKEWERS===
     1/2                lime
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing skewers

To make the Skewers:  In a small saucepan combine wine, ketchup, peanut butter, soy sauce, paprika, ginger, and salt.  Bring to a boil.  Let cool completely.

Place chicken and plantain pieces in separate resealable plastic bags.  Pour 1/2 of marinade in each bag; close bags.  Marinate in refrigerator 1 hour.

Meanwhile, make the Tomato Salsa:  In a small aluminum foil pan place tomatoes, stem-side down.  Place pan on cooking grate.  Grill 15 to 20 minutes or until blackened.  Remove and discard tomato skins.  Mash tomatoes; set aside.

Heat oil in small saucepan.  Add red onion and chile; cook and stir 2 minutes.  Add garlic and mashed tomato; simmer 5 minutes.  Keep warm until skewers are ready.

On 12-inch skewers, alternately thread chicken and plantain pieces, leaving space between pieces.  Squeeze lime juice over skewers; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Brush skewers with oil and place in center of cooking grate.  Grill 10 to 12 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve with warm Tomato Salsa.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A clean and citrusy Sauvignon Blanc from Sonoma -- especially a Semillon blend -- will evoke all the individual flavors of the marinade.

Beer Recommendation:  Nut Brown Ale, which is somewhat sweet and mildly spicy, won't be the least bit intimidated by this upstart combination of flavors.

Comments:  Fire up the grill and hang up the hammock.  This entrÈe will make you feel tropical all over.

Notes:  Plantain ripen slowly, so buy them several days ahead of time if you can't find them ripe in the store.  (Unripe ones are green in color, semi-ripe ones are mottled yellow and black.  Ripe ones are black.)  If using wooden skewers, soak in water 30 minutes before using so ends won't burn during grilling time.

          Sweet And Sour Chicken Thighs With Wilted Baby Spinach

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     boneless skinless chicken thighs -- (abt 4 oz ea)
  1                     plum tomato -- seeded, chopped
  4              large  handful baby spinach leaves -- (abt 12 oz total)
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sambal oelek - (to 2)
                        = (chili-garlic paste)

To make the Marinade:  In a small bowl whisk together the marinade ingredients.

Rinse the chicken thighs under cold water.  Place them in a large, plastic resealable bag and pour in the marinade.  Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly.  Turn the bag to distribute the marinade, place the bag in a bowl and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours, turning the bag occasionally.

Remove the chicken thighs from the bag, reserving the marinade.  Pour the marinade into a very large skillet and set it aside.  Grill the chicken thighs over Direct Medium heat until the meat is firm and the juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Meanwhile, bring the marinade to a boil over high heat and allow to boil for 1 full minute.  Add the tomato and spinach leaves to the skillet and cook until the spinach is just wilted, 2 to 3 minutes, turning occasionally with tongs.  Serve the warm spinach mixture under the chicken.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Look for a white wine that balances bright acidity and fresh fruit flavors, such as an off-dry Gew¸rztraminer.

Beer Recommendation:  A sweet, nutty pale ale has just what this chicken recipe needs.

Comments:  Boneless chicken thighs rank high among a griller's most dependable assets.  They absorb seasonings in a matter of minutes, they cook even faster and they taste more like chicken than any other part of the bird.  For dinner tonight, give them a well-balanced marinade and a bed of tender spinach leaves.

Meanwhile, bring the marinade to a boil over high heat and allow to boil for 1 full minute.  Add the tomato and spinach leaves to the skillet and cook until the spinach is just wilted, 2 to 3 minutes, turning occasionally with tongs.  Serve the warm spinach mixture under the chicken.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  Look for a white wine that balances bright acidity and fresh fruit flavors, such as an off-dry Gew¸rztraminer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beer Recommendation:  A sweet, nutty pale ale has just what this chicken recipe needs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Boneless chicken thighs rank high among a griller&apos;s most dependable assets.  They absorb seasonings in a matter of minutes, they cook even faster and they taste more like chicken than any other part of the bird.  For dinner tonight, give them a well-balanced marinade and a bed of tender spinach leaves.

                           Sweet And Spicy Pork

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/4           cup  lime juice
     1/4           cup  pineapple juice
     1/4           cup  chili oil
  2 1/2    tablespoons  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  hot chili oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR THE PORK ===
  2             pounds  boneless pork shoulder -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" cubes
                        = (or 2 whole pork tenderloins,
                        abt 1 lb ea)
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing skewers

In small bowl combine all marinade ingredients.  Place pork in a resealable plastic bag set in a shallow dish.  Pour marinade mixture over pork; close bag.  Marinate in refrigerator 4 to 6 hours, turning occasionally to distribute marinade.

Skewer pork cubes on six 10-inch skewers, leaving space between cubes.  Lightly brush skewers with oil and place in center of cooking grate.  Grill 10 to 12 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  (If using pork tenderloins, place in center of cooking grate and grill 20 to 30 minutes until center is barely pink and internal temperature reaches 160 degrees)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  The key words here are sweet and spicy.  Reach for the fruitiest Gew¸rztraminer you can find.  Or you might be just as happy with a semi-dry Riesling.

Beer Recommendation:  A refreshing blond lager will elevate the sweetness of the pork and cleanse the heat of the chile from your palate.

Comments:  Put on your favorite silk shirt and invite your friends over for this classic Thai dish.

Note:  If using wooden skewers, soak in water 30 minutes before using so ends won't burn during grilling.

                      Tenderloin Wrapped In Pancetta

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === THE RUB ===
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh rosemary
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR THE PORK ===
  2                     pork tenderloins - (abt 1 lb ea)
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced pancetta

To make the Rub:  In a small bowl combine the rub ingredients.

Trim any excess fat and silver skin from the tenderloins and spread the rub evenly all over, pressing the spices into the meat.

Cut six 12-inch pieces of cotton string, three for each tenderloin.  Wrap the tenderloin with the slices of pancetta and secure the pancetta with the string. (The tenderloins do not need to be completely covered.)  Allow to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling.

Grill the tenderloins over Indirect Medium heat until the centers are barely pink and the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees, 25 to 30 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Move the tenderloins over Direct Medium heat for the last 3 minutes if you want to crisp the pancetta.

Allow the tenderloins to rest for 3 to 5 minutes, then snip the strings with scissors and remove them.  Cut the tenderloins in thin slices on the bias and serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  This "other white meat" dish deserves more than just another white wine.  Cabernet Franc from California or France's Loire Valley is the perfect "crossover" red to highlight its contrasting textures and flavors.

Beer Recommendation:  A fine festbier from Munich, or any Octoberfest beer from craft brewers in the USA, will complete the herbal condiment for the pork and bring out the salty flavors in the pancetta.

Comments:  Pancetta, a salt-cured Italian bacon, adds rich flavor here and, if crisped over Direct heat at the end, it creates a compelling contrast to the tenderloin.
