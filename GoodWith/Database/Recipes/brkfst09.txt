                        4 Grain Blueberry Pancakes

Recipe By     :Carrie Levin
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               pint  blueberries
                        = (or strawberries, etc.)
                        === 4-GRAIN PANCAKE BATTER ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  old-fashioned oats - (heaping)
  2        tablespoons  toasted wheat germ - (heaping)
  2        tablespoons  coarse yellow corn meal
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2                tespoon salt
  2              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
     1/4           cup  whole milk
                        = (or 20% or skim)
  5        tablespoons  melted butter
                        = (reserve 1 tbspn for griddle)

Prepare the pancake batter by mixing all ingredients together in a bowl.  Beat together eggs and milk.  Pour the liquid into the dry ingredients and use a fork to mix until there are no pockets of dry mix left.  Do not overbeat.  Drizzle in the melted butter and cut it through the batter.  It's OK if a few streaks show on the surface.

Half of the berries should be cooked into the pancakes, and the other half should be saved to scatter over the top of the cooked pancakes for serving.  Butter the heated griddle or pan.  Knowing that you're making 10 pancakes, you might want to make a rough estimate of the number of berries you will use for each pancake before starting.

Pour the first pancake and distribute the blueberries evenly over the surface.  Avoid the extreme edges.  Proceed with the next pancake.  If you're using a griddle that will accommodate 6 or more pancakes, contine this way until you've maxed out the griddle, then return to the first pancake and check it.  Each pancake should cook approximately 3 minutes on the first side and 2 minutes on the second.

Arrange the pancakes on your plate, scatter some fresh blueberries over them and serve with maple syrup.

Note: If a berry should break on the cooking surface and you're going to cook another pancake there, a dribble of water or club soda and a scrape of the spatula will clear it.  After the liquid has evaporated, heat up some more butter and resume cooking.

This recipe yields 10 pancakes.

Comments:  Blueberries are ideal for pancakes, and as you might guess, they occupy a special place in my heart.  We also use sliced strawberries in our Lumber Jill breakfast, which is two strawberry pancakes, two scrambled eggs, and two pork or turkey sausage patties.  Any slightly tart berry will work wonderfully with pancakes, although I don't recommend cooking blackberries or raspberries into the pancake.  Just scatter a nice amount on top.  The 4-Grain Pancakes batter works beautifully with berries, and it is what we use at the restaurant.

Description:
  "Every year in early spring, neighborhood people will stop me on the
  street and ask if Blueberry Pancakes are back on the menu.  And every
  year I tell them they're back on after Memorial Day -- which is when
  Good Enough To Eat changes to the summer menu."

                               Apple Scones

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  cold butter - (1/2 stick)
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  wheat germ
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  2                     eggs -- (1 for glazing)
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
  1                     Granny Smith apple -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes -(abt 1 cup)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut the butter into small (1/4-inch) chunks, rewrap it in the paper, and return it to the refrigerator.

Combine the dry ingredients.

Beat 1 egg and combine it with the buttermilk.

Thread the butter though the dry ingredients with thumb and fingers, getting it to a gravelly texture.  Comb the buttermilk-egg mixture into the butter-flour "gravel" then add the apple cubes, blending through the batter just enough to be able to make two equal sized balls.

Flatten the balls to 2 disks 5 to 6 inches in diameter.  Now "pizza-slice" each disk into four sections.  Put the scones on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Beat the second egg and brush it on the scones as a glaze.  Bake for 20 minutes, until golden brown.

This recipe yields 8 scones.

Comments:  I have to amend the preceeding: I don't make apple scones in June -- my purveyor tells me that's the month the Grannies have been sitting too long in the warehouse.

Description:
  "This one is good all year long, but better in the fall, cliff-side or
  no, wherever you can find Granny Smith apples."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           envelope  dry yeast
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  warm water -- divided
  2                     eggs -- room temperature
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  diced fresh apples
  1                     egg white -- beaten

Pour 1/2 cup warm water, about 85 to 115 degrees, into the bowl of a large food processor.  Sprinkle the yeast and sugar over the water and mix at low speed.  Let stand for five minutes.

Slowly mix in remaining water, eggs, vanilla and salt.  Slowly add flour a cup at a time.  Mix on high for about a minute or two.  The dough should turn into a ball and roll around the processor.  If the dough does not ball up because it's to dry, add water one tablespoon at a time until it does.  If your mixture is more like a batter, add flour one tablespoon at a time.  Mix in fruit.

Remove from food processor.  Place in an oiled bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.

Grease and flour two large loaf pans.  Punch down dough.  Divide dough between two loaf pans, cover and let rise again, about 1/2 hour.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Brush top of loaves with beaten egg white and bake for about 45 minutes or until golden brown.

This recipe yields 2 large loaves.

Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     loaf sourdough bread or
                        black olive bread - (16 to 20 oz) -- crusts removed,
                        if thick
  3               jars  marinated artichoke hearts - (6 1/2 oz ea) -- drained, and
  3        tablespoons  artichoke  marinade reserved
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh thyme or tarragon
                        = (or 1 tspn dried thyme or tarragon)
  3                     plump garlic cloves -- roasted in a dry
                        skillet until soft and smashed
     3/4         pound  creamy fresh goat cheese -- crumbled
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  8              large  eggs
  2 1/2           cups  half-and-half or milk
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-milled black pepper
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Oil or butter a deep 9- to 10-inch baking dish.

Slice the bread into approximately 1-inch cubes.  Transfer the bread to a baking sheet and toast for about 20 minutes, stirring once or twice, until golden brown and lightly crisp.

Slice the artichoke hearts about 1/3-inch thick.  Mix them with the thyme and garlic in a small bowl.  Arrange 2 or 3 equal alternating layers of the bread, cheeses, and artichoke hearts in the baking dish.

Whisk the eggs with the half-and-half, salt, pepper, and reserved artichoke marinade.  Pour the custard over the bread mixture.  Drizzle the olive oil over the surface.  Cover and refrigerate the strata for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.

Remove the strata from the refrigerator 20 to 30 minutes before you plan to bake it.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Bake the strata for 50 to 55 minutes, until puffed, golden brown, and lightly set in the center.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 or more servings

Comments:   We cube the bread in this case rather than slice it so that the pieces are closer in size to the artichoke hearts, and then we toast it too for extra flavor and texture.  Good additions, if on hand, include a handful of slivered briny black olives or soaked sun-dried tomatoes.

In a separate bowl, beat together eggs, soy sauce and ginger until blended.  Pour over cabbage mixture.  As mixture begins to set, gently stir across bottom and sides of pan, to form soft curds.  Continue until eggs are thickened and no visible liquid egg remains.  Do not stir constantly.

                       Bacon-Tomato-Gruyere Omelet

Recipe By     :Carrie Levin
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes
                Omelets

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  clarified butter
  1              ounce  cooked bacon - (1 1/2 slices) -- cut 1/2" pieces
  3                     eggs
  1              ounce  grated Gruyere cheese - (1/4 cup)
                        = (don't pack it down!)
  1              ounce  plum tomato - (1/2 small) -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1/4" cubes

After the butter is good and hot in the pan, scatter in the bacon.  Shake the pan once to make sure the bacon is not sticking.  Now pour in the beaten eggs.  Tilt and pull a couple of times and sprinkle in the cheese, keeping it well in the eggs.  Pull a couple more times to cook to desired doneness.  Scatter in the tomato pieces, avoiding the edge of the pan.

Immediately (almost!) depan the omelette, flipping it into a half circle on your warmed plate.  The tomatoes will be sufficiently warmed being folded into the omelet at the end of the process and shouldn't be cooked so much as to release their water.  Water in the pan will cause sticking.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Comments:  One day I remarked to Keith, a chef who had been with me for many years, that I always seem to be putting cheese in my omelettes.  He said, "An omelette without cheese is a day without sunshine!"

                Baked Artichokes With Coddled Eggs Nicoise

Recipe By     :Paul Gaylor
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  to large globe artichokes
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     2/3           cup  water
  4              large  eggs
     2/3           cup  heavy cream
  2                     plum tomatoes -- skinned, seeded,
                        and cut into small dice
  8                     fresh basil leaves -- roughly chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

With a large, sharp knife, slice one third off the top of each artichoke.  Pull off the outer leaves and discard them.  Break the artichoke stems off at the base, then trim about 1/4 inch from the base.

Use the butter to grease a flameproof casserole dish just large enough to hold the artichokes.  Place the artichokes in it and pour the wine and water over them.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover and cook gently for 15 to 20 minutes or until just tender; test the base of each artichoke with the point of a knife.

Remove the artichokes from the casserole, reserving the cooking liquid.  Leave the artichokes to cool, placing them upside down to drain off any liquid.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  To create a central cavity in each artichoke, pull out the small inner leaves, then use a teaspoon to scrape out the fibrous choke.

Place the artichokes in a baking dish and crack an egg into the center of each one.  Season generously with salt and pepper and bake in the oven for 5 minutes, or until the eggs are lightly set.

Meanwhile, make the sauce:  Reheat the cooking liquid, then add the cream and boil for 5 minutes.  Stir in the tomatoes and basil and season to taste.  Place each artichoke on a serving plate, coat lightly with the sauce and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In another bowl, whisk the egg and then whisk in the buttermilk, vanilla, and melted butter.  Pour mixture all at once into dry ingredients.  Quickly stir to partially blend.  Add blueberries.  Carefully fold together to moisten.  The batter will be thick and lumpy.

Spoon batter into 12 paper-lined muffin tins.  The cups will be full.  Sprinkle the tops with the 1 tablespoon sugar.  Bake 25 to 30 minutes.  When done, the tops will spring back when lightly touched.  Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes and then carefully remove and cool on a rack.

This recipe yields 12 muffins.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  butter
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
  3 1/2           cups  flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  8             ounces  sour cream
  3                     eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2               cups  fresh blueberries -- washed and dried

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour a 9-inch tube pan with a removable bottom.

Beat together butter, 1 cup sugar and cinnamon, continue beating until light and fluffy.  Reduce mixer speed and beat in 2 cups flour until well blended and mixture is crumbly.  Set aside 1 cup of crumbly mixture.

Mix remaining flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt until well blended.  Add remaining 1/2 cup sugar, eggs, sour cream and vanilla.  Increase mixer speed and beat for about 2 minutes, stopping to scrape the bowl as needed.  Reduce mixer speed to low and mix in the flour mixture and mix until just blended.

Fold in 1 1/2 cups blueberries and spoon the batter into the prepared tube pan.  Sprinkle the reserved 1/2 cup blueberries around the top of cake, followed by the reserved crumbly mixture.

Bake for about 1 hour or until a cake tester comes out clean.  Cool cake in pan for about 10 minutes before loosening from the sides of the pan with a knife.  Carefully remove cake from pan by lifting up from the bottom.  Cool completely on a wire rack, crumb-side up.

This recipe yields 1 cake, about 14 slices.

Recipe By     :Susan Goss
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     loaf Farmhouse Bread - (24 oz) -- crusts trimmed
     1/3         pound  shaved ham
  4               cups  shredded cheddar cheese -- shredded
     1/2           cup  chopped chives
     1/2           cup  fresh basil -- chopped
  8              large  eggs
  4                cup  whole milk
  2        tablespoons  grainy-style mustard
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt -- or to taste
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste

Butter or spray a 9- by 11-inch casserole.

Slice bread into long slices, about 1/3-inch thick.  You should have 6 or 7 slices.  Arrange 3 of the slices in one layer in the buttered pan.  Top with half the ham.  Cover with half the cheese and half the herbs.  Arrange 3 more slices of bread over this (it doesn't matter if the bread doesn't fit snugly, although you can use the extra slice to fill in any gaps).  Arrange remaining ham, cheese and herbs over bread.

In a mixing bowl, whisk eggs until combined.  Add milk, mustard, salt and pepper and whisk until light and frothy.  Pour egg mixture evenly over bread, using the entire mixture.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

When ready to bake, pre-heat oven to 325 degrees.  Bake the pudding on the bottom rack in the pre-heated oven for 1 1/2 hours until puffed and browned.  Let pudding rest for 15 minutes before cutting into squares.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  You should use this recipe as a guide in creating your own special pudding.  Add chiles and Southwestern spices if you like, or use Canadian-style bacon or smoked turkey in place of the ham.  Add a layer of vegetables for simple supper dish.  The best part of this recipe is you make it the night before and then just pop it in the oven the next morning for a spectacular breakfast

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1 3/4           cups  sugar
  3 3/4           cups  flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  butter
  3                     eggs
  2               cups  sour cream
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1                cup  dried tart cherries
                        === BAKED IN FILLING ===
     3/4           cup  chocolate chips
  1         tablespoon  cocoa
  2           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/3           cup  sugar
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISHES ===
                        Melted chocolate or white chocolate
                        Confectioner's sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour a 9- or 10-inch tube pan with a removable bottom.

Combine filling ingredients, set aside.  In a separate bowl combine dry cake ingredients.

In a large bowl with an electric mixer at low speed, beat the sugar and butter until well blended, then increase speed and beat for about 2 to 3 minutes, until fluffy.  Reduce speed to low and add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition.  Continuing at low speed, alternately adding the dry ingredient mixture and the sour cream.  Mix in the vanilla and beat until the batter is smooth.  Stir in the dried cherries.

Spoon 1/3 of the batter into the prepared pan, sprinkle with half the chocolate mixture.  Top that with half the remaining batter, then the remaining chocolate mixture.  Carefully spread the remaining batter over the top.

Bake for about 1 hour and fifteen minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean.  Cool cake in pan on wire rack for 10 minutes, before loosening cake from side and removing bottom of pan.  Invert the cake onto a plate and remove the bottom of the cake pan, then immediately invert the cake back onto a wire rack to cool completely (the right side will be up).

If desired, drizzle top with melted chocolate or white chocolate or sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Description:
  "Here's an impressive cake to serve at your next brunch, coffee
  klastch or late night dessert party.  A classic sour cream coffee cake
  is given a decadent touch with the addition of chocolate chips and
  tart dried cherries."

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  2               cups  milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1                     loaf French bread - (16 oz) -- cut 1 1/2"-thk
                        slices

With a wire whisk, slightly beat the eggs.  Add the flour, sugar and other dry ingredients.  Beat until it's a smooth, thin batter.  Gradually beat in milk and vanilla.

Pour the mixture into a 9- by 13-inch baking dish.

Dip one side of each slice into the batter; turn the slices over and place them in a single layer in the batter.  Push the slices together to make them fit.  Cover the dish and refrigerate overnight.

About 30 minutes before ready to cook, turn the slices over to soak the other side.

Heat a large frying pan or griddle over medium heat.  Melt a small amount of butter or margarine in the pan and add as many bread slices as will fit.

Pour any of the extra batter over the tops of the slices.  Cook for 8 to 10 minutes on each side or until the slices are golden.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                           Fresh Fruit Smoothie

Recipe By     :Chery Alters Jamison and Bill Jamison
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages                       Breakfast/Brunch


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2                 generous cups chopped mangoes, peaches,
                        plums, strawberries, raspberries,
                        blueberries, watermelon, cantaloupe, or
                        honeydew melon
  1              small  banana -- cut into chunks
     1/2           cup  plain or fruit-flavored yogurt
     1/2           cup  skim or low-fat milk
  6                     ice cubes
                        Sugar -- optional
                        Fresh fruit chunks -- (optional)
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- (optional)

In a blender, combine the chopped fruit, banana, yogurt, milk, and ice cubes.  Puree until smooth.  Add a little sugar if the drink is not as sweet as you like.  Pour into tall glasses and drink up.

On a leisurely morning, garnish the smoothie, if you wish, with fruit chunks on toothpicks and sprigs of mint for each glass.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Smoothie Technique Tip:  While dairy products play a big role in most smoothies, they are not necessities.  If you like creaminess, silken tofu can replace yogurt or soy milk can replace cow's or goat's milk.  A tablespoon or more of canned cream of coconut can add richness.  For a more sprightly taste, try cherry cider, cranberry or apple juice, another fruit nectar, or even ginger ale.  Bananas give smoothies body and are mild enough to blend with most other flavors.  Peel any fruit with a thick skin, such as mangoes.  Thinner-skinned fruits such as peaches or plums can be peeled if you wish, but it's not necessary.  Avoid adding a preponderance of fruits with noticeable seeds, such as blackberries, unless you want to go to the effort of straining them.

Comments:  Choose fruit by season, but also don't hesitate to use frozen fruit in a smoothie; its icy tingle can be a plus in the drink.

  "On-the-go eaters love smoothies.  In addition to offering convenience
  and speed, they provide a painless way to get a healthy quantity of
  fruit into your daily diet."

  12                    apples
                        = (any variety except Macintosh)
     1/2           cup  butter

In the meantime, melt remaining 1/4 cup butter in the bottom of a heavy ovenproof frying pan.  Peel, core and cut remaining apples into wedges.  Arrange apples in a circle in bottom of pan, to cover pan completely.  Sprinkle currants over apples.

Beat eggs with cream and combine with the cooled applesauce.  Carefully pour the egg mixture over the apples in the frying pan, taking care not to disturb the arrangement of apples in the bottom of the pan.

Bake for about 1/2 hour or until omelette is set.  Turn onto a plate and serve warm with sweetened whipped cream.

Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              large  egg
  1 1/4           cups  milk
     1/4           cup  molasses
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        Lemon Sauce -- (see recipe)

Stir together dry ingredients.

In a separate bowl, beat egg with milk.  Beat in molasses then oil.

Add flour mixture and stir until combined.  Batter will be lumpy.  Lumps will cook out.

Grease a griddle or frying pan.  Use approximately two tablespoons of batter for each pancake.  Turn when the pancake appears to be dry and bubbles appear on the top.  Flip and cook the second side until lightly browned.  Watch these closely -- they burn easily.

Serve with Lemon Sauce.

This recipe yields 20 pancakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  eggs - (to 8)
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh mint
  1         tablespoon  minced flat-leaf parsley
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh oregano
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried oregano)
  2        tablespoons  minced scallion
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2               cups  spinach - (packed)
  1                cup  crumbled feta
  1                cup  diced ripe tomatoes
                        = (or halved cherry tomatoes)

Break the eggs into a medium-sized bowl and beat with a whisk until smooth.  Stir in the herbs and scallion, and grind in a good, amount of black pepper.

Place a 10-inch skillet or sautÈ pan over medium heat.  After several minutes, add the olive oil, wait about 10 seconds, then swirl to coat the pan.  Turn the heat up to medium-high, add the spinach, and sautÈ for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the spinach has wilted and turned a deep green.

With the heat still at medium-high, pour the eggs into the pan, scrambling them slowly.  As the eggs begin to set, push the curds from the bottom to one side, allowing uncooked egg to flow into contact with the pan.  The spinach will blend into the eggs.

When the eggs are mostly set but still slightly wet, sprinkle in the crumbled feta.  Continue scrambling slowly, allowing the cheese to melt slightly into the eggs.  After about a minute, stir in the tomatoes.

Cook for just a few seconds longer, or until the eggs are done to your liking.  Serve right away.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  yellow cornmeal -- preferably
                        stoneground
     2/3           cup  masa harina
                        = (or substitute additional cornmeal)
     1/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  2               cups  buttermilk
  2                     eggs -- well beaten
  2                     long green chiles -- roasted, peeled,
                        and chopped
     1/3           cup  tender sweet corn kernels and juices

  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  thinly-sliced red bell pepper
  1                cup  grated gruyËre - (packed)
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  milk
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place a medium-sized skillet over medium heat and wait about 2 minutes.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the pan.  Add the onion, sautÈ for 5 minutes, and then add the salt, herbs, and mustard.  Cover the pan, lower the heat, and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  (During this time, preheat the oven to 375 degrees, and place the unbaked crust on a baking tray.)

Stir the vinegar and bell pepper into the onions, turn the heat up to medium, and cook, uncovered, for another 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Sprinkle the cheese into the crust, then spoon the onion-pepper mixture on top of the cheese.

Whisk together the eggs, milk, and black pepper to taste, and slowly pour this over the vegetables and cheese.

Bake on the baking tray in the lower third of the oven for 35 to 40 minutes or until the custard is set.  Cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing, and serve at any temperature.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                     Latkes (Grated Potato Pancakes)

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  potatoes -- peeled, grated
  1                     onion -- grated
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Vegetable oil or shortening -- for frying

Squeeze out as much liquid from the grated potatoes as you can and place in a mixing bowl; mix in the grated onion then add the eggs, flour and salt, mixing well.

Heat, over medium heat, enough oil in a heavy frying pan to cover the pancakes amply.  Drop the batter by spoonfuls into the hot oil, spreading the batter to about 3-inches in diameter.  Cook until crisp, puffed and golden brown on both sides; drain on paper towels.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cook's Note:  To lower the fat in this recipe, the batter can also be baked in a greased shallow baking pan at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes or until nicely browned.  Cut into squares and serve hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  chopped ripe mango - (abt 1 mango)
                        = (or 1 cup chopped cantaloupe,
                        watermelon, or honeydew)
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt
  4                     ice cubes - (to 6)
                        Sugar -- to taste
                        Ground cardamom to taste
                        Chopped pistacios or slivered almonds -- for garnish

Puree until smooth.  Check the flavor and add sugar and more cardamon if needed.  If practical, refrigerate the lassi for an hour or longer before serving.  Pour into tall glasses and sprinkle with chopped nuts if you wish.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Description:
  "Similar to a fruit smoothie, though East Indian in origin and
  seasoning, mango lassi makes a superb breakfast drink, as we learned
  from an Indian-American child in Albuquerque.  Top with chopped
  pistachios or a few slivered almonds."

  1                     egg
  1                cup  all-purpose or whole-wheat flour
     3/4           cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  sugar (white or brown)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

In a medium mixing bowl, beat egg until fluffy.  Add remaining ingredients and beat just until smooth.  For thinner pancakes, stir in additional 1 to 2 tablespoons milk.

Heat greased griddle or skillet over medium heat or to 375 degrees.  Griddle is ready when a few drops of water bubble and skitter rapidly around.

For each pancake, pour scant 1/4 cup batter onto hot griddle.  Cook pancakes until puffed, bubbly and dry around edges.  Turn and cook other sides until golden brown.

This recipe yields about 10 (4-inch) pancakes.  Recipe can be doubled.

Variations: 
  ï Fruited Pancakes:  Stir in 1/2 cup fresh or frozen (thawed and drained) berries or chopped fruit such as bananas, apples, peaches or pears. 
  ï Crunch Pancakes:  Stir in 1/2 cup chopped nuts, trail mix or granola.

                     Potato Pancakes With Applesauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              whole  green apples -- cut into eighths
  2 1/2           cups  apple flavor Libby's 100% Juicy Juice
  6                     red potatoes -- peeled, grated
  1                     onion -- peeled, grated
  1                     egg
  10       tablespoons  corn oil -- divided
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  sour cream

Simmer apples (not peeled, cored or seeded) in apple juice for 30 minutes or until very soft.  Drain, reserving the liquid.  Push apple through sieve and discard peel and seeds.  Simmer liquid to reduce by half and stir into applesauce.

In a large mixing bowl, combine potato and onion.  Beat egg with 2 tablespoons of the corn oil and salt; combine with potato mixture.

Pour enough of the remaining corn oil into a sautÈ pan to cover bottom with about 1/16-inch of oil.  Heat to very hot but not smoking, and drop potato mixture in by heaping tablespoons.  Flatten immediately so pancakes are about 4 inches in diameter (smaller pancakes will burn).  Try to keep them neatly round.  Fry until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes, flip and brown other side.  Drain on paper towels.  Serve with applesauce and sour cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt
     3/4           cup  milk
  1                cup  fresh berries in any combination desired
                        = (blueberries, raspberries,
                        strawberries, blackberries)
                        Additional berries -- for accompaniment
                        Maple syrup -- for accompaniment
                        Lightly-sweetened whipped cream -- for accompaniment

Whisk together flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in a bowl.

In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs; add the yogurt and milk, mixing well.

Add egg mixture to the flour mixture; stirring by hand until just combined.  Gently fold in 1 cup berries into batter, being careful not to break up the fruit.

Heat a lightly greased griddle or skillet over medium heat (375 degrees).  Griddle is ready when a few drops of water bubble and skitter rapidly around.

For each pancake, pour scant 1/4 cup batter onto hot griddle.  Cook pancakes until surface is covered with bubbles and appear dry around the edges.  Turn and cook other side until golden brown.

Serve with additional berries spooned on top, drizzle with maple syrup and top with a dollop of whipped cream.

This recipe yields about 12 (4-inch) pancakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     hard boiled eggs
  1              pound  spicy sausage meat
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/2           cup  flour -- divided
  1                cup  breadcrumbs
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  2                     eggs -- beaten
                        Oil -- for frying

Peel the eggs and set aside.  Mix sausage and spices in a small bowl.  Divide sausage into 6 equal portions, set aside.  Mix breadcrumbs with salt, pepper and paprika, set aside.

Dry each egg with a paper towel, then roll lightly in flour to coat.  Take one portion of sausage and using hands, shape a coating around the hard boiled egg, completely enclosing it.  Roll in flour again, then dip in beaten egg then roll in breadcrumb mixture.  Repeat with remaining eggs.

Heat about 2 to 3 inches of oil in a large skillet.  Fry eggs, turning frequently, until golden brown on all sides.  Drain on paper towels.  Let cool slightly before serving.

To serve, cut each in half and serve with some good mustard.

This recipe yields 6 eggs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BATTER ===
  1 1/2           cups  flour -- sifted
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarse salt
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  4                     eggs
  1 1/3           cups  milk
  1                cup  water
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped chives
                        === FILLING ===
  16            ounces  dry curd cottage cheese
  16            ounces  small curd cottage cheese
  3                     egg yolks
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon zest
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped chives
     1/2         pound  Nova Scotia lox -- sliced, and
                        finely diced
  3        tablespoons  butter
  5        tablespoons  corn oil -- divided
  1               pint  sour cream

Resift the flour with the salt, baking powder, and pepper into a large bowl.  In a separate bowl beat the eggs, and then add the milk, water and chives.  Make a well in the sifted ingredients, pour in the liquid ingredients, and combine with a few strokes.  Ignore the lumps, they will dissolve when you stir the batter before making the crepes.  Let the batter rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

While the batter is resting make the filling.  In the work bowl of a food processor combine the two types of cottage cheese, the egg yolks, lemon zest, and pepper.  Process for one minute.  Remove to a medium-sized bowl and gently stir in the lox and chives.  Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.

Using a 5 to 6-inch crepe pan make the crepes.  Allow about 3 tablespoons of batter per crepe.  Have the pan well-heated before beginning.  Using about 2 tablespoons of the oil, brush the pan with a little of the oil before adding batter each time.  Cook each crepe on one side until lightly browned, then turn and cook just a few seconds on the other side.  Remove to waxed paper to cool.  As the pancakes cool, stack between sheets of waxed paper.

Divide the filling among the crepes, allowing about 1/4 cup per crepe.  Fold up envelope-style, by first folding the bottom to cover the filling, then folding over the two sides.  Allow the seam to be on the bottom of the blintz.  (The blintzes can be made to this point ahead of time and refrigerated or frozen.)

In a 10-inch skillet heat one tablespoon each of the butter and oil.  SautÈ the blintzes over medium heat, allowing them to brown nicely on both sides.  Add more butter and oil to the pan as needed.  Keep warm in a 200 degree oven while completing the batches.

When ready to serve, stir the sour cream until smooth and creamy.  Place two blintzes in the center of the warmed plate, spoon sour cream over them and garnish with the chives.

This recipe yields 24 blintzes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Sourdough Starter Mix -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  milk
  1                     egg -- well beaten
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar

The night before:  Mix 1 cup starter with the flour and milk in a large, nonreactive bowl.  Place the bowl in a warm place, cover and let it stand until morning.  (Be sure to replenish your starter by adding 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup water; let stand until next morning; then refrigerate.)

The next day, add beaten egg, oil, baking soda, baking powder, salt and sugar to sour dough mixture; mix well.

Heat a lightly greased griddle or skillet over medium heat (375 degrees).  Griddle is ready when a few drops of water bubble and skitter rapidly around.

For each pancake, pour scant 1/4 cup batter onto hot griddle.  Cook pancakes until surface is covered with bubbles and appear dry around the edges.  Turn and cook other side until golden brown.

This recipe yields about 12 to 14 pancakes.

Variation: ï Whole Wheat Sourdough Pancakes:  Use 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour in place of 1 cup all-purpose flour.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4      teaspoons  active dry yeast
  2               cups  non-chlorinated water -- room temperature
                        = (or bottled water)
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour

In a 2- to 3-quart glass or ceramic jar or bowl, using a wooden or non-metallic spoon, mix yeast and warm water.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

Add flour; mix until thick batter forms.  Batter need not be smooth.

Cover loosely with cheesecloth, lightweight kitchen towel or plastic wrap.  Let stand in warm place for 24 hours.

Stir; cover loosely.  Place starter in a warm place for 2 to 3 days or until it bubbles and smells sour; stirring once a day.

Cover loosely with a glass or ceramic lid or plastic wrap and store in refrigerator.  If the starter is not used within one week, you must feed it to keep it alive and active by following directions to replenish below.  If a clear liquid (an alcohol sometimes called hooch) rises to the top of starter during storage, simply stir it back in, but if the liquid turns a light pink, it means the starter is beginning to break down and spoil; discard and begin again.

To Replenish Starter:  After using a portion of starter, replenish with equal amounts of flour and warm water.  For example, if 1 1/4 cups of starter were removed to make bread, replenish remaining starter with 1 1/4 cups warm water and 1 1/4 cups flour.  Stir well to blend, cover and let stand in a warm place until bubbly, 3 to 5 hours.  Store starter in loosely covered glass container in refrigerator.  If not used at the end of one week, remove 1 cup starter and discard; then replenish with equal amounts of flour and warm water as instructed.

Comments:  Be aware that when a new starter is begun, it will take several feedings before developing the desired "sour-tangy-taste" strived for in baked goods.  When treated with regularly scheduled attention and loving care, your starter will last for literally centuries!  Sharing your well-established sourdough starter with other bread-makers in your life makes a very nice gift they'll surely appreciate!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  plain yogurt
  2        tablespoons  sour cream
  1              small  chile pepper -- seeded, minced
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1              pound  sweet potatoes -- peeled, grated
     2/3           cup  minced onion
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  5        tablespoons  flour
  2        tablespoons  butter or olive oil
  2                     scallions -- chopped

In a small bowl, combine yogurt, sour cream, chile pepper, lime juice, and salt and pepper to taste.  Stir well and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine sweet potato, onion, salt and pepper.  Add eggs; mix well.  Add flour and mix again.

In a large skillet, heat butter or olive oil over medium-high heat.  (Do not use a non-stick skillet or latke crust will be too thin.)  Divide potato mixture in half; drop the halves into skillet to form two cakes.  (If your skillet cannot hold both latkes, cook them one at a time.)  Flatten latkes with a large spoon until they are about 1 inch thick and about 5 inches in diameter.  Fry 4 to 5 minutes until they are deep brown on the underside, then flip and cook for 3 to 4 minutes more.

Serve hot, garnished with chile-lime sour cream and scallions.

This recipe yields 2 servings.
