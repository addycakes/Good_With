  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pounds  Granny Smith or other tart apples -- unpeeled, cored,
                        and sliced
  2 1/2           cups  apple cider
  2               cups  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  2                     strips lemon zest - (ea 2 1/2" long)

  1           teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

In a large saucepan cook the apples in the cider over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes, or until tender.  Puree them through the medium disk of a food mill into another saucepan and add the remaining ingredients.

Cook the mixture over very low heat, stirring occasionally, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until very thick.  Discard the lemon zest and spoon the mixture into 2 sterilized 1-pint Mason-type jars, filling them to within 1/2-inch of the top.  Wipe the rims with a dampened cloth and seal the jars with the lids.

Put the jars in a water bath canner or a rack in a deep kettle and add enough water to cover the jars by 2 inches.  Bring to a boil and process, covered, for 10 minutes.

Transfer the jars with canning tongs to a rack and let them cool.  Let the apple butter mellow in a cool, dark place for at least 1 week.

This recipe yields about 2 pints.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1                cup  old-fashioned oats
  1                cup  dark raisins
     1/2     teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  unsweetened applesauce
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  2              large  eggs

Bring the water to a boil in a medium-size saucepan over moderately-high heat.  Stir in the oats.  When the liquid returns to a boil, stir in the raisins and salt.  Reduce the heat and simmer 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the oats are soft and the water is absorbed.  Remove from heat, stir in the sugar, applesauce, and oil.  Cool to lukewarm.

Meanwhile, heat the oven to 350 degrees, and grease a 13- by 9-inch baking pan.

Put the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg into a large bowl.  Stir to mix well.  Stir the eggs into the oat mixture.  Add the flour mixture, and stir just until moistened.

Spread in the prepared pan and bake 30 to 40 minutes, or until the cake starts to shrink from the sides of the pan and a wooden pick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.

Place the pan on a wire rack to cool.  The cake is good served warm.  Or cool completely, cover tightly, and store overnight at room temperature before serving or freezing.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     baguette - (24" long)
  6              large  eggs
  3               cups  whole milk
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1                cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  pecans - (abt 3 oz)
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter - (1/4 cup) -- plus
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3               cups  blueberries -- (1 cup of which
                        will make the syrup)
     1/2           cup  pure maple syrup
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice

Butter a 13- by 9-inch baking dish.  Cut 20 (1-inch) slices from baguette and arrange in 1 layer in the baking dish.

In a large bowl whisk together eggs, milk, nutmeg, vanilla and 3/4 cup brown sugar and pour evenly over bread.  Chill mixture, covered, until all liquid is absorbed by bread, at least 8 hours, and up to 1 day.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a shallow baking pan, spread pecans evenly and toast in middle of oven until fragrant, about 8 minutes.  Toss pecans in pan with 1 teaspoon butter and salt.

Increase temperature to 400 degrees.

Sprinkle pecans and blueberries evenly over bread mixture.  Cut 1/2 stick butter into pieces and in a small saucepan heat with remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar, stirring until butter is melted.  Drizzle butter mixture over bread and bake for 20 minutes, or until any liquid from the blueberries is bubbling.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, cook blueberries and maple syrup over moderate heat until berries have burst, about 3 minutes.  Pour syrup through a sieve into a heatproof pitcher, pressing on solids, and stir in lemon juice.  Syrup may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.

Reheat syrup before serving.  Serve French toast with syrup.

This recipe yields 6 generous servings.

  12            ounces  beer
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BERRY MIXTURE ===
  8               cups  fresh or IQF frozen blackberries
     3/4           cup  sugar -- or to taste
     1/2           cup  red wine or water
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
                        === DUMPLING DOUGH ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/2           cup  buttermilk - (or a mixture of plain
                        yogurt and skim milk or water) -- plus more as needed
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- mixed with
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Whipped cream, cinnamon ice cream,
                        or sweetened yogurt

Place the berry mixture in a deep 8- or 9-inch skillet and bring to a simmer over moderate heat.  While berries are cooking make the dumpling dough.

In a mixing bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  Stir in the melted butter.  Add enough of the buttermilk to form a soft, sticky dough that is slightly wetter than a biscuit dough.

Using a soup spoon, spoon the dough over the fruit, forming small dumplings.  Sprinkle the dumplings with the cinnamon sugar.  Tightly cover the skillet with the lid or a sheet of foil and steam mixture over medium-low heat, without opening lid, until the dumplings set and the surface is dry when touched with a fingertip, about 15 minutes.

To serve:  Spoon the warm grunt into serving bowls, and top with whipped cream, ice cream or sweetened yogurt.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Place the berry mixture in a deep 8- or 9-inch skillet and bring to a simmer over moderate heat.  While berries are cooking make the dumpling dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a mixing bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  Stir in the melted butter.  Add enough of the buttermilk to form a soft, sticky dough that is slightly wetter than a biscuit dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a soup spoon, spoon the dough over the fruit, forming small dumplings.  Sprinkle the dumplings with the cinnamon sugar.  Tightly cover the skillet with the lid or a sheet of foil and steam mixture over medium-low heat, without opening lid, until the dumplings set and the surface is dry when touched with a fingertip, about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve:  Spoon the warm grunt into serving bowls, and top with whipped cream, ice cream or sweetened yogurt.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm-ripe peaches - (abt 3 med)
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  1 1/2           cups  brandy

Peel peaches:  Cut a small x in the blossom end of each peach.  Place peaches in boiling water for about 30 seconds.  Remove from boiling water and quickly submerge in ice cold water for a few minutes, or until cool enough to handle.  The skin should slip off.  Cut peaches in half and remove pit.  Dice peaches and put in a sterilized 1-quart Mason-type jar.

In a saucepan bring the sugar and water to a boil over low heat, washing down any sugar crystals clinging to the sides with a brush dipped in cold water until the sugar is dissolved.  Simmer the syrup for 3 minutes and remove it from the heat.  Add 1/2 cup brandy, 2 tablespoons at a time, stirring, and let it cool.  Stir in the remaining 1 cup brandy.

Pour the syrup over the peaches.  Add more brandy if necessary to cover completely.  Seal the jar with the lid and store in a cool place for at least 1 month.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  Kirby cucumbers -- cut 1/2" slices
  1                     onion -- sliced very thin
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  2               cups  ice cubes
  1                cup  cider vinegar
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  turmeric
  1         tablespoon  mustard seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  celery seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne -- or to taste

In a large bowl combine the cucumbers and onion, sprinkle with salt, and toss well.  Add the ice cubes and chill, covered, overnight.

Drain the mixture in a colander and rinse under cold water.  In a saucepan bring the remaining ingredients to a boil, stirring.  Add the cucumbers and onions and bring to just a simmer, stirring.  Transfer to a bowl and cool.  Chill the pickles, covered, for 24 hours.

The pickles can be made 1 week ahead and kept refrigerated, covered.  Or, spoon the hot pickles into sterilized 1-pint Mason-type jars, filling the jars to within 1/2-inch of the top.  Seal with the lids.

Put the jars on a rack in a kettle and pour in enough hot water to cover them by 2 inches.  Bring to a boil and cook, covered, for 10 minutes.  Transfer the jars with tongs to a rack and cool.  Store in a cool, dark, dry place.

This recipe yields about 4 pints.

Drain the mixture in a colander and rinse under cold water.  In a saucepan bring the remaining ingredients to a boil, stirring.  Add the cucumbers and onions and bring to just a simmer, stirring.  Transfer to a bowl and cool.  Chill the pickles, covered, for 24 hours.

Put the jars on a rack in a kettle and pour in enough hot water to cover them by 2 inches.  Bring to a boil and cook, covered, for 10 minutes.  Transfer the jars with tongs to a rack and cool.  Store in a cool, dark, dry place.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  vegetable oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  2                     Spanish chorizo links - (spicy
                        dried pork sausage; 6 to 8 oz) -- ground
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1              pound  boiling potatoes such as Yukon Gold -- peeled and shredded
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     jalapeÒos, seeded, chopped fine
  2                     plum tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
     1/3           cup  grated queso blanco or Monterey Jack
  8                     frozen empanada or turnover wrappers -- thawed
                        === ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
                        Bottled or homemade salsa verde
                        Sour cream

Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking, then sautÈ chorizo and onion, stirring, until onion is softened.  Add potatoes with salt and pepper to taste and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until potatoes begin to turn golden brown, about 6 minutes.  Stir in jalapeÒos, tomatoes, and cumin and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender and golden brown, about 6 minutes.

Transfer to a bowl and cool completely.  Stir in cilantro, cheese, and salt and pepper to taste.  Roll out each empanada wrapper into a 6-inch round on a lightly floured surface.  Put about 1/3 cup filling in center of each wrapper and form filling into a log.  Moisten wrapper edges with a finger dipped in water and fold each wrapper over filling to form a half-moon.  Press down around filling to force out air and seal by pressing edges together firmly with a fork.

Heat remaining 3 cups oil in a deep 12-inch skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then fry empanadas in 3 batches, gently turning, until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Transfer empanadas to paper towels to drain.  Empanadas may be filled 1 day ahead and chilled in 1 layer on a lightly floured plate, covered.  Reseal edges if necessary.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TUNA MIXTURE ===
     1/4           cup  minced yellow onion
  3        tablespoons  butter
  6        tablespoons  flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                can  chicken broth - (10 3/4 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  1                can  tuna - (6 oz) -- drained and flaked
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  sour-cream
     1/3           cup  minced drained canned pimientos
                        === CHEESE SWIRL BISCUITS ===
  2               cups  sifted flour
  3          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4                vegetable shortening
     2/3           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  shredded sharp Cheddar or American cheese
                        === GREEN PEAS AND MINT ===
  1                     box frozen peas
  2         tablespoon  butter
  1           teaspoon  dried mint

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Lightly butter 1 1/2- to 2-quart casserole and set aside.

Tuna Mixture:  Stir-fry onion in butter in a large heavy skillet over moderate heat, until lightly browned, about 5 to 8 minutes.  Blend in flour and salt, then broth.  Add milk and heat, stirring constantly until thickened and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes.  Mix in tuna, sour-cream, pimiento and lemon juice; set off heat, but keep warm.

Cheese Swirl Biscuits:  Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together into a large mixing bowl.  Add shortening and cut in with pastry blender until texture of coarse meal.  Add milk and fork briskly to make soft dough.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 12- by 8- by 1/4-inch rectangle.  Scatter cheese evenly on top, then jelly-roll style, starting from short end, to form roll 8 inches long.  With floured sharp knife, slice 1-inch thick.

Spoon tuna mixture into casserole.  Space biscuits evenly on top, arranging so spiral designs show.  Bake, uncovered, until biscuits puff and brown slightly, about 20 minutes.

In a saucepan with 1/2 cup boiling water add frozen peas, follow directions on the back of package.  Drain.  In a glass bowl, toss peas, with butter and dried mint.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg -- beaten to blend
     1/2           cup  dry breadcrumbs
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- melted
                        === MUSHROOM SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- sliced
     1/4           cup  dry white wine

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  chicken - (abt 3 lbs) -- cut into parts
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- seasoned with
                        salt and pepper to taste
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  4                     leeks, white and pale green parts only -- sliced thin
                        crosswise, and washed thoroughly
  4                     shallots -- sliced thin
  4                     carrots -- peeled, halved
                        lengthwise, and sliced
  2                     celery ribs with leaves -- sliced
  1              small  bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme -- crumbled
  3               cups  low-salt chicken broth
     1/2           cup  apple cider or juice
                        === FOR DUMPLINGS ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh dill
  1                cup  half-and-half -- plus
  3        tablespoons  half-and-half

Dredge chicken parts in seasoned flour, shaking off excess, and put on a rack.  In a large heavy kettle melt butter with oil over moderately-high heat until foam subsides and brown chicken in batches (do not crowd,) transferring it to a plate as done, about 5 minutes on each side.

Stir in leeks and shallots and cook 3 minutes, scraping the bottom and stirring occasionally.  Stir in carrots, celery, bay leaf, and thyme and cook 3 minutes.  Stir in broth, cider, and chicken and bring liquid to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered partially, until chicken is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes.

For the dumplings, in a bowl sift together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt and stir in dill.  With a fork stir in half-and-half until dough is just blended.  With a large soup spoon scoop out 12 dumplings and arrange over chicken mixture.  Simmer chicken and dumplings, covered, 12 minutes.  (Dumplings are done when a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.)

Discard bay leaf.  Serve with a green salad.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                     Chilled Lemon Grass-Tomato Soup

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     fresh lemon grass stalks -- see * Note
  6               cups  Tomato Water -- (see below)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  unflavored gelatin
  1              slice  watermelon 1" thick
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh chives
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh mint leaves
                        === TOMATO WATER ===
  4             pounds  vine-ripened red tomatoes - (abt 10 med)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  kosher salt
  2             pieces  cheesecloth, each 18" square

* Note:  Available at Southeast Asian markets and some specialty foods shops.

For the Tomato Water:  Rinse tomatoes well under running water and quarter.  In a food processor puree tomatoes with salt until smooth.  Line a large sieve set over a tall nonreactive kettle with cheesecloth and carefully pour tomato puree into center of cheesecloth.  Gather sides of cheesecloth up over puree to form a large sack and, without squeezing puree, gently gather together upper thirds of cheesecloth to form a neck.

Carefully tie neck securely with kitchen string.  Tie sack to a wooden spoon longer than diameter of kettle and remove sieve.  Put spoon across top of kettle, suspending sack inside kettle and leaving enough room underneath sack so that it will not sit in tomato water that accumulates.  Let sack hang in refrigerator at least 8 hours. Without squeezing sack, discard it and its contents and transfer tomato water to a bowl.  Tomato water keeps, covered and chilled, 4 days.  (Makes about 6 cups)

Discard 1 or 2 outer leaves of lemon grass and trim root ends.  Finely chop enough lemon grass from lower 6 inches of stalks to measure 1/4 cup total.

In a small saucepan combine lemon grass and 1 cup tomato water and simmer uncovered, 10 minutes.  Pour mixture through a fine sieve into another small saucepan, discarding solids, and stir in gelatin.  Heat mixture over low heat, stirring until gelatin is dissolved.

In a large bowl stir gelatin mixture into remaining 5 cups tomato water.  Chill tomato-water mixture, covered, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.

Discard rind and seeds from watermelon and finely chop enough fruit to measure 3/4 cup.  Divide soup among 6 bowls and just before serving add watermelon, chives, and mint.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPONGE MOONS ===
                        Butter -- to grease
                        baking sheet and parchment or foil
  4              large  eggs -- separated
  10       tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  4        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === BANANA FILLING ===
  1                cup  well-chilled heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  banana liqueur
  2              large  bananas -- cut into 24 slices,
                        reserving 8 slices for garnish
                        === CHOCOLATE SAUCE ===
  6             ounces  melted chocolate
  2             ounces  heavy cream
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting
                        the desserts
  4                     mint sprigs -- if desired

For the sponge moons, line a buttered baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper or foil and butter the paper.  In a small bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are foamy, add gradually 6 tablespoons of the sugar, beating, and beat the whites until they just hold stiff peaks.

In another bowl whisk together the egg yolks and the remaining 4 tablespoons sugar until the mixture is combined well.  Fold the whites in the yolk mixture, sift together the cocoa powder, the flour, and the salt over the mixture, and fold the mixture together gently but thoroughly.

Divide the mixture into mounds spaced well apart on the prepared baking sheet and with a rubber spatula spread the mounds carefully, forming 4 (6-inch rounds).  Bake the rounds in a preheated 400 degree oven for 5 minutes, or until they are springy to the touch, let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, and transfer them with a metal spatula to a rack.

While they are still warm drape the sponge rounds over 2 rolling pins suspended between 2 inverted mugs and let them cool completely.

Make the filling while the sponge moons are cooling:  In a well-chilled bowl with an electric mixer beat the cream, with the banana liqueur, until the mixture just holds stiff peaks, and transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.

For the chocolate sauce, combine melted chocolate with heavy cream and mix well.

Put each sponge moon on a dessert plate, arrange banana slices inside each one, sauce the top of the flips chocolate, and pipe the flavored whipped cream decoratively over the bananas.  (Alternatively, the whipped cream may be spooned over the bananas.)  Dust the filled moons with the confectionersí sugar and garnish each dessert with 4 of the reserved banana slices and a mint sprig.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  mandarin-orange-flavored vodka
     1/2         ounce  orange liqueur
  1              ounce  Roseís lime juice

Place about 10 ice cubes in a plastic bag with a zipper-like closure.  With a mallet, a rolling pin or the handle of a large knife, crack the ice into coarse pieces.  Transfer them to the bowl of a food processor.  Pulse until ice is finely shaved, but not powdery.  Transfer it to a chilled bowl.

Working with your hands, gently gather ice shavings and shape into a 2 to 4-inch ball, depending on size of serving glass.  Do not pack the ice too tightly.  Place ball in a chilled glass.

Fill a cocktail shaker one-third of the way up with crushed ice.  Add vodka, orange liqueur, lime juice and cranberry juice.  Shake well and strain liquid over the snowball.  Garnish with the lemon or lime twist and serve with a spoon.

This recipe yields 2 drinks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fingerling potatoes and
                        purple and red potatoes
  4        tablespoons  cider vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped fresh mixed herbs
  1 1/2                 shallots -- coarsely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon zest

Cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1-inch, then simmer until just tender, 10 to 15 minutes.  (Potatoes will continue to cook after draining; do not overcook or they will break apart.)

Drain potatoes and rinse under cold water until slightly cooled.  Halve lengthwise and while still warm gently toss with 1 tablespoon vinegar.  Cool potatoes to room temperature, then season with salt and pepper.

While potatoes cook, in a food processor pulse mixed herbs, shallots, garlic until finely chopped.  Add oil, zest and remaining 3 tablespoons vinegar in a food processor until finely chopped.

Toss potatoes with herb dressing.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  strained pureed fresh or frozen raspberrie -- plus
  6              whole  raspberries - (to 8) -- for garnish
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  eau-de-vie de framboise (raspberry brandy)
     2/3           cup  sugar -- plus
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  4                     egg whites -- at room temperature
  1              pinch  salt
  1 2/3           cups  well-chilled heavy cream

Brush a 6-inch wide doubled band of waxed paper or foil long enough to fit around a soufflÈ dish with flavorless vegetable oil and fit the dish with a collar extending 3 inches above the rim.  Secure it with string or tape.

In a bowl combine the raspberry puree, lemon juice and the framboise.  In a small heavy saucepan combine the 2/3 cup sugar with the water, bring the mixture to a boil, gently swirling the pan and washing down any sugar crystals clinging to the sides of the pan with the brush dipped in cold water, and boil the syrup until it reaches the soft-ball stage, or the candy thermometer reaches 238 degrees.

In the bowl of the upright mixer beat the egg whites with the salt until they hold stiff peaks.  With the mixer running, add the sugar syrup in a stream and beat the egg whites until cool.

In a chilled bowl with the hand-held mixer, beat the cream with the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar until it holds soft peaks.  Fold the whites into the raspberry puree gently but thoroughly and fold in the whipped cream.  Spoon the mixture into the prepared dish, smooth the top and freeze it for at least 6 hours, or overnight.

Before serving, remove the waxed paper collar carefully and garnish the top of the soufflÈ with the remaining raspberries.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  onion -- chopped coarse
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     red bell peppers -- roasted (procedure f
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     flour tortillas - (9" to 10" dia)
  4 1/2          ounce  log soft mild goat cheese (Montrachet) -- cut into 4 pieces,
                        at room temperature
     1/4           cup  prepared basil pesto -- available at
                        specialty food shops and many supermarkets
  1              small  onion -- sliced thin
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened

Make sauce:  In a skillet cook onion and garlic in 1 tablespoon oil over moderate heat, stirring, until softened.  Transfer onion mixture to a food processor and add roasted peppers, basil, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, and salt and pepper to taste.  Blend sauce until smooth and transfer to a small bowl.  (Sauce may be made up to 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.)

Put 1 tortilla on a work surface and spread with 1 goat cheese piece, covering surface evenly.  Spread 1 tablespoon pesto over goat cheese and cover with one fourth of onion.  Repeat layering in the same manner, ending with a tortilla and gently pressing layers together.  Make 1 more layered quesadilla with the remaining tortillas, goat cheese, pesto, and onion.  Spread top and bottom of each quesadilla with 1/2 tablespoon butter.

Heat a griddle or well-seasoned 10-inch cast iron skillet over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Cook quesadilla, 1 at a time, gently pressing down with a metal spatula, until golden, about 4 minutes on each side.  Cut each quesadilla into 8 wedges and serve warm with roasted red pepper sauce.

To Roast Peppers:  Using a long-handled fork, char peppers over an open flame or on a rack set over an electric burner, turning them, until skins are blackened, 4 to 6 minutes.  (Or broil peppers on a rack of a broiler about 2 inches from heat, turning them every 5 minutes, 15 to 20 minutes, or until skins are blistered and charred.)  Transfer peppers to a bowl and let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle.  Keeping peppers whole, peel them, starting at blossom end.  Cut off pepper tops and discard seeds and ribs.

Make sauce:  In a skillet cook onion and garlic in 1 tablespoon oil over moderate heat, stirring, until softened.  Transfer onion mixture to a food processor and add roasted peppers, basil, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, and salt and pepper to taste.  Blend sauce until smooth and transfer to a small bowl.  (Sauce may be made up to 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put 1 tortilla on a work surface and spread with 1 goat cheese piece, covering surface evenly.  Spread 1 tablespoon pesto over goat cheese and cover with one fourth of onion.  Repeat layering in the same manner, ending with a tortilla and gently pressing layers together.  Make 1 more layered quesadilla with the remaining tortillas, goat cheese, pesto, and onion.  Spread top and bottom of each quesadilla with 1/2 tablespoon butter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a griddle or well-seasoned 10-inch cast iron skillet over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Cook quesadilla, 1 at a time, gently pressing down with a metal spatula, until golden, about 4 minutes on each side.  Cut each quesadilla into 8 wedges and serve warm with roasted red pepper sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To Roast Peppers:  Using a long-handled fork, char peppers over an open flame or on a rack set over an electric burner, turning them, until skins are blackened, 4 to 6 minutes.  (Or broil peppers on a rack of a broiler about 2 inches from heat, turning them every 5 minutes, 15 to 20 minutes, or until skins are blistered and charred.)  Transfer peppers to a bowl and let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle.  Keeping peppers whole, peel them, starting at blossom end.  Cut off pepper tops and discard seeds and ribs.

  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cans  chick-peas - (19 oz ea) -- drained, rinsed
     2/3           cup  well-stirred tahini

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RASPBERRY-BLUEBERRY SAUCE ===
  2               cups  fresh or unsweetened frozen raspberries
     1/3           cup  raspberries preserves or jam
     1/3           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1                cup  fresh or frozen blueberries -- (small berries
                        work better here)
                        === LEMON-VANILLA ANGEL FOOD CAKE ===
  1 1/2           cups  egg whites
                        Butter to grease pan -- (if using a pan
                        without a removable bottom)
  1                cup  all-purpose flour or 1 1/4 cups cake flour
  1                cup  granulated sugar, or 2 cups confectionersí
                        sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cream of tartar
  3        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Confectionersí sugar -- (optional)

For the raspberry sauce, mix 1 cup of the raspberries, the preserves, water, and the sugar in a medium-size heavy saucepan (not uncoated aluminum).  Bring to a boil over moderately-high heat, mashing the raspberries with a wooden spoon.  Boil 1 minute.  Remove from the heat.

Strain the raspberry mixture through a fine strainer suspended over a bowl, pressing down on raspberries to release the juices.  Discard the seeds.  Stir the blueberries and the remaining 1 cup raspberries into the hot raspberry syrup.  Cover and let stand until cool.  Refrigerate until ready to use.  (Makes 2 cups)

For the cake, check that one rack is in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 325 degrees.  Pour the egg whites into the bowl in which you will be making the batter.

Prepare a 10- by 4-inch tube pan or 9- to 10-inch round cake pan with sides at least 3 inches high (a removable bottom is helpful).  If the pan has a removable bottom, do nothing to it.  If it does not, lightly butter the bottom.  Line the bottom with waxed paper or parchment paper cut to fit, and lightly butter the paper.

Thoroughly mix the flour and 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar or 1/2 cup of the confectionersí sugar in a small bowl.  Have all the ingredients and tools at hand.

Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium speed for about 2 minutes, until frothy and well broken up.  Add the cream of tartar and increase the speed to medium-high.  Beat until the whites lose their yellow cast, greatly increase in volume, and start to turn white.

With the mixer running, slowly sprinkle the remaining 3/4 cup sugar over the whites.  Beat until the whites become very thick, very glossy, and white, and the beaters leave a deep trail.  Depending on the mixer, this need take only about 3 minutes total.  Beat in the lemon juice and vanilla, just enough to mix.

Reduce the speed to the lowest possible.  Quickly sprinkle the flour sugar-mixture over the whites.  As soon as it is all added, but not completely mixed in, stop the machine and remove the bowl.  With a rubber spatula or a large metal spoon, complete mixing in the flour by folding or gently stirring.  Stop just as soon as the flour seems blended in.

With a rubber spatula, scrape the batter (9 cups) into the pan and spread evenly.  Inscribe a circle deep in the batter to release any large air bubbles.  Bake until no moist patches remain in the surface cracks, the cake springs back when touched, and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes for a 10- by 3-inch pan, 1 hour for a tube pan.

Turn the pan upside down on a wire rack.  Let cool completely.  Loosen the edges (and tube) with a knife.  Turn out the cake, loosen and remove the pan bottom, or peel off the paper.  Store airtight 1 day at room temperature before serving or freezing.

When serving, top cake with sauce and confectionersísugar, if you wish.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              small  onions -- chopped fine
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  turmeric
     1/2      teaspoon  dried hot red pepper flakes
  4          teaspoons  tomato paste
  3               cups  chicken broth
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/2         pound  merguez -- cut in half
  2                     carrots -- cut diagonally
                        into 1/2" thick slices
  2                     turnips -- peeled, and cut
                        into 1 1/2"-thick wedges
  1                     cinnamon stick - (2" to 3" long)
  1                     bay leaf
  1                cup  canned chick-peas -- rinsed well,
                        and drained
  1 1/2           cups  couscous

In a heavy saucepan cook the onion in 1 tablespoon of the butter over moderately-low heat, stirring, until it is softened, add the turmeric, and the red pepper flakes, and cook the mixture, stirring for 1 minute.  Stir in the tomato paste, the broth, the water, the merguez, the carrot, the turnip, the cinnamon stick, and the bay leaf and simmer the mixture, covered, for 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.  Add the chick-peas and simmer the mixture for 5 minutes. 

Strain 1 cup of the cooking liquid into a small saucepan, add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, and bring the mixture to a boil.  Stir in the couscous, remove the pan from the heat, and let the mixture stand, covered, for 5 minutes.  Fluff the couscous with a fork, divide it between 2 plates, and make a well in the center of each serving. 

Transfer the meat and vegetables with a slotted spoon to the wells and serve the remaining cooking broth separately to moisten the dish as desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUMB CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  finely-ground graham crackers or cookies
                        such as chocolate or vanilla wafers or
                        gingersnaps - (abt 5 oz)
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, plus
                        butter to grease springform pan
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        === FILLING ===
  2             pounds  cream cheese
  1                cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  4                     eggs

For the crust, stir together crust ingredients and press onto bottom and 1-inch up side of a buttered 24-centemeter springform pan.  Fill immediately or chill up to 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  For the filling, use your mixers lowest speed.  Using a paddle attachment, if your mixer has one, beat the cream cheese smooth, no more than 30 seconds.  Stop the mixer and scrape the bowl and beater (or paddle).  Add the sugar in a stream, mixing for no more than 30 seconds.  Stop and scrape.  Add the vanilla, lemon juice, and 1 egg at a time; mix only until absorbed, no more than 30 seconds each.  Stop and scrape after each addition.

Wrap aluminum foil around the bottom of the springform pan so it comes at least 1-inch up the sides.  Pour the filling into the pan over the crust.  Place the pan in a jelly-roll or roasting pan and pour warm water into the pan to a depth of 1/2-inch.

Bake cheesecake for about 60 minutes, or until lightly colored and firm except for the very center.  Remove from the pan of hot water.

Remove the foil and cool completely on a rack.  Wrap the cheesecake in plastic or foil and chill overnight before unmolding.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  broccoli, cut florets
  2              small  yellow squash
  4                     asparagus spears - (abt 5" long ea)
  1 1/2           cups  trimmed green beans in 1" lengths
                        Salt -- to taste
     3/4           cup  fresh or frozen peas
     1/2           cup  snow peas
  1         tablespoon  peanut, vegetable or corn oil
  2               cups  thinly-sliced mushrooms
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  chopped hot fresh red or green chillies
                        (or abt 1/2 tspn dried red pepper flakes)
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped parsley
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  3                     tomatoes -- cubed
     1/4           cup  fresh basil leaves -- julienned
  1              pound  fresh fettucine
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  fresh or canned chicken broth
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     2/3           cup  Parmesan cheese
     1/2           cup  pine nuts

Trim the broccoli and break it into bite-size florets.  Set aside.

Trim off and discard the ends of the yellow squash but do not peel.  Cut the squash into quarters.  Cut each quarter into 1-inch or slightly longer lengths.  There should be about 1 1/2 cups, no more.  Set aside.

Cut each asparagus spear into thirds.  Set aside.

Cook each of the green vegetables separately in boiling salted water to cover.  The essential thing is to cook each vegetable so that it remains crisp-tender.  Cook the broccoli, squash, green beans, and asparagus for about 5 minutes.  Drain well, run under cold water to chill, and drain thoroughly.  Combine them in a mixing bowl.

Cook the peas and snow peas for about minute if fresh, or 30 seconds if frozen.  Drain, chill, and drain again.  Combine them in a mixing bowl.

Heat the peanut oil in a skillet and add the mushrooms.  Add salt and pepper to taste, shaking the skillet and stirring.  Cook for about 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms to the vegetables.  Add the chopped chilies and parsley.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a saucepan and add half the garlic, the tomatoes, salt, and pepper to taste.  Cook for about 4 minutes, stirring gently so as not to break up the tomatoes more than is essential.  Add the basil, stir and set aside.

Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet and add the remaining garlic and the vegetable mixture.  Cook, stirring gently, just to heat through.

Drop the spaghetti into boiling salted water.  Cook until al dente.  The spaghetti when ready must retain just a slight resilience in the center.  Drain well.

Melt the butter in a utensil large enough to hold the drained spaghetti and vegetables.  Add the chicken broth, 1/2 cup cream, and cheese, stirring constantly.  Cook gently on and off the heat until smooth.

Add the spaghetti and toss quickly to blend.  Add half the vegetables and pour in the liquid from the tomatoes, tossing and stirring over very low heat.

Add the remaining vegetables and, if the sauce seems too dry, add about 1/4 cup more cream.  The sauce should not be soupy.  Add the pine nuts and give the mixture one final tossing.

Serve equal portions of the spaghetti bowls.  Spoon equal amounts of the tomatoes over each serving.  Serve immediately.  Four portions will serve as a main course; six to eight as an appetizer.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

                        === FOR THE TOPPING ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- softened

                        === FOR THE CAKE ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
     2/3           cup  granulated sugar
  2              large  eggs

     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3              large  peaches - (abt 1 1/4 lbs) -- sliced thin

Beat the batter until it is just combined and spread it evenly in the pan.  Arrange the peach slices in slightly overlapping rows over the batter, sprinkle the topping over them, and bake the cake in the middle of the oven for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until a tester comes out clean.

Serve the cake warm or at room temperature.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CAKE ===
     1/2         pound  dark sweet chocolate -- broken into bits
     1/4           cup  strong brewed coffee -- cold
  7              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  sugar
  7              large  egg whites -- at room temperature
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
                        === FOR THE PRALINE POWDER ===
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
     1/4           cup  water
  1                cup  blanched whole almonds
  1              quart  vanilla ice cream -- softened slightly
  1                cup  well-chilled heavy cream
  3        tablespoons  confectionersí sugar
                        === FOR THE CARAMEL CUTOUTS ===
                        Flavorless vegetable spray -- for coating the
                        cookie cutters and jelly-roll pan
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
     1/4           cup  water

To make the cake:  Butter a jelly-roll pan (15 1/2- by 10 1/2- by 1-inch), line it with wax paper and butter the paper.  In the top of a double broiler set over hot water, stir the chocolate with the coffee until it is just melted and let the mixture cool.

In a bowl using an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks until they are combined, beat in 1/2 cup of the sugar, a little at a time, and beat the mixture until it ribbons when the beater is lifted.

In another bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the salt until they are frothy.  Add the cream of tartar and beat the whites until they hold soft peaks.  Beat in the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, a little at a time, and beat the whites until they hold stiff peaks.

Add the chocolate mixture to the egg yolk mixture and combine well.  Stir in 1/4 of the whites and fold in the remaining whites gently but thoroughly.  Spoon the batter into the pan, spread it evenly with a spatula and bake the cake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean.

Transfer the pan to a rack and let the cake cool completely, covered with dampened paper towels.  Remove the towels and run a knife around the sides of the pan to release the waxed paper.  Cover the top of the cake with waxed paper and a baking sheet, invert the cake onto the baking sheet and peel off the waxed paper on top.

To make the praline powder:  In a heavy saucepan bring to a boil the sugar with the cream of tartar and water over moderately-high heat, stirring and washing down any sugar crystals clinging to the sides of the pan with a brush dipped in cold water.  Cook the syrup over high heat without stirring, swirling the pan until it is a light caramel.  Add the almonds and swirl the pan until the nuts are coated with the caramel and begin to make a popping sound.

Pour the mixture onto an oiled marble surface or jelly-roll pan and let cool until it is hard.  Transfer the praline to a cutting board, chop it coarse and use a food processor or blender to pulverize it in batches.  Store the praline powder in an airtight container.

In a bowl, using an electric mixer, beat 1 1/2 cups of the praline powder with the ice cream until it is just soft enough to spread, and spread it over the cake, leaving a 1-inch border.  Starting with a long side, roll up the cake jelly roll fashion, lifting it with the waxed paper and finishing with the seam side down.  Transfer it to a platter and freeze it for at least 2 hours, or until the ice cream is frozen.

In a chilled bowl, beat the cream with the confectionersí sugar until it just holds soft peaks.  Spoon 3/4 of it into a pastry bag fitted with a ribbon tip and pipe it over the cake.  Spoon the remaining cream to a pastry bag with a 1/4-inch plain round tip and pipe it onto the ends of the cake.  Or spread all the cream over the cake with a spatula.  Freeze the cake for 1 hour more.  Sprinkle the cake with the remaining 1/2 cup praline powder and garnish it with the caramel cutouts, if desired.

To make the caramel cutouts:  Coat 6 metal "open" cookie cutters with the oil and arrange them 2 inches apart on a well-oiled jelly-roll pan.  In a heavy saucepan bring to a boil the sugar with the cream of tartar and the water over moderately-high heat, stirring and washing down any sugar crystals clinging to the sides of the pan with a brush dipped in cold water.  Cook the syrup over high heat without stirring, swirling the pan, until the syrup is caramel-colored.  Let it cool for 1 minute and spoon enough of it carefully into each cookie cutter to measure 1/8-inch.  Let the cutouts cool until they are hard and release them from the pan and cutters with the tip of a knife.  Arrange them fancifully on the ice cream log.

                        and oven dried (procedure follows)
  2                     eggplants - (ea 1 lb and abt 4" dia)
                        Olive oil

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

  2             medium  red onions -- peeled, and
                        cut into 8 rounds
  4              small  red bell peppers -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and cut into quarters
  2              large  Portobello mushrooms -- black gills removed,

  4             sprigs  rosemary -- made into spears

For the Black Olive Dressing, combine all ingredients and allow to sit for at least 2 hours, covered and refrigerated, for flavors to develop.

For the poached garlic in the basil puree, place unpeeled garlic cloves in a small saucepan and cover by 1-inch of cold water.  Bring to a boil, drain and repeat process 2 more times.  Remove husk from garlic, chop.

For the Basil Puree, blanch the basil in lightly salted boiling water for about 5 seconds.  Remove and immediately plunge into ice water to stop the cooking and set the color.  Drain well, squeeze dry and chop.  Add to a blender along with poached garlic, olive oil, pine nuts and enough stock to make a smooth puree.  Store in refrigerator.

To oven dry tomatoes for napoleons, cut tomatoes in half and remove stems.  With your fingers gently squeeze and remove the seeds.  Lightly oil a baking sheet, place tomatoes and season lightly with sea salt and freshly ground pepper.  Place in a preheated 225 degree oven for 3 to 4 hours or until tomatoes are somewhat shriveled and have the faintest bit of color on them.

For the Napoleons, slice the eggplants into 12 (1/2-inch) thick rounds and generously paint both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Place in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast in a preheated 400 degree oven until cooked through and lightly browned, about 10 minutes.  Set aside.

Oil, season and roast remaining vegetables in the same manner and set aside.  Be sure not to overcook, vegetables should still have some texture.

To assemble the napoleons, on a lightly oiled baking sheet start with a round of eggplant and top with slices of zucchini, onions, peppers, mushrooms and oven dried tomatoes and cheese.  Repeat the layers, ending with an eggplant slice for each napoleon.  Place a rosemary spear in the center of each napoleon to hold it together.

To serve, Place baking sheet with napoleons in a preheated 375 degree oven for a few minutes to warm through and barely melt cheese.  Place on warm plates and spoon the black olive dressing around.  Top with drops of the reduced Balsamic vinegar, fresh basil puree and garnish with herb sprigs.  Serve immediately.

     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  2          teaspoons  olive oil

Leave tomatoes halved.

Onions and Mushrooms:  Prepare grill.  Brush onions and portobellos with olive oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill until soft.  Slice mushrooms into 1/2-inch slices.

Salad:  Whisk together dressing ingredients.  Toss with grilled vegetables.  Garnish with sprigs of rosemary or fresh basil leaves.  Serve with a hot, crusty loaf of peasant bread.

                        === FOR THE PEPPER SOUP ===

     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme -- crumbled

  6                     yellow bell peppers -- roasted, and
                        chopped coarse
  1 1/2           cups  low-salt chicken broth -- plus additional
                        to thin the soup
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
                        Fresh lemon juice -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE TOMATO SOUP ===
  3             pounds  plum tomatoes -- quartered lengthwise
  3              large  garlic cloves -- unpeeled
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped shallot
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
  1 1/2           cups  low-salt chicken broth -- plus additional
                        to thin the soup
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
                        Fresh lemon juice -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE CREAM ===
  3                     serrano chilies or jalapeÒos -- seeded, chopped fine
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced, and
                        mashed to a paste with
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  crËme fraiche or sour cream

To roast the peppers:  Using a long-handled fork, char the peppers over an open flame, turning them for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the skins are blackened.  Transfer the peppers to a bowl and let them steam, covered, until they are cool enough to handle.  Keeping the peppers whole, peel them starting at the blossom end, cut off the tops and discard the seeds and ribs.

Make the pepper soup:  In a heavy saucepan cook the shallot, thyme, salt and pepper to taste in the butter over moderately-low heat, stirring until the shallot is soft.  Add the bell peppers and 1 1/2 cups of the broth and simmer the mixture, covered, for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the peppers are very soft.

In a blender puree the soup in batches until it is very smooth, forcing it as it is pureed through a fine sieve set over the pan.  Then whisk in the cream, enough of the additional broth to reach the desired consistency, the lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste.  The soup may be made 1 day in advance, kept covered and chilled, and reheated.

Make the tomato soup:  Spread the tomatoes, skin-side down, in 1 layer in 2 foil-lined jelly-roll pans.  Add the garlic to one of the pans and bake the tomatoes and garlic in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the tomatoes are very soft and their skin is dark brown.  Let the tomatoes and the garlic cool in the pans on racks.

In a heavy saucepan cook the shallot, the oregano, salt and pepper to taste in the butter over moderately-low heat, stirring until the shallot is soft.  Add the tomatoes, garlic (skins discarded) and 1 1/2 cups of the broth and simmer the mixture, covered for 15 minutes.

In a blender puree the soup in batches until it is very smooth, forcing it as it is pureed through a fine sieve set over the pan.  Whisk in the cream, the additional broth, if necessary, the lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste.  The soup may be made 1 day in advance, kept covered and chilled, and reheated.

Make the serrano cream:  In a blender blend together the chilies, the garlic paste, and crËme fraiche, until the mixture is combined well.  Force the mixture through a fine sieve set over a small bowl.  The serrano cream may be made 1 day in advance, kept covered and chilled, and then reheated.

This recipe yields about 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     six-ounce tuna steaks, each 1"-thick
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil -- plus additional
                        oil for brushing
                        Salt -- to season fish
  1         tablespoon  fennel seeds
  1 1/2       teaspoon  black peppercorns
  1             medium  fennel bulb -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1/4" slices
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- quartered, and
                        cut into 1/4" thick slices
  2              large  garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Lightly brush tuna with additional oil and season with salt.  Crush fennel seeds and peppercorns coarse in a mortar with a pestle and press onto both sides of tuna steaks.  Let tuna steaks stand on a plate 10 minutes.

In a heavy non-stick skillet saute fennel bulb in 1 1/2 tablespoons oil over moderately-high heat, stirring until golden.  Add bell pepper and garlic and saute 1 minute.  Add water and simmer vegetables, covered, 10 minutes, or until fennel is tender.  Remove lid and, if necessary, boil mixture until liquid is nearly evaporated.  Add lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste and keep warm.

While fennel mixture is cooking, brush a heavy skillet, preferably cast-iron, with some additional oil and heat over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Saute tuna steaks 2 minutes on each side, or until barely pink in center, for medium meat.

Transfer tuna steaks to plate and spoon fennel-pepper mixture over and around them.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  minced peeled fresh gingerroot
  3        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  medium-dry sherry
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced, and

  1           teaspoon  salt
  2             pounds  salmon steaks

In a bowl whisk together soy sauce, gingerroot, honey, sherry, vinegar and the garlic paste.  Add the salmon and let it marinate in the soy mixture, turning it once, for 5 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Butter or margarine -- as needed
                        Grated Parmesan cheese or bread crumbs -- as needed
  4                     egg yolks
  5                     egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  shredded cheddar cheese
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed, and
                        wrung-out dry

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and dust a 1 1/2-quart souffle dish with grated Parmesan or breadcrumbs.  Separate the eggs.  Put egg whites in mixer bowl with cream of tartar.

To make a white sauce, in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter or margarine until it bubbles.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly until smooth and bubbly.  Stir in milk all at once, then cook and stir until mixture boils and is smooth and thickened.  To flavor the white sauce, stir in the cheese until melted.  Stir in the spinach.  Set aside.

Beat the egg whites only until they cling to the side of the mixing bowl when you roll and tilt it.  Add the yolks to the sauce, and stir.  To fold the sauce into the whites, first mix about a quarter of the whites right into the sauce in the pan, then empty the sauce into the whites in the mixing bowl.  Gingerly but thoroughly fold the sauce into the whites.  Then pour that mixture into the prepared souffle dish.

Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes.  Donít open oven door for at least 30 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  6 1/2         pounds  turkey breast -- boned (technique bel
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme -- crumbled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  sliced baked ham
                        Reserved fillets from boning the breast -- halved lengthwise
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  6               cups  brown stock or canned beef broth
                        Cheesecloth bag containing
  12                    parsley sprigs -- together with
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme -- and also
  1                     bay leaf
  2        tablespoons  arrowroot
  2        tablespoons  Sercial Madeira
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
                        Duchesse Potatoes -- (see recipe)
                        === FOR THE STUFFING ===
  1              pound  finely-ground veal
     1/4         pound  ground fresh pork fat
  3                     eggs
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  minced fresh parsley leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg -- or to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground pepper -- to taste

For the Stuffing: In a food processor blend the veal and the fat.  With the motor running, add the eggs, 1 at a time and combine well.  With the motor still running, add the heavy cream in a stream.  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and add the remaining ingredients.  Chill, covered, for at least 30 minutes.

To Bone A Turkey Breast:  With a sharp knife and your fingers, cut and pull the wishbone from the turkey breast.  Turn skin-side down and, starting at the severed backbone and working toward the ridge of the breastbone, cut the breast meat of half the breast away from the carcass, keeping the knife angled against the bones and pulling the meat away as it is cut.  Turn so the other side of the backbone is facing you and cut away the meat in the same manner.  With the knife angled against the breastbone, sever the meat completely and discard the carcass.  Lay the breast skin-side down.  Remove the fillets, trim off any tendons and sinews and reserve.  Cut the breast to a uniform 1-inch thickness by slicing horizontally into the thicker sections.  Use some of the trimmings to patch any areas where there is little or no meat.  Cover the breast with moistened waxed paper and with a mallet or the flat side of a cleaver pound to flatten slightly.

On a double thickness of cheesecloth arrange the turkey breast skin side-down with a long side facing you.  Sprinkle it with the thyme and salt and pepper to taste.  Smooth half the stuffing over the turkey breast, leaving a 1-inch border.  Cover the stuffing with a layer of the ham, using slightly more than half.  Smooth the remaining over the ham and arrange the remaining ham slices, with the short ends facing you, on the turkey breast.  Center the turkey breast fillets lengthwise on the ham and fold the ham over them.

Beginning with the long side of the breast nearest you, roll it carefully away from you into a cylinder shape.  Tie the ends securely with string.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a roasting pan heat the butter and oil over moderate heat until hot and in it brown the turkey, patted dry.  Add the stock and cheesecloth bag and bring the mixture to a boil.  Braise the ballottine, covered tightly with foil, in the middle of the oven, basting occasionally, for 1 1/2 hours, or until the juices run clear when the breast is pricked with a skewer.  The ballottine can be made 1 day ahead up to this point and kept refrigerated, covered, in the cooking liquid.

To reheat, bring to a boil over moderately-high heat, baste, and heat, covered, in a preheated 350 degree oven, basting frequently for 1 hour.  Transfer the ballottine to a rack to cool.  Unwrap it.

Skim the braising liquid and strain it into a saucepan.  In a small bowl combine the arrowroot, Madeira, and cream.  Bring the strained liquid to a boil and stir in the arrowroot mixture.  Cook the mixture over moderately-high heat until it is thickened slightly.  Keep the sauce warm, covered with a buttered round of waxed paper.  Transfer the ballottine to a carving board and slice half of it into 1/2-inch slices.  Transfer the slices and remaining ballottine to a platter with the Duchesse Potatoes and serve warm with the sauce.

For the Stuffing: In a food processor blend the veal and the fat.  With the motor running, add the eggs, 1 at a time and combine well.  With the motor still running, add the heavy cream in a stream.  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and add the remaining ingredients.  Chill, covered, for at least 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To Bone A Turkey Breast:  With a sharp knife and your fingers, cut and pull the wishbone from the turkey breast.  Turn skin-side down and, starting at the severed backbone and working toward the ridge of the breastbone, cut the breast meat of half the breast away from the carcass, keeping the knife angled against the bones and pulling the meat away as it is cut.  Turn so the other side of the backbone is facing you and cut away the meat in the same manner.  With the knife angled against the breastbone, sever the meat completely and discard the carcass.  Lay the breast skin-side down.  Remove the fillets, trim off any tendons and sinews and reserve.  Cut the breast to a uniform 1-inch thickness by slicing horizontally into the thicker sections.  Use some of the trimmings to patch any areas where there is little or no meat.  Cover the breast with moistened waxed paper and with a mallet or the flat side of a cleaver pound to flatten slightly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On a double thickness of cheesecloth arrange the turkey breast skin side-down with a long side facing you.  Sprinkle it with the thyme and salt and pepper to taste.  Smooth half the stuffing over the turkey breast, leaving a 1-inch border.  Cover the stuffing with a layer of the ham, using slightly more than half.  Smooth the remaining over the ham and arrange the remaining ham slices, with the short ends facing you, on the turkey breast.  Center the turkey breast fillets lengthwise on the ham and fold the ham over them.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beginning with the long side of the breast nearest you, roll it carefully away from you into a cylinder shape.  Tie the ends securely with string.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a roasting pan heat the butter and oil over moderate heat until hot and in it brown the turkey, patted dry.  Add the stock and cheesecloth bag and bring the mixture to a boil.  Braise the ballottine, covered tightly with foil, in the middle of the oven, basting occasionally, for 1 1/2 hours, or until the juices run clear when the breast is pricked with a skewer.  The ballottine can be made 1 day ahead up to this point and kept refrigerated, covered, in the cooking liquid.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To reheat, bring to a boil over moderately-high heat, baste, and heat, covered, in a preheated 350 degree oven, basting frequently for 1 hour.  Transfer the ballottine to a rack to cool.  Unwrap it.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Skim the braising liquid and strain it into a saucepan.  In a small bowl combine the arrowroot, Madeira, and cream.  Bring the strained liquid to a boil and stir in the arrowroot mixture.  Cook the mixture over moderately-high heat until it is thickened slightly.  Keep the sauce warm, covered with a buttered round of waxed paper.  Transfer the ballottine to a carving board and slice half of it into 1/2-inch slices.  Transfer the slices and remaining ballottine to a platter with the Duchesse Potatoes and serve warm with the sauce.
