                              All-'Round Rub

Recipe By     :Cheryl and Bill Jamison
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Rubs
                Spice Blends

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  paprika
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
                        = (or other coarse salt)
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  2          teaspoons  brown sugar - (packed)
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper - (to 2)

Mix the spices in a small bowl.  Store the rub covered in a cool, dark pantry or freezer.

This recipe yields 3/4 cup.

Comments:  Be cautious about using the same spice rubs in grilling that you use in slow smoke cooking.  The lighter, more sprightly savor of grilled food benefits from fresher, subtler seasonings than those often found in traditional barbecue rubs.

We cut back significantly on sugar -- which tends to burn at the much higher grill temperatures -- and on salt, a balancing accent in smoke flavor that can overwhelm the cleaner taste of grilled dishes.

We also avoid bland products such as garlic and onion powder, common in the older rubs, in favor of fresher ingredients that maintain a clear, independent character in the quick cooking process.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
  3 1/2         ounces  white sesame seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  instant dashi powder -- dissolved in
     1/4           cup  hot water
  2        tablespoons  mirin
  2        tablespoons  tamari soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  sake
  3        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1              pinch  crushed red pepper flakes
                        = (or cayenne pepper)
                        === BURGERS ===
  2             pounds  high-quality ground beef chuck
  2                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  freshly-grated ginger
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1                cup  chopped scallions
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
                        === FOR SERVICE ===
  6                     sesame hamburger buns -- toasted
                        Lettuce
                        Sliced tomato
                        Avocado
                        Onions

For dressing, heat a dry skillet on medium heat and toast sesame seeds 3 to 5 minutes, stirring.  When seeds turn golden, remove from heat to prevent scorching.  Place in blender with remaining ingredients and blend until smooth.  Set aside.

By hand, mix ground beef, eggs and seasonings to combine.  Form into six patties, handling meat as little as possible.  Grill patties about 3 minutes per side, or to taste.

Place burgers on buns, garnish with sliced tomato, avocado and onions, and spoon on sesame dressing.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  chopped onions
  1                cup  very strong coffee
  1                cup  Worcestershire sauce
  1                cup  catsup
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  3         tablespoon  chili powder
  1                     habanero pepper -- pureed, including
                        its seeds - see * Note
  4                     garlic cloves -- pressed
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

* Note:  Habanero peppers are the hottest.  If you can't find them in your Mexican foods aisle at the grocery store, or you want less heat you can substitute jalapeÒo peppers.

Combine all ingredients in a sauce pan and simmer for 15 minutes.  Puree in a blender or food processor.

Meanwhile, place 2 pint-sized jars in a large pot of boiling water.  Boil for 15 minutes.  Bring a small pan of water to a simmer and place two canning lids in the water; remove pan from heat.

With tongs remove one jar from boiling water, empty water from jar and fill with barbecue sauce.  Place a canning lid on top and seal with band.  Repeat with other hot jar.

This recipe yields 2 pints.

Comments:  This makes a nice gift when going to someone's house for a barbecue.  It doesn't last very long!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHINESE-MEX PEPPER RUB ===
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns
  2        tablespoons  Sichuan peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  cumin seed
  1         tablespoon  coriander seed
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  1         tablespoon  chili powder -- sweet
     1/2      teaspoon  Chinese five spice powder
  1         tablespoon  sea salt
                        === TACOS ===
  2             pounds  flank steak -- trimmed of all fat
  1                     orange -- sliced thin
  1                     red onion -- sliced thin
  16                    corn tortillas -- warmed
  8                     scallions
  8                     jalapeÒos
  1                     lime -- cut in wedges
  2            bunches  fresh cilantro -- washed
                        Prepared salsa -- for garnish

Make the Chinese-Mex Pepper Rub:  On a hard surface, coarsely crush the peppercorns, cumin and coriander seeds.  Heat a dry saute pan over medium heat.  Add the crushed spices to the pan and toast 3 to 5 minutes, shaking pan.  Add remaining ingredients to the hot mix and toss.  Place in an airtight jar until needed.

Coat the meat with the pepper rub.  Wrap meat tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

A couple of hours before cooking, remove meat from the refrigerator and slice flank steak very thin against the grain.  In a baking dish, put a layer of sliced steak.  Top this with a layer of orange and onion slices.  Repeat the two layers until all of the meat, oranges and onions are layered.  Cover dish and marinate in the refrigerator about two hours.

When ready to cook, light a barbecue.  Place the marinated meat on the grill, sprinkle lightly with salt to taste, and grill meat to desired degree of doneness.

Lightly grill the scallions and jalapeÒos, giving them a squeeze of fresh lime when done, and warm the tortillas on the grill.

To serve, place two slices of beef on half a tortilla, top with a teaspoon of salsa and a few sprigs of cilantro.  Fold tortilla in half and serve with the grilled scallions and jalapeÒos on the side.

This recipe yields 16 tacos.

                Charcoal-Grilled Chicken With Garlic PurÈe

Recipe By     :Alice Waters
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     frying chicken - (abt 3 lbs)
  2                     garlic heads
     1/2        bottle  red wine
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme - (to 3)
                        = (or 1 tspn dried thyme)
  1                cup  virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cut chicken into serving pieces; peel 8 to 10 cloves of garlic and chop roughly.  Marinate chicken in red wine with chopped garlic and thyme for 2 to 4 hours in refrigerator.

Spread remaining cloves of garlic, with skins on, in small baking dish in one layer and cover with olive oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper and bake in preheated 300 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours or until garlic is completely soft.  PurÈe garlic through food mill when done.  Discard skins and reserve purÈe.

About an hour before cooking chicken, remove it from refrigerator.  Prepare a medium-low charcoal fire.  When fire is ready, remove chicken from marinade.  Pat pieces dry, and salt and pepper them.  Cook chicken on grill slowly for about 35 minutes, turning frequently.  Chicken should be nicely browned, but a bit rare and juicy.

Spread garlic purÈe over chicken and heat in a 375 degree oven for 5 minutes.  Serve chicken on a platter with oven-roasted potatoes, garnished with watercress and lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This dish emerged at Chez Panisse's first garlic festival in 1975, celebrating the garlic harvest.  Back then, Waters recalled, garlic was exotic and had been dismissed as a strong-smelling Italian spice.

                        pasilla, or a combination of these)
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar

Mix the spices in a bowl.  (Wear rubber gloves when handling this chile-based rub, or be sure to wash your hands well before touching your eyes or other sensitive body parts.)  Store the rub covered in a cool, dark pantry or freezer.

This recipe yields 3/4 cup.

Comments:  Dry rubs get sticky on the grill.  When you're using one, be sure to oil the cooking grate well to prevent fusion between the food and the metal.  As further insurance, don't move the food during the first minute of grilling, giving the spices time to singe into the surface.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MANGO MAYO ===
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  diced ripe mango
  2          teaspoons  fresh lime juice
                        === BURGERS ===
  1 1/2         pounds  ground pork
  2        tablespoons  sauvignon blanc wine
  2        tablespoons  hot pepper sauce
                        = (such as Tabasco sauce)
     1/4           cup  panko -- see * Note
  4              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  4          teaspoons  minced fresh gingerroot
  4          teaspoons  curry powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
  4                     seeded sandwich rolls -- split
                        Vegetable or olive oil or
                        vegetable cooking spray -- as needed
  4             slices  sweet onion, 1/2" thick
  1              bunch  watercress -- stemmed

* Note:  Panko are long-flaked unseasoned Japanese bread crumbs.  Look for them at Asian markets or in supermarkets with an international foods section.

Prepare a grill (with a cover) for medium-high heat.  Place Mango Mayo ingredients in a blender or food processor and process until smooth.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, combine pork, wine, hot sauce, panko, garlic, gingerroot, curry powder, salt and allspice.  Mix lightly but well.  Shape into 4 patties, formed to fit the rolls.

Brush grill rack with oil.  Place patties onto grill and cook until browned on the bottom, about 4 minutes.  Turn and grill just until done, 5 to 7 minutes more.

While burgers are cooking, place onions on grill and cook until golden brown and crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

During the last minute of cooking time, place rolls cut-side down on the edges of the grill to toast.

Place burgers on bottom halves of rolls and top each with some Mango Mayo, an onion slice and a generous amount of watercress.  Cover with roll tops.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ASIAN SPICE RUB ===
  1         tablespoon  Sichuan peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  fennel seeds
  1              whole  star anise
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  seasoned rice wine vinegar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  seasoned rice wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  hoisin sauce
  1                     garlic clove -- finely minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === DUCK SALAD ===
  2                     fresh plump duck breasts
  1              bunch  fresh watercress -- cleaned, and
                        tough stems removed
  1              bunch  fresh arugula -- cleaned
  1                cup  fresh bean sprouts
  1                     roasted red bell pepper -- cut thin strips
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds -- toasted
                        === SESAME FLATBREAD ===
  1         tablespoon  dry yeast
  2               cups  spring water
  4               cups  all-purpose flour - (to 4 1/2)
                        = (or half bread flour and
                        half all-purpose flour)
  3        tablespoons  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  sea salt - (to 2)
  1         tablespoon  black sesame seeds

For the Asian Spice Rub:  Toast the spices in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant (for about 2 to 3 minutes).  Using either an electric spice grinder or mortar and pestle, grind the spices to a soft powder-like consistency.

For the Vinaigrette:  Combine all ingredients into a glass bowl.  Slowly whisk again before adding to salad greens.

For the Duck Salad:  With a sharp knife, score the duck breasts, cutting only through the fat layer.  Rub each duck breast with 1/2 teaspoon of the spice rub and let set in the refrigerator for 2 hours.

Place duck breast skin-side down in the center of the cooking grate over low heat.  Cook for about 10 minutes.  (Be careful of flare-ups that might occur as the result of fat dripping into the fire.  If this does occur, turn the breasts over.)  If you do not have flare-ups, cook for 10 minutes or to desired degree of doneness.  Remove duck from the grill and allow to rest until cool (do not refrigerate).

When the duck is cool enough to handle, slice duck breasts thinly.  Cover and set aside.

Pour 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette in the bottom of a large bowl.  Toss the duck strips, salad greens, bean sprouts and roasted pepper strips into the bowl and mix well until all ingredients are lightly coated.  Place a generous handful of the salad on each grilled flatbread and garnish with toasted sesame seeds.  Serve immediately.

For the Sesame Flatbread:  Proof the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water.  Add the remaining ingredients, except for black sesame seeds, and mix with a dough hook for 10 minutes.  After 3 minutes of mixing, adjust the consistency if needed to assure a moist satiny dough.

When fully kneaded, shape the dough into a ball, and place it into a lightly oiled bowl, covered with plastic wrap, to rise.  Room temperature is ideal.  Allow the dough to rise until doubled, for about 1 1/2 hours.

Punch the dough down, and cut it into 4 pieces.  Shape or roll each piece of dough into a 10-inch disk about 1/4-inch thick.  Put aside and cover with a damp tea towel while you roll out the remaining disks.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

Grill each flatbread over low heat in the center of the cooking grate.  Turn occasionally to avoid overbrowning.  Grill until flatbreads are brown, but still soft enough to fold.  Top each with the duck salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Add the cabbage salad in a little pile on top of the salmon.  (Try to get the salad to stand up on the salmon.)  Sprinkle the peanuts over the sauce.

Prepare medium-hot fire in grill.  Set grate 4 to 5 inches above glowing coals.  Brush grate with oil just before grilling to help prevent sticking.

Slide lower blade of poultry shears between flesh of tail and top shell of lobster tail.  Keeping shears in middle of shell (there's a sort of channel), cut lengthwise down entire shell leaving about 1/2 inch of flipper uncut.  As you cut, you'll be slicing into about 1/2 inch of flesh as well.

Holding each side of tail with flesh-side facing you, gently but surely, snap sides away from you to butterfly it.  (You may need to cut flesh a little more to butterfly it without tearing, but don't cut all the way through.)  Small, uncut flipper section should stay together, making butterflied tail look like a beautifully marked wigwam.  Now you have a flat side that's perfect for grilling.  Repeat process for other tails.

Rub flesh with oil and season with salt and pepper.  Place tails over glowing coals, flesh-side down.  They should lie perfectly flat.  Grill until flesh is golden, 6 to 7 minutes.  Turn tails over and grill second side until flesh is completely opaque, another 2 to 3 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     yellowfin tuna steaks - (8 to 10 oz ea) -- cut 3" cubes
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  minced gingerroot
                        === MARINADE ===
  2               cups  teriyaki sauce
     1/2           cup  dry sherry
  4        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh ginger
     1/2           cup  chopped scallions
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Juice of 2 lemons

Combine all the marinade ingredients in a bowl large enough to hold the tuna.  Place the tuna steaks in the marinade and refrigerate for 3 hours, turning every hour.

Thirty minutes before cooking, drain the tuna and bring to room temperature.  Preheat outdoor barbecue to very hot.

Brush the tuna with the olive oil.  Grill the steaks for 1 to 2 minutes on each of their six sides.  The outside of the tuna should be nicely charred and the center should be barely warm and quite rare.  Cooked this way, the tuna will remain moist and flavorful.

Top each steak with ginger and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GINGERED PINEAPPLE SAUCE ===
  1                cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1                cup  boiling water
                        Juice from 1 lemon
                        = (or 3 tbspns bottled lemon juice)
  1                can  crushed pineapple - 12 oz) -- strained, and
                        juice reserved for marinade
  2        tablespoons  pickled ginger
                        === TUNA ===
  4                     tuna steaks - (4 to 6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                can  pineapple juice - (6 oz)
                        Reserved juice from pineapple

For the Gingered Pineapple Sauce:  Combine sugar and cornstarch, and mix well.  Slowly add boiling water to the sugar mixture, whisk to dissolve, and put the mixture into a stainless-steel pan.

While whisking, bring the mixture to a boil.  The mixture will thicken and clarify.  Add the crushed pineapple and the lemon juice, stir to incorporate, and then add the slices of pickled ginger.  Heat through and serve warm over fish.  (Makes about 1 pint)

Place the steaks in a shallow glass dish, season to taste, and pour the pineapple juice and the reserved pineapple juice over the fish.  Allow the fish to marinate for 20 minutes, turning over the fish after 10 minutes.

Drain the fish, and spray lightly with a fat-free vegetable spray.  Place the steaks on a hot grill, and allow them to cook for about 3 to 4 minutes.  Without turning the steaks over, turn them 45 degrees, and allow them to cook for another 4 to 5 minutes.  Turn the steaks over, and cook for 5 minutes longer.

Remove from the grill when a knife inserted in the center of the steak reveals no remaining translucence, and the flesh appears opaque.  Serve with the warm gingered pineapple sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PESTO ===
  2              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/2           cup  walnuts
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  fresh basil leaves - (lightly packed)
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus more
                        === SUN-DRIED TOMATO SAUCE ===
  12                    dry-packed sun-dried tomato halves
     1/4           cup  Pesto -- from above
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BUNDLES ===
  8              large  radicchio leaves
  8             ounces  fresh mozzarella -- cut 8 slices
  8                     thin prosciutto slices - (4 to 6 oz)
                        Olive oil -- for brushing
  8             pieces  cotton kitchen string - (8" long)
     1/4           cup  toasted pine nuts -- for garnish

To make Pesto:  With motor running in food processor fitted with steel blade, drop garlic through feed tube to mince it.  Stop machine, add walnuts and salt, and coarsely chop nuts.  Add basil and process until finely chopped.  With machine running, pour olive oil through feed tube and process to a puree.  Use at once, or store in airtight container in refrigerator.  Cover pesto with layer of olive oil to keep color bright green.  (Makes 1 1/2 cups)

To make Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce:  Place tomatoes in a bowl, cover with hot water and let plump for 20 minutes.  Drain and finely chop tomatoes.  Place in a bowl and add 1/4 cup Pesto, oil, vinegar, and salt and pepper.  Blend with whisk or in food processor.  Set aside.

To make bundles:  Prepare a hot fire in a grill.

Place a large pan of water over high heat and bring to boil.  Blanch radicchio by dipping leaves into boiling water for 5 seconds.  Remove with tongs and plunge into bowl of ice water.  When cool, remove leaves and place on paper towels to drain.  They should be limp and pliable.

Wrap each mozzarella slice in a slice of prosciutto.  Wrap bundles with radicchio, enclosing completely.  Secure each bundle with string and brush with oil.  Grill bundles for about 3 minutes each side, or until nicely browned, turning with tongs or a spatula, so as not to pierce them.

Transfer to a heated platter.  Drizzle with sauce and sprinkle with pine nuts.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  canola oil
  6        tablespoons  pine nuts
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                     cucumber -- peeled, seeded,
                        and thinly sliced
  6              small  scallions -- sliced diagonally
  1                     Northern Pike fillet - (3 to 4 lbs)

To grill fish:  When charcoal is gray and hot, lay fish fillets on grate.  Grill for 6 to 8 minutes on each side, or until the fish is tender, flaky and translucent.

To serve:  Season fish with salt and pepper.  Just before serving, squeeze fresh lemon juice over fish.  Ladle cucumber mixture over fish.  Garnish with extra lemon wedges.

                          Grilled Pesto Chicken

Recipe By     :Bob Bowersox
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PESTO ===
  2                     garlic cloves
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  fresh basil leaves - (tightly packed)
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  grated parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  grated romano cheese
  4        tablespoons  butter -- softened
                        === FOR THE CHICKEN ===
  2                     boneless skinless chicken breasts -- (abt 6 to 7 oz ea)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the Pesto:  In a food processor or blender, put the garlic, salt, basil, pine nuts, and olive oil and process until smooth.  Add the cheeses and the butter and process very briefly, just to incorporate them.  If the sauce is a little thick, add a little water a tablespoon at a time and process for 1 to 2 seconds.  Sauce should be thick, but spreadable.

Lay the chicken breasts out on a cutting board or other work surface.  Using a sharp knife, slice the breasts longitudinally, but do not cut all the way through them -- you want to make a kind of pocket in them.

Place several teaspoons of the pesto sauce into the chicken "pocket", and make sure it is spread across the entire interior surface.  Fold the top half back over the pesto.  Rub the outer surface of the breasts with the olive oil, then season to taste with the salt and pepper.

Place the breasts on a pre-heated BBQ grill and cook until done.  If you'd like, you can spread a little of the pesto on the outside of the breasts a minute or two before they are done, just to form a slight crust on the outside.  Serve with extra pesto on the side.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

For the Pesto:  In a food processor or blender, put the garlic, salt, basil, pine nuts, and olive oil and process until smooth.  Add the cheeses and the butter and process very briefly, just to incorporate them.  If the sauce is a little thick, add a little water a tablespoon at a time and process for 1 to 2 seconds.  Sauce should be thick, but spreadable.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lay the chicken breasts out on a cutting board or other work surface.  Using a sharp knife, slice the breasts longitudinally, but do not cut all the way through them -- you want to make a kind of pocket in them.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place several teaspoons of the pesto sauce into the chicken &quot;pocket&quot;, and make sure it is spread across the entire interior surface.  Fold the top half back over the pesto.  Rub the outer surface of the breasts with the olive oil, then season to taste with the salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the breasts on a pre-heated BBQ grill and cook until done.  If you&apos;d like, you can spread a little of the pesto on the outside of the breasts a minute or two before they are done, just to form a slight crust on the outside.  Serve with extra pesto on the side.

Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2             medium  zucchini -- julienned
  2                     red bell peppers -- stemmed, cored,
                        and julienned
     1/2           cup  snipped fresh chives
  4             sprigs  herbs of choice -- for garnish
                        === ROASTED TOMATILLO AND MANGO SALSA ===
  10            medium  tomatillos
  2                     ripe mangoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  3        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  fresh cilantro leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- roasted, peeled,
                        and diced

To roast the tomatillos:  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Wash tomatillos with the husks on.  Transfer to an ovenproof pan or dish large enough so that they do not overlap.  Place on the lower rack of the oven and cook until tender, stirring often, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove and cool.  Peel off the husks and rinse the tomatillos if sticky.  Dice finely.

To prepare the salsa:  In a medium bowl, combine the tomatillos, mangoes, lime juice, olive oil and cilantro.  Season with salt and jalapeÒo pepper to taste.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.

Preheat the grill.  Lay a large piece of plastic wrap on the countertop.  Rub a few drops of cold water across the surface of one chicken breast.  Loosely fold the plastic wrap over the chicken.  Pound with a meat mallet until it is about 1/4-inch thick.  Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts.  Refrigerate until ready to cook.

Season the chicken with salt, pepper and cumin.  Rub the surface of each chicken breast with a few drops of olive oil.  Sear on the grill, about 3 minutes.  Turn over and cook until the desired degree of doneness is reached, about 2 or 3 minutes, depending on the heat of your grill.

Meanwhile, in a nonstick skillet, heat the remaining olive oil over high heat.  Add the zucchini and peppers, cooking until hot and just tender, about 3 or 4 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Toss with half of the chives.

Divide and mound into the center of warm individual serving plates.  Place the chicken breast atop the vegetables.  Drizzle the salsa around the chicken and place a small mound atop the chicken.  Sprinkle with the remaining chives.  Garnish with herbs of choice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                  Grilled Salmon With Basil Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Leslie Revsin

                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  basil leaves - (packed)
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  drained capers
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- plus
  4          teaspoons  olive oil -- divided
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     salmon steaks, 1" thk - (7 oz ea)

Puree parsley, basil, garlic, capers, lemon juice and 1/2 cup olive oil in blender or food processor until very smooth.  (Blender sauce will be smoother.)  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Place in container.  Cover and refrigerate up to 2 days, but color is prettiest when sauce is freshly made.

Prepare medium-hot fire in grill.  Set grate 4 to 5 inches above glowing coals.  Brush grate with oil just before grilling to help prevent sticking.  Dry steaks with paper towels, season with salt and pepper and rub with remaining 4 teaspoons olive oil.  Grill 5 to 6 minutes.  Turn them over and grill 3 to 4 minutes longer.  They should be slightly underdone in center if you like them super-moist.  Place salmon on plates and spoon vinaigrette over top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Grilled onions provide a nice contrast to the salmon.  To grill them, cut in half, brush with oil and place on grill approximately five minutes before you begin the salmon.  They will be ready at the same time as the salmon.

  3                     garlic cloves
  4        tablespoons  pine nuts
     1/4           cup  corn oil
  5        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  5        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed orange juice
                        === SALAD ===
     1/2         pound  fresh arugula -- washed, and
                        dried in a spinner
  1                     small head radicchio -- torn bite size
  2               ears  corn
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SALMON ===
  1              pound  salmon fillet -- scaled, boned
  2        tablespoons  corn oil
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the Pesto:  In a blender jar place the orange juice, lime juice, garlic and Epazote.  Puree until smooth.  Add pine nuts and blend well.  While the blender blades are running, slowly pour in the corn oil in a thin stream until puree mixture is creamy.

For the Salad:  In a bowl of cold water soak the ears of corn, in their husks, for one hour.  After soaking place ears on hot grill, turning with tongs until the husks are well charred.  Remove from the grill and let cool to the touch.  Remove the husk and slice the kernels off of the cob.  Combine corn with other ingredients in a large bowl.  Divide among four chilled dinner plate and set aside.

For the Salmon:  Cut salmon into four equal pieces.  Brush each piece with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Cook on a hot grill for about 3 minutes on each side.  Place on piece of fish on top of the salad on each plate.  Spoon the pesto over the salmon and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Grilling corn can be tricky but smoking and charring the husk right through to the kernels adds a smoky-sweetness by caramelizing the natural sugars in the corn.  It is worth the extra step.  Two tips to make sure you get the best results -- throughly soak the corn before grilling to make sure the kernels stay moist.  And if you don't have time to regularly turn the corn, wrap it in aluminum foil and grab a glass of lemonade while you bask in the sun.  Turn the corn every time you get up for a refill.

                     Grilled Spice-Rubbed Flank Steak

Recipe By     :Ruth Cousineau
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  garlic cloves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated peeled fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1 1/2         pounds  flank steak -- trimmed

Mash garlic and ginger to a paste with salt and spices using a mortar and pestle (or mince and mash with a large knife).  Pat steak dry, then rub paste all over and marinate steak, covered and chilled, at least 8 hours.  Steak can be marinated up to 2 days.

Prepare grill for cooking.

Bring steak to room temperature (do not leave out longer than 1 hour).  When fire is hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack 1 to 2 seconds), grill steak on lightly oiled grill rack 5 to 8 minutes on each side for medium-rare.

Transfer steak to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes.  Holding knife at a 45-degree angle, cut steak across the grain into thin slices.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dry mustard
  1         tablespoon  hot water
     1/4           cup  Chinese plum sauce
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sesame oil
  5          teaspoons  rice vinegar
                        = (or other mild vinegar)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     swordfish steaks, 3/4" to 1" thk -- (7 oz ea)
  4          teaspoons  vegetable oil

                        Coarsely-chopped roasted peanuts
                        Slivered green onions

In small bowl, stir together mustard and hot water.  Whisk in plum and soy sauces, sesame oil and vinegar until mixture is smooth.  Sauce should be thick but fluid.  Add a few drops of water if too thick.  Check it for salt, season with pepper and set aside.  Sauce can be kept refrigerated up to 4 weeks but be sure to serve it at room temperature.

Prepare medium-hot fire in grill.  Set grate 4 to 5 inches above glowing coals.  Brush grate with oil just before grilling to help prevent sticking.

Season steaks with salt and pepper.  Rub each with 1 teaspoon oil.  Grill, turning once midway, 5 to 7 minutes total.  To check for doneness, make small incision in center of one steak to see whether it's opaque all the way through.

Place steaks on warm dinner plates and coat them with plum sauce mixture.  Pass peanuts and green onions for guests to help themselves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Leslie Revsin

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2    tablespoons  bottled Chinese oyster sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  finely-minced onion
  2 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh ginger
  2 1/2    tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sesame oil
  4                     tuna steaks, 3/4" to 1" thk -- (7 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place oyster sauce in small mixing bowl along with onion and ginger.  Whisk in rice wine vinegar, then gradually whisk in sesame oil.  Set aside.  Sauce can be made in advance.  Cover and refrigerate up to 2 weeks.

Prepare medium-hot fire in grill.  Set grate 4 to 5 inches above glowing coals.  Brush grate with oil just before grilling to help prevent sticking.

Season steaks with salt and pepper.  Place them in shallow dish and pour 1/4 cup of oyster-ginger marinade over them.  Set aside remaining marinade.  Coat steaks all over with mixture.  If you have time, cover them with plastic wrap and let them marinate at room temperature at least 30 minutes.  Refrigerate them if kitchen is hot.  Otherwise you can grill them right away.

Remove steaks from marinade and place over hot coals.  Grill first side 2 to 3 minutes until browned.  Turn steaks and grill other side another 2 to 3 minutes.  Steaks will be pink inside.  Cook few minutes longer on each side if you want them well done.

Place steaks on warm dinner plates, spoon rest of reserved oyster-ginger sauce over them and serve right away.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Julie Sahni
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ground lamb or beef
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced green chiles
                        = (serranos or jalapeÒos)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro - (lightly packed)
  1                cup  finely-chopped onion
  1           teaspoon  garam masala
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing grill

Combine all ingredients thoroughly and shape into logs that can be threaded onto thin skewers or cooked directly on the grill.

                        Hamburgers Of Their Dreams

Recipe By     :Jamie Purviance
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  bacon - (to 6)
  6             medium  white or brown mushrooms - (to 8) -- cut 1/4"-thk slices
  2              large  yellow or red onions -- cut 1/2" slices
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef chuck
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing
  4                     assorted thin cheese slices - (to 6)
  8             slices  French or Italian bread -- toasted if desired
                        = (or 4 split rolls)
  1              large  avocado -- peeled, pitted,
                        and cut into 1/4" slices
  1 1/2           cups  tomato salsa
  3             ounces  lettuce leaves or baby greens
                        Ketchup -- as needed
                        Mustard -- as needed

Place the bacon in a large saute pan, put the pan over medium heat and cook, turning often, until browned, for 8 to 10 minutes.  Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain.

Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the pan.  Raise the heat to medium-high, add the mushrooms, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, for 5 to 6 minutes.

Lightly brush both sides of the onion slices with the olive oil.  Grill directly over medium heat, turning once, until tender, for 12 to 14 minutes total.

In a medium bowl, mix the meat with the salt and pepper.  Form into 4 patties, each about 3/4-inch thick.  The burgers should be lightly shaped, as working them too hard will create an unappealing texture.

Lightly brush the cooking grate with vegetable oil.  Grill the burgers directly over medium heat, turning once, until no longer pink.  Resist the urge to press down on the burgers during grilling or you will force out the juices.

To make cheeseburgers, 3 to 4 minutes before the meat is done, place the cheese on top and allow it to melt.  Serve warm on the bread with the bacon, mushrooms, onions, avocado, tomato salsa, lettuce, ketchup and mustard.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     catfish fillets
                        === MARINADE ===
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  4                     green onions -- chopped
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === LEMON BUTTER SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  white wine
  1           teaspoon  chopped shallot
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  4        tablespoons  chilled butter -- cut up
                        Juice of 1 lemon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === SEASONED FLOUR ===
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  onion powder
  1              pinch  dried thyme
  1              pinch  dried basil
  1              pinch  dried oregano
  1              pinch  garlic powder
  1              pinch  white pepper
  1              pinch  baking powder
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Lemon wedges
                        Green onions

To marinate the catfish, puree lemon juice, green onions and olive oil in a blender.  Pour the marinade into a shallow dish and add salt and black pepper to taste.  Add catfish fillets, turning to coat.  Refrigerate, covered, for 12 to 24 hours to marinate.

To prepare the lemon butter sauce, simmer wine and shallot in a small saucepan over medium heat until the wine has evaporated.  Add the cream and simmer until reduced by half.  Remove from heat.  Gradually whisk in cubes of butter, a few at a time, until sauce thickens and is thoroughly blended.  Return the pan very briefly to the heat to help incorporate the butter, if necessary.  Season to taste with lemon juice, salt and white pepper.

Prepare a grill or preheat the broiler.

To prepare the seasoned flour, mix the flour, seasonings and baking powder in a shallow dish or on a piece of waxed paper.

Drain excess marinade from fillets and pat dry with paper towels.  Lightly dredge catfish fillets in flour mixture.  Place fillets on an oiled grill rack or broiler rack and grill or broil fish about 4 inches from the heat source for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.

Serve with lemon butter sauce and garnish with lemon wedges and green onions.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Turkey tenderloins
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1           teaspoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  crushed dried rosemary
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Combine Marinade ingredients.  Mix well.  Add turkey, coating all sides. Cover and chill for 3 hours or overnight.

Place turkey on grill over medium-hot coals.  Cover grill and cook 30 minutes per pound, brushing often with marinade and turning several times.  Turkey is done when internal temperature reaches 170 degrees.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Turkey cuts suitable for grilling include tenderloins, thighs, breasts and breast steaks, drumsticks and whole turkeys.  Use 1/2 cup marinade for each pound of turkey.  Use the marinade only for soaking the meat and not as a dipping sauce.  Instead, prepare a double portion of the mixture and reserve half of it for the sauce.

Comments:  Turkey cuts suitable for grilling include tenderloins, thighs, breasts and breast steaks, drumsticks and whole turkeys.  Use 1/2 cup marinade for each pound of turkey.  Use the marinade only for soaking the meat and not as a dipping sauce.  Instead, prepare a double portion of the mixture and reserve half of it for the sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  seedless raspberry jam
  3        tablespoons  raspberry vinegar
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts

Cut chicken into 1-inch pieces; place in plastic bag set into a shallow dish.  Add marinade; seal bag.  Turn chicken to coat well.  Chill for 2 to 24 hours, turning chicken occasionally.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove chicken from bag, reserving marinade.  Cut green and red peppers into 1-inch pieces.  On six 12-inch metal skewers alternately thread chicken, pineapple, green pepper, and red pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grill on uncovered grill directly over medium coals for 5 minutes.  Brush with marinade; turn skewers and grill for 7 to 9 minutes more or until chicken is tender and no longer pink.  Serve over hot cooked rice and garnish with green onion brushes, if desired.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To grill by indirect heat:  Arrange preheated coals around a drip pan in a covered grill.  Test for medium heat above pan.  Place skewers on grill over drip pan.  Cover and grill for 16 to 18 minutes or till chicken is tender and no longer pink, brushing occasionally with marinade up to the last 5 minutes of grilling.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  coarse-ground coffee beans
     1/4           cup  coarse-ground black pepper

Mix the spices in a small bowl.  Store the rub covered in a cool, dark pantry or freezer.

This recipe yields 3/4 cup.

Comments:  When you find yourself rushed, and don't have the time to marinate food for as long as a recipe suggests, a dry rub offers significant advantages over other seasoning methods, contributing the greatest amount of flavor in a short span of time.  If necessary, you can apply a rub right before grilling and still get much of its savor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  extra virgin olive oil
                        Juice from 1 large lemon
     1/4           cup  boiling water
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
                        === SHRIMP ===
  16                    extra-large shrimp - (abt 1 1/4 lbs) -- in the shells
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     3/4           cup  medium-grind sea salt
                        = (or kosher salt)

Make the dipping sauce:  Whisk together the oil, lemon juice and hot water.  Stir in the garlic, oregano and parsley.  Let stand for at least 20 to 30 minutes to marry the flavors.

Using a small sharp knife, make a slit about 3/4-inch deep down the backs of the shrimp and devein them but do not remove the shells.

Place the shrimp in a large bowl and toss with the olive oil to coat lightly all over.  Sprinkle the salt evenly over the shrimp and toss well to make sure each shrimp is thoroughly coated in a crust of salt.

Place the shrimp in the center of the cooking grate, 3 to 4 minutes per side or until the meat is opaque (white) all the way through when cut into.

Arrange 4 shrimp on each serving plate and accompany with a small ramekin of the dipping sauce.  The shrimp may also be served on a communal platter with a bowl of the sauce in the center.  Provide plenty of napkins and a small bowl for discarding the peeled shrimp shells.

This recipe yields 4 appetizer servings.

Comments:  Sarah Leah Chase proves that good taste does not have to be complicated with this recipe.  Whether you serve it as an appetizer or main course, it is destined to show up on your barbecue menus over and over again.

  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Make the Sesame-Ginger Vinaigrette:  Combine all the ingredients except the salt and pepper in a small bowl.  Whisk together, and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside or refrigerate until ready to use.

Rinse and dry the tuna steaks.  Place them in a single layer in a shallow non-reactive baking dish, and pour 3/4 cup of the vinaigrette over them.  Cover and set aside to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

Remove the tuna steaks from the dressing and discard the vinaigrette.  Grill the tuna steaks until nicely browned on the outside but still translucent in the center 2 to 3 minutes per side for rare, 3 to 5 minutes for medium-rare.

While the fish is cooking, toss the salad greens with the remaining 1/4 cup vinaigrette (or to taste) and divide the salad among four dinner plates.  Arrange the grilled fish over the greens, sprinkle each steak with a teaspoon toasted sesame seeds, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Hayday is one of the best gourmet food stores in the country and their prepared foods rival the best restaurants.  This recipe taken from their new book, is as easy as it is delicious.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Rubs
                Spice Blends

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  ground allspice
  2        tablespoons  turbinado sugar
                        = (or 1 tbspn regular sugar)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  kosher salt
                        = (or other coarse salt)
  1         tablespoon  ground dried mild red chile
                        = (such as New Mexican)
  1         tablespoon  ground cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground white pepper

Mix the spices in a small bowl.  Store the rub covered in a cool, dark pantry or freezer.

This recipe yields 3/4 cup.

Comments:  Sweet and fragrant, this rub flavors some of our favorite grilled pork dishes.  Turbinado sugar -- a crystallized, lighter version of brown sugar -- contributes a coarse texture to the mix that enhances its crusting effect.

In spite of the conventional wisdom, sugar and fire don't always equal incineration.  Sugar and naturally sweet foods such as oranges or tomatoes will burn over time at high temperatures, but when you use them properly in a dry rub, marinade, or glaze, they can produce a delightful caramelized crunch on grilled foods.  If you keep the quantities proportionately small, cook the food only briefly, or grill over moderate heat, the sweetening contributes to a chewy, lightly charred, deeply flavored crust.  The effect is similar to what happens with creme brulee, where the sugar topping melts down to a rich, brown caramel under a direct flame.

     3/4      teaspoon  ground gingerroot
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
  1                     zucchini -- cut 16 rounds
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- cut 16 pieces
  1                     red bell pepper -- cut 16 pieces
  16            medium  mushrooms -- stems removed

In a large pot of boiling water, cook the squash until just about tender, then drain.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the tomato sauce, garlic, basil, vinegar, ginger and salt.  Set this mixture aside.

Thread the vegetables onto skewers, alternating each kind.  You should get about 8 skewers.  Baste well with the sauce, then grill.  Baste often when you turn them.  They should be done in about 10 minutes, but don't let them burn.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                   Yankee Carolina Pulled Pork Barbecue

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Pork
                Sandwiches                      Smoking


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pork butt roast - (abt 4 lbs)
  1              quart  charcoal briquettes
  4                     chunks hickory wood
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  8                     white hamburger buns
                        Prepared or homemade coleslaw
                        === CAROLINA RED SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  ketchup
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt

Bring roast to room temperature while preparing the fire.  For the fire, pile the charcoal on one side of a covered grill and light.  Soak the hickory chunks in water.

When the coals are white around the edges, combine pepper, salt, paprika, mustard and cayenne and rub it evenly over the roast.  Scatter the hickory chunks over the pile of coals (do not spread).  Place grid on grill.  Place roast on grid, on the side away from the coals.  Cover and adjust top vents so they are one-quarter open.  Bottom vents should remain fully open.  Cook pork for 4 hours, opening lid as infrequently as possible.  It should not be necessary to add more coals.

Remove roast from grill and tightly seal in a double thickness of foil.  Bake at 300 degrees for 3 hours, until an instant-read thermometer registers 210 degrees.  Unwrap roast and place on a cutting board.  Shred the meat with a fork.  Lightly dress with Carolina Red Sauce, or pass the sauce at the table.  Pile the meat on hamburger buns and top with coleslaw.

For the Carolina Red Sauce:  Combine all ingredients and stir to dissolve sugar.  Serve at room temperature.  Keeps indefinitely in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields 8 servings.
