                           Asian Vegetable Stew

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     dried black mushrooms
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  chili paste
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === VEGETABLES ===
  1             medium  leek, white part only -- trimmed
  3                     Asian eggplant - (abt 1 lb)
                        = (or regular eggplant)
  3             medium  tomatoes -- peeled
  1              small  red bell pepper -- seeded
  3              small  zucchini - (abt 1 lb)
                        === COOKING ===
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  6              large  garlic cloves -- lightly mashed
  4             slices  ginger -- lightly mashed
     1/4         pound  pearl onions
                        = (or 1 small onion, coarsely chopped)
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  4          teaspoons  water
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil

Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut off and discard the stems and cut the caps in half.  Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.

Cut the leek, eggplant, and tomatoes into 1-inch chunks.  Cut the bell peppers into 1-inch squares.  Cut the zucchini into 1/2-inch-thick slices.

Place a large pot over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the pan.  Add the garlic, ginger, and onions and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the leek and cook for 1 minute.  Add the eggplant and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms, bell pepper, zucchini, tomatoes, and sauce; mix well.  Bring to a boil; reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until all the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.

Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Stir in the sesame oil just before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Although this really is a stew, it probably deserves a fancier name.  It's a delicious mixture of summer vegetables, similar to the French dish ratatouille, that I season with Chinese flavorings.  Serve it hot or at room temperature.  If you happen to have any left over, use it as a filling for omelets.

                 Asparagus With Spicy Sesame Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  asparagus
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/2      teaspoon  toasted sesame seeds
     1/8      teaspoon  toasted Sichuan peppercorns -- ground
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  catsup
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  chili paste
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Combine the dressing ingredients in a small bowl and whisk until well blended.  Set aside.  Snap off the tough ends of the asparagus.  Peel the stalks if desired.

In a wide frying pan, cook the asparagus in 1 inch of boiling water until crisp-tender, 2 to 4 minutes.  Drain, rinse under cold running water, and drain again.  Arrange on a serving platter, cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve.  Just before serving, pour the dressing over the asparagus.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  It doesn't take guesswork to tell which part of an asparagus spear is tough and should be discarded and which part is tender and should be saved.  Hold one end of the asparagus spear in each hand and bend.  It will snap apart at the tough-tender division.

Comments:  You can simmer, stem, or microwave the asparagus to make this chilled vegetable side dish.  The secret it to cook it to the crisp-tender stage so that when it is served with the sesame-spiked vinaigrette it will look as fresh as it did before cooking.

                        Baked Smoke-Flavored Duck

Recipe By     :Martin Yan

Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     duckling - (4 to 5 lbs) -- cleaned, trimmed
  1              whole  star anise
  1                     green onion, including top -- crushed
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                     green onion, including top -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  chopped ginger
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
     1/4      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === TEA MIXTURE ===
     2/3           cup  black tea leaves
     1/2           cup  raw rice
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  2          teaspoons  Chinese five-spice powder
                        === GLAZE ===
  3        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil

Combine the marinade ingredients in a large bowl.  Add the duck and rub it inside and out with the marinade.  Place the star anise and crushed green onion in the cavity.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Place a steaming rack in a wok, pour in water to just below the level of the rack and bring it to a boil.  Place the duck breast-side up on the rack.  Cover and steam for 45 minutes, add additional water if necessary.  Remove the duck from the steamer and pat it dry.

While the duck is steaming, prepare the pan for smoking as follows: Line the bottom of a deep roasting pan with heavy-duty foil.  Combine the tea mixture ingredients on the foil, mix well, and spread in an even layer.  Place an empty 2-inch-high can (such as a water chestnut can) at each end of the pan and position a wire rack large enough to hold the duck on the cans.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the duck on the rack.  Cover the entire pan with a large sheet of foil, making a tent; seal the edges.  Bake for 45 minutes.  Meanwhile, combine the glaze ingredients in a small bowl.  Remove the duck from the oven, remove the top sheet of foil, and brush the duck with glaze.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees, return the duck to the oven, and bake uncovered until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.

Cut the duck into serving-size pieces and arrange them on a serving platter in the shape of a whole duck.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Tip:  Served cold, this is a wonderful addition to an appetizer plate.

Comments:  To give duck a light and very delicate smoky flavor, Chinese cooks don't use mesquite or charcoal.  They make smoke from a mixture of tea leaves, raw rice, brown sugar, and spices and let it swirl around the bird.  It's all done neatly under a foil tent in the oven.

Combine the marinade ingredients in a large bowl.  Add the duck and rub it inside and out with the marinade.  Place the star anise and crushed green onion in the cavity.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a steaming rack in a wok, pour in water to just below the level of the rack and bring it to a boil.  Place the duck breast-side up on the rack.  Cover and steam for 45 minutes, add additional water if necessary.  Remove the duck from the steamer and pat it dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the duck is steaming, prepare the pan for smoking as follows: Line the bottom of a deep roasting pan with heavy-duty foil.  Combine the tea mixture ingredients on the foil, mix well, and spread in an even layer.  Place an empty 2-inch-high can (such as a water chestnut can) at each end of the pan and position a wire rack large enough to hold the duck on the cans.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the duck on the rack.  Cover the entire pan with a large sheet of foil, making a tent; seal the edges.  Bake for 45 minutes.  Meanwhile, combine the glaze ingredients in a small bowl.  Remove the duck from the oven, remove the top sheet of foil, and brush the duck with glaze.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees, return the duck to the oven, and bake uncovered until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut the duck into serving-size pieces and arrange them on a serving platter in the shape of a whole duck.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tip:  Served cold, this is a wonderful addition to an appetizer plate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  To give duck a light and very delicate smoky flavor, Chinese cooks don&apos;t use mesquite or charcoal.  They make smoke from a mixture of tea leaves, raw rice, brown sugar, and spices and let it swirl around the bird.  It&apos;s all done neatly under a foil tent in the oven.

                      Baked Stuffed Chicken Breasts

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     dried black mushrooms
  4              large  chicken breast halves -- boned, skin on
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FILLING ===
  4                     cooked quail eggs -- shells removed
     1/2         small  carrot -- cut 2" matchsticks
     1/2         small  zucchini -- cut 2" matchsticks
     1/4           cup  sliced water chestnuts -- cut thin strips
  1                     green onion, including top -- cut 2" slivers
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
                        === COOKING ===
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
                        Slivered green onion -- for garnish

Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut off and discard the stems; slice the caps into matchstick pieces.

Remove the small muscle (fillet) from each chicken breast half; reserve them for other uses.  Split each breast half horizontally almost all the way through, leaving one long edge attached, and open it up like a book.  Lightly pound the breasts to an even thickness with the back edge of a cleaver blade or with a flat-surfaced mallet.  Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.  Add the chicken; stir to coat.  Set aside for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Drain the chicken breasts and discard the marinade.  Place the flattened breasts, skin-side down, on a work surface.  Place a quail egg and a quarter of the remaining filling ingredients, including the mushrooms, in the center of each breast.  Roll up the breasts (do not fold in the sides).  Place the rolls seam-side down in a 9-inch baking pan and brush them with sesame oil.

Bake the rolls uncovered until the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced, 30 to 40 minutes.  Transfer to a platter.  Pour the pan juices over the rolls.  Garnish with green onion.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Which came first the chicken or the egg?  Don't waste time on the answer -- just wrap boneless chicken breasts around quail eggs and strips of vegetables to make a good tasting, good looking individual entree.  You can really impress your guests with this one.

                 Bell Peppers Stuffed With Seafood Mousse

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Dim Sum


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FISH MOUSSE ===
  2                     dried black mushrooms
     1/4         pound  white fish fillet
                        = (sole, snapper, or lingcod)
     1/4         pound  raw shrimp -- shelled, deveined
  1                     egg white
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  chicken broth
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === BELL PEPPERS ===
  2                     green bell peppers -- seeded, and
                        cut into 2" squares
                        Cornstarch -- for dry coating
                        === COOKING ===
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  chopped shallots
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  3        tablespoons  Chinese preserved black beans -- rinsed, drained
                        and coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water

Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut off and discard the stems; cut the caps into quarters.  Place the mushrooms in a food processor and process until finely chopped.  Add the remaining mousse ingredients and process to a smooth paste

Lightly dust the inside of the bell pepper squares with cornstarch.  Spread about 2 teaspoons of mousse on each square.  (The squares can be prepared to this point up to 2 hours ahead of time and refrigerated.)

Place a wide frying pan over medium-high heat.  Add 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the surface.  Place half the stuffed peppers in the pan filling-side down and cook for 1 1/2 minutes.  Add 1/4 cup of broth; cover and cook until peppers are tender, about 3 minutes.  Remove the peppers from the pan and keep them warm.  Wipe the pan dry and cook the remaining peppers with another tablespoon of oil and 1/4 cup of broth.

Meanwhile, place a small saucepan over high heat.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable, swirling to coat the surface.  Add the garlic, ginger, shallots, and red pepper and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the black beans, sherry, soy sauce, sugar, and the remaining broth; mix well.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Spoon the sauce over the stuffed peppers.

This recipe yields 16 pieces.

Variation:  For a different flavor, stuff fresh Anaheim green chiles.  Cut the peppers in half lengthwise; remove the seeds and veins before cutting into squares for stuffing.

Comments:  My food processor makes the seafood mousse for these stuffed bell pepper squares in no time.  I cook the stuffed peppers in a regular wide frying pan and serve them with black bean sauce.  They make nice appetizers as well as dim sum offerings.

                  Braised Dried Oysters With Black Moss

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  dried oysters
     1/2         ounce  dried black moss
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  chopped shallot
  1                     green onion, including top -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  4          teaspoons  water
  8                     iceberg lettuce cups - (to 12) -- washed, chilled
                        Cilantro (Chinese parsley) sprigs -- (optional garnish)

Rinse the dried oysters and soak them in 1 1/2 cups warm water for 1 hour.  Drain, reserving 1 cup of the soaking liquid.  Soak the black moss in warm water to cover for 30 minutes and drain.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the ginger, shallot, and green onion and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the oysters and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add the reserved oyster soaking liquid and the broth.  Spread the moss in an even layer over the oysters.  Reduce the heat to medium-low.  Cover and simmer until the oysters are tender, about 30 minutes.  Stir in the sherry and sesame oil.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.

Arrange the lettuce cups on a serving platter and spoon the oyster mixture into them.  Garnish with cilantro sprigs, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Tips:  Whole leaves of iceberg lettuce are a popular wrapper for foods to be eaten without chopsticks.  Use good-sized inner leaves that come off the head in one piece.

Black moss, also called hairlike seaweed or hair vegetable, is often steamed with simple seasonings or used in broths.  It is available in Chinese markets and herbal stores.

Comments:  To the Chinese, dried oysters, 'ho see' in Cantonese, symbolizes good business; black moss, 'fat choy' in Cantonese, offers prosperity; and lettuce, 'sung choy', prophesies wealth.  Serve them together in this special New Year's dish, and good fortune is guaranteed to come your way.

                    Braised Eggplant With Garlic Sauce

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Asian eggplants - (abt 1 1/4 lbs)
                        = (or 1 regular eggplant)
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
                        = (or dark Chinese rice vinegar)
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  hoisin sauce
  2          teaspoons  ckili paste
                        === COOKING ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/4         pound  coarsely-chopped boneless pork
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  2                     green onions, including tops -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped water chestnuts
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  4          teaspoons  water
                        Slivered green onions, including top -- for garnish

Peel egg plant and cut it into 1/2-inch cubes.  Place it in a medium bowl, sprinkle with salt, and toss gently to mix.  Set aside for 30 minutes.

Combine the sauce ingredients in a medium bowl.  Drain and rinse the eggplant and squeeze it dry.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the pork and cook until browned and crumbly, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the eggplant, green onions, and water chestnuts; mix well.  Add the sauce.  Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan and braise until the eggplant is tender and the liquid is slightly reduced, about 10 minutes.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Garnish with slivered green onions.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Asian eggplant has a tender skin which does not require peeling.  Do so only if you want the color of the dish to be light rather than tinged with purple.

Comments:  Here's a chance to practice your skill with a cleaver.  Although you can make this garlicky dish from Sichuan with ground pork, I prefer chopped pork for its more pleasing texture contrast to the creamy eggplant.  Still, if you want to use your food processor, by all means do so.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     duckling - (4 to 5 lba) -- cleaned, trimmed
  12                    dried black mushrooms
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === BROTH MIXTURE ===
  1                can  chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz) -- plus
  1                can  water
     1/4           cup  red bean paste
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1              whole  star anise
                        === COOKING ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- pressed
  6                     thin slices ginger
  2                     shallots -- cut into wedges
  1                     leek, white part only -- split lengthwise,
                        and cut into 2" strips
  2                     green onions -- cut 2" pieces
  1                can  bamboo shoots - (8 oz) drained -- and
                        cut into 1 1/2" pieces
  1                can  whole water chestnuts -- drained
  1              pound  tarro or thin-skin potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" chunks
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch

Combine the marinade ingredients in a large bowl.  Add the duck and set aside for 1 hour, turning occasionally.  Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut off and discard the stems; thinly slice the caps.  Set aside.

Combine the broth mixture ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.  Remove the duck from the marinade and pat it dry.  Place a wok or wide frying pan over medium heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Brown the duck well on all sides, transfer it to a plate, and set it aside.

Place a large pot over medium-high heat until hot.  Add the remaining tablespoon of oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the garlic, ginger, and shallots; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Stir in the leek, green onions, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, and broth mixture.  Add the duck, breast-side down.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 1 1/4 hours, turning the duck over halfway through the cooking period.  Add the taro or potato and cook for 30 to 35 minutes or until the duck is tender.

Remove the duck and vegetables to a serving platter.  Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons of water.  Add the cornstarch solution to the liquid in the pot; cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Serve half the sauce over the duck, and the rest over rice or noodles.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This is a wonderful entree for a special meal, Chinese or Western, and a delightful change from roast duck.  Slow braising makes an especially flavorful sauce, and leaves the meat so tender you can pull it from the bones with chopsticks.

                        === SAUCE ===
     2/3           cup  vegetable broth
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === STIR-FRY ===
  1         tablespoon  canola oil - (to 2)
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  3                     green onions -- cut 1" pieces
  8                     dried shiitake mushrooms -- soaked until soft,
                        and thinly sliced
  1                     carrot -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  julienned bamboo shoots
     1/2           cup  sliced water chestnuts
  1                can  baby corn - (15 oz) -- drained
     1/2         pound  snow peas
     1/2         pound  napa cabbage -- cut 1" by 2" pieces
  2             ounces  dried bean thread noodles -- broken 4" pieces,
                        and soaked in warm water to cover
     1/2         pound  firm tofu -- cut 1" cubes.

Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in a bowl; set aside.

Stir-Fry:  Heat oil in work or large deep skillet over high heat.  Add garlic, ginger, green onions and mushrooms; stir-fry 1 minute.  Add carrot, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, corn, peas and cabbage; cook about 2 minutes.

Add sauce, cover and cook 5 minutes.  Drain noodles, and add to work with tofu.  Reduce heat to low and cook until most of sauce is absorbed, about 15 minutes.  Serve as is or over rice.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  You can always find this dish on Chinese restaurant menus.  It traditionally contains dried black moss, dried bean curd (tofu) stick and ginkgo nuts, but my simplified version is just as good and is easy to prepare.

                    Calamari With Chinese Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
  1                     tespoon minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
                        === COOKING ===
  1              pound  small squid -- cleaned, with
                        tentacles separated and body cut
                        into 1/4" rings
  2             ounces  snow peas -- ends and
                        strings removed, halved diagonally
  2                     celery stalks -- thinly sliced
     1/2         small  red onion -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  sliced water chestnuts

Combine the dressing ingredients in a small bowl and whisk until well blended; set aside.

Bring 4 inches of water to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Add the squid, including the tentacles, and cook for 1 minute.  Drain, rinse under cold running water, and drain again.  Toss with 2 tablespoons of the dressing and set aside for 30 minutes.

Cook the snow peas in boiling water for 1 minute or until crisp-tender.  Drain, rinse under cold running water, and drain again.  Combine in a large salad bowl with the squid and the remaining ingredients.  Stir the remaining dressing, add it to the salad, and toss to coat evenly.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Many fish markets sell small squid already cleaned.  To do it yourself, grasp the tentacles and gently pull them away from the hood.  Pull and discard the long clear quill from the hood.  Squeeze out and discard the contents of the hood, then pull off the thin speckled membrane from the hood to expose the white meat.  Rinse well inside and out.  With a sharp knife, cut between the eyes and tentacles; discard the eyes and the material attached.  Pop out and discard the hard beak in the center of the tentacles.

Comments:  The tenderness and flavor of squid remind me of abalone -- at a fraction of the cost.  Cook squid very briefly or for a very long time.  Cook in between, the flesh is tough and rubbery.

             Cantonese Roast Chicken With Honey-Hoisin Glaze

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  frying chicken - (abt 3 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
  2                     thin slices ginger -- crushed
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
                        === GLAZE ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce
  2          teaspoons  honey
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil

Rinse the chicken inside and out; pat it dry with paper towels.  Starting at the neck opening, separate the skin and flesh with your fingers, being careful not to tear the skin.  Work your fingers over each side of the breast and over the thigh areas.

In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, salt, and five-spice.  Rub half of th mixture over the chicken flesh, under the skin.  Rub the remaining mixture on the outside of the chicken.  Place the crushed ginger and garlic under the skin on the breast.  Cover the chicken and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours or overnight.  Just before cooking, combine the glaze ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Stand the chicken on a vertical roaster, or place it breast-side up on a rack in a foil-lined shallow baking pan.  Roast for 50 minutes, brush with the glaze, and continue to cook until the meat near the thigh bone is no longer pink when pierced, about 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Variation:  To cook in a covered grill, prepare charcoal briquets in the usual manner.  When the coals are beginning to turn grey, arrange them in a circle around the bottom of the grill.  Set a shallow, disposable pan of water in the middle, place the chicken on a vertical roaster in the pan, and cover the grill.  Open the top and bottom vents.  Roast to an internal temperature of 165 degrees, 30 to 40 minutes.  Baste with the glaze during the last 10 minutes.

Comments:  The fantastic flavor and crispness of this dish results from rubbing the seasonings both under and over the skin, roasting the chicken uncovered, and brushing it with a honey-hoisin glaze during the last 10 minutes of roasting.  It's great grilled too!

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  uncooked rice
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1              pound  lean ground beef
  3                     green onions, including tops -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint leaves
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
                        Chilled romaine or butter lettuce leaves
                        Mint sprigs or lime wedges -- for garnish

Place a small frying pan over medium heat until hot.  Add the rice; cook, shaking the pan frequently, until the rice is toasty brown, about 4 minutes.  Let stand until cool.  Place the rice in a spice grinder and grind to a fine powder.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the red pepper and shallots and cook, stirring, until the shallots soften, about 30 seconds.  Add the beef and cook until it is browned and crumbly, about 3 minutes.  Drain the excess liquid.  Add the green onions, cilantro, mint, lime juice, fish sauce, and sugar; toss well.  Add the ground rice and stir until the liquid is absorbed, about 30 seconds.

To serve, mound the meat mixture on a platter and surround it with lettuce leaves.  Garnish with mint sprigs.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  To eat, place a spoonful of meat in a lettuce leaf, wrap it up, and eat it out of hand.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  When a cook prepares a dish from another cuisine, he invariably adds his own personal touch, and I've done so with this recipe.  It's based on the "larb" of northern Thailand, in which the beef is eaten raw or blanched in water.  I prefer to stir-fry it with seasonings to give it a Chinese accent.

Place a small frying pan over medium heat until hot.  Add the rice; cook, shaking the pan frequently, until the rice is toasty brown, about 4 minutes.  Let stand until cool.  Place the rice in a spice grinder and grind to a fine powder.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the red pepper and shallots and cook, stirring, until the shallots soften, about 30 seconds.  Add the beef and cook until it is browned and crumbly, about 3 minutes.  Drain the excess liquid.  Add the green onions, cilantro, mint, lime juice, fish sauce, and sugar; toss well.  Add the ground rice and stir until the liquid is absorbed, about 30 seconds.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, mound the meat mixture on a platter and surround it with lettuce leaves.  Garnish with mint sprigs.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  To eat, place a spoonful of meat in a lettuce leaf, wrap it up, and eat it out of hand.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  When a cook prepares a dish from another cuisine, he invariably adds his own personal touch, and I&apos;ve done so with this recipe.  It&apos;s based on the &quot;larb&quot; of northern Thailand, in which the beef is eaten raw or blanched in water.  I prefer to stir-fry it with seasonings to give it a Chinese accent.

                           Chicken Coconut Soup

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  chicken broth
                        Bottom 6" of 1 lemon grass stalk -- cut 1" pieces,
                        and crushed with side of a cleaver
  3                     thin slices ginger
  1                can  coconut milk - (14 oz)
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1              whole  boneless skinless chicken breast -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  canned straw mushrooms
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1                     serrano or jalapeÒo chile -- seeded, slivered
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil

In a large pot, bring the broth, lemongrass, and ginger to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium, add the coconut milk and fish sauce, cover, and simmer for 8 minutes.  Add the chicken, mushrooms, lime juice, and chile and cook until the chicken turns opaque, about 5 minutes.  Add the basil leaves just before serving.  Ladle into individual soup bowls.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Although lemongrass stalks are fibrous and are used to flavor soup rather than as an ingredient to be eaten, it is customary in Thai cooking to leave them in the soup when serving.  You may prefer to discard them just as you would a bay leaf.

Microwave Method:  Combine the broth, lemongrass, and ginger in a 2-quart microwave-safe casserole and cook on high for 5 minutes.  Add the coconut milk, fish sauce, chicken, straw mushrooms, lime juice, and chile; cover and cook on high until the chicken is just tender, about 3 minutes.  Add the basil leaves just before serving.  Serve as above.

Comments:  Fragrant lemongrass, creamy coconut milk, pungent fish sauce, and hot chile flavor this aromatic soup from Thailand.  My version is only moderately spiced.  If you want a bolder spicy Thai flavor, double the amount of lemongrass and do not remove the seeds from the chile.

                Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm-textured 3/4"-thk white fish fillets
                        = (such as cod or halibut)
                        === MARINADE ===
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  dry sherry or Chinese red wine
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
                        Lettuce leaves -- for serving

Score the fish with shallow parallel cuts at 1-inch intervals.  Make another set of cuts at an angle to the first to make a diamond pattern.  Combine the marinade ingredients in a shallow dish.  Add the fish, turning it to coat both sides.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight,

Remove the fish from the marinade and place in on a rack in a foil-lined baking pan; reserve the marinade.  Broil the fish 2 to 3 inches from the heat until opaque in the center, about 6 minutes.  Transfer it to a deep plate; set aside.

Pour the reserved marinade into a small saucepan.  Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat and boil for 2 minutes.  Strain the liquid over the fish and let it stand for 30 minutes.  Pour off and discard the marinade; cover and refrigerate the fish until ready to serve.  Serve on a bed of lettuce leaves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Try serving the fish with Belgian endive as part of an appetizer plate.

Comments:  Shanghai cuisine is known for its richly marinated seafood, served chilled or at room temperature.  This contemporary recipe is similar to a smoked fish appetizer popular in Shanghai restaurants.  Usually deep-fried, it's just as delicious broiled.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BROTH MIXTURE ===
     2/3           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
                        === COOKING ===
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water
  1               head  Chinese (napa) cabbage - (abt 2 lbs) -- cored, and
                        cut lengthwise into 6 sections

Combine the broth mixture ingredients in a small bowl.

Place a medium saucepan over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the surface.  Add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the broth mixture and bring to a boil.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Keep warm

In a large pot, bring 3 inches of water to a boil.  Plunge the cabbage into the water and cook until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.  Drain well and place on a platter.  Serve the sauce over the cabbage.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Tip:  The cabbage cam also be cooked in a microwave.  Place in a microwave-safe dish, cover, and cook on high until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.

Comments:  Clear sauce is the Chinese counterpart to basic white sauce used in Western-style cooking.  It goes perfectly with white meat chicken, turkey breast, scallops, and such steamed vegetables as Chinese (napa) cabbage, baby bok choy, or Shanghai baby greens.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  ground turkey
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
                        === STUFFING ===
  4                     dried black mushrooms
  1              small  carrot -- grated
  2                     green onions, including tops -- thinly sliced
     1/3           cup  coarsely-chopped water chestnuts
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === SAUCE ===
     2/3           cup  vegetable juice cocktail
     1/3           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === COOKING ===
  8              large  Chinese (napa) cabbage leaves
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
  1                     green onion, including top -- thinly sliced
                        Cooked brown rice -- hot

Combine the turkey and marinade ingredients in a large bowl; mix well, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut off and discard the stems and coarsely chop the caps.  Add the mushrooms and remaining stuffing ingredients to the turkey, mix well, and set aside.  Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.

Cook the cabbage leaves in a large pot of boiling water until they are limp, about 2 minutes.  Drain, rinse under cold running water, and drain again.  To stuff each leaf, mound 1/8 of the stuffing at the stem end, fold the bottom of the leaf over the stuffing, then fold over the right and left sides; roll the whole package over once to enclose the stuffing.

Place a 10-inch frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan.  Add the garlic and ginger; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Remove the pan from the heat and arrange the cabbage rolls seam-side down in a single layer in the pan.  Pour the sauce over the rolls.  Return the pan to medium-low heat; cover and simmer for 25 minutes.

Lift the rolls out with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a serving platter.  Add the cornstarch solution to the pan juices; cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Pour the sauce over the rolls and sprinkle with green onion.  Serve with hot brown rice.

This recipe yields 8 rolls.

Tip:  You can use lean ground beef or chicken in place of the turkey.

Comments:  Let the cabbage roll!  Each country has a version of the homey dish.  What makes this Chinese?  The Chinese (napa) cabbage -- and the marinade and stuffing made with typical Chinese ingredients.

Combine the turkey and marinade ingredients in a large bowl; mix well, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut off and discard the stems and coarsely chop the caps.  Add the mushrooms and remaining stuffing ingredients to the turkey, mix well, and set aside.  Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the cabbage leaves in a large pot of boiling water until they are limp, about 2 minutes.  Drain, rinse under cold running water, and drain again.  To stuff each leaf, mound 1/8 of the stuffing at the stem end, fold the bottom of the leaf over the stuffing, then fold over the right and left sides; roll the whole package over once to enclose the stuffing.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a 10-inch frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan.  Add the garlic and ginger; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Remove the pan from the heat and arrange the cabbage rolls seam-side down in a single layer in the pan.  Pour the sauce over the rolls.  Return the pan to medium-low heat; cover and simmer for 25 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lift the rolls out with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a serving platter.  Add the cornstarch solution to the pan juices; cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Pour the sauce over the rolls and sprinkle with green onion.  Serve with hot brown rice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 rolls.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tip:  You can use lean ground beef or chicken in place of the turkey.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Let the cabbage roll!  Each country has a version of the homey dish.  What makes this Chinese?  The Chinese (napa) cabbage -- and the marinade and stuffing made with typical Chinese ingredients.

                Chinese Chicken Salad With Glazed Walnuts

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
                        = (or Chinese dark rice vinegar)
  3        tablespoons  sesame paste
                        = (or peanut butter)
  3        tablespoons  walnut oil
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === SALAD ===
  4               cups  shredded iceberg lettuce
  2               cups  shredded cooked chicken
  1              small  carrot -- cut matchstick
                        pieces
     1/2                cucumber -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut matchstick pieces
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)
  2        tablespoons  finely-shredded fresh basil
                        === COOKING ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying
  12                    wonton wrappers -- cut 1/4" strips
  2        tablespoons  walnut oil
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  toasted walnut halves

Combine the dressing ingredients in a small bowl and whisk until smooth.  Combine the salad ingredients in a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Set a wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of about 2 inches.  Heat the oil to 360 degrees and adjust the heat to medium-high.  Fry the wonton strips until golden brown, about 15 seconds.  Remove them with a skimmer and drain on paper towels.

Place a wide frying pan over medium heat until hot.  Add the walnut oil, swirling to coat the surface.  Add the sugar, stir until it dissolves, add the walnuts, and stir until the nuts are coated with caramelized sugar.  Immediately transfer the walnuts to a foil-covered plate and separate them with two forks.

Just before serving, pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat evenly.  Serve the salad in a wide shallow bowl, surrounded with wonton strips.  Scatter the glazed walnuts over the top.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  There are as many variations of Chinese chicken salad as there are moves in a game of mah jong.  Place your money on this one; it's a sure winner.  The glazed walnuts are traditionally deep-fried, but you can make them with less fuss in just a tiny bit of oil.  To be on the safe side, double the amount of walnuts; you may eat half of them for snacks by the time you serve the salad.

                             Chinese Coleslaw

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
                        === SALAD ===
  5               cups  shredded Chinese (napa) cabbage
  1                cup  daikon in fine julienne
  1              small  carrot -- cut fine julienne
  1                     green onion, including top -- cut 1" slivers
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)

Combine the dressing ingredients in a small bowl and whisk until evenly blended.  Combine the salad ingredients in a large bowl.  Just before serving, pour the dressing over the salad and toss until evenly coated.

This recipe yields 6 servings,

Tip:  If you prefer a less nippy flavor, use jicama or sliced water chestnuts in place of the daikon.  To build this salad into a main dish, toss in a generous handful of small cooked shrimp.

Comments:  I'll tell you a secret:  I don't always use my cleaver for cutting.  To make long, skinny shreds of daikon and carrot, it's faster to use the julienne disc of a food processor.  You can also make fast work of this style of cutting with the French shredding and slicing tool called a "mandoline" or the fine blade of a Japanese grater.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  thin-skinned potatoes -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     Chinese sausage - (abt 2 oz) -- cut 1/4" cubes
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  diced bamboo shoots
     1/2                green bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1/2" squares
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesane oil

Place the potato cubes in a medium pot; barely cover the with cold water.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the potatoes are just tender when pierced, about 8 minutes.  Drain well.

Place a wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the surface.  Add the sausage and garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the potatoes and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Reduce the heat to medium.  Add the bamboo shoots, bell pepper, and black pepper.  Cook, stirring, until the potatoes are lightly browned, about 2 minutes, then stir in the soy sauce and sesame oil.  Cook until heated through, about 1 minute.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Because red and white thin-skinned potatoes (also called new potatoes) are firm and waxy, they keep their shape better during frying that thick-skinned russet potatoes.  If cooking the potatoes ahead of time, rinse them under cold water and drain them well before frying.

Microwave Method:  Cut the potatoes into 1/2-inch cubes, arrange them in a 9-inch microwave-safe glass pie pan, and sprinkle them with water.  Cover and cook on high until tender, 4 to 5 minutes.

Comments:  What are breakfast egg without a side of hash browns?  I like mine Chinese-style -- seasoned with "lop cheong," the little sweet-savory sausages that are sold in pairs.

  1           teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
  2        tablespoons  water
                        Hog casings

Grind the pork and fat in a meat grinder fitted with a 3/8-inch plate or, to be more authentic, dice the meat and fat with a knife into 1/4-inch cubes.  Combine all the remaining ingredients except the casings in a large mixing bowl.  Add the meat and fat and mix well.

Stuff the meat mixture into the hog casing; tie the casing into 5-inch links.  Prick the links all over with a fork.  Spread them on a rack and place them in the refrigerator.  Let the sausages dry overnight.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  Place the sausages on a rack in a foil-lined baking sheet, making sure they do not touch each other.  Bake for 5 hours.  Shut off the oven but do not open the oven door.  Let the sausages cool for another 2 hours.  Discard any excess fat in the pan and store the sausages in the refrigerator for one to two weeks, or freeze them for two to three months.

This recipe yields 6 sausages, about 2 ounces each.

Comments:  Small, slightly sweet and spicy Chinese sausages are used in many of the recipes in this collection.  If you cannot get them, here is a recipe for making your own.  It comes from San Francisco sausage maker Bruce Aidells, whose sausage making workshops are always a hit at my cooking school.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/3           cups  wheat starch
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
     2/3           cup  boiling water
  1           teaspoon  lard
                        === FILLING ===
  2         tablespoon  dried shrimp -- soaked 30 minutes,
                        and coarsely chopped
     1/2         pound  lean pork -- coarsely chopped,
                        or ground
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped walnuts
                        = (or unsalted peanuts)
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  2        tablespoons  chicken broth or water
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  2           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
                        === FOR SERVING ===
                        Soy sauce
                        Prepared Chinese mustard

Combine the wheat starch and cornstarch in a bowl.  Add the boiling water, stirring with chopsticks or a fork until dough is evenly moistened.  Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.  Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

On a lightly oiled surface, knead the dough until smooth.  Work in the lard, 1/4 teaspoon at a time, kneading after each addition until dough glistens and feels satiny.  Divide the dough in half.  Roll each half into a 15-inch long cylinder.  Cut each cylinder crosswise into 1-inch pieces; shape each piece into a ball.  Cover with a damp cloth to prevent drying.

Flatten a ball of dough and roll with a rolling pin into a 3-inch circle.  Spoon 1 heaping teaspoon of filling in the center of the circle.  Lightly moisten the edges with water and fold the circle in half.  Starting at one end, seal the curved edges together with 4 to 6 pleats, pinching the edges to seal securely.  Cover the filled dumplings with a damp cloth while shaping the rest.

Line the bottoms of two bamboo steamers with small damp cloths.  Arrange half the dumplings in each without crowding.  Bring 2 inches of water to a boil in a wok.  Stack the steamers, cover, and steam over boiling water until the dumplings are translucent, 10 to 12 minutes.  Serve with soy sauce and mustard.

This recipe yields about 30 dumplings.

Tip:  Wheat starch, the starchy part of flour separated from the gluten, is a pure white powder with the look and feel of cornstarch.  It is sold in Chinese groceries.

Comments:  These delicious dumplings with their transparent skins come from Chiu Chow cuisine, named after a region around Shantou in Southeastern China.  Chiu Chow dishes and restaurants are common in Hong Kong and most of the cities of Southeast Asia, where people from this region have settled as emigrants and traders for centuries.

                        Clams In Black Bean Sauce

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  Chinese preserved black beans -- rinsed, drained,
                        and coarsely chopped
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1                     serrano or jalapeÒo chile -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  2          teaspoons  sor sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  2             pounds  small hard-shell clams -- well scrubbed
     1/3           cup  chicken broth
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
  1                     green onion, including top -- thinly sliced

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the black beans, garlic, and chile and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Stir in the sherry, soy sauce, and sugar.  Add the clams, broth, and sesame oil; cover and cook until the clams open, about 6 minutes.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Discard any clams that haven't opened by the time the sauce has thickened.  Garnish with green onion.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This deliciously spicy dish is one of the most popular items served in Cantonese seafood restaurants.  One taste will convince you to try it again -- and again.  You can buy the preserved black beans in Asian markets and in selected supermarkets across the country.

                          Cold-Tossed Jellyfish

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  salted jellyfish - (1 lb)
                        === SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
                        = (or Chinese dark rice vinegar)
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Without unfolding the layers, cut the jellyfish into very thin julienne strips, about 1/16-inch wide.  Place the jellyfish in a colander and rinse it under cold running water for 15 minutes.  Toss the jellyfish occasionally to rinse it evenly.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and pour the hot water over the jellyfish.  Immediately plunge the jellyfish in a large bowl of cold water and drain.  Repeat the rinsing with boiling water and chilling with cold water one more time.  Pat the jellyfish dry between paper towels.

Combine the sauce ingredients in a medium bowl and add the jellyfish.  Toss until evenly coated.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve or for as long as one week.

This recipe yields 6 appetizer servings.

Comments:  You'd think that by the time a jellyfish left the sea, it would have seen enough water!  The recipe directions are correct.  Wash the jellyfish for 15 minutes -- 30 if you have the time.  The more it is rinsed, the more crispy and crunchy it becomes.

     1/2           cup  frozen peas -- thawed
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  4          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water
  1                     egg white

Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut off and discard the stems and thinly slice the caps.  Set aside.

In a large pot, bring the broth, ginger, and mushrooms to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium, add the corn, scallops, crabmeat, and peas, and cook until the scallops turn opaque, about 1 minute.  Stir in the sesame oil and pepper.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the soup boils and thickens.  Lightly beat the egg white in a bowl.  Remove the pot from the heat; slowly drizzle in the egg white, stirring constantly, to form "egg flowers."

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Variation:  If bay scallops are not available, sea scallops may be substituted; cut the sea scallops into smaller slices.

Comments:  Yes, China has corn.  (Where do you think the cornstarch comes from?) One favorite Chinese way to use sweet corn is in luscious seafood soups.  This version uses scallops and crabmeat, but feel free to use all scallops, or any other combination of shellfish you like.

                      Country-Style Sausage Patties

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  lean ground pork
  2                     green onions, including tops -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil

Combine all ingredients except the oil in a large bowl.  Mix well and shape into eight patties, each about 2 1/2 inches in diameter.

Place a wide frying pan over medium heat until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the surface.  Add the sausage patties; cook for 2 minutes on each side or until lightly browned.  Cover and cook for 2 more minutes, then uncover.  Cook until the patties are no longer pink in the center, about 2 more minutes on each side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variation:  For a reduced-calorie version, use ground turkey in place of the pork.

Comments:  Spiced with ginger, fresh cilantro, and green onion, these sausage patties make a perfect partner to breakfast eggs.  If time permits, season the meat and then chill it overnight so the flavors have time to blend.

                     Curried Turkey In A Noodle Nest

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Poultry                         Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  boneless turkey breast -- cut thin slices
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                     tablespon soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  chili paste
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
                        === NOODLE BASKET ===
     1/2         pound  fresh egg noodles
  2        tablespoons  beaten egg
  1 1/2    tablespoons  oil
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1              pinch  salt
                        === COOKING ===
                        Vegetable cooking spray
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  2                     celery stalks -- thinly sliced
  1              small  red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        diagonally cut into 1/2" pieces
  2             ounces  sugar snap peas or
                        Chinese pea pods -- ends, and
                        strings removed
  2                     green onions, including tops -- cut diagonally
                        into 1 1/2" pieces
     1/4           cup  chicken broth

Combine the marinade ingredients in a small bowl.  Add the turkey and stir to coat.  Set aside for 30 minutes.  Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Cook the noodles according to package instructions.  Drain, rinse lightly, and drain again.  Place the remaining noodle basket ingredients in a large bowl and mix well.  Add the noodles and toss until evenly coated.  Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Spray the outside of a flat-bottomed strainer basket or sieve (6 to 7 inches in diameter and 3 inches deep) with vegetable cooking spray.  Place the strainer, open-side down, on the lined cookie sheet.  Arrange the noodles in a lace-like pattern over the bottom and around the sides of the strainer.  Bake until golden brown and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes.  Let stand until cool, then gently remove and place on a serving plate.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the ginger, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the turkey, and stir-fry until no longer pink, about 2 minutes.  Remove the turkey from the wok.  Add the celery, bell pepper, peas, green onions, and broth, and stir to mix well.  Cover and cook for 1 minute or until the vegetables are crisp-tender.  Return the turkey to the pan.  Stir the sauce to recombine, add it to the pan, and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Spoon the turkey mixture in to the nest.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  The traditional noodle nest is deep-fried.  Because this baked version is more fragile, it is important to make it only from Chinese-style fresh egg noodles.  Dried noodles and brands labeled "ready cooked" are not sticky enough to hold the nest together.

Comments:  Here's a garnish that's not just for show.  After you savor the curried turkey, break the lacy noodle nest apart and nibble on the pieces.

Combine the marinade ingredients in a small bowl.  Add the turkey and stir to coat.  Set aside for 30 minutes.  Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Cook the noodles according to package instructions.  Drain, rinse lightly, and drain again.  Place the remaining noodle basket ingredients in a large bowl and mix well.  Add the noodles and toss until evenly coated.  Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Spray the outside of a flat-bottomed strainer basket or sieve (6 to 7 inches in diameter and 3 inches deep) with vegetable cooking spray.  Place the strainer, open-side down, on the lined cookie sheet.  Arrange the noodles in a lace-like pattern over the bottom and around the sides of the strainer.  Bake until golden brown and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes.  Let stand until cool, then gently remove and place on a serving plate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the ginger, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the turkey, and stir-fry until no longer pink, about 2 minutes.  Remove the turkey from the wok.  Add the celery, bell pepper, peas, green onions, and broth, and stir to mix well.  Cover and cook for 1 minute or until the vegetables are crisp-tender.  Return the turkey to the pan.  Stir the sauce to recombine, add it to the pan, and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Spoon the turkey mixture in to the nest.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tip:  The traditional noodle nest is deep-fried.  Because this baked version is more fragile, it is important to make it only from Chinese-style fresh egg noodles.  Dried noodles and brands labeled &quot;ready cooked&quot; are not sticky enough to hold the nest together.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Here&apos;s a garnish that&apos;s not just for show.  After you savor the curried turkey, break the lacy noodle nest apart and nibble on the pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     strip dried tangerine peel - (abt 2")
                        = (or 2 tbspns finely-chopped fresh
                        orange or tangerine peel)
  1              pound  ground turkey
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped waterchestnuts
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)
  2        tablespoons  chicken broth or water
  2        tablespoons  oyster sauce
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
                        === FOR SERVING ===
  1                     large bunch watercress -- blanched
                        Worcestershire sauce -- for dipping
                        = (or soy sauce mixed with prepared
                        Chinese mustard to taste)

If using dried tangerine peel, soak it in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain and mince.  Combine all the ingredients except the watercress and dipping sauce in a medium bowl; mix well.  With wet hands, shape the mixture into 20 meatballs, each approximately 1 1/2 inches in diameter.

Place a steaming rack in a wok; add water to just below the level of the rack and bring it to a boil.  Arrange the turkey balls in two greased 9-inch glass pie pans.  Set one pan on the rack, cover, and steam until turkey is no longer pink (cut a small slit through a turkey ball to test), about 12 minutes.  Serve the first portion while you steam the second.  Place the watercress on a serving platter and arrange the turkey balls on top.  Serve with Worcestershire sauce or the soy-mustard dip.

This recipe yields 20 meatballs.

Variation:  Traditionally this dish is made with beef; you can also try it with finely chopped raw shrimp or minced chicken.

Microwave Method:  Instead of steaming the turkey balls, place them in a 9-inch microwave-safe glass pie pan, cover, and cook on high for 2 minutes.  Stir, cover, and cook on medium until the turkey is no longer pink, about 4 minutes.  Serve as above.

Comments:  I've given this dim sum item a modern twist by using ground turkey rather than the traditional beef.  Lean and healthful, the turkey blends nicely with the flavor of tangerine.  Terrific as dim sum or an appetizer, turkey balls are also a great main dish.

                    Double-Steamed Chicken With Herbs

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  dried mixed Chinese herbs - (4 oz)
     1/2         pound  boneless skinless chicken breasts or
                        thighs -- cut into 1" chunks
     1/4         pound  boneless lean pork -- cut into 1" chunks
  6                     dried black mushrooms
  6                     dried longans
     1/2         ounce  Smithfield ham -- thinly sliced
  4               cups  water

Rinse the herbs well in warm water; drain.  Place the chicken and pork in a medium pan and cover them with water.  Bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute.  Drain.  Wash the mushrooms and cut off the stems.  Place the herbs, chicken, pork, mushrooms, longans, and ham in a Yunnan pot, 7 inches in diameter, or a 2-quart casserole.  Add the water and cover the pot.

Place a steaming rack in a wok.  Pour in water to just below the level of the rack and bring it to a boil.  Set the pot on the rack.  Cover and steam for 3 hours, adding additional water as necessary.  Strain the broth and serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Tip:  Packages of mixed dried herbs, which include various leaves, barks, and roots, are sold in Chinese herbal shops, and sometimes in larger Chinese groceries with herbal counters.  Just ask for herbs for making chicken soup.  Longans are a dried fruit related to lychees, also sold in well-stocked Chinese groceries.

Comments:  This Chinese elixir of life is traditionally cooked in a Yunnan pot.  Like an angel food cake pan or Mongolian hot pot, the Yunnan pot has a chimney coming up through the middle, which helps the heat (in this case from steam) circulate around the food more efficiently.  You can also make the soup in a casserole set inside a larger steaming pot.

Some Chinese people consider this soup a tonic, and drink only the strained broth; but I see no reason not to eat the delicious meat as well.

                           Dried Bok Choy Soup

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  Dried bok choy
  4                     jujubes or dried figs
  1                     large can chicken broth - (49 1/2 oz)
  4               cups  water
     1/2         pound  boneless lean pork -- cut 3/4" cubes
  2                     thin slices ginger
                        Salt -- to taste

Soak the bok choy in warm water to cover for 2 hours.  Wash it in clean water to remove dirt around the stems.  Remove the stem ends and cut the bok choy into 1 1/2-inch pieces.  If jujubes are used, soak them in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.

In a large pot, combine the bok choy, jujubes, chicken broth, water, pork, and ginger.  Bring to a boil over high heat and skim any foam that forms on the top.  Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until the bok choy is tender.  Add salt to taste before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Tips:  Jujubes, also called Chinese dates, are not actually of the date family.  They are small, dried, wrinkled red fruit with an apple-prune-like taste.  They are imported from northern China and grown in drier sections of the western United States.  They give subtle sweetness to soups and braised dishes.

In some Chinese markets, packages of dried bok choy are labeled "dehydrated cole."

Comments:  In ancient times, bok choy was dried to preserve it until the next growing season.  Today fresh bok choy is available year round, but it is also dried because cooks and diners like the unique flavor drying gives it.  My mother used to blanch the surplus from our garden and hang it on the clothesline to dry.  This homespun soup was one of her specialties.

Soak the bok choy in warm water to cover for 2 hours.  Wash it in clean water to remove dirt around the stems.  Remove the stem ends and cut the bok choy into 1 1/2-inch pieces.  If jujubes are used, soak them in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large pot, combine the bok choy, jujubes, chicken broth, water, pork, and ginger.  Bring to a boil over high heat and skim any foam that forms on the top.  Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until the bok choy is tender.  Add salt to taste before serving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tips:  Jujubes, also called Chinese dates, are not actually of the date family.  They are small, dried, wrinkled red fruit with an apple-prune-like taste.  They are imported from northern China and grown in drier sections of the western United States.  They give subtle sweetness to soups and braised dishes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In some Chinese markets, packages of dried bok choy are labeled &quot;dehydrated cole.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  In ancient times, bok choy was dried to preserve it until the next growing season.  Today fresh bok choy is available year round, but it is also dried because cooks and diners like the unique flavor drying gives it.  My mother used to blanch the surplus from our garden and hang it on the clothesline to dry.  This homespun soup was one of her specialties.

                          Duck And Walnut Salad

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  walnut halves
     1/2                Chinese roast duck
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Chinese prepared mustard
  1           teaspoon  honey
                        === SALAD ===
     1/2           cup  matckstick pieces jicama
     1/2           cup  matchstick pieces celery
  3               cups  salad greens

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Bring about 2 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Add the walnuts and cook for 1 minute.  Drain the nuts, pat them dry, spread them on a cookie sheet, and toast them in the oven until crisp and brown, 10 to 12 minutes.  Let stand until cool.

Cut the duck breast from the carcass in one piece, with the skin attached.  Cur it crosswise into very thin slices.  Remove the remaining meat from the carcass and cut it into shreds.

Place 1/4 cup of the toasted walnuts in a food processor or blender with the dressing ingredients.  Process until well blended.

Set aside a few strips of jicama and celery for garnish.  Place the rest, the salad greens, and the shredded duck meat in a large bowl.  Add half the dressing, toss to mix well, and transfer to a serving platter.  Arrange the duck breast slices on top.  Garnish with the remaining walnuts and reserved jicama and celery strips.  Serve the remaining dressing on the side.

This recipe yields 2 main dish or 4 side dish servings.

Comments:  Next time you see crisp, shiny Cantonese roast ducks hanging in the window of a Chinese deli, pick up half a duck and turn it into this easy Western-style salad.  Although Cantonese roast duck is sometimes confused with its Northern cousin Peking duck, it is much more highly seasoned and can be served hot or cold without a sauce.  The more delicate Peking version is always served hot, with hoisin sauce and Mandarin pancakes or steamed buns.

                            Egg Custard Tarts

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 14    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Dim Sum


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY DOUGH ===
  1 3/4           cups  flour
     1/2           cup  solid vegetable shortening -- chilled
     1/4           cup  butter -- chilled
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  ice water
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
     2/3           cup  water
     1/3           cup  sugar
  4                     eggs
     1/3           cup  evaporated milk
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract

Prepare dough:  Place flour in a food processor.  Cut shortening and butter into 1/2-inch chunks and distribute over flour.  Process with on-off bursts until fat particles are the size of peas.  Add egg, ice water, and vanilla.  Process until mixture just begins to form a ball.  (Do not process completely to the ball stage, and don't worry if dough has shortening streaks in it.)  Remove dough, shape into a patty 1-inch thick, and cover with plastic wrap.  Chill for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.

Prepare filling:  In a small pan, heat water and sugar until sugar dissolves; let cool.  In a bowl, beat eggs slightly.  Whisk in sugar-water syrup, evaporated milk, and vanilla extract, blending until smooth.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  On a lightly floured board, roll out pastry to about 1/4-inch thick.  Cut into fourteen 4-inch circles (reroll scraps and cut again if necessary).  Fit circles into 2 1/2-inch tart pans.  Lightly press dough into bottoms and sides of pans; trim edges.

Pour filling into pastry-lined pans to within 1/4-inch of top.  Place filled pans on a baking sheet; bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted in center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.  Place pans on rack; let cool for 10 minutes.  Remove tarts from pans.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 14 tarts.

Comments:  Ask any 7-year-old in Hong Kong what his or her favorite treat is, and you will get an earful: Egg Custard Tarts!  These sweet tarts are great for a dim sum brunch, and they are perfect for a proper afternoon tea.  And in the very unlikely event that you have any left over, they make a great after-dinner dessert, too.

                             Fiery Hunan Beef

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  flank steak -- thinly sliced
                        across the grain
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  regular soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  chili paste
  2          teaspoons  sugar
                        === COOKING ===
  2               cups  broccoli florets
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  6              whole  dried chile peppers
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2          teaspoons  water

Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.  Add the beef, stir to coat, and set aside for 30 minutes.  Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.

Cook the broccoli in boiling water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain well; set aside.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add the garlic and chiles and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the beef and stir-fry until it is barely pink, about 2 minutes.  Add the broccoli and sauce, mix well, and add the cornstarch solution.  Cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Microwave Method:  In step 2, wash the broccoli and shake off the excess water; place it in a microwave-safe bowl, cover, and cook on high until just barely tender, about 2 minutes.

Comments:  Cooking chiles whole unlocks just enough of their heat to give a wonderful tongue-tingling flavor to this stir-fry.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
  2                     taespoons minced garlic
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
     1/4           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water
                        === FILLING ===
  1                     chinese sausage - (abt 2 oz)
  1             medium  russet potato
  1              small  carrot
  4             ounces  jicama
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/2         pound  lean ground pork
  1                cup  shredded Chinese (napa) cabbage
  1              small  chayote -- peeled, shredded
  3                     green onions/ including tops -- slivered
  2        tablespoons  chicken broth -- if needed
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2                     taespoons water
                        === LUMPIA ===
  8                     spring rolls or lumpia wrappers
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
                        Oil -- for deep frying
  8                     lettuce leaves -- for garnish

Combine the dipping sauce ingredients (except the cornstarch solution) in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Remove from the heat

Cut the sausage, potato, carrot, and jicama into matchstick pieces.  Place a wok or wide frying pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of oil, swirling to coat the sides of the pan.  Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the pork, sausage, and potato and stir-fry until the pork is browned and crumbly and the potato is soft, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the cabbage, chayote, carrot, jicama, and green onions; stir-fry until the carrot is crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.  Add the broth if the mixture becomes too dry.  Str in the soy sauce, sherry, and sesame oil and add the cornstarch solution.  Cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Transfer the filling to a bowl and refrigerate until cool.

Lay a wrapper on the table with one corner toward you; keep the remaining wrappers covered to prevent drying.  Mound about 1/3 cup of filling across the middle of the wrapper, stopping 1 inch from the corners.  Fold the bottom corner the filling to cover, then fold over the right and left corners.  Roll over once to enclose the filling.  Brush the remaining triangle of the wrapper with egg and fold over to seal.  Cover the filled lumpia with a damp cloth while filling the remaining wrappers.

Heat the oven to 200 degrees.  Set a wok in a ring stand and add vegetable oil to a depth of about 2 inches.  Heat the oil to 360 degrees; adjust the heat to medium-high.  Fry the lumpia, half at a time, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Keep the fried rolls warm in the oven while cooking the remaining rolls.  Meanwhile, reheat the dipping sauce.  Serve the lumpia on a platter lined with lettuce leaves.  Serve the dipping sauce alongside.

This recipe yields 8 rolls.

Comments:  Many Southeast Asian countries enjoy variations of the Chinese egg roll; Lumpia is the delicate Filipino version.  Lumpia wrappers are thinner than egg roll wrappers.  You can purchase them, frozen, in Asian markets.

                       Fish And Chips Chinese-Style

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm white fish fillet, about 1" thick
  2              large  potatoes -- cut chips/wedges
                        Plain flour -- for dusting fish
                        Cooking oil -- for deep-frying
                        Sweet and sour sauce -- for serving
                        === BATTER ===
  3             ounces  plain flour
  1 1/4       teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  6             ounces  water
  2           teaspoon  cooking oil
                        === MARINADE ===
  2         tablespoon  Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
  2           teaspoon  chopped coriander
  2           teaspoon  finely-chopped ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === SPICY SALT ===
  2             ounces  salt
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     1/4      teaspoon  Sichuan peppercorns
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

First make the batter: combine the flour, baking powder and sugar in a bowl.  Gradually add the water; whisk until blended.  Whisk in the oil.  Let stand for 1 1/2 hours.

Cut the fish into strips about 1-inch wide.  Combine the marinade ingredients in a bowl.  Add the fish and stir to coat.  Let stand for 15 minutes.

To make the spicy salt:  In a small frying pan, stir the salt, chili powder, peppercorns and pepper over medium-high heat, shaking the pan frequently, until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.  Whirl in a blender until coarsely ground.

Place the potatoes in a colander and rinse with cold running water; drain.  Pat dry with paper towels.  In a wok, heat the oil for deep-frying to 375 degrees.  Deep-fry the potatoes, a batch at a time, until tender and golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.

Dust the fish with flour, then dip into the batter; shake to remove the excess.  Deep-fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.

Arrange the fish and chips on a serving platter.  Serve with the spicy salt and sweet and sour sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  No, I am not trying to sell ice to the Eskimos.  The famous British fish and chips can do well with a Chinese makeover.  Say farewell to the old vinegar bottle, marinate the fish in Chinese rice wine and ginger, and serve the fish and chips with spicy salt and sweet and sour sauce.

                      Fish With Sichuan Chili Sauce

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
     2/3           cup  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  rice vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Sichuan chili paste
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground toasted Sichuan peppercorns
                        === COOKING ===
  1              pound  rock cod fillets, 3/4" thick
     2/3           cup  curnstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     egg
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger

Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.  Cut the fish into serving-size pieces.  Lightly score the fish on both sides with shallow diagonal cuts 1/2-inch apart.  Score again at an angle to the first cuts, making a diamond pattern.

Combine the cornstarch, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl.  Lightly beat the egg in another shallow bowl.  Dip each piece of fish in the egg, drain briefly, then dredge in the cornstarch mixture; shake off the excess.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the fish and cook for 3 minutes, turn, and add 2 more teaspoons of oil.  Continue cooking until the fish is golden brown and the center is opaque, 3 to 4 more minutes.  Transfer the fish to a platter, cover loosely, and keep warm.

Wipe the wok clean and turn the heat to high.  Add the remaining teaspoon of oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Stir in the sauce and cook, stirring, until it boils and thickens.  Pour the sauce over the fish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Don't coat the fish too much ahead of time.  Doing it at the last minute ensures a crisp crust.

Comments:  Other than steaming Cantonese style, this is my favorite way of preparing fish.  Lightly coated with a cornstarch batter and pan-fried in a wok, fish fillets or steaks come out crisp outside and meltingly tender inside, ready to receive the pungent sauce.

                       Fish, Spinach, And Tofu Soup

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     dried black mushrooms
     1/2         bunch  spinach - (abt 6 oz)
     1/2         pound  firm-textured 3/4"-thk white fish fillets
                        = (such as cod, halibut, or sea bass)
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  5               cups  chicken broth
  1            package  soft tofu - (16 oz) -- drained, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil

Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut off and discard the stems and thinly slice the caps.  Wash the spinach; discard the heavy stems.  Cut the fish into 1/2-inch cubes; sprinkle with pepper and set aside.

In a large pot, bring the broth and mushrooms to a boil over medium-high heat.  Add the spinach, fish, tofu, and sesame oil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the spinach is slightly wilted, about 2 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Tips:  Chard or bok choy leaves may be used in place of spinach.  You can use either soft or regular tofu.  I personally prefer the soft because it has a wonderfully silky-smooth texture.

Comments:  When I was growing up, my mother prepared this simple, nutritious soup almost every day.  I must have  eaten it half a million times -- and I still love it!  It's a great starter for a light family meal.

                          Five-Spice Crispy Duck

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     duckling - (4 to 5 lbs) -- cleaned, trimmed
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  grated orange peel
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  4              whole  star anise
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  4          teaspoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder

Place a steaming rack in a wok.  Pour in water to just below the level of the rack and bring it to a boil.  Place the duck breast-side up on a heatproof dish and set the dish on the rack.  Cover and steam for 30 minutes.  Let cool slightly.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Combine the marinade ingredients and rub the marinade over the skin of the duck.  Place the duck breast-side down on a rack in a foil-lined roasting pan.  Roast uncovered for 30 minutes.  Protecting your hands with several layers of paper towel, turn the duck breast-side up.  Reduce the heat to 325 degrees and roast until the skin is browned and crisp and the meat near the thigh bone is no longer pink when pierced, about 1 hour.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Tip:  To prepare a whole duck for cooking Chinese style, cut off and discard the excess neck skin and the tail and remove all the loose fat from around the cavity.  With the tip of a small, sharp knife, lightly prick the skin around the legs and other fatty areas (You can see the pockets of fat under the skin).  Take care not to pierce the meat under the fat layer.

Star anise, brown, eight-pointed, star-shaped seed pods with a strong licorice flavor, are often used in barbecues, stews, and braised dishes.  Rather than one whole star anise, an equivalent of broken points will do.  Sometimes it is hard to find a plastic bag of whole ones.

Comments:  Everyone loves the crackling skin and succulent meat of roast duck, but not everyone loves the layer of fat in the middle.  With this technique, you steam the duck first so it sheds much of its fat, then roast it to brown and crisp the skin.

Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  beef shank
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
                        === SPICE BAG ===
  1                     strip dried tangerine peel - (abt 2")
  2              whole  star anise
     1/2      teaspoon  whole cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  fennel seed
                        === COOKING ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetables oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- lightly crushed
  2                     thick slices ginger -- lightly crushed
  1                can  beef broth - (14 1/2 oz)
                        = (or 2 cups)
     1/4           cup  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/2         pounds  diakon -- cut 1" chunks
  2                     green onions, including tops -- cut 2" pieces
  1              large  carrot -- cut 1" chunks
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
                        Hot cooked rice or noodles

Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.  Cut off and discard the skin from the beef shanks.  Bone the shanks, reserving the bones.  Cut the meat into 2-inch chunks and add it to the marinade, stirring to coat.  Let stand for 30 minutes.  Soak the tangerine peel in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Tie up the tangerine peel, star anise, cloves, and fennel seeds in a square of cheesecloth.

Place a large pot over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the surface.  Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the beef and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.  Add the reserved bones, the spice bag, broth, sherry, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and sugar.  Stir to mix evenly.  Add the daikon and green onions and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 45 minutes.  Add the carrot and continue to cook until the meat is tender when pierced, about 45 more minutes.  Discard the spice bag and bones.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Stir in the sesame oil.  Serve over rice or noodles.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Tip:  Daikon if the Japanese name for a large, cylindrical white radish up to 1 1/2 feet long and 2 inches in diameter; it is also known as Chinese white turnip or Korean turnip.  Japan's most important vegetable, it is a staple in Chinese cooking as well.  The Chinese variety is shorter, thicker, and more fibrous than the Japanese, and has a stronger flavor.

Comments:  Every country has its classic one-pot recipes which are handed down from one generation of cooks to the next, and China is no exception.  We love their homespun flavors and their ease of preparation.  One of my favorites includes beef, carrot, and the giant white radish, daikon, cooked in a faintly sweet, spiced gravy.  It's the perfect partner to rice and noodles.

Tie up the tangerine peel, star anise, cloves, and fennel seeds in a square of cheesecloth.

Place a large pot over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the surface.  Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the beef and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.  Add the reserved bones, the spice bag, broth, sherry, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and sugar.  Stir to mix evenly.  Add the daikon and green onions and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 45 minutes.  Add the carrot and continue to cook until the meat is tender when pierced, about 45 more minutes.  Discard the spice bag and bones.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Stir in the sesame oil.  Serve over rice or noodles.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Tip:  Daikon if the Japanese name for a large, cylindrical white radish up to 1 1/2 feet long and 2 inches in diameter; it is also known as Chinese white turnip or Korean turnip.  Japan&apos;s most important vegetable, it is a staple in Chinese cooking as well.  The Chinese variety is shorter, thicker, and more fibrous than the Japanese, and has a stronger flavor.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Every country has its classic one-pot recipes which are handed down from one generation of cooks to the next, and China is no exception.  We love their homespun flavors and their ease of preparation.  One of my favorites includes beef, carrot, and the giant white radish, daikon, cooked in a faintly sweet, spiced gravy.  It&apos;s the perfect partner to rice and noodles.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  3        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  2          teaspoons  chili paste
  4          teaspoons  sugar
                        === BUNDLES ===
  3               cups  shredded cooked chicken
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley) -- plus
  12                    cilantro sprigs
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  12                    dried 7" rice paper rounds
  2             ounces  bean threads -- soaked, drained
                        and cut into 3" lengths
  1              bunch  watercress -- tough stems removed
     1/2                red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into matchstick pieces
  3                     green onions, including tops -- slivered
                        Mint leaves -- for garnish

Combine the dipping sauce ingredients in a small serving bowl and stir until the sugar dissolves.  Set aside.  Combine the chicken, fish sauce, sesame oil, chopped cilantro, and black pepper in a medium bowl.

To assemble each bundle, immerse a rice paper round in cool water for about 10 seconds then transfer it to a flat working surface.  Let it stand for 1 minute or until it becomes soft and pliable.  Place about 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture in the center and top with a small mound of the bean threads, 2 or 3 pieces each of watercress, bell pepper, and green onion, and a cilantro sprig.  Roll the wrapper around the filling, tucking in one end.  Serve the bundles on a platter, garnished with mint leaves.  Offer dipping sauce at the table.

This recipe yields 12 bundles.

Tip:  If all you can find are 9- or 12-inch rice paper rounds, make larger bundles and cut them into thirds before serving.

Comments:  If Vietnam had a national dish, it would be this popular variation of the spring roll.  The delicious cha gio are wrapped in phyllo-thin rice paper wrappers that have been carefully softened with water or other liquid before rolling.

                                Fried Rice

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  cooking oil
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  3               cups  cold cooked long-grain rice -- fluffed
     3/4           cup  frozen peas and carrots -- thawed
     3/4           cup  diced char siu (barbecued pork) -- store bought
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  4                     green onions -- thinly sliced

Place wok over high heat until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add eggs, salt and pepper; cook until lightly scrambled.  Use spatula to move eggs to the side.  Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil.  Add rice; stir for 2 minutes.

Add peas and carrots, and char siu; stir to mix well.  Add soy sauce and green onions; stir-fry 1 minute.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The fluffy, slightly dry texture of fried rice practically depends on your using day-old or at least not-straight-from-the-stove-or-steamer rice.  Freshly cooked rice still contains so much moisture that when you stir-fry it with the other ingredients, you end up with a wet, clumpy dish.  Break up any clumps that have formed in the leftover rice by gently rubbing the grains between your fingers or breaking them apart with a wooden spoon or rubber scraper before stir-frying.  Separate grains stir-fry more quickly and evenly.

Variation:  After making fried rice for a while, you can cast recipes aside.  Fried rice is really meant to be one of those do-it-yourself dishes, so whatever looks good in your pantry is a potential fried rice ingredient.  I chose the particular ingredients for this dish with the goal of creating a fried rice like those you get at Chinese restaurants.  You can create your own fried rice dishes by using regional or seasonal ingredients.  For instance, if you'd like fried rice with shrimp, it's easy to do.  Before you add the eggs, quickly stir-fry some shrimp until they begin to curl and turn pink.  Set them aside, proceed with the fried rice recipe, and return the shrimp to the wok for a quick heat-through before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken thighs or
                        breasts -- cut into 1" cubes
                        Cornstarch -- for dry coating
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
                        === SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
  3        tablespoons  catsup
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce or chili oil
                        === COOKING ===
                        Oil -- for deep-frying
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  1              small  onion -- cut 1" cubes
  1                     bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  1                can  lychees - (11 oz) -- drained
  1                can  mandarin oranges - (11 oz) -- drained
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water

Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.  Add the chicken and stir to coat.  Set aside for 30 minutes.  Coat the chicken with cornstarch and shake off the excess.  Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.

Set a wok in a ring stand; add oil to a depth of about 2 inches.  Place over high heat until the oil reaches 375 degrees.  Add the chicken a few pieces at a time and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Lift out and drain on paper towels.  Keep warm while cooking the remaining chicken.

Place a skillet or medium saucepan over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, swirling to coat the surface.  Add the ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the onion and cook for 1 minute or until softened.  Add the bell pepper and cook for 1 minute.  Add the lychees and sauce and mix well.  Add the mandarin oranges, lemon juice, and chicken and toss to coat evenly.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Variation:  To prepare the Sweet and Sour Sauce separately, combine the sauce ingredients as above.  Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or skillet, add 1 teaspoon minced ginger, and cook until fragrant; add the sauce mixture and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves.  Dissolve 1 tablespoon cornstarch in 2 tablespoons water, stir into the sauce and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Refrigerate until ready to use.  Try it tossed in with stir-fried meats and vegetables, or reheated over fried fish or chicken.

Comments:  Most of the early Chinese emigrants to the U.S. were from Canton; they brought their love of fresh ingredients and bright flavor combinations with them.  Their sweet and sour dishes have become American favorites.  Try this delicious version made with mandarin oranges and lychees.

Comments:  Most of the early Chinese emigrants to the U.S. were from Canton; they brought their love of fresh ingredients and bright flavor combinations with them.  Their sweet and sour dishes have become American favorites.  Try this delicious version made with mandarin oranges and lychees.

                           Garlic Chive Omelet

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Omelets


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  chicken broth
                        = (or water)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2         small  onion -- thinly sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/2           cup  Chinese chives in 1" pieces
     1/2           cup  finely-shredded jicama
     1/4         pound  crabmest -- flaked
                        = (or small cooked shrimp or
                        diced barbecued pork)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil

In a bowl, beat the eggs with the chicken broth, salt, and pepper.  Divide the onion, ginger, chives, jicama, and crabmeat into two equal portions.

Place a 7- to 8-inch nonstick omelet pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Add 1 1/2 teaspoons of the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the surface.  Add one portion of the onion and ginger and cook for 30 seconds.  Pour in half the egg mixture.  As the edges begin to set, lift one side with a spatula, and shake the pan to let the uncooked egg flow underneath.  Sprinkle the omelet with one portion of chives, jicama, and crabmeat.  Continue cooking until the egg is set to your liking.  Fold the omelet in half and slide it onto a serving plate.  Repeat to make a second omelet using the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of oil and the remaining egg and filling ingredients.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Tips:  If you use frozen or canned crabmeat, drain it well before flaking.

Delicately flavored, but stronger than regular chives, Chinese chives (or garlic chives) are a foot long and have flat, dark green leaves.  They are commonly used with eggs, in stir-fries, and with noodles.  In Chinese markets you can also find yellow chives which are grown under cover to prevent them from developing a dark green color.  They are sweeter, with a more delicate flavor and less fibrous texture, and are often used in soups.  Flowering chives are also available in Asian stores.  They are firm and crunchy, with round stalks.

Comments:  Because I live in sunny California, Chinese chives grow vigorously in my garden and, with no effort on my part, re-seed themselves every year.  I love their subtle, delicate garlic flavor, especially with eggs.  If you're not a backyard farmer, look for the chives (gow choy) in Asian markets in late fall or early winter, or substitute regular chives for a more delicate flavor.

                              Gingered Yams

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  yams -- peeled, and
                        cut into 2" cubes
  2                     thin slices ginger -- crushed
     1/2           cup  fresh orange juice
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  chopped crystallized ginger
                        Salt -- to taste

Place yams and ginger slices in a large pot with water to cover.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the yams are tender, about 30 minutes.  Drain; discard the ginger.

Place the hot yams, orange juice, and sugar into a food processor and process just until smooth.  (Or mash the hot yams with a potato masher until only fine lumps remain, then add the orange juice and sugar and continue mashing until smooth.)  Remove to a serving bowl, stir in the crystallized ginger, and add salt to taste.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Ginger and yams have a long history in Chinese cuisine.  In primitive times, wild yams were dug from the forest during famines.  The ancient Chinese believed that a bite of ginger a day kept the doctor away.  Today in China, some yams and ginger are planted in the same beds.  I don't know if this ginger-yam team will keep you young, but it will surely satisfy your appetite.

                       Glazed Sichuan Chicken Wings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             whole  chicken wings
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === SEASONING MIXTURE ===
  4             slices  ginger - (thin) -- crushed
  1                     green onion, including top -- halved
     1/2      teaspoon  toasted Sichuan peppercorns
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
                        === COOKING ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2              whole  dried chile peppers
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  4          teaspoons  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water

Separate the chicken wings into sections; discard the bony tips.  Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.  Add the chicken wings.  Stir to coat and set aside for 30 minutes.  Combine the seasonings mixture ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and whole chiles, swirling to coat the sides of the pan.  Add the chicken wings; cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Add the seasoning mixture; stir for 15 seconds.  Stir in the broth, dark soy sauce, sherry, and sugar.  Bring to a boil; reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the chicken wings are tender when pierced, about 12 minutes.

Remove and discard the chiles, ginger, and green onion.  Increase the heat to high.  Add the cornstarch solution; cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens and the wings are glazed, about 2 minutes.

This recipe yields 24 pieces.

Tip:  Stand back a bit from your wok when stir-frying chiles.  The volatile oils released by the chiles may sting your nose and eyes.

Comments:  These chicken wings are hot stuff!  The peppery sauce can be used again and again to simmer meats and poultry -- it only gets more flavorful with each use.  Just strain after using and refrigerate or freeze until you're ready to cook with it again.

                    Grilled Eggplant And Green Onions

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Asian eggplants - (abt 6" long ea)
  8                     green onions, including tops
  1         tablespoon  Chinese dark rice vinegar
                        = (or balsamic vinegar)
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Chinese dark rice vinegar
                        = (or balsamic vinegar)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil

Combine the marinade ingredients in a 9- by 13-inch baking dish.  Cut the eggplants lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices, cutting up to but through the stem ends.  Gently spread them open to make fan shapes.  Trim the root ends of the green onions.  Cut the tops so each onion is 6 to 8 inches long; slash the white part.  Place the eggplants and onions in the pan with the marinade; brush marinade over all the cut surfaces of the vegetables.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

Spread the eggplant fans out on a grill 3 to 4 inches above a solid bed of low-glowing coals.  Cook until they are soft, 2 to 3 minutes on each side.  Cook the green onions for about 1 minute on each side.  Arrange the grilled vegetables on a platter and sprinkle with vinegar.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  You can broil these flavorful vegetables indoors if you prefer.

Comments:  I like making things easy.  That's why when I cook outdoors I often grill vegetables along with the main course.  Marinated eggplant "fans" and green onions cook quickly over low-glowing coals, and the grilled flavor is fantastic.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tip:  You can broil these flavorful vegetables indoors if you prefer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  I like making things easy.  That&apos;s why when I cook outdoors I often grill vegetables along with the main course.  Marinated eggplant &quot;fans&quot; and green onions cook quickly over low-glowing coals, and the grilled flavor is fantastic.

                    Grilled Steak With Black Mushrooms

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  New York strip, poeterhouse, or
                        other tender beef steak, abt 1" thick
  8                     dried black mushrooms - (to 10)
                        = (or fresh shiitake mushrooms)
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  toasted Sichuan peppercorns -- ground
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  beef broth
  2        tablespoons  oyster sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
                        === COOKING ===
  2         tablespoon  butter or margarine
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger

Score the beef lightly on each side with shallow criss-cross marks.  Combine the marinade ingredients in a sealable plastic bag.  Add the beef, seal the bag, and turn it a couple of times to evenly coat the meat.  Refrigerate overnight.

If using dried mushrooms, soak them in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut off and discard the stems and thinly slice the caps.  (Fresh mushrooms can be sliced stem and all.)  Set aside.

Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.  Lift the beef from the marinade and grill it on a lightly greased grill over a solid bed of low-glowing coals for 4 minutes.  Turn and continue to cook until it is done to your liking, 4 more minutes for medium-rare.

While the steak cooks, melt the butter in a small frying pan over medium heat.  Add the shallots, garlic, and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the mushrooms and cook until tender, about 2 minutes.  Add the sauce mixture and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Carve the steak into 1/2-inch-thick slices and top with the mushroom sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variation:  The steak can also be broiled 2 inches from the heat, or cooked in a ridged grilling pan.

Comments:  You may not choose to eat this steak with chopsticks like I do, but even if you're going to eat it with a fork, follow the traditional Chinese style and cut the meat into thin strips before smothering it with the succulent black mushroom sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === WRAPPERS ===
  1                cup  wheat starch
     1/3           cup  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  boiling water
                        === FILLING ===
     3/4         pound  medium raw shrimp
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped bamboo shoots
  1                     egg white
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  rice wine or dry sherry
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === COOKING ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cooking oil
                        = (or solid vegetable shortening)
                        Soy sauce -- to taste
                        Chili oil -- to taste

Wrappers:  Mix the wheat starch, cornstarch, and salt together in a bowl.  Add the boiling water to the mixture and stir until the dough is moist all over.  Cover it with a towel and let sit for approximately 20 minutes.

While the dough is sitting, begin preparing the filling.  Remove the shells from the shrimp, and devein by cutting a slice down the back of the shrimp and removing the vein.  Rinse the shrimp in cold water, drain and place in a bowl with the other filling ingredients.

Turn the dough onto a lightly floured cutting board and knead until smooth.  Add the cooking oil, a teaspoon at a time, kneading the dough after each addition.  The dough should be smooth and shiny.

Cut the dough into two equal pieces.  Roll each piece into a 15-inch cylinder.  Split each cylinder into 1-inch pieces, and form each piece into a ball.  Cover the dough while you are making the dumplings to prevent it from drying.

Dumplings:  Roll a portion of the dough into a 3- to 3 1/2-inch circle.  Place about a teaspoon of filling in the center, and fold the skin in half, forming a semicircle or half-moon shape.  Press to seal the edges.  Cover the dumpling with a damp cloth while you are making the remaining dumplings.

Steaming:  Line the bottom of the steamer with Napa cabbage or a damp cloth to keep the dumplings from sticking.  Steam the dumplings until translucent (this will take approximately 18 to 20 minutes).  Serve immediately with the soy sauce and chili oil.

This recipe yields about 30 dumplings.

Comments:  Har gow are plump dumplings with a pleasing, pleated translucent skin and tasty shrimp filling.  Though a delicate steamed treat, they're sturdy enough to withstand being served with soy sauce and even hot red chili sauce.

Comments:  Har gow are plump dumplings with a pleasing, pleated translucent skin and tasty shrimp filling.  Though a delicate steamed treat, they&apos;re sturdy enough to withstand being served with soy sauce and even hot red chili sauce.

                            Hoisin Lamb Kabobs

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  boneless lamb sirloin
                        === MARINADE ===
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  catsup
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce or chili oil
                        === COOKING ===
  3                     bamboo skewers -- soked for 30 minutes
  1                     zucchini or yellow crookneck squash -- cut 1"-thk rounds
     1/2                red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1" squares

Cut the lamb across the grain into 3 strips, each 3 inches long, 1-inch wide, and 1/4-inch thick.

Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.  Add the lamb, stirring to coat it evenly.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight.

Remove the lamb from the marinade; reserve the marinade.  On each skewer, thread 1 strip of lamb, accordion-style, with pieces of zucchini and bell pepper between the folds.  Brush with reserved marinade.  Place the skewers on a rack in a foil-lined baking pan.  Broil 2 to 3 inches from the heat, turning once and brushing occasionally with marinade until the lamb is done to your liking, about 7 minutes for medium-rare.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Comments:  I prepared this recipe for the show entitled "Cooking for One," thus the small quantity.  But broiling is an easy, convenient, and healthful way to cook, whether for one or for twenty, so feel free to increase the recipe.

                         Hot And Sour Shrimp Soup

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  mediun raw shrimp
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  5               cups  chicken broth
  2                     lemongrass stalks -- cut 2" pieces,
                        and crushed
                        Peel of 1/2 lime
  1                     serrano or jalapeÒo chile -- cut in half
     1/2           cup  canned straw mushrooms
  2 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
                        === GARNISH ===
  2                     green onions, including tops -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped cilantro
  1 1/2    tablespoons  coarsely-chopped mint leaves
  1                     serrano or jalapeÒo chile -- seeded, slivered

Shell the shrimp, rinse the shells, and pat them dry.  Cut the shrimp in half horizontally and rinse out the sand veins.

Place a large pot over high heat until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the surface.  Add the shrimp shells; cook until they turn pink, about 30 seconds.  Add the broth, lemongrass, lime peel, and chile.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.  Strain the broth, discarding the seasonings.  Return the broth to the pot and heat to simmering.  Add the shrimp and straw mushrooms and cook until the shrimp turn pink, about 2 minutes.  Stir in the lime juice and fish sauce.  To serve, ladle into individual soup bowls.  Garnish with green onion, cilantro, mint leaves, and chile.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  If you want to grow your own lemongrass, root several fresh stalks in a jar of water, just as you would a geranium cutting.  Plant them in a large pot, leaving room for them to spread.  They can stand light frosts, but not cold winters.

Comments:  By upbringing, I'm thrifty.  If you looked in my freezer, you'd find bags of shrimp shells tucked among the bags of Chinese sausage, barbecued pork, and noodles.  I save the shells every time I clean shrimp, because they give a fresh-from-the-sea flavor to fish stock; they're essential to this fragrant Thai soup.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pickles/Relishes                Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  Chinese (napa) cabbage head - (abt 2 lbs)
  4          teaspoons  salt
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3                     green onions, including tops -- minced
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  cayenne pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground toasted Sichuan peppercorns
  6              whole  dried chile peppers

Cut the cabbage lengthwise into sections about 2 inches wide; remove the core.  Cut each section crosswise into 2-inch lengths.  Place the cabbage in a large bowl, sprinkle it with the salt, and toss to mix well.  Cover with an inverted plate and weight it down with a heavy object, such as a large juice can or a 1-quart jar filled with water.  Let stand for 3 minutes.  Lightly rinse the cabbage under cold running water and drain.  Squeeze it to extract most of the liquid.

Combine the remaining ingredients in a large bowl.  Add the cabbage and mix well.  Transfer the mixture to a glass bowl or crock.  Cover with an inverted plate and weight down with a heavy object.  Refrigerate for 4 days before eating.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 to 3 cups.

Comments:  Kim chee is one of the treasures of Korean cooking; a Korean meal served without it would seem almost bland.  The most popular vegetable for kim chee is Chinese (napa) cabbage, which is salted, mixed with spices, and allowed to ferment to the desired degree of tartness.  Serve this spicy side dish in small portions, just as you would any pickled vegetable.

                       Korean Barbecued Short Ribs

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  Korean-style beef short ribs
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2          teaspoons  water
                        === MARINADE ===
  2                     green onions, including tops -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  4          teaspoons  toasted sesame seeds -- crushed
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
     1/3           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Combine the marinade ingredients in a large bowl.  Add the ribs, stir to coat, cover, and refrigerate for 6 hours or overnight.

Lift the ribs from the marinade and drain them briefly; reserve the marinade.  Place the ribs on a greased grill 3 to 4 inches above a solid bed of low-glowing coals (or place them 2 to 3 inches below the heat on a rack in a broiler pan).  Cook, turning once, until done to your liking, 3 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Meanwhile, bring the leftover marinade to a boil in a small saucepan.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Transfer the ribs to a serving platter, pour the sauce over the ribs, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This dish is succulent and tasty; it's always my choice when I eat out at a Korean restaurant.  If your market does not display Korean-style short ribs, ask for them by their other name, flanken ribs.  This refers to beef ribs which have been sawed across the bone to make 1/4-inch-thick strips about 6 inches long.  If you can't find this cut, use any thin strips of tender beef.

This refers to beef ribs which have been sawed across the bone to make 1/4-inch-thick strips about 6 inches long.  If you can&apos;t find this cut, use any thin strips of tender beef.

                            Kung Pao Scallops

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  sea scallops
                        === MARINADE ===
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  cornstarh
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar or Chinese rice vinegar
  2 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  5          teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sesame oil
                        === COOKING ===
  1              small  red or green bell pepper -- seeded
  1              small  onion
  2                     celery stalks
  1                can  whole bamboo shoots - (15 oz)
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  6              whole  dried chile peppers
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water

Cot the scallops in half horizontally.  Combine them with the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl and stir to coat.  Set aside for 30 minutes.  Combine the sauce ingredients in another bowl.

Cut the bell pepper and onion into 1-inch squares.  Cut the celery diagonally into 1/2-inch slices.  Cut the bamboo shoots into 1-inch cubes.  Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the scallops and stir-fry until opaque, about 2 minutes.  Remove the scallops to a bowl.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the wok.  Add the ginger, garlic, whole red peppers, and crushed red pepper.  Slightly pressing the peppers into the oil with the back of a spatula, cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the bell pepper, onion, celery, and bamboo shoots and stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Tipping the bowl of scallops slightly, pour the accumulated juices into the wok and add the sauce.  Cover and cook for 1 minute.  Return the scallops to the wok.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variation:  You can cook just about any meat, poultry, or seafood 'kung pao' style.  The sauce can also be made ahead of time; simply omit the scallops and the diced vegetables from the above recipe.  Keep the sauce on hand in a jar in the refrigerator, and when you're to use it, stir-fry your choice of meat and vegetables and stir in the sauce.

Comments:  You pronounce "pao" in this recipe name like "pow." and that's the kind of flavor punch you get in this specialty from Sichuan.  There's plenty of ginger, garlic, and fiery red peppers to dazzle the most jaded taste buds.

  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  chili paste
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === SWEET AND SOUR PLUM SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  plum sauce
  2        tablespoons  seasoned rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
                        === HOISIN-FLAVORED SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  hoisin sauce
  2        tablespoons  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  catsup
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  honey
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        === TANGY MUSTARD SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  prepared Chinese mustard
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
                        === CURRY-FLAVORED SAUCE ===
  5        tablespoons  canned unsweetened coconut milk
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  peanut butter
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
     1/4      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cumin
                        === MISO SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        = (or use rice vinegar)
     1/4      teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/3           cup  Japanese rice wine (sake)
     1/4           cup  white miso
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar

Soak the bean threads in warm water to cover for 30 minutes.  Drain and cut into 3-inch lengths.  Place on a serving platter with the lamb, shrimp, spinach, and green onions.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to cook.

Combine the dipping sauce ingredients in separate serving bowls.

In a large pot, bring the broth, ginger, and sherry to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.  Discard the ginger.  Set the Mongolian firepot or an electric wok in the center of the table.  Arrange the meat, shrimp, vegetables, and dipping sauces around the cooking vessel.  Pour the hot broth into the firepot and adjust the heat so the broth simmers gently.  Each diner cooks his or her choice of ingredients and seasons it with a dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  A Mongolian hot pot is a handsome piece of equipment to use for communal table-top cooking.  It consists of a cylindrical chimney that holds coals surrounded by a moat that holds the liquid.  The diners become the cooks.  They pick out a bite of food, cook it in the bubbly broth, then dip it in savory sauce before eating.  If this sounds complicated, try lamb firepot in an electric wok and see how easy and delicious it can be.  Serve it with your choice of two or three dipping sauces.  After you are done with the meat, shrimps, vegetables, and noodles, serve the delicious broth as a soup.

                              Lemon Chicken

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  chicken broth
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  dark soy sauce
     1/4           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  2          teaspoons  lemon zest
  1                     egg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     3/4         pound  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- butterflied
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/3           cup  cooking oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame seeds

Make a sauce by combining the chicken broth, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar and lemon zest in a small saucepan; set aside.

In a bowl, beat the egg lightly with the salt and white pepper.  Dredge the chicken breasts with the cornstarch; dip into the egg batter and dredge in the cornstarch again.  Let chicken pieces stand for 5 minutes.  Just before cooking, shake off the excess cornstarch.

In a wok, heat the oil until hot.  Pan-fry the chicken, a couple of pieces at a time, turning occasionally, until golden-brown, about 3 minutes on each side.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Bring the sauce to a boil over medium heat; add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.

Cut the chicken across the grain into 1/2-inch slices.  Place the chicken on a serving plate.  Pour the sauce on top and sprinkle with the sesame seeds.

To toast sesame seeds, place seeds in a small, dry pan and cook over low heat, swirling the pan to expose all surfaces to the heat.  When the seeds look slightly colored and release their aroma, after 3 to 4 minutes, remove them from the heat immediately, to avoid burning them.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is a Cantonese classic, a citrusy treatment of chicken that combines sweet and sour flavors with savory meat.  No wonder you find versions of it on almost every Chinese restaurant menu in the West.

Make a sauce by combining the chicken broth, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar and lemon zest in a small saucepan; set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl, beat the egg lightly with the salt and white pepper.  Dredge the chicken breasts with the cornstarch; dip into the egg batter and dredge in the cornstarch again.  Let chicken pieces stand for 5 minutes.  Just before cooking, shake off the excess cornstarch.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a wok, heat the oil until hot.  Pan-fry the chicken, a couple of pieces at a time, turning occasionally, until golden-brown, about 3 minutes on each side.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring the sauce to a boil over medium heat; add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut the chicken across the grain into 1/2-inch slices.  Place the chicken on a serving plate.  Pour the sauce on top and sprinkle with the sesame seeds.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To toast sesame seeds, place seeds in a small, dry pan and cook over low heat, swirling the pan to expose all surfaces to the heat.  When the seeds look slightly colored and release their aroma, after 3 to 4 minutes, remove them from the heat immediately, to avoid burning them.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This is a Cantonese classic, a citrusy treatment of chicken that combines sweet and sour flavors with savory meat.  No wonder you find versions of it on almost every Chinese restaurant menu in the West.

  1                cup  minced chicken
     3/4         pound  large raw shrimp -- shelled, deveined
  2          teaspoons  oil -- for grilling
  2               cups  shredded cabbage
  5                     Chinese long beans -- cut 1", blanched

                        === SALAD CONDIMENTS ===
  1                cup  shredded sweetened coconut
  1                cup  roasted peanuts or macadamia nuts -- coarsely chopped

                 Lettuce Soup With Poached Chicken Wings

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             whole  chicken wings
     1/2                iceberg lettuce head
                        === PEPPER SALT ===
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground toasted Sichuan peppercorns
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground blak pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
                        === COOKING ===
  1                     large can chicken broth - (49 1/2 oz)
  2                     thin slices ginger -- crushed
  1                     green onion, including top -- lightly crushed
  1                cup  frozen peas -- thawed
  1              small  carrot -- very thinly sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4           cup  oyster sauce

Cut each chicken wing into 3 sections; set all pieces aside.  Reserve two outer lettuce leaves to garnish the serving platter.  Cut the remaining lettuce into 1-inch squares; set aside.

Combine the pepper salt ingredients in a small frying pan.  Cook over medium heat for 2 minutes or until fragrant; set aside.

Combine the broth, chicken wings, ginger, and green onion in a large pot and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the chicken wings are tender when pierced, about 12 minutes.  Lift out and transfer the chicken wings to a serving bowl; discard the wing tips.  Cover and keep warm.

Strain the broth and discard the ginger and green onion.  Return the broth to the pot and bring it to a boil.  Add the peas, carrot, lettuce squares, sesame oil, and white pepper; cook for 2 minutes.

To serve, arrange the chicken wings on the lettuce leaves and sprinkle them with a tiny bit of pepper salt.  Pass the oyster sauce as a dip.  Serve the soup on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tips:  You can use any green leafy vegetable of your choice to garnish the serving platter.  Sliced mushrooms would be a nice addition to the soup.  Steak sauce or Worcestershire sauce can also be used as a dip.

Microwave Method:  In step 3, combine the broth, chicken wings, ginger, and green onion in a 2 1/2-quart microwave-safe casserole; cover and cook on high for 8 minutes.  Cook on medium until the chicken is tender, about 12 minutes.  In step 4, combine the strained broth and vegetables and cook on high for 1 minute.

Comments:  I'm a firm believer in meals in minutes.  In about 15 minutes, you can cook tasty chicken wings and also create a savory soup to serve alongside.

                  Lobster With Sizzling Ginger-Chili Oil

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lobster tails - (abt 8 oz ea) -- thawed if frozen
  3                     thin slices ginger
  2                     green onions, including tops -- cut in half
  10                    cilantro (Chinese parsley) sprigs
                        === SIZZLING GINGER-CHILI OIL ===
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1                     green onion, including top -- cut 1 1/2" slivers
  1         tablespoon  slivered ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  2              whole  dried chile peppers
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Cilantro (Chinese parsley) sprigs

With scissors, cut lengthwise along the top of each lobster shell to the end of the tail, leaving the fan end intact.  Spread the shell open and carefully pry out the meat, leaving it attached at the fan end; lay the meat over the top of the shell.

Crush the ginger, green onions, and cilantro sprigs with the flat side of a cleaver to bruise them slightly.  Place them in a wok and add a steaming rack.  Pour in water to just below the level of the rack; bring it to a boil.

Place the lobster, meat-side up, in a heatproof dish and set the dish on the rack.  Cover and steam until the lobster meat turns opaque, about 6 minutes.  Transfer the lobster to a warm serving platter.

Heat the vegetable oil in a small saucepan until hot.  Stir in the slivered green onion, ginger, garlic, chiles, sesame oil, and salt.  Remove from the heat and stir in the soy sauce (the oil will sizzle).  Immediately drizzle the oil over the lobster.  Garnish with cilantro sprigs.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Tip:  This dish can also make an attractive appetizer for four.

Comments:  An unusual method of cutting the lobster shell results in an especially attractive presentation.  Quickly steamed over fragrant seasonings, the luscious meat curls tenderly over the shell.  Then it's drizzled with a sizzling, spicy sauce -- absolutely beautiful and delicious!

</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the vegetable oil in a small saucepan until hot.  Stir in the slivered green onion, ginger, garlic, chiles, sesame oil, and salt.  Remove from the heat and stir in the soy sauce (the oil will sizzle).  Immediately drizzle the oil over the lobster.  Garnish with cilantro sprigs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tip:  This dish can also make an attractive appetizer for four.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  An unusual method of cutting the lobster shell results in an especially attractive presentation.  Quickly steamed over fragrant seasonings, the luscious meat curls tenderly over the shell.  Then it&apos;s drizzled with a sizzling, spicy sauce -- absolutely beautiful and delicious!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  chopped peanuts
     1/4           cup  toasted sesame seeds
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  36                    wonton wrappers, eggroll wrappers or
                        siu mai wrappers
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch dissolved in
  3        tablespoons  water
  2               cups  canola oil -- for deep-frying

Combine peanuts, sesame seeds and sugar in a small bowl; set aside.

If using square wrappers, cut 36 circles from the wrappers with a biscuit cutter; discard trimmings.  Alternatively, use wrappers as is.  Cover circles or wrappers with damp cloth to prevent drying when not in use.

Place a heaping teaspoon peanut mixture in center of each circle or wrapper.  Brush cornstarch solution along edges.  Fold in half and press edges to seal.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.

Heat oil in a wok or in large deep skillet until very hot.  Add dumplings 1 or 2 at a time and deep-fry, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 30 seconds per side.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 36 dumplings.

                             Marbled Tea Eggs

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     eggs
  1                     green onion, including top -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  slivered ginger
     1/4           cup  regular soy sauce
     1/4           cup  dark soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  black tea leaves
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
  3              whole  star anise
  1                     cinnamon stick

Place eggs in a medium saucepan; cover with cold water.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.  Cool the eggs under cold running water and drain.  Gently tap each egg all over with a spoon until hairline cracks form over the entire shell.

While the eggs are cooking, bring the remaining ingredients to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Reduce the heat to a gentle boil, cover, and cook for 15 minutes.

Place the cooked eggs into the soy mixture, adding extra water if necessary to cover the eggs.  Simmer, covered, over low heat for 1 hour.  Remove the pan from the heat; let the eggs cool in the liquid, then refrigerate (still in the liquid) overnight or for up to 2 days.  Peel the eggs just before serving and place in a serving bowl.

This recipe yields 8 eggs.

Tips:  Use a fresh batch of tea leaves for this recipe; old tea leaves will not release as much flavor.

The combination of regular and dark soy sauces provides a balance of colors and flavors neither sauce can give on its own.

Comments:  These fragrant, distinctively colored eggs, "marbled" with a mixture of tea and soy sauce, are popular as an appetizer or a between-meal snack in eastern China.  Even at midnight, you can hear Shanghai street vendors calling "Marble egg! Marble egg!"  They are equally good day or night.

                     Minced Pork With Preserved Fish

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  Chinese preserved fish
  1           teaspoon  finely-shredded ginger
  2                     green onions, including tops -- thinly sliced
                        === PATTY MIXTURE ===
     3/4         pound  boneless pork butt
  1                     Chinese sausage - (abt 2 oz) -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped water chestnuts
  1                     egg white
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch

Soak the preserved fish in water to cover for 15 minutes; drain.  Cut the fish into thin slices and remove any bones.

In a food processor or with a cleaver, coarsely chop the pork.  Place it in a large bowl with the remaining patty ingredients and mix well.  Spread the mixture evenly in a 9-inch glass pie pan.  Top with the preserved fish, ginger, and 2 teaspoons of the green onions.

Place a steaming rack in a wok.  Pour in water to just below the level of the rack and bring to a boil.  Set the pie pan on the rack.  Cover and steam over high heat until the pork is no longer pink (cut a slit to test), about 12 minutes.  Sprinkle with remaining green onions before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Tip:  The preserved fish I use comes from Hong Kong or Macao as whole fish about 6 to 10 inches long, in plastic wrappers.  Some packages are labeled "salted fish."  It has fermented slightly in the drying process, giving it a different flavor than Western-style salt cod or other salted fish.  You may also find it packed in oil in jars, the only real substitute.

Comments:  Some kids have warm memories of their mom's kitchen smelling of sugar and spice.  The wafting aroma that drew me to my Mom's kitchen in double-quick time was fermenting fish steaming on a plump pork patty.  It smell up the whole house, but when it was done, wow -- it tasted good.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  boneless lean lamb -- thinly sliced
                        = (leg or shoulder)
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1              pinch  Chinese five-spive powder
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce or chili oil
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
                        === COOKING ===
  6                     green onions
  1              large  leek or 2 medium leeks
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  2             ounces  dried bean thread noodles
  8              whole  dried chile peppers - (to 10)
  8                     thin slices ginger
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/4      teaspoon  ground toasted Sichuan peppercorns
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar

Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.  Add the lamb and stir to coat.  Let stand for 30 minutes.  Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.

Cut the green onions and leeks (including tops) into 2-inch pieces.  Set a wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of about 2 inches.  Place over high heat until the oil reaches 375 degrees.  Add half the bean thread noodles and deep-fry until they puff and expand, about 5 seconds.  Turn over to cook the other side.  Lift out and drain on paper towels.  Cook the remaining noodles.  Place the noodles on a serving platter and press down to flatten them slightly.

Remove all but 2 tablespoons of oil from the wok.  Add the chiles and stir-fry for 10 seconds.  Add the lamb and stir-fry until barely pink, about 2 minutes.  Remove the lamb from the wok.  Add 2 teaspoons of oil and the ginger and garlic to the wok and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the green onions, leeks, and peppercorns and cook for 1 minute.  Add the sugar and cook for 30 seconds or until caramelized.  Return the lamb to the wok.  Add the sauce and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Serve over the noodles.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Bean thread noodles, known as "fun see" in Chinese, and in English as bean threads, cellophane noodles, or Chinese vermicelli, are thin, translucent noodles made from mung bean starch.  They do not need to be boiled; to use them in soups or casseroles, just soak them in hot water until soft.  Or deep-fry them as in this recipe for garnishing salads.  To avoid a mess when separating a bundle of bean threads, do it inside a bag.

Comments:  In northern China and Mongolia, summers are hot and winters are cold.  Spicy dishes like this are popular all year, to warm up a wintry night or to give you a cooling glow on a hot summer day.

Cut the green onions and leeks (including tops) into 2-inch pieces.  Set a wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of about 2 inches.  Place over high heat until the oil reaches 375 degrees.  Add half the bean thread noodles and deep-fry until they puff and expand, about 5 seconds.  Turn over to cook the other side.  Lift out and drain on paper towels.  Cook the remaining noodles.  Place the noodles on a serving platter and press down to flatten them slightly.

<DirT>
Remove all but 2 tablespoons of oil from the wok.  Add the chiles and stir-fry for 10 seconds.  Add the lamb and stir-fry until barely pink, about 2 minutes.  Remove the lamb from the wok.  Add 2 teaspoons of oil and the ginger and garlic to the wok and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the green onions, leeks, and peppercorns and cook for 1 minute.  Add the sugar and cook for 30 seconds or until caramelized.  Return the lamb to the wok.  Add the sauce and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Serve over the noodles.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Tip:  Bean thread noodles, known as &quot;fun see&quot; in Chinese, and in English as bean threads, cellophane noodles, or Chinese vermicelli, are thin, translucent noodles made from mung bean starch.  They do not need to be boiled; to use them in soups or casseroles, just soak them in hot water until soft.  Or deep-fry them as in this recipe for garnishing salads.  To avoid a mess when separating a bundle of bean threads, do it inside a bag.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  In northern China and Mongolia, summers are hot and winters are cold.  Spicy dishes like this are popular all year, to warm up a wintry night or to give you a cooling glow on a hot summer day.

                           My Mom's Ginger Beef

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  beef sirloin or flank steak -- thinly sliced
                        across the grain
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  3        tablespoons  oyster sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
                        === COOKING ===
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  slivered young ginger
  3                     green onions, including tops -- cut 1" pieces
  2        tablespoons  finely-shredded pickled ginger

Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.  Add the beef and stir to coat.  Set aside for 30 minutes.  Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the beef and stir-fry until barely pink, about 2 minutes.  Remove the beef from the wok.  Add the remaining tablespoon of oil.  Add the ginger and green onions and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Return the beef to the wok.  Add the pickled ginger and sauce.  Cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Some cooks don't peel carrots, and some cooks don't peel ginger.  I peel ginger because it makes a dish look more refined.  Young ginger, however, need only be washed.  The skin is thin and translucent.

Comments:  The list of curative powers credited to fresh ginger is as long as a Chinese scroll.  It's reputed to aid digestion, prevent colds, restore appetite, and make a young (or old) man aware of the pleasures of spring.  You seldom find beef this gingery in my restaurant.  My Mom made it this way, not to stimulate my appetite but to soothe it.

                     Popping Clams With Sizzling Rice

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2                     serrano or jalapeÒo chile peppers -- thinly sliced
  2                     green onions, including tops -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  chili paste
  3               cups  chicken broth
  3            bottles  clam juice - (8 oz ea)
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2          teaspoons  fish sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  16             small  hard-shell clams - (to 20) -- scrubbed
     1/4         pound  seascallops -- halved horizontally
  1                cup  sliced mushrooms
  1            package  firm tofu - (abt 16 oz) -- drained, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  8                     two-inch square rice crusts -- see * Note
                        Cilantro (Chinese parsley) sprigs -- for garnish

* Note:  Look for rice crusts in Chinese markets.

Place a wok or 6-quart pot over high heat.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the garlic, chiles, green onions, and chili paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the chicken broth, clam juice, chopped cilantro, lime juice, fish sauce, and sugar.  Bring to a boil.  Add the clams; cook until the clam shells open, about 5 minutes.  Add the scallops, mushrooms, and tofu and cook until the scallops turn opaque, about 2 minutes.  Keep warm while preparing the rice crusts.

Set a wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of about 2 inches.  Place over high heat until the oil reaches 375 degrees.  Add the rice crusts, half at a time, and cook them, turning occasionally, until puffed, about 15 seconds.  Lift the crusts out and drain them on paper towels.

Pour the clams and broth into a warmed serving bowl and carry it to the table.  Bring the hot fried rice crusts to the table and carefully slide them into the broth.  Garnish with cilantro sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Hot and spicy seasonings from Southeast Asia flavor this wonderful, very impressive soup.  You won't hear the clams pop open -- the sign that they are cooked -- but get ready for plenty of sizzle when you slide the rice crusts into the fiery brew.

                             Red-Cooked Lamb

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  6                     thin slices ginger
  2              whole  star anise
  1              piece  deied tangerine peel
                        = (or 2 pieces fresh orange peel, white
                        part removed, each abt 1 1/2" square)
  4               cups  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  regular soy sauce
     1/4           cup  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
     1/3           cup  dark soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  sugar
                        === LAMB ===
  3             pounds  lamb shoulder piece
     1/4      teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1 1/2      teaspoons  water
                        Thinly-sliced cucumber -- for garnish

Place a medium saucepan over high heat until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the remaining sauce ingredients and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, place the lamb in a pot just large enough to hold it snugly; cover it with cold water.  Bring to a boil, cook for 4 minutes, and drain.  Remove the lamb and rinse the pot.  Return the lamb to the pot and add the sauce.  (If necessary, add just enough chicken broth or water so the lamb is barely covered.)  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until the lamb is tender when pierced, about 2 hours.

Pour off the sauce and strain it.  Bring 1/2 cup of the sauce to a boil in a small saucepan.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  To serve, cut the lamb into very thin slices.  Arrange them on a serving plate and garnish with sliced cucumber.  Serve with the thickened sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tips:  Refrigerate the remaining sauce to use again.  Lift any congealed fat off the sauce before using.

If you wish to serve the lamb thinly sliced as part of an appetizer cold plate, let it cool in the sauce.

Comments:  Red-cooking, a technique from eastern China, gets its name from the beautiful red-brown color of meats simmered in a highly seasoned soy sauce.  You can use the cooking liquid, or "master sauce," over and over again, and it gets richer each time you use it.  Add a little water, broth, or fresh soy sauce and a bit of the seasoning each time you re-use the sauce to maintain the color and flavor.

You can use the cooking liquid, or &quot;master sauce,&quot; over and over again, and it gets richer each time you use it.  Add a little water, broth, or fresh soy sauce and a bit of the seasoning each time you re-use the sauce to maintain the color and flavor.

                        Roast Turkey Chinese Style

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry
                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     turkey - (13 to 15 lbs)
                        === MARINADE ===
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
                        === STUFFING ===
  8                     dried black mushrooms
     1/4           cup  dried shrimp
  1         tablespoon  vehetable oil
  2                     Chinese sausages - (abt 2 oz ea) -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  3                     green onions, including tops -- thinly sliced
  1                can  water chestnuts - (8 oz) -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)
  3        tablespoons  oyster sauce
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  3               cups  cooked glutinous or medium-grain rice

Remove the giblets from the turkey; reserve them for other uses.  Rinse the turkey inside and out and pat it dry with paper towels.  Combine the marinade ingredients in a small bowl and rub them over the skin of the turkey.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or as long as overnight.

Soak the mushrooms and dried shrimp separately in warm water for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut off and discard the mushroom stems and thinly slice the caps.  Leave the shrimp whole.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the sausage, shrimp, and garlic and stir-fry until the sausage is slightly crisp, about 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms, green onions, water chestnuts, and cilantro; cook for 1 minute.  Stir in the oyster sauce, soy sauce, and pepper.  Add the rice, mix well, and remove from the heat.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spoon the stuffing into the turkey cavity; close it with trussing needles or sew it closed.  Place the turkey on a rack in a foil-lined baking pan.  Bake until the juices run clear when a thigh is pierced, about 3 hours.  (Or, insert a meat thermometer in the center of one of the inside thigh muscles, being careful that the tip does not touch bone.  Bake until the thermometer registers 180 to 185 degrees.)  During the last half of the roasting time, baste the turkey occasionally with pan juices.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Tip:  If you make the stuffing ahead, let it cool, cover it, and refrigerate it until needed.  If you use the stuffing while it is still warm, roast the turkey immediately after stuffing.

Comments:  After sampling this tasty, crisp-skinned turkey with its special rice stuffing you may never go back to plain roast turkey.  This bird's superb!  Glutinous rice, a popular Chinese poultry stuffing, is often marketed a "sweet rice," and sometimes as "sticky rice."

                      Seafood And Asparagus Stir-Fry

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  medium raw shrimp -- shelled, deveined
     1/4         pound  seascallops -- halved horizontally
     1/2         pound  asparagus
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === COOKING ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  canned baby corn -- drained, and
                        cut in half diagonally
     1/2           cup  whole water chestnuts
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  2 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  5          teaspoons  water

Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.  Add the shrimp and scallops; stir to coat.  Set aside for 30 minutes.  Snap off and discard the tough ends of the asparagus, and cut the spears diagonally into 1 1/2-inch pieces.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the shrimp and scallops; stir-fry for 2 minutes or until the scallops turn opaque and the shrimp turn pink.  Remove the seafood from the wok.  Add the asparagus, baby corn, water chestnuts, and broth; cover and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the sherry, sesame oil, sugar, salt, and pepper; mix well.  Return the seafood to the wok and add the cornstarch solution.  Cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variation:  You can use all shrimp if you prefer.

Comments:  I get excited just thinking about fresh asparagus, which I never tasted until I came to North America.  When asparagus is combined with shrimp, scallops, baby corn, and water chestnuts in this dish, it's almost too beautiful to eat.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FISH CAKES ===
     3/4         pound  fresh red snapper or rock cod fillets
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped water chestnuts
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped red bell pepper
  1                     green onion, including top -- minced
  1                     tea pon chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)
  1                     egg white
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === COATING ===
     1/2           cup  dried bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds
                        === COOKING ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
                        red bell pepper slivers -- for garnish
                        Shredded seaweed (nori) -- for garnish

Chop the fish finely with a cleaver or in a food processor.  Combine it with the remaining fish cake ingredients in a medium bowl and mix well.  Shape the mixture into six 2-inch cakes.  Combine the bread crumbs and sesame seeds in a shallow bowl.  Dredge the fish cakes in the coating on both sides.

Set a wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of about 2 inches.  Heat the oil to 360 degrees and adjust the heat to medium-high.  Slide the fish cakes into the oil and cook until golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side.  Remove the cakes with a skimmer and drain them on paper towels.  Garnish with bell pepper slivers and shredded seaweed.

This recipe yields 6 cakes.

Tips:  You can use any fresh white fish to make this recipe.  Some frozen fish tends to be dry and lacks the binding quality necessary for these cakes.

Nori is most familiar as the dried seaweed wrapper for rolled sushi.  Look for it in Japanese stores.

Variation:  If you prefer, you can pan-fry the fish cakes in 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.  Cook for 2 1/2 minutes on each side or until golden.

Comments:  Being clever with your cleaver comes in handy when you make fish cakes.  Of course, a food processor chops the fish even faster.  Moist on the inside, crunchy and colorful on the outside, these savory little cakes make a colorful first course for any asian or Western meal.

  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  dry sherry
  4          teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  toasted sesame seeds -- crushed
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === COOKING ===
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil

Cut the beef into thin slices, about 3 inches square and 1/4-inch thick.

Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.  Add the beef and stir to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight.  Sprinkle with sesame oil just before cooking.

Place the meat on a lightly greased grill 3 to 4 inches above a solid bed of low-glowing coals.  Cook, turning once, until just browned on both sides, about 2 minutes total.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Pork reigns in China, but in Korea, beef is the most favored meat.  If you've eaten in a Korean restaurant, perhaps you've tasted bulgogi, the most famous beef dish of all.  On the show, I cook this on a dome-shaped Genghis Khan grill.  You can cook it directly on your barbecue or under the broiler, or even sear the meat quickly in a frying pan.

                    Shrimp And Scallops With Snow Peas

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  shelled medium raw shrimp -- deveined
     1/2         pound  sea scallops -- halved horizontally
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  oyster-flavored sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cooking oil
     1/4           cup  sliced water chestnuts
     3/4           cup  trimmed snow peas - (3 oz)

Pat shrimp and scallops dry with paper towels and place in a bowl.  Add ginger and garlic; stir to coat.  Let stand 10 minutes.

Make a sauce by combining chicken broth and oyster-flavored sauce in a small bowl.

Place wok over high heat until hot.  Add oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add shrimp and scallops; stir-fry until shrimp are slightly pink and the scallops are slightly firm, about 2 minutes.  Remove from wok.

Add water chestnuts and snow peas; stir-fry for about 30 seconds.  Return seafood to wok.  Add the sauce; bring to boil and cook until sauce reduces slightly.  Once shrimp begin to turn pink and curl up or scallops become firm and opaque, they're done.  So take them off the heat as quickly as possible, or you'll wind up with tough, dry, overcooked shellfish that won't make your mouth cry out for more, but rather will make it cry, period.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                     Shrimp With Orange Mustard Sauce

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  large or medium shrimp - (20 to 30) -- shelled, deveined,
                        with tail shells left on
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  orange marmalade
  2          teaspoons  prepared Chinese mustard

Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.  Add the shrimp; stir to coat.  Set aside for 20 minutes.  Combine sauce ingredients in a small serving bowl; set aside.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the shrimp on a rack in a foil-lined baking pan.  Bake until the shrimp feel firm and turn pink, about 6 minutes.  Arrange on a platter.  Serve warm or at room temperature with the dipping sauce.

This recipe yields about 20 pieces.

Tip:  Check the shrimp a minute or two before the recommended baking time is up; it is important not to overcook the shrimp.

Comments:  Simply wonderful!  I love the combination of orange and mustard.  Although traditional Chinese kitchens don't have ovens, this updated recipe is baked.  Still it has all the elements of the traditional Chinese dish, which is "deep-fried" in a wok.

                     Skewered Chicken With Sesame Dip

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Chicken
                Dim Sum                         Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless chicken breasts -- skinned, and
                        cut into 1" wide strips
  12                    short bamboo skewers
     1/2           cup  dried bread crumbs
                        === MARINADE ===
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  peanut butter
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  chili paste
                        === SESAME DIP ===
  3        tablespoons  sesame seeds -- toasted
                        = (or 1 tbspn sesame paste)
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1                     egg yolk
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/2      teaspoon  chili paste
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil

Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.  Add the chicken and stir to coat.  Set aside for 30 minutes.  Soak the skewers in water for 30 minutes.

In a blender or food processor, combine the sesame seeds, garlic, egg yolk, vinegar, honey, chili paste, red pepper, and salt.  Add the sesame oil and process until well blended.  With the motor running, add the vegetable oil, a few drops at first then increasing to a slow steady trickle, until the mixture thickens.  Transfer the dip to a bowl.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes for the flavors to blend.

Weave the chicken strips lengthwise on the skewers and roll the in the breadcrumbs.  Place them on a rack in a foil-lined baking pan and broil 2 to 3 inches below the heat (or grill 3 to 4 inches above a solid bed of low-glowing coals).  Cook, turning to brown all sides, until the chicken is no longer pink when pierced, 8 to 10 minutes.  Serve with sesame dip.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Tips:  Panko, coarse Japanese-style bread crumbs, give a great crispy finish to the chicken.  If you cannot find panko, process dried sweet French bread in the food processor to make coarse crumbs.

This dish is also wonderful as an entree; it will serve 6.

Comments:  Most of the time I cook with Chinese ingredients, but I don't mind borrowing Western cooking styles.  In this case, I've made a sesame dip with the same technique used to make mayonnaise.  The sauce is creamy and aromatic, perfect for grilled Chicken bits.  I think you'll like this East-West blend.

  1              whole  star anise
                        = (or 1/4 tspn anise seed)
  1             medium  green onion -- coarsely chopped
  3        tablespoons  light brown sugar - (packed)
  3        tablespoons  sesame oil
                        = (or vegetable oil)
                        Lettuce leaves -- for garnish

Rinse the turkey breast and pat it dry with paper towels.  Combine the soy sauce, water, sherry, ginger, star anise, and green onion in a large saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium heat.  Add the turkey breast, skin-side up.  Using a baster or large spoon, continuously baste the turkey breast with the braising liquid until it returns to a simmer, about 1 minute.  Cover the pan tightly, and simmer on low heat for 20 minutes, basting twice.  Turn the turkey breast over carefully with two wooden spoons; stir in the brown sugar.  Cover and simmer 20 minutes longer, basting the turkey twice.

Remove the pan from the heat but keep it tightly covered.  Let the turkey stand in the liquid for 1 hour, basting every 15 minutes.  Turn the turkey breast over carefully with two wooden spoons and let it stand, covered, 1 hour longer, again basting every 15 minutes.

Remove the turkey breast from the braising liquid and place it on a washed surface.  Brush the skin with sesame oil.  For the best-looking presentation, chop the breast into pieces Chinese-style.  With a heavy cleaver, chop the rib and backbone section away from the meat portion of the breast.  Chop the breast in half vertically down the breastbone.  Chop each breast portion crosswise into 3 or 4 pieces.  Chop each piece in half vertically.  (If you prefer, carve the turkey breast in the usual way.)  To serve, line a serving platter with lettuce leaves and arrange the turkey pieces on top.  Serve at room temperature with braising liquid as a dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Manhattan caterer Rick Rodgers showed me his variation on the classic "red-cooked" whole chicken.  A whole turkey breast is about the same size, but contains a higher proportion of meat, and its smooth skin takes on the same deep mahogany color from slow cooking in a soy sauce mixture.  This is an adaptation of the recipe that appears in his book "The Turkey Cookbook" (HarperCollins, 1990).  It's delicious served hot, but it's even better at room temperature.

                   Spiced Orange Pork Chops With Onions

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  fresh orange juice
  2          teaspoons  grated orange peel
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar - (packed)
                        === PORK CHOPS ===
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
  4                     pork chops, each 1/2" thick -- (1 to 1 1/2 lbs
                        total)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  1              small  onion -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  4          teaspoons  water
                        Orange slices for garnish
                        Orange peel cut in thin strips -- for garnish

Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.  Combine the salt and five-spice in a small bowl; sprinkle over the pork chops.

Place a wide nonstick frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add 2 teaspoons of the oil, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan.  Add the pork chops and brown for 2 minutes on each side; remove.  Add the remaining teaspoon of oil to the pan, swirling to coat the surface.  Add the garlic, ginger, red pepper, and onion and stir-fry until the onion is softened, about 2 minutes.

Return the pork chops to the pan; reduce the heat to low.  Pour the sauce over the chops, cover, and simmer until the meat is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes.  Transfer the chops to a warm serving platter.  Add the cornstarch solution to the pan and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Pour over the chops.  Garnish with orange slices and orange peel.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Microwave Method:  In step 2, combine the oil, garlic, ginger, red pepper, and onion in a shallow microwave-safe casserole and heat on high for 2 minutes.  Stir, place the pork chops on top, and pour the sauce over the meat.  Cover and cook on high until the pork is no longer pink, about 7 minutes.  Remove the chops to a warm serving platter.  Stir the cornstarch solution into the casserole, cover, and cook on high until the sauce boils and thickens, about 2 minutes.  Serve as above.

Comments:  Braising is one of the most popular cooking techniques in many parts of China.  You'll understand why once you sample these pork chops prepared in a tangy orange sauce.

                      Spicy Leek And Jicama Stir-Fry

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === COOKING ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  6              whole  dried chile peppers
  2                     leeks, white part only -- cut 1/2" slivers
     1/2         pound  jicama -- peeled, and
                        cut into matchstick pieces
  1                     carrot -- cut into thin
                        matchstick pieces
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2          teaspoons  water

Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the ginger and chile peppers and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the leeks and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the jicama, carrot, and broth.  Cover and cook until the carrot is crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.  Stir in the sauce.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Dirt hides between the layers of leeks.  To prepare them for cooking, trim the roots and tops, leaving about 3 inches of green leaves.  Cut the leeks in half lengthwise, then wash them under running water, separating the layers to rinse out the dirt.

Comments:  I think someone should create a national jicama week.  It is a terrific vegetable, both tasty and versatile.  It retains its snowy white color, crisp texture, and sweet flavor when stir-fried and doesn't wilt or become watery when used raw in salads.  I always buy the largest jicama I can find.  It keeps up to a week, though in my kitchen it disappears long before that.

                       Spinach With Sesame Dressing

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  spinach or watercress
                        === DRESSING ===
  3        tablespoons  sesame seeds -- toasted
  2                     cubes white fermented bean curd (fu yu) -- abt 1 1/2 tbspns
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  instant bonito soup stock base (hon-dashi) -- mixed with
     1/4           cup  hot water
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Place 2 1/2 tablespoons of the sesame seeds in a blender with the rest of the dressing ingredients and blend until smooth.  Without trimming the roots and stems, wash the spinach in a large bowl of water; discard any wilted leaves.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add the spinach and cook 1 minute.  Drain, rinse under cold running water, and drain again.  Lay 2 or 3 bunches of spinach together on a work surface so they form a bundle about 1-inch in diameter; squeeze to remove as much water as possible.  Trim and discard the root ends and cut each bundle into 2-inch lengths.  Repeat with the remaining spinach.  Arrange the cut bundles on a serving platter and pour the dressing on top.  Sprinkle with the remaining sesame seeds.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Tip:  Fermented bean curd is packed in jars in a thin liquid flavored with wine.  It may have chiles added for color and flavor.  Don't be put off by its very pungent odor; it is delicious in this dressing.  Covered and refrigerated, a jar of "fu yu" will keep for a long time.

Microwave Method:  In step 2, spin the spinach dry in a plastic salad spinner.  Cover the spinner with plastic wrap, place it right in the microwave, and cook on high for 4 minutes.  Divide the spinach into 3 bundles; lay them on paper towels and squeeze them dry, forming 1-inch logs as above.  Trim, cut, and dress as above.

Comments:  A mixed green salad you toss.  My spinach salad, made Chinese style with cooked spinach, you squeeze.  After eliminating the water from the spinach bunches, I cut them into logs and arrange them on a serving plate.  Depending on my mood, I stack them like cordwood or stand the bundles on end.

Place 2 1/2 tablespoons of the sesame seeds in a blender with the rest of the dressing ingredients and blend until smooth.  Without trimming the roots and stems, wash the spinach in a large bowl of water; discard any wilted leaves.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add the spinach and cook 1 minute.  Drain, rinse under cold running water, and drain again.  Lay 2 or 3 bunches of spinach together on a work surface so they form a bundle about 1-inch in diameter; squeeze to remove as much water as possible.  Trim and discard the root ends and cut each bundle into 2-inch lengths.  Repeat with the remaining spinach.  Arrange the cut bundles on a serving platter and pour the dressing on top.  Sprinkle with the remaining sesame seeds.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tip:  Fermented bean curd is packed in jars in a thin liquid flavored with wine.  It may have chiles added for color and flavor.  Don&apos;t be put off by its very pungent odor; it is delicious in this dressing.  Covered and refrigerated, a jar of &quot;fu yu&quot; will keep for a long time.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Microwave Method:  In step 2, spin the spinach dry in a plastic salad spinner.  Cover the spinner with plastic wrap, place it right in the microwave, and cook on high for 4 minutes.  Divide the spinach into 3 bundles; lay them on paper towels and squeeze them dry, forming 1-inch logs as above.  Trim, cut, and dress as above.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  A mixed green salad you toss.  My spinach salad, made Chinese style with cooked spinach, you squeeze.  After eliminating the water from the spinach bunches, I cut them into logs and arrange them on a serving plate.  Depending on my mood, I stack them like cordwood or stand the bundles on end.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  canola oil - (to 2)
  2             slices  giner - (1 1/2") -- julienned
                        = (abt 2 tbspns)
  6                     dried shiitake mushrooms -- soaked until soft,
                        and thinly sliced
  2                     celery stalks -- julienned or diced
  1              large  carrot -- julienned or
                        shredded
  1 1/2           cups  shredded cabbage
  3             ounces  firm tofu -- julienned, or
                        cut small cubes
  2                     green onions -- diced
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  12                    spring roll or eggroll wrappers
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water
  2               cups  canola oil for deep-frying

Heat oil in wok or very large skillet over high heat.  Add ginger and mushrooms; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add celery, carrot, cabbage, tofu and green onions; stir-fry about 2 minutes.  Add soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, sugar and white pepper; mix well.  Remove work or skillet from heat and let cool.

Lay 1 wrapper on work surface with 1 corner toward you.  Cover remaining wrappers with damp cloth to prevent drying.  Place 1/3 cup vegetable mixture in a line across center of wrapper.  Fold bottom corner of wrapper over vegetable mixture.  Fold in left and right corners.  With a pastry brush, brush top corner and side edges of wrapper with cornstarch solution.  Roll wrapper to form a tight cylinder.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.

If deep-frying, heat oil in wok or large deep skillet.  (Oil must be very hot, about 360 degrees.)  Gently place 1 or 2 spring rolls in oil.  Cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all sides, about 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Keep warm in oven while cooking remaining spring rolls.

Alternatively, you can bake or steam spring rolls.  Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray, place rolls on baking sheet and lightly spray rolls with cooking spray.  Bake at 400 degrees until golden brown, about 10 minutes.

To steam, place bamboo steamer over boiling water.  Place spring rolls in steamer, cover and steam until done, about 10 minutes.

Serve with sauce of your choice.  Try sweet and sour, hoisin or soy sauce mixed with a little chili oil.

This recipe yields 12 spring rolls.

Comments:  These appetizers are traditionally deep-fried, but you can also bake or steam them with good results.

                          Steamed Savory Custard

Recipe By     :Martin Yan

Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  1                     green onion, including top -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  cooked flaked crabmeat
                        = (or small cooked shrimp, or diced
                        cooked ham)

Combine the eggs, green onions, sesame oil, salt, and pepper in a bowl.  Stir in the broth until evenly blended, then stir in the crabmeat.

Place a steaming rack in a wok and add water to just below the level of the rack.  Bring it to a boil and reduce heat so that water simmers gently.  Divided the egg mixture among four individual custard cups.  Carefully set the cups on the rack, cover, and steam until a knife inserted in the center of the custard comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Keep the water at a gentle simmer so the eggs will stay creamy.  If you use frozen crabmeat or shrimp, pat it very dry between towels before combining it with the eggs.  Any excess water will spoil the creamy texture of the custard.

Comments:  Smooth and velvety, this cloudlike custard studded with crabmeat and green onion is good for brunch, lunch, or supper.  It's a very popular dish in Japanese cuisine as well as Chinese homestyle cooking.  With this steaming technique, you cook it in less than 20 minutes -- one half the time it takes for oven baking.

                    Steamed Tofu With Shrimp Mousse II

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  soft tofu - (abt 16 oz) -- drained
  1         tablespoon  minced Smithfield ham
  1                     green onion, including top -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === SHRIMP MOUSSE ===
     1/4         pound  medium raw shrimp -- shelled, deveined
  2                     water chestnuts -- coarsely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)
  1                     egg white
  1         tablespoon  chicken broth or water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Coarsely chop the shrimp in a food processor.  Add the remaining mousse ingredients and process until the shrimp are finely chopped, but not so long as to make a smooth paste.  Cut the block of tofu in half horizontally; cut each piece in half lengthwise, then crosswise, to make 8 equal pieces.

Lay the tofu pieces side by side in a 9-inch pie pan or other heatproof dish.  Spread shrimp mousse in an even layer over each piece.  Sprinkle with ham, green onion, and cilantro.

Place a steaming rack in a wok, add water to just below the level of the rack, and bring to a boil.  Place the dish on the rack, cover, and steam until the shrimp mousse turns pink, about 6 minutes.  Remove the dish from the wok; carefully pour off the cooking juices.  Sprinkle the tofu with soy sauce, sesame oil, and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tips:  Served Chinese style, this dish is placed in the center of the table and everyone helps himself.  For individual servings, assemble the tofu and mouse in shallow ramekins that will fit your steamer.  The cooking time will not change.

Comments:  I've taken a shortcut with this dish.  Instead of painstakingly stuffing cubes with shrimp mousse, I completely cover each slice with mousse and steam the dish briefly.  It's a snap to prepare, low in calories, packed with flavor, and it looks beautiful.

                Stir-Fried Pork With Preserved Vegetables

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     dried balck mushrooms
     3/4         pound  boneless lean pork -- cut into
                        matchstick pieces
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
                        = (or chili oil)
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
                        === COOKING ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     celery stalk -- thinly sliced,
                        on the diagonal
  3        tablespoons  thin-sliced Sichuan preserved vegetables -- rinsed, drained
  2                     green onions, including tops -- cut 1" pieces

Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut off and discard the stems and thinly slice the caps.  Combine the marinade ingredients in a bowl.  Add the pork, stir to coat, and set aside for 30 minutes.  Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the surface.  Add the pork and stir-fry until it is no longer pink, about 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms, celery, preserved vegetables, and green onions and cook for 1 minute.  Add the sauce and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Sichuan preserved vegetables (jar choy) are mustard stems preserved with salt and ground chiles.  They are sold in Chinese markets in plastic bags or small flat cans.  After opening, transfer to a jar and refrigerate for up to six months or longer.

Comments:  Some kids grow up craving pickles.  I grew up snacking on slices of preserved vegetables.  They were deliciously hot, spicy, and sour.  I still love their flavor as a quick seasoning for stir-fried pork.

                          Stuffed Steamed Trout

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     trout - (abt 12 oz ea)
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        === COOKING ===
  2                     green onions, including tops
  4                     thin slices ginger -- slivered
  2             ounces  ham -- cut matchsticks
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Slivered green onions
                        Slivered ginger
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        Cilantro (Chinese parsley) sprigs

Score both sides of the fish with 3 diagonal cuts, 3/4-inch deep.  Combine the marinade ingredients on a deep plate large enough to hold the fish.  Add the fish, turn to coat, and set aside for 30 minutes.  Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.

Cut one green onion into 2-inch pieces; crush slightly.  Cut the remaining green onion into 2-inch slivers.  Place the crushed green onion and half of the ginger and ham into the fish cavities.  Tuck the slivered green onion and remaining ginger and ham into the diagonal cuts on the outside.  Place the fish in a 9-inch heatproof glass pie pan.

Place a steaming rack in a wok, add water to just below the level of the rack, and bring to a boil.  Place the pan of fish on the rack, cover, and steam until the center of the fish is opaque, about 15 minutes.  Remove the pan, pour off and discard the juices.  If desired, transfer the fish to a platter.  Sprinkle the fish with slivered green onion and ginger.  Heat the vegetable oil in a small saucepan until it just begins to smoke; pour it over the fish.  Immediately pour the sauce over the fish.  Garnish with cilantro sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Microwave Method:  In step 3, place the stuffed fish in a microwave-safe dish, cover and cook on high until the flesh is just opaque, about 8 minutes.  Let stand 2 minutes before serving.

Comments:  I always catch big trout, so each one is large enough for two people to share.  If you catch (or buy) smaller fish, reduce the steaming time by a few minutes.  The goal is to cook the fish just until it begins to flake so that it will retain its mountain-lake freshness.

                          Succulent Stuffed Pork

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     boneless pork loin - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- butterflied
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
     1/2      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
                        === COOKING ===
  1                     Chinese sausage - (abt 2 oz) -- cut 1/4" cubes
  1             medium  onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     green onion, including top -- thinly sliced
  1              bunch  mustard greens - (8 to 10 oz) -- chopped
                        = (or Swiss chard)
     1/2           cup  diced water chestnuts
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce

To butterfly the pork loin roast, split it in half horizontally, almost all the way through, leaving one long edge attached, and unfold the halves like the wings of a butterfly.  Ask your butcher to butterfly it for you if you like.

Combine the marinade ingredients in a small bowl and rub over the pork.  Let stand for 20 minutes.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the sausage and cook for 1 minute.  Add the onion and green onion and cook for 1 minute.  Add the mustard greens, water chestnuts, soy sauce, vinegar, and pepper and cook until the greens are wilted, about 2 minutes.  Add the cornstarch; mix well and let cool.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spread the hoisin sauce over the open surface of the pork, then spread the stuffing evenly to within one inch of the edge.  Roll the roast tightly and secure it with string, tying it once lengthwise then crosswise at 2-inch intervals.  Place the roast on a rack in a large foil-lined baking pan.  Bake uncovered to an internal temperature of 155 degrees, about 1 1/2 hours.  Remove the roast from the oven and let it stand for at least 10 minutes before cutting it into thin slices (the internal temperature will rise to 165 degrees).

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Variation:  The roast can be braised in a wok.  Brown the surface first in a little oil, add the chicken broth to a depth of 1 inch, cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.

Comments:  If you're looking for something special, you've selected the right recipe.  Tender pork and a flavorful stuffing of Chinese sausage, greens, and seasonings create a magnificent roast pork entree.

To butterfly the pork loin roast, split it in half horizontally, almost all the way through, leaving one long edge attached, and unfold the halves like the wings of a butterfly.  Ask your butcher to butterfly it for you if you like.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the marinade ingredients in a small bowl and rub over the pork.  Let stand for 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the sausage and cook for 1 minute.  Add the onion and green onion and cook for 1 minute.  Add the mustard greens, water chestnuts, soy sauce, vinegar, and pepper and cook until the greens are wilted, about 2 minutes.  Add the cornstarch; mix well and let cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spread the hoisin sauce over the open surface of the pork, then spread the stuffing evenly to within one inch of the edge.  Roll the roast tightly and secure it with string, tying it once lengthwise then crosswise at 2-inch intervals.  Place the roast on a rack in a large foil-lined baking pan.  Bake uncovered to an internal temperature of 155 degrees, about 1 1/2 hours.  Remove the roast from the oven and let it stand for at least 10 minutes before cutting it into thin slices (the internal temperature will rise to 165 degrees).
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Variation:  The roast can be braised in a wok.  Brown the surface first in a little oil, add the chicken broth to a depth of 1 inch, cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  If you&apos;re looking for something special, you&apos;ve selected the right recipe.  Tender pork and a flavorful stuffing of Chinese sausage, greens, and seasonings create a magnificent roast pork entree.

              Sweet And Sour Fish With Pineapple Fried Rice

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              pound  red snapper fillets -- cut 1" by 2" pieces
                        === BATTER ===
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FRIED RICE ===
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2                     green onions, including tops -- thinly sliced
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1/4" squares
  3               cups  cooked long-grain rice
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                can  pineapple tidbits - (8 oz) -- drained, with
                        juices reserved
                        === FOR SERVING ===
     1/2           cup  Sweet and Sour Sauce -- see * Note
                        = (or bottled sweet and sour sauce)

* Note:  See the variation for the sweet and sour sauce portion of the "Fruited Sweet And Sour Chicken" recipe which is included in this collection.

Combine the batter ingredients in a medium bowl; set aside

Place a wide nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the surface.  Dip the fish pieces into the batter, letting the excess drip off.  Add half the fish to the pan and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes on each side.  Lift out and drain on paper towels; keep warm.  Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan and cook the remaining fish.

After all the fish is cook, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in the same pan until hot.  Add the ginger, garlic, and green onion and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the bell pepper and rice, separating the grains of rice with the back of a spoon.  Reduce the heat to medium; cook and toss for 1 minute.  Add the broth, soy sauce, sesame oil, and white pepper and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Toss with half of the pineapple pieces; keep warm.  Meanwhile, bring the sweet and sour sauce and the remaining pineapple pieces to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Pour the sauce over the fish and serve the fried rice on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tips:  If bottled sweet and sour sauce is too thick, add a small amount of pineapple juice.

Rock cod or other mild white fish fillets can be used in place of red snapper.

Comments:  Sweet and sour lovers, this one's for you.  And it's as easy as 1-2-3: Batter and pan-fry the fish fillets; meanwhile, heat some sauce from the fridge; then stir up some fried rice in the same wok you used to cook the fish.

                    Swordfish With Miso-Mustard Sauce

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  white miso
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  Japanese rice wine (sake)
  2          teaspoons  prepared Chinese-style mustard
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === COOKING ===
  4                     swordfish steaks, 3/4" thick -- (1 1/2 to 2 lbs)
  1                     lemon -- cut 6 wedges

Whisk the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl until evenly blended.  Brush one side of the fish steaks with a little sauce and place them sauce-side up on a rack in a foil-lined baking pan,  Broil 3 to 4 inches from the heat for 4 minutes, turn, and brush with a little more sauce.  Broil until the center of the fish is just opaque, 3 to 4 more minutes.  Pour the remaining sauce onto a serving platter, place the fish on top of the sauce, and squeeze 2 of the lemon wedges over the fish.. Garnish with the remaining lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Shredded daikon (white radish) makes a terrific garnish for this dish.  Chill the daikon shreds in ice water for 30 minutes before serving so they become crisp and crystal white.

Microwave Method:  Place the fish in a shallow microwave-safe casserole, combine the sauce ingredients, and pour the sauce on top of the fish.  Cover and cook on high until the center of the fish is just opaque, 7 to 8 minutes.  Let stand 2 minutes.  Serve and garnish as above.

Comments:  Made from soybeans and other grains, miso is packed with protein and is prized by Japanese cooks for its sweet-salty-savory flavor.  With fish, I prefer white miso.  It is less salty than the darker kinds and blends beautifully in this zippy mustard sauce.  Chinese-style fermented soybean sauce is too dark and too salty for this dish.

                  Teriyaki Beef With Rainbow Vegetables

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     taespoons minced garlic
  1              pound  tender boneless beef abt 1/2" thick
                        = (such as sirloin)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === TERIYAKI SAUCE ===
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
     1/2           cup  sake (Japanese rice wine)
     1/3           cup  sot sauce
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water
                        === COOKING ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  1              small  onion -- cut 1" squares
  1 1/2           cups  broccoli florets
  1 1/2           cups  cauliflower florets
  1              small  carrot -- thinly sliced
                        on the diagonal
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  sliced fresh mushrooms
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2          teaspoons  water

Rub half the garlic onto the beef; sprinkle with pepper and set aside for 30 minutes

Combine the teriyaki sauce ingredients in a small saucepan; cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until the sauce boils and thickens.  Remove from the heat; cover the pan to keep the sauce warm.

Place a wide frying pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the oil, swirling to coat the surface.  Add the beef and cook until done to your liking, 2 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Remove the beef from the pan and keep it warm.  Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the pan until hot.  Add the remaining garlic, ginger, and onion; cook, stirring until the onion softens.  Add the broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, and broth; cover and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and cook until the broccoli, cauliflower, and carrot are crisp-tender, about 1 more minute.  Stir in the soy sauce and pepper and add the cornstarch solution.  Cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  To serve, slice the beef diagonally into 1/4-inch-thick slices, pour the sauce over the slices, and serve with the vegetables on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  To save time, pre-cut vegetables can be purchased at many supermarket salad bars.

Comments:  This Japanese-style dish is quick, easy, and so delicious that I fix it even when I'm not pressed for time.  The textures and colors of the vegetables contrast nicely with the succulent beef and its slightly sweet sauce.  Try the same vegetables as a side dish with any other simply cooked meat dish.

Place a wide frying pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the oil, swirling to coat the surface.  Add the beef and cook until done to your liking, 2 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Remove the beef from the pan and keep it warm.  Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the pan until hot.  Add the remaining garlic, ginger, and onion; cook, stirring until the onion softens.  Add the broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, and broth; cover and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and cook until the broccoli, cauliflower, and carrot are crisp-tender, about 1 more minute.  Stir in the soy sauce and pepper and add the cornstarch solution.  Cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  To serve, slice the beef diagonally into 1/4-inch-thick slices, pour the sauce over the slices, and serve with the vegetables on the side.

Tip:  To save time, pre-cut vegetables can be purchased at many supermarket salad bars.

Comments:  This Japanese-style dish is quick, easy, and so delicious that I fix it even when I&apos;m not pressed for time.  The textures and colors of the vegetables contrast nicely with the succulent beef and its slightly sweet sauce.  Try the same vegetables as a side dish with any other simply cooked meat dish.

                           Thai Cucumber Salad

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
                        === SALAD ===
  1                     English or 1 1/2 regular cucumbers -- seeded if necessary,
                        and thinly sliced
  1              small  red onion -- thinly sliced
     1/2                red bell bepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into matchstick pieces
     1/4         pound  small cooked shrimp
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame seeds -- (optional)
                        = (chopped toasted nuts)

Combine the dressing ingredients in a small bowl and let stand 30 minutes.

Combine the cucumbers, onion, bell pepper, and shrimp in a large bowl.  Both the salad and the dressing may be prepared up to 4 hours ahead and refrigerated, but do not combine until just before serving.

Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds or chopped nuts if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  When I was a kid growing up in China, all I knew was Chinese food.  Now I enjoy foods from other Asian countries as well.  This typical Thai salad is as cool as a cucumber, yet peppery-sweet.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2                     serrano or jalapeÒo chiles - (to 3) -- seeded, slivered
     3/4         pound  boneless pork -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves -- cut fine shreds
  2                     gren onions, including tops -- cut 1 1/2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  chicken broth or water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fish sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the garlic and chiles and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the pork and stir-fry until it is no longer pink, about 2 1/2 minutes.  Add the basil and green onions and stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Add the broth, fish sauce, and sugar; mix well and add the cornstarch solution.  Cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tips:  You can adjust the amount of chile to achieve the degree of hotness you like.

If you can find it, try using Thai basil, which has a stronger anise flavor than regular basil.

Comments:  Sometimes I like to give my Chinese stir-fry a peppery Thai accent.  Here I used a flavorful combination of Thai fish sauce (nam pla), basil, and chile peppers.  Try it -- it's hot and sensational!

                       Thai Pork And Shrimp Toasts

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Dim Sum


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            slices  firm day-old white bread
                        === PORK AND SHRIMP PASTE ===
     1/4         pound  lean ground pork
     1/4         pound  medium raw shrimp -- shelled, deveined
  1         tablespoon  chopped green onion, including top
  1                     serrano or jalapeÒo chile -- minced
  2                     egg whites
  2          teaspoons  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley) roots
                        and 1" of the stems
  1           teaspoon  chopped cilantro leaves
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === COOKING ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
                        Cilantro leaves -- for garnish

Trim the crusts from the bread and cut each slice in half diagonally.

In a food processor, combine the paste ingredients and process to make a coarse paste.  Spread the paste about 1/4-inch thick on one side of each bread triangle.  If you wish, you may place the triangles in a single layer in a baking pan and cover and refrigerate them for up to 2 hours.

Set a wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of about 2 inches.  Heat over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 360 degrees.  Add the triangles paste-side down, a few at a time; cook for 1 1/2 minutes.  Turn them and cook until golden brown, about 30 seconds.  The edges will be curled like furled ribbon.  Lift the toasts out and drain them on paper towels.  Keep them warm in a 200 degree oven while cooking the rest.  Arrange the toasts on a flat basket and garnish them with cilantro leaves.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 34 toasts.

Tips:  The toasts are large -- hearty enough for a snack.  For a party appetizer, cut each slice of bread into 4 triangles or cut it into circles with a 2-inch cookie cutter.  You can also try thinly sliced French bread.  Leftover cilantro roots can be frozen for later use

Comments:  I can't understand why the Thais are the only ones who cook with cilantro roots.  The roots have a deep, rich flavor, less spicy than the feathery leaves.  My produce man is so fastidious he trims off the roots, so I save a spot in my garden to grow my own supply.  You can omit the roots from this recipe; the toast will still taste great, just not quite as authentically Thai.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  dried bean thread noodles
  12            ounces  spinach -- coarse stems
                        discarded
  2             pounds  boneless lamb (leg or loin) -- cut thin strips
                        = (or chicken or beef)
  1              pound  medium raw prawns -- shelled, deveined,
                        (optional)
  2                     spring onions -- cut 1" lengths
  2             quarts  chicken broth
  1              slice  ginger -- lightly crushed
  2        tablespoons  Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
                        === HOT AND SPICY DIPPING SAUCE ===
  2             ounces  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped ginger
  1           teaspoon  chili garlic sauce
  1           teaspoon  chopped coriander
                        === SPICY HOISIN DIPPING SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  Hoisin sauce
  2        tablespoons  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  chili garlic sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        === TANGY MUSTARD DIPPING SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  prepared Chinese mustard
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped ginger
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce

Soak the noodles in warm water to cover until softened, about 30 minutes; drain.  Cut the noodles into 3-inch pieces.  Place the noodles and spinach on a serving platter with the lamb, prawns, and onions.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to cook.

In separate small serving bowls, whisk the dipping sauce ingredients until blended.

In a large pot, bring the broth, ginger and wine to the boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to low; cover and simmer for 20 minutes.  Discard the ginger.

Set a Mongolian fire pot or an electric wok in the centre of the table.  Arrange the lamb platter and dipping sauces around the cooking vessel.  Pour the hot broth into the fire pot and adjust the heat so the broth simmers gently.  Each diner cooks his or her choice of ingredients and seasons it with dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Did the Swiss invent fondue?  Not according to the Mongolian warriors.  The greatest culinary contribution of the Great Khan was undoubtedly the Mongolian fire pot, which metamorphosed in the West into a fondue pot.  But instead of cheese, the fire pot cooks meat and other ingredients in a savoury broth.  The Mongol emperors must have thrown some lively dinner parties.

Plotting your Fire Pot:  When purchasing a fire pot or hot pot, be sure to find one that is functional and not merely ornamental.  To prevent damage to the pot, fill the moat with hot broth before adding the charcoal.  Light the charcoal ahead of time in a barbecue, then transfer them to the fire pot.  Unable to find a traditional fire pot?  In a pinch, use an electric wok, or a portable gas burner, or even a fondue pot.  The Cantonese version of hot pot is called a fire pot, which is a large clay pot over a portable burner or cool-burning stove.

Soak the noodles in warm water to cover until softened, about 30 minutes; drain.  Cut the noodles into 3-inch pieces.  Place the noodles and spinach on a serving platter with the lamb, prawns, and onions.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to cook.

In separate small serving bowls, whisk the dipping sauce ingredients until blended.

<DirT>
In a large pot, bring the broth, ginger and wine to the boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to low; cover and simmer for 20 minutes.  Discard the ginger.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Set a Mongolian fire pot or an electric wok in the centre of the table.  Arrange the lamb platter and dipping sauces around the cooking vessel.  Pour the hot broth into the fire pot and adjust the heat so the broth simmers gently.  Each diner cooks his or her choice of ingredients and seasons it with dipping sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Did the Swiss invent fondue?  Not according to the Mongolian warriors.  The greatest culinary contribution of the Great Khan was undoubtedly the Mongolian fire pot, which metamorphosed in the West into a fondue pot.  But instead of cheese, the fire pot cooks meat and other ingredients in a savoury broth.  The Mongol emperors must have thrown some lively dinner parties.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Plotting your Fire Pot:  When purchasing a fire pot or hot pot, be sure to find one that is functional and not merely ornamental.  To prevent damage to the pot, fill the moat with hot broth before adding the charcoal.  Light the charcoal ahead of time in a barbecue, then transfer them to the fire pot.  Unable to find a traditional fire pot?  In a pinch, use an electric wok, or a portable gas burner, or even a fondue pot.  The Cantonese version of hot pot is called a fire pot, which is a large clay pot over a portable burner or cool-burning stove.

                               Tomato Beef

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  oyster-flavored sauce
  2        tablespoons  Chinese rice wine
     3/4         pound  beef (tri-tip or New York steak) -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/3           cup  chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  ketchup
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  chili garlic sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cooking oil
  1                cup  diced green bell pepper in 1" pieces
  1             medium  tomato -- cut into 8 wedges,
                        and then halved

To make the marinade:  Combine the oyster-flavored sauce and rice wine in a bowl.  Add the beef and stir to coat.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

To make the sauce:  Combine the chicken broth, ketchup, hoisin sauce, brown sugar and chili garlic sauce in a bowl.

Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the beef and stir-fry until no longer pink, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Add the bell pepper and tomato; stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add the sauce and bring to a boil.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Chinese cooks have often had to use tougher cuts of beef and have developed clever techniques and quick cooking methods to make them more palatable.  Marinating the meat in oyster-flavored sauce before stir-frying, as in this quickly made recipe for Tomato Beef, helps tenderize stringy fibers.  Fortunately for Americans, high-quality, tender cuts of beef are not hard to find here.

                              Tomato Beef II

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  flank steak -- thinly sliced
                        across the grain
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  drysherry or Chinese rice wine
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  catsup
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  distilled white vinegar
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  sugar
                        === COOKING ===
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1              small  onion -- cut 1" squares
  1              small  gren bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1" squares
  2             medium  tomatoes -- each cut 8 wedges
  2 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water

Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.  Add the beef, stir to coat, and set aside for 30 minutes.  Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the beef and stir-fry until barely pink, about 2 minutes.  Remove the beef from the wok and add the remaining tablespoon of oil.  Add the garlic and onion and cook until the onion is soft and translucent, about 1 minute.  Add the bell pepper; stir for 30 seconds.  Stir in the tomatoes and the sauce mixture and mix well.  Return the beef to the wok and add the cornstarch solution.  Cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Tip:  If you wish to peel the tomatoes before cutting them into wedges, dip them in boiling water for 15 to 30 seconds, plunge them into cold water to cool, then pull off the skin in strips.

Comments:  This is such a popular dish in most Chinese restaurants, I think of it as a blue plate special.  It cooks in a flash, and the combination of beef, vegetables, and my secret sauce makes it a good choice for an easy one-dish entree to serve with rice or noodles.

                      Turkey And Vegetable Stir-Fry

Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry
                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  ground turkey
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
                        === COOKING ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  frozen peas and carrots -- thawed
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped water chestnuts
  1                     green onion, including top -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1           teaspoon  water
     1/4           cup  chopped toasted walnuts
  1           teaspoon  chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley)

Combine the marinade ingredients in a small bowl.  Add the turkey, stirring to break it up and coat it with marinade.  Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the turkey and stir-fry, using the back of a spatula to break up the meat, until brown and crumbly, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Add the vegetables, broth, soy sauce, and sesame oil, cook for 1 minute, and add the cornstarch solution.  Cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Sprinkle with walnuts and cilantro just before serving.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Tips:  You can substitute lean ground beef for the turkey.

To toast the nuts, spread them in a shallow baking pan; bake uncovered in a preheated 350 degree oven, stirring occasionally, until toasty brown, 10 to 12 minutes.

Comments:  I never knew about turkey (or frozen peas and carrots for that matter) when I was growing up in Guangzhou, China.  It's a treat combining them in this easy, quick stir-fry.  Serve it over rice or noodles.

Add the turkey and stir-fry, using the back of a spatula to break up the meat, until brown and crumbly, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Add the vegetables, broth, soy sauce, and sesame oil, cook for 1 minute, and add the cornstarch solution.  Cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Sprinkle with walnuts and cilantro just before serving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 1 serving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tips:  You can substitute lean ground beef for the turkey.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To toast the nuts, spread them in a shallow baking pan; bake uncovered in a preheated 350 degree oven, stirring occasionally, until toasty brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  I never knew about turkey (or frozen peas and carrots for that matter) when I was growing up in Guangzhou, China.  It&apos;s a treat combining them in this easy, quick stir-fry.  Serve it over rice or noodles.

                            Twice-Cooked Pork

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless pork butt
  8             ounces  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
  8              small  dried red chillies
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  3                     spring onions -- cut 1" lengths
  8             ounces  napa cabbage -- cut bite-size
  2        tablespoons  hoisin sauce
  2          teaspoons  dark soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  light soy sauce
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  cornflour -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water

In a pan, combine the pork and chicken broth.  Bring to the boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low; cover and simmer until tender, 40 to 45 minutes.  Remove the pork from the pan and let cool; reserve the broth.  Cut the pork into thin slices.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the chiles and garlic; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the pork and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add the onions and cabbage; stir-fry for 30 seconds.

Add the reserved broth, hoisin sauce, dark and light soy sauces, and salt.  Cook until the cabbage is tender-crisp, about 3 minutes.  Add the cornflour solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  "Twice-cooked" refers to the two-step cooking process to create this dish.  It does not mean that you will only want to cook this dish twice.  Chances are, your guests will be asking for encores.

Excess Cabbage:  When I was growing up, cabbage was a regular guest of my family's dining table.  In China, in addition to regular cabbage, we also grow napa cabbage.  Both of these kinds have sweet, cream-colored stalks, and they are great in soup and bruising dishes.

                        Wok-Braised Chinese Fungus

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Mushrooms

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         ounce  dried white fungus (snow fungus)
     1/2         ounce  dried black fungus (cloud ear)
  12                    dried black mushrooms
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  oyster sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
                        === COOKING ===
  8                     Chinese (napa) cabbage leaves -- for garnish
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/2           cup  canned gingko nuts -- drained
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  4          teaspoons  water

Soak the white and black fungus and mushrooms in separate bowls in warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain.  Rinse the white fungus well to remove sand around the stems.  Cut off and discard the mushroom stems.  Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.

Cook the cabbage leaves in a large pot of boiling water for 1 minute and drain well.  Arrange on a serving platter.

Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the white and black fungus, mushrooms, gingko nuts, and sauce; mix well.  Cover and simmer over medium-low heat for 10 minutes.  Add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Serve over cabbage leaves.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Tips:  For extra contrast in texture, you can add a small can of sliced water chestnuts or sliced bamboo shoots.

Dried white fungus, also known as white tree fungus, snow ears, or silver fungus, have a spongy look in the dried state.  After soaking, they are soft and almost translucent.

There are two common varieties of black fungus available in markets.  Cloud ears are smaller and softer when soaked; wood ears are larger and firmer.  They are sold dried, for the most part, for their medicinal properties (they're believed to prevent blood clots) as well as for cooking.  Crumpled-looking, they have little flavor but a pleasant crunch.

Comments:  The location of prime fungus hunting grounds in China is a secret as closely guarded as the where-abouts of truffle hunting areas in Italy.  Don't worry.  You can buy all three kinds of fungus, including succulent dried black mushrooms, in your local Chinese market.  This typical Chinese dish is prized for its texture as well as its flavor.

                             Wor Wonton Soup

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     dried black mushrooms
  20                    wonton wrappers
                        === FILLING ===
     1/4         pound  lean ground pork
     1/4         pound  medium raw shrimp -- shelled, deveined
                        and coarsely chopped
  1                     green onion, including top -- minced
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === COOKING ===
  1                     large can chicken broth - (49 1/2 oz)
  1                cup  sliced bok choy leaves in 1" pieces
  1                cup  snow peas -- ends, and
                        strings removed
     1/2         pound  Chinese barbecued pork or ham -- thinly sliced
  1                     green onion, including top -- thinly sliced
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil

Soak the mushrooms in warm water for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut off and discard the stems and thinly slice the caps.  Set aside.  Combine the filling ingredients in a medium bowl; mix well.

To fill each wonton, place 1 heaping teaspoon of filling in the center of a wonton wrapper (keep the remaining wrappers covered to prevent drying).  Brush the edges of the wrapper lightly with water, fold it in half over the filling to form a triangle, and press the edges firmly to seal.  Place the filled wontons slightly apart on a baking sheet and cover them with a damp cloth while filling the remaining wrappers.

Bring the broth to a boil in a large pot over high heat,  Add the mushrooms and bok choy and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the wontons and cook 3 minutes.  Add the snow peas and cook for 1 minute.  Ladle the wontons and broth into large individual bowls and garnish each serving with slices of barbecued pork and green onion.  Sprinkle with pepper and sesame oil before serving.

This recipe yields 5 servings.

Tips:  In Chinese restaurants the wontons are cooked separately in water so the broth will not become cloudy.  Here they are cook in the broth for convenience.

You can fill the wontons ahead of time and cover and refrigerate them for up to 8 hours.  For longer storage, freeze them on a baking sheet, then transfer them to a plastic bag and return them to the freezer.  Do not thaw before cooking; add 2 minutes to the cooking time.

Comments:  Every country has its chicken soup.  Wonton soup, with its ravioli-like pasta, is a wonderful Chinese version.  Wonton means "swallowing the clouds."  With their skirt-like sides, wontons float in soup like little trailing clouds.  "Wor" in Chinese means large pot or stock pot.  Wor wonton means a pot of wontons with lots of goodies.
