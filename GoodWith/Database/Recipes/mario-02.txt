--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1              pound  Montasio cheese -- shredded
     1/8           cup  sauerkraut
     1/8           cup  chopped pickles
     1/8           cup  shredded roasted chicken

In each of four 7- to 10-inch non-stick saute pans, heat 1/2 tablespoon butter over medium heat until it browns.  Place 2 1/2 tablespoons cheese in the center of each pan to form a crepe-like disk, about 4 to 5 inches across.

Place the sauerkraut on one, the pickles on another and the chicken on a third.  Sprinkle another tablespoon of shredded cheese over each one and press with a spatula.  After cooking 3 to 4 minutes, the bottom will be golden-brown.  Carefully flip with a spatula and cook 3 to 4 minutes on the other side.

Transfer to a plate covered with paper towels to drain grease and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fritters

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         medium  zucchinis -- rinsed, dried
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced scallions
     1/2           cup  Sardegna sheep's milk ricotta
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper - (to 2)
                        Zest of 2 lemons
  3                     eggs
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  olive oil

Grate the zucchini with a hand grater into a mixing bowl.  Add garlic, scallions and ricotta and stir to mix well.  Add pepper, lemon zest and eggs and stir through.  Add flour, three to four tablespoons at a time, stirring constantly to avoid lumps, until all flour is mixed in.

In a 12- to 14-inch frying pan, heat oil until 375 degrees, or just under the smoking point.  Scoop 1/8 cup of zucchini mixture and gently drop into the hot oil.  Being careful not to crowd the pan, add three to four more similar-sized scoops.

Cook until golden-brown, about 45 seconds, and flip with a spatula.  Continue cooking until all are done.  Drain each on paper towels before placing on serving platter with lemon wedges and a radicchio salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Dumplings                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  russet potatoes
  6               cups  ice
  6               cups  cold water
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                     extra-large egg
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  canola oil

Boil the whole potatoes until they are soft (about 45 minutes).  While still warm, peel and pass through vegetable mill onto clean pasta board.

Set 6 quarts of water to boil in a large spaghetti pot.  Set up ice bath with 6 cups ice and 6 cups water near boiling water.

Make well in center of potatoes and sprinkle all over with flour, using all the flour.  Place egg and salt in center of well and using a fork, stir into flour and potatoes, just like making normal pasta.  Once egg is mixed in, bring dough together, kneading gently until a ball is formed.  Knead gently another 4 minutes until ball is dry to touch.

Roll baseball-sized ball of dough into 3/4-inch diameter dowels and cut dowels into 1-inch long pieces.  Flick pieces off of fork or concave side of cheese grater until dowel is finished.  Drop these pieces into boiling water and cook until they float (about 1 minute).  Meanwhile, continue with remaining dough, forming dowels, cutting into 1-inch pieces and flicking off of fork.

As gnocchi float to top of boiling water, remove them to ice bath.  Continue until all have been cooled off.  Let sit several minutes in bath and drain from ice and water.  Toss with 1/2 cup canola oil and store covered in refrigerator up to 48 hours until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings of gnocchi.

  3             pounds  Russet potatoes
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                     extra-large egg
  1              pinch  salt
                        === FILLING ===
  5              small  plums - (smallest possible) -- quartered
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        === SAUCE ===
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  fresh bread crumbs
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon

Boil the whole potatoes until they are soft (about 45 minutes).  While still warm, peel and pass through vegetable mill onto clean pasta board.  Make well in center of potatoes and sprinkle all over with flour, using all the flour.  Place egg and salt in center of well and using a fork, stir into flour and potatoes, just like making normal pasta.  Once egg is mixed in, bring dough together, kneading gently until a ball is formed.  Knead gently another 4 minutes until ball is dry to touch.

To make Gnocchi di Susine:  Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt.

Pinch off walnut-sized balls of gnocchi dough and roll with rolling pin to form 2 1/2-inch circle of dough.  Place one quarter of plum and a 1/2 teaspoon sugar on each and fold dough around plum pieces to form a package with no tears or rips, relatively smooth and evenly coated.  Continue until all are finished.  If making pasta ahead cook and the shock in cold water.

Place gnocchi in water, 10 at a time, and carefully stir to prevent sticking to sides or bottom of pan.  Allow to float and continue cooking for 2 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt butter in a 12-inch saute pan over medium heat.  Add bread crumbs and then add cooked gnocchi and toss gently to coat.  Serve on a plate and sprinkle with cinnamon.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  sweet butter -- divided
  2        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1              large  red onion -- finely chopped
  2                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced 1/8" pieces
  1 1/2           cups  arborio rice
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        = (such as Albana di Romagna)
  4               cups  homemade chicken stock - (to 5) -- simmering
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian flat leaf parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons sweet butter and virgin olive oil until melted together.  Add onion and cook over medium heat until soft and not yet browned.  Add apples and rice and cook about 3 to 4 minutes, until rice has acquired a pearly opaque quality.  Add the wine and simmer until evaporated.

Add enough warm chicken stock to cover rice and cook until the level of the liquid goes down below the level of the rice.  Continue cooking, adding stock and stirring constantly until most of stock is gone, about 15 to 18 minutes.

The rice should be tender and still retain an al dente bite.  Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, grated cheese and parsley and season with salt and pepper.  Serve immediately with additional grated cheese on the side.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh spinach -- rinsed, shaken dry
  1              pound  potatoes -- boiled, peeled,
                        and riced
     3/4           cup  flour
  1                     egg
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

Set up small ice bath.

In a pot with a lid, cook spinach over medium heat, allowing it to steam from the liquid still present on the leaves, about one minute.

Meanwhile, take warm boiled potatoes, peel and run them through a food mill on smallest setting.  Remove cooked spinach and shock in ice bath.  Drain well and wrap in clean side towel and twist to totally dry leaves.  Chop finely (and I mean FINELY) with a knife and add to potatoes.  Make well in center, add flour,egg and salt and knead to form dough.

Bring 6 quarts water to boil and retain initial ice bath.  Roll dough into one-inch thick ropes and cut into 1-inch long pieces.  Flick off fork tines to establish classic shape and drop 10 to 15 at a time into boiling water.  When they float, all together, remove to ice bath.  Repeat until all are done.  Remove from ice bath and drain.  Dress with oil and hold covered in bowl in refrigerator until ready to use.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     extra-large eggs
  6             ounces  frozen chopped spinach -- defrosted, and
                        squeezed very dry
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
                        extra flour for dusting
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil

Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil and spinach.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs, oil and spinach and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when 1/2 of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands primarily.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits.  Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

This recipe yields 1 pound of pasta.

Comments:  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are essential for a light pasta.

Place all fish on the bottom of the two-grill sandwich piece and close top.  Place on grill and cook 7 to 8 minutes, or until eyes of the fish have completely clouded over.  Turn over and grill 7 to 8 more minutes, checking to see that thickest part of monkfish is cooked through.

Remove and carefully separate grill holder from fish and serve on large platter with radicchio salad, lemons and extra virgin olive oil.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  beef, top round - (abt 4 oz ea)
  1                cup  grated Pecorino
  4        tablespoons  bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
     1/4           cup  currants
  8                     three-inch rosemary sprigs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             ounces  olive oil
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

Preheat barbecue or grill.  Soak the rosemary sprigs in cool water for 1 hour.  Soak the currants in warm water for 1 hour; drain.

Using a kitchen mallet or wide cleaver, pound each slice of beef between 2 oiled pieces of wax paper until thin yet not torn, about 1/16-inch thick.  Lay each piece out on a cool working surface.

In a mixing bowl, stir together Pecorino, bread crumbs, parsley, pine nuts and plumped, drained currants until well blended.  Season the beef slices with salt and pepper.  Divide the Pecorino mixture among the 8 pieces of beef, spreading it out thinly.  Roll the beef up tightly like a burrito and secure with toothpicks.

Lay 4 pairs of beef rolls side by side a half-inch apart and skewer them with 2 rosemary sprigs to yield 4 sets.  Season with salt and pepper and brush with olive oil.  Grill until cooked, about 3 to 4 minutes per side, and serve immediately with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2            bottles  balsamic vinegar
  1              pound  magret of duck with fat
     1/2         pound  pork butt
     1/4         pound  pancetta
  1           teaspoon  cumin seeds
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4         pound  caul fat
                        = (available at specialty butcher shops)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2               cups  kale (bitter escarole) -- cut 1/2" ribbons
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Reduce the balsamic vinegar to 20 percent to syrup consistancy.  Set aside.

Preheat the broiler or grill.

Cut the duck, pork butt and Pancetta into 1/4-inch cubes.  Run the meat through a grinder.  The mixture should be quite rough.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat with the cinnamon, cumin and salt.  Mix very well.  Divide the mixture into 8 equal oval patties, about 1/2-inch thick.  Wrap each patty in caul fat.  Place the patties under the broiler or on the grill and cook through, about 4 to 5 minutes per side.  Set aside.

In a large 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil until just smoking.  Add the garlic and saute until very light brown, about 2 minutes.  Toss in the kale and saute, stirring quickly, about 2 to 3 minutes, until just wilted but not too soft.  Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper.

Divide the mixture equally on 4 plates.  Place 2 crepinettes on each plate, drizle the balsamic syrup over the greens, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  broccoli rabe, whole -- blanched, refreshed
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  24                    scallions or spring onions -- root end trimmed
     1/2           cup  sweet vermouth
     1/4           cup  sundried tomatoes -- soaked 10 min. in
     1/2           cup  boiling water
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  capers
  12             small  soft shell crabs
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat grill.  Remove florets from broccoli rabe and cut stems and leaves into 1-inch pieces.

In a 10-inch to 12-inch saute pan, heat 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil until just smoking.  Toss scallions and cook 2 minutes, stirring often until just wilted.  Add broccoli rabe and sweet vermouth and continue cooking 2 to 3 minutes, until scallions are quite soft.  Season with salt and pepper.  Set aside and allow to cool to room temperature.

In a blender, add sundried tomatoes, soaking water, balsamic vinegar, capers and 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil and blend until smooth, about 1 minute.  Remove from blender and set aside.

Clean soft shell crabs by cutting off face and removing gills.  Season with black pepper and place onto grill.  Cook until crisp and bright-red (about 5 minutes each side).

Meanwhile, divide rabe/scallion mixture among 4 plates.  Place 3 crabs on each plate, drip 2 tablespoons tomato pesto around crabs and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1             recipe  Strudel Pastry -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  walnuts -- chopped roughly
     1/2           cup  hazelnuts -- chopped roughly
                        Zest of 1 lemon
                        Zest of 1 orange
     1/4           cup  candied citron
     1/4           cup  semi-sweet chocolate pieces -- roughly chopped
     1/4           cup  currants -- soaked 1 hour in

     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  3        tablespoons  sugar

Preheat oven to 375 degrees and grease a cookie sheet.

In a large mixing bowl, combine walnuts, hazelnuts, lemon zest, orange zest, candied citron, chocolate pieces, currants, soaking liquid and stir to combine.  Add egg whites and 1/4 cup sugar and fold together.

Roll the pastry up like a jelly roll from south to north so it appears to be a thick pipe.  Make a circle of the pipe by attaching the two open ends like a wreath.  Brush with beaten eggs yolks and sprinkle with remaining sugar.

Place on cookie sheet and bake 50 minutes.  Allow to cool before cutting.  Serve with Verduzzo wine.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- finely sliced
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  fennel seeds
  1              pound  pork shoulder meat -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1                cup  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  2               cups  dry red wine
     1/2           cup  fresh mint leaves
  4                     eggs
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated pecorino
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped italian parsley
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- plus 1/4 cup
     3/4           cup  fine semolina
     1/2           cup  warm water -- with
  4             ounces  butter -- melted in it
  1              pinch  salt

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat olive oil until smoking.  Add onion, garlic and fennel seeds and saute until light golden-brown.  Add pork, season with salt and cook until lightly browned.  Add vinegar, sugar, Basic Tomato Sauce and wine and bring to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer 1 hour, until very tender.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

In a mixing bowl, place cooled pork mixture, mint, 2 eggs, pecorino and parsley and stir to combine.  Set aside.

Mix flour and semolina together in a mixing bowl and make a well.  Add water-butter mixture and stir to form a ball of dough.  Remove dough from bowl and place on work surface.  Knead for 1 minute, wrap in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees and line a cookie sheet with parchment.

Roll out dough to 1/4-inch thick and cut out 6-inch circles.  Place two to three tablespoons of pork mixture in each one and fold to form a half moon.  Seal edges, pressing with fingertips and place on lined baking sheet.  Continue until all the dough is used up.

Beat remaining 2 eggs and brush each impanada with the egg wash.  Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until golden-brown and remove.  Serve warm with a marinated tomato salad.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     thin slices Leg or shoulder of lamb -- about 4" x 4" x 1/4"
  8                     paper-thin prosciutto slices
  8             pieces  young Pecorino cheese - (2 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint leaves
  6        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves -- divided
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- finely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  dried hot chilies
  1                cup  dry red wine
  3               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1             recipe  Orecchiette Made From Eggless Pasta -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  freshly-grated hard Pecorino

Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Using a meat mallet or cleaver blade, pat each lamb piece until it's 1/16-inch thick.  Onto each lamb piece place one slice of Prosciutto and 1 piece of cheese.  Mix rosemary, mint and 2 tablespoons parsley and divide among 8 pieces of lamb.  Season with salt and pepper and roll like a burrito to form a little package.  Tie each with 2 pieces of butcher's twine.

In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat olive oil until smoking.  Brown lamb pieces 4 at a time until golden brown all over and remove.  Add onions and garlic and cook until softened and lightly browned.  Add chilies, red wine and Basic Tomato Sauce and bring to a boil.  Lower heat to medium and place meat in pan with sauce, submerging the meat halfway.  Simmer uncovered for 20 to 30 minutes, or until lamb is fork tender.

Put Orecchiette into boiling water and cook until al dente, about 6 to 7 minutes, and drain.

Remove meat from sauce and toss orecchiette into sauce.  Remove strings from meat.  Pour orecchiette into a large serving bowl.  Place meat on top, sprinkle with cheese and serve.

Using a meat mallet or cleaver blade, pat each lamb piece until it&apos;s 1/16-inch thick.  Onto each lamb piece place one slice of Prosciutto and 1 piece of cheese.  Mix rosemary, mint and 2 tablespoons parsley and divide among 8 pieces of lamb.  Season with salt and pepper and roll like a burrito to form a little package.  Tie each with 2 pieces of butcher&apos;s twine.

In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat olive oil until smoking.  Brown lamb pieces 4 at a time until golden brown all over and remove.  Add onions and garlic and cook until softened and lightly browned.  Add chilies, red wine and Basic Tomato Sauce and bring to a boil.  Lower heat to medium and place meat in pan with sauce, submerging the meat halfway.  Simmer uncovered for 20 to 30 minutes, or until lamb is fork tender.

Put Orecchiette into boiling water and cook until al dente, about 6 to 7 minutes, and drain.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  fine semolina
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  ground saffron

To make pasta:  Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the semolina and add the water, salt and saffron.  Using a fork, beat together the water, salt and saffron and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.  As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any leftover crusty bits.  Discard these bits.  Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe.  They are essential for a light pasta.

After allowing to rest, cut pasta into 4 pieces and roll into dowels 1-inch round.  Cut into 1/4-inch thick pieces and roll each piece along the back of a fork to form lined mallorredus.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  three-pound fish
                        = (snapper, bream, sea bass or porgy)
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  Gaeta olives
  2                     jalapeÒos -- seeded and chopped
  1 1/2           cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1               head  fennel -- sliced paper thin,
                        fronds chopped and set aside
  1              bunch  fresh oregano -- leaves only
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Clean and gut fish, remove top and bottom fins, scale and remove gills.  Stand fish up in a shallow casserole, just large enough to hold the fish.  Pour wine over fish and add olives, jalapeÒos, Basic Tomato Sauce, fennel and oregano.

Drizzle fish with olive oil, place in oven and cook until just cooked through, about 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove, sprinkle with fennel fronds and serve immediately.  (An excellent contorno for this dish would be tiny potatoes, roasted with garlic and rosemary.)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Drizzle fish with olive oil, place in oven and cook until just cooked through, about 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove, sprinkle with fennel fronds and serve immediately.  (An excellent contorno for this dish would be tiny potatoes, roasted with garlic and rosemary.)

  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- divided
  2             medium  Spanish onions -- sliced 1/4" slices
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  2               cups  milk

Place both types of flour in a large mixing bowl and stir to mix well.  Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add water a little at a time, stirring with your hands until a dough is formed.  You may need more or less water, depending on the humidity in your kitchen.

Place the dough on a floured work surface and knead it like bread for 8 to 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.  Cover and let stand for 10 minutes at room temperature.

Roll dough into long dowels about 3 to 4 inches thick.  Cut into flat disks about 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thick.  Press center of each disk with thumb to form saucer-shaped pasta and set aside until ready to cook.

This recipe yields enough pasta for 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  chick pea flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped italian parsley
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
                        Zest of 2 lemons -- finely chopped
                        Oil -- for frying

In a 4- to 6-quart saucepan, dissolve chick pea flour and salt in 3 cups cold water.  Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly until consistency resembles cream of wheat, about 20 minutes.

Stir in chopped parsley and spread mixture onto a cookie sheet, flattening until about 1/2-inch thick and allow to cool.  Using a water glass, cut into 2 1/2-inch rounds and set aside.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat almonds, black pepper, sea salt and lemon zest over medium-high heat and cook 3 to 4 minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted and infused with lemon fragrance.  Set aside.

Heat a few inches of cooking oil in a tall frying pan to 375 degrees.  Fry chick pea disks 4 to 5 at a time until golden-brown, about 30 to 45 seconds.  Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with almond mixture and serve just warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

     1/2           cup  pomade olive oil -- for frying
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  fresh ricotta
  3                     eggs

  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/8           cup  virgin olive oil
  2                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  cool water - (to 4)
     1/2           cup  pomace olive oil -- for frying
                        === SAUCE ===
  4                     duck legs and thighs -- skin removed
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- chopped 1/4" dice
  1             medium  carrot -- peeled, chopped fine
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, sliced thin
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped 1/4" dice
  8             ounces  red wine
                        = (Chianti preferred)
  1              pound  canned peeled whole tomatoes
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1              ounce  dried porcini mushrooms

Pasta:  Stir together flour and salt and add olive oil, stirring with a whisk.  Add eggs and mix with hands until sticky.  Add water 1 tablespoon at a time until dough stays together.  Knead 5 to 8 minutes until pliable.  Cover and allow to rest 15 minutes.

Ragu:  Wash duck legs and remove all fat.  Pat dry.  In a thick-bottomed casserole or Dutch oven, heat olive oil until smoking.  Add duck legs and cook until brown on all sides and remove, about 10 to 12 minutes.

Add onion, carrot, garlic and celery and cook until softened, about 7 to 9 minutes. Add wine, tomatoes, chicken stock and dried mushrooms and bring to a boil.  Add duck legs and return to boil, lower heat, cover and allow to simmer for 1 hour.

Remove duck legs and allow to cool.  Pull all meat off the bones and return to pot, without the bones.  Simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, or until quite thick.  Season with salt and pepper and set aside.

In a large pot, bring 6 quarts of water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Roll the pasta dough out to its thinnest setting and then cut by hand into pappardelle, about 1- to 1 1/4-inch thick.

Heat 2 cups duck ragu in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan until quite hot.  Boil pappardelle until cooked, about 1 minute and drain well.  Put hot pappardelle into pan with duck ragu and toss well.  Pour into serving bowl and serve immediately.

  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  salt -- divided
  2        tablespoons  virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/2           cup  virgin olive oil
  1              quart  olive oil for frying
  4                     lemons
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Soak the baccala for 2 days, changing the water at least twice daily.  Drain baccala and pat dry, checking for bones but leaving intact any skin pieces.  Cut baccala into 3-inch by 1-inch pieces and set aside.

In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together flour, water, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt and two tablespoons virgin olive oil until very smooth.

In a 6-inch deep frying pan, heat 1 quart oil to 370 degrees.  Dip baccala into batter and drop into oil, 2 to 3 pieces at a time, and fry until golden-brown on all sides, about 6 to 7 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.

While pieces are frying, quarter 3 lemons and remove the seeds.  Chop roughly and place in food processor with remaining 1/2 cup of virgin olive oil, teaspoon of salt, sugar and pepper and blend until smooth and thick.  Pour lemon pesto into serving bowl.  When all baccala is cooked, serve immediately with lemon wedges and lemon pesto dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  light red or white wine
                        = (such as Ruspo from Cappezzana)
     3/4           cup  warm water
  1 1/2         ounces  brewer's yeast
  1         tablespoon  honey
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided

Place wine, water and yeast in a large bowl and stir until dissolved.  Add honey, salt and olive oil and mix through.  Add 1 cup flour and mix with a wooden spoon until it becomes a loose batter.  Add 2 more cups of flour and stir in as much as you can with the wooden spoon (2 to 3 minutes).

Bring dough together with your hands and turn out onto floured board or marble surface.  Knead about 6 to 8 minutes until you have made a smooth, firm dough.  Place in a clean, lightly-oiled bowl and cover with a towel.  Let rise in the warmest part of the kitchen for 45 minutes.

For individual pizzas or calzones, cut the dough into four equal pieces and knead into rounds.  For one large pizza, knead into one large round.  For both, let rest 15 minutes.

This recipe yields enough dough for 4 servings.
