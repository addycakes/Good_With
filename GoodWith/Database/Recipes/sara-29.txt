  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CENTER MIXTURE ===
     1/2           cup  cream
  9             ounces  semisweet or bittersweet chocolate
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup
  2        tablespoons  Cognac, rum, or
                        other liquor or liqueur
                        === ENROBING ===
     3/4         pound  semisweet or bittersweet chocolate
  3               cups  cocoa powder

Bring cream to a boil.  Remove from heat and add chocolate; allow to stand several minutes, add butter, corn syrup, liquor and whisk smooth.  Cool about 2 to 3 hours at room temperature to about 80 degrees.  Beat with paddle on medium speed in electric mixer until light.  Pipe out small truffles on paper with a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tube.  Refrigerate to set for at least 1 hour.

Enrobing:  Melt and cool or temper the chocolate.  Sift the cocoa into a deep pan.  Coat truffles, using your hand to cover truffles with tempered chocolate.  Deposit the truffles in the cocoa as they are enrobed and shake the pan to cover them.  Remove the truffles to another pan as they are coated.  After the covering sets, shake the truffles in a strainer to remove the excess cocoa.

This recipe yields 35 to 50 truffles depending on size.

Comments:  These are classics; the flavoring may be added by changing the liqueur.  Also, try adding some chopped, toasted nuts to the whipped center mixture and rolling the finished truffles in chopped, toasted nuts instead of cocoa.  This recipe is an example of Truffle Ganache.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  3             pounds  mixed apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/8" thick slices
  1                     vanilla bean -- halved lengthwise
  1                     lemon -- zested
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     1/2           cup  sugar -- or more to taste
                        === FOR THE CRUST ===
  8             slices  firm white bread - (to 10) -- crusts removed
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- clarified
                        === VANILLA CUSTARD SAUCE ===
  2               cups  milk
  1                     vanilla bean
                        = (or 1 tspn vanilla extract)
  6                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar

Make the Filling:  Melt the butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat.  Add the apples in an even layer, then the vanilla bean, lemon zest, lemon juice, and sugar.  Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are completely soft, 25 to 30 minutes.

Remove the cover, increase the heat if necessary for the apples to be bubbling vigorously, and continue cooking, stirring frequently, until any liquid has evaporated and the thickened apple mixture moves around as a mass when you stir it, about 15 minutes.  It may caramelize in spots, but watch it so it doesn't get too dark.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place a round of buttered parchment paper in the bottom of a 1-quart charlotte mold or ovenproof bowl with a flat bottom.

Prepare the Crust:  Cut about 4 slices of the bread in half to form triangles, and then cut those triangles in half.  Brush 1 side of each triangle lightly with butter, and arrange them in the base of the prepared mold, buttered-side down, so they completely cover the bottom.  If there are any spaces, fill them in with pieces of bread that are cut to fit.

Cut the remaining bread slices into 14 to 16 (1-inch) wide strips, and trim them so they are just long enough to reach the top of the mold.  Lightly brush each with clarified butter, and arrange them, buttered-side out, upright along the sides of the mold to completely line it, overlapping them slightly.  Set aside the extra bread strips.

Remove the vanilla bean from the apples and discard it.  Spoon the apple mixture into the mold.  The apples may mound above the edge of the mold; they will sink during cooking.  Completely cover the apple filling with any remaining pieces of bread, cut to fit, buttered-side out.

Place the charlotte mold on a baking sheet, and bake it on the center rack of the oven for 15 minutes.  Then reduce the heat to 350 degrees, and continue baking until the bread on the top and sides is deep golden, about 35 minutes.  If the top is getting too dark, cover it loosely with aluminum foil.

Transfer the charlotte mold to a wire rack and let it cool for 15 minutes.  Then, place a serving plate over the top of the mold and carefully flip it over.  The charlotte will slide right out.  Because of its pudding-like consistency, use 2 large spoons to cut the charlotte.  Serve it warm or at room temperature, with the Vanilla Custard Sauce alongside.

Vanilla Custard Sauce:  Combine the milk and the vanilla bean, if using, in a medium-sized heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.  Scald the milk by heating it just until little bubbles form around the edge of the pan.  Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and set aside to infuse for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks and the sugar together in a medium bowl until pale yellow and thick.

Strain the hot milk into a bowl, and discard the vanilla bean.  Whisk the milk into the egg yolk mixture, add the vanilla extract, if using, and return it to the saucepan.  Cook, stirring constantly, over medium-low heat until the custard has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, 8 to 10 minutes.  Be careful not to let the custard curdle.

Immediately transfer the custard to a bowl, to stop the cooking of the custard.  Let it cool to room temperature, and then serve or cover and refrigerate.  The custard will thicken in the refrigerator, and it will keep for 1 day.  (Makes 2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Make the Filling:  Melt the butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat.  Add the apples in an even layer, then the vanilla bean, lemon zest, lemon juice, and sugar.  Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are completely soft, 25 to 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the cover, increase the heat if necessary for the apples to be bubbling vigorously, and continue cooking, stirring frequently, until any liquid has evaporated and the thickened apple mixture moves around as a mass when you stir it, about 15 minutes.  It may caramelize in spots, but watch it so it doesn&apos;t get too dark.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place a round of buttered parchment paper in the bottom of a 1-quart charlotte mold or ovenproof bowl with a flat bottom.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare the Crust:  Cut about 4 slices of the bread in half to form triangles, and then cut those triangles in half.  Brush 1 side of each triangle lightly with butter, and arrange them in the base of the prepared mold, buttered-side down, so they completely cover the bottom.  If there are any spaces, fill them in with pieces of bread that are cut to fit.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut the remaining bread slices into 14 to 16 (1-inch) wide strips, and trim them so they are just long enough to reach the top of the mold.  Lightly brush each with clarified butter, and arrange them, buttered-side out, upright along the sides of the mold to completely line it, overlapping them slightly.  Set aside the extra bread strips.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the vanilla bean from the apples and discard it.  Spoon the apple mixture into the mold.  The apples may mound above the edge of the mold; they will sink during cooking.  Completely cover the apple filling with any remaining pieces of bread, cut to fit, buttered-side out.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the charlotte mold on a baking sheet, and bake it on the center rack of the oven for 15 minutes.  Then reduce the heat to 350 degrees, and continue baking until the bread on the top and sides is deep golden, about 35 minutes.  If the top is getting too dark, cover it loosely with aluminum foil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the charlotte mold to a wire rack and let it cool for 15 minutes.  Then, place a serving plate over the top of the mold and carefully flip it over.  The charlotte will slide right out.  Because of its pudding-like consistency, use 2 large spoons to cut the charlotte.  Serve it warm or at room temperature, with the Vanilla Custard Sauce alongside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Vanilla Custard Sauce:  Combine the milk and the vanilla bean, if using, in a medium-sized heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.  Scald the milk by heating it just until little bubbles form around the edge of the pan.  Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and set aside to infuse for 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks and the sugar together in a medium bowl until pale yellow and thick.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Strain the hot milk into a bowl, and discard the vanilla bean.  Whisk the milk into the egg yolk mixture, add the vanilla extract, if using, and return it to the saucepan.  Cook, stirring constantly, over medium-low heat until the custard has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, 8 to 10 minutes.  Be careful not to let the custard curdle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Immediately transfer the custard to a bowl, to stop the cooking of the custard.  Let it cool to room temperature, and then serve or cover and refrigerate.  The custard will thicken in the refrigerator, and it will keep for 1 day.  (Makes 2 cups)

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced, and
                        mashed to a paste with
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  skirt steak -- trimmed, and
                        cut large pieces to fit on a grill or
                        broiler pan or in a ridged grill pan
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2                     assorted colored bell peppers -- sliced thin
  1              large  red onion -- sliced thin
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  8                     flour tortillas - (7" to 8" dia)
                        Salsa - (store bought or home made)
                        === GUACAMOLE ===
  2                     ripe seasonal avocados
     1/2         small  onion -- minced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced, and
                        mashed to a paste with
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4          teaspoons  fresh lime juice -- or to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1                     fresh or pickled jalapeÒo chile -- if desired,
                        seeded and minced (wear rubber gloves)
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro -- if desired

In a large bowl whisk together the garlic paste, lime juice, cumin, and olive oil.  Add the steak to the marinade, turning it to coat it well, and let it marinate, covered and chilled, for at least 1 hour or overnight.

Grill the steak, drained, on a well-oiled rack set about 5 inches over glowing coals or in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until it is just springy to the touch, for medium-rare meat.  (Alternatively, the steak may be broiled on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat.)  Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let it stand for 10 minutes.

While the steak is standing, in a large skillet heat the oil over moderately-high heat until it is hot but not smoking, add the bell peppers, onion, and garlic, and saute the mixture, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the bell peppers are softened.

To warm tortillas:

In the oven:  Stack 4 tortillas at a time, wrap each stack in foil, and heat the tortillas in the middle of a preheated 325 degree oven for 15 minutes.  (If the tortillas are very dry to begin with, pat each tortilla between dampened hands before stacking them.)

In the microwave:  Stack 6 tortillas at time, wrap each stack in a microwave-safe plastic bag, and heat the tortillas in a microwave oven at high power (100 percent) for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until they are heated through and pliable.

Slice the steak thinly, across the grain, on the diagonal and arrange the slices on a platter with the bell pepper mixture.  Drizzle any steak juices over the steak and the pepper mixture and serve the steak and the pepper mixture with the tortillas, the guacamole, and the salsa.

To assemble a fajita:  Spread some of the guacamole on a tortilla, top it with a few slices of the steak, some of the pepper mixture, and some of the salsa, and roll up the tortilla to enclose the filling.

Guacamole:  Halve and pit the avocados and scoop the flesh into a bowl.  Mash the avocados coarsely with a fork and stir in the onion, garlic paste, lime juice, cumin, chile, and cilantro.  The guacamole may be made 2 hours in advance, its surface covered with plastic wrap, and chilled.  (Makes about 2 cups)

In a large bowl whisk together the garlic paste, lime juice, cumin, and olive oil.  Add the steak to the marinade, turning it to coat it well, and let it marinate, covered and chilled, for at least 1 hour or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grill the steak, drained, on a well-oiled rack set about 5 inches over glowing coals or in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until it is just springy to the touch, for medium-rare meat.  (Alternatively, the steak may be broiled on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat.)  Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let it stand for 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the steak is standing, in a large skillet heat the oil over moderately-high heat until it is hot but not smoking, add the bell peppers, onion, and garlic, and saute the mixture, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the bell peppers are softened.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To warm tortillas:
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the oven:  Stack 4 tortillas at a time, wrap each stack in foil, and heat the tortillas in the middle of a preheated 325 degree oven for 15 minutes.  (If the tortillas are very dry to begin with, pat each tortilla between dampened hands before stacking them.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the microwave:  Stack 6 tortillas at time, wrap each stack in a microwave-safe plastic bag, and heat the tortillas in a microwave oven at high power (100 percent) for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until they are heated through and pliable.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Slice the steak thinly, across the grain, on the diagonal and arrange the slices on a platter with the bell pepper mixture.  Drizzle any steak juices over the steak and the pepper mixture and serve the steak and the pepper mixture with the tortillas, the guacamole, and the salsa.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble a fajita:  Spread some of the guacamole on a tortilla, top it with a few slices of the steak, some of the pepper mixture, and some of the salsa, and roll up the tortilla to enclose the filling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Guacamole:  Halve and pit the avocados and scoop the flesh into a bowl.  Mash the avocados coarsely with a fork and stir in the onion, garlic paste, lime juice, cumin, chile, and cilantro.  The guacamole may be made 2 hours in advance, its surface covered with plastic wrap, and chilled.  (Makes about 2 cups)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  unflavored gelatin
  2        tablespoons  whole milk
     1/4           cup  confectioners' sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2 1/2      teaspoons  finely-grated fresh orange zest
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
     3/4           cup  sour cream
  2                     Navel oranges
                        Chopped pistachios -- for garnish
                        === ORANGE VANILLA SAUCE ===
  1                cup  sugar
  2               cups  orange juice
     1/2                vanilla bean -- scraped
  2        tablespoons  orange flavored liqueur -- (optional)

Special equipment needed:  6 (1/2-cup) decorative metal molds

Sprinkle gelatin over milk in a small bowl and let stand 1 minute to soften.

Whisk together confectioners' sugar, salt, and 1 cup of the heavy cream.

Cook granulated sugar in a dry small heavy saucepan over moderate heat, undisturbed, until it begins to melt.  Continue to cook, stirring occasionally with a fork, until sugar is melted into a golden caramel.  Stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons zest and cook, stirring, until zest is toasted and fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Stir the cream mixture and carefully add to caramel (it will bubble and harden).  Cook over moderately-low heat, stirring, until caramel is dissolved.

Stir in gelatin mixture and remaining teaspoon zest until gelatin is dissolved.  Stir in orange juice, then let stand just until cooled to room temperature.  Pour through a fine sieve into a medium bowl.

Beat remaining 1/2 cup heavy cream with an electric mixer until it just holds soft peaks.  Whisk sour cream in another bowl until smooth.  Fold whipped cream into sour cream, then fold into caramel mixture until combined well.  Whisk to remove any lumps.  The mixture should be smooth.

Spoon into molds and chill until firm, at least 8 hours.

Dip molds in hot water 2 or 3 seconds, until it begins to melt slightly on the edges and run a thin knife around edge of molds to help release panna cotta.  Invert onto dessert plates and let stand at room temperature 20 minutes.

While panna cotta is standing, remove peel and white pith from oranges with a sharp knife, and cut the sections free from membranes.

Orange Vanilla Sauce:  In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, orange juice, and vanilla bean and bring to a boil.  Reduce the mixture to 1 1/4 cups.  Remove from the heat.  If using the orange liqueur, stir it in.

Allow to cool before serving over the panna cotta.  (Makes 1 1/4 cups)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  chicken pieces
                        = (legs and breasts)
  4                     garlic cloves
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (2" long, 1" wide)
  6             medium  onions
  10                    cloves
  20                    black peppercorns
  8                     cardamom pods -- seeded
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  poppy seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  ground mace
  4          teaspoons  salt -- divided
  3        tablespoons  lemon juice
  10            ounces  yogurt - (1 1/4 cups)
  8        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2                     bay leaves
  4                     large whole black cardamom pods
  2          teaspoons  saffron threads -- dry-roasted
  2        tablespoons  milk -- warmed
  1 3/4           cups  long-grain rice
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISHES ===
  2        tablespoons  golden raisins
  2        tablespoons  blanched almonds
  2                     hard-cooked eggs

Remove and discard the skin from the chicken legs and breasts.  Cut each leg into drumstick and thigh, and quarter the breasts.

To prepare the marinade paste, peel and coarsely chop the garlic, ginger, and 3 onions.  Place in a blender with the cloves, peppercorns, cardamom seeds, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, poppy seeds, mace, 1 teaspoon salt, and the lemon juice.  Blend to a smooth paste.  Turn into a large bowl, add the yogurt, and mix well.

Dry Roasting:  Spices are often dry-roasted before use.  It is best to do this over medium heat in a preheated small, heavy, cast-iron frying pan.  No oil is used; the spices are just stirred around in the pan with a wooden spatula until they brown lightly.  Roasted spices develop a heightened, nutty aroma.  They can be stored for several months in an airtight jar.

Peel the 3 remaining onions, halve lengthwise, and slice finely.  Heat the oil in a large heavy-based frying pan over medium heat.  When hot, add the bay leaves and cardamom pods.  Fry for 10 to 15 seconds.  Add the sliced onions and fry, stirring, for about 10 minutes or until brown and crisp, but not burned.  Remove with a slotted spoon, squeezing out as much oil as possible.  Reserve the oil, cardamoms, and bay leaves.  Add 2/3 of the fried onions to the marinade paste and mix well.  Drain the rest on paper towels and set aside for garnishing.

Pierce the chicken pieces with a fork and add to the bowl of marinade paste; mix well.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight, turning the chicken occasionally.

Transfer the chicken and marinade to a large heavy-based cooking pot or pan.  Bring slowly to a boil, cover, lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.  Lift out the chicken pieces with a slotted spoon and place them in a 6-quart casserole dish; cover and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Crumble the saffron into the warm milk and set aside to soak.

Boil the marinade paste, stirring, over a medium heat, until reduced to 9 to 10 tablespoons.  Spoon the paste over the chicken.  Cover again.

Pour about 3 quarts water into a large cooking pot or flameproof casserole.  Add 3 teaspoons of salt and bring to a boil.  Add the rice, bring back to a boil, then simmer for precisely 5 minutes.  Drain the rice in a colander, then place it on top of the chicken in the casserole.

Pour the saffron-infused milk over the rice, streaking it with orange lines.  Sprinkle the reserved cardamom, bay leaves, and oil over the rice (retaining 1 tablespoon oil, for frying the raisins, if using).  Cover the casserole dish with foil, cut 2 inches wider than the rim of the dish.  Now put the lid on and use the protruding foil edges to seal the dish as best you can by crinkling it and pushing it against the sides.  Bake in the oven for 1 hour.

To prepare the garnishes, if including raisins fry them briefly in the reserved oil.  Lightly toast the almonds if you wish.  Quarter the hard-cooked eggs lengthwise, or cut into slices.

Spoon the rice and chicken onto a large warm platter.  Sprinkle with the fried onions, raisins, almonds and hard-cooked eggs.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

No oil is used; the spices are just stirred around in the pan with a wooden spatula until they brown lightly.  Roasted spices develop a heightened, nutty aroma.  They can be stored for several months in an airtight jar.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Peel the 3 remaining onions, halve lengthwise, and slice finely.  Heat the oil in a large heavy-based frying pan over medium heat.  When hot, add the bay leaves and cardamom pods.  Fry for 10 to 15 seconds.  Add the sliced onions and fry, stirring, for about 10 minutes or until brown and crisp, but not burned.  Remove with a slotted spoon, squeezing out as much oil as possible.  Reserve the oil, cardamoms, and bay leaves.  Add 2/3 of the fried onions to the marinade paste and mix well.  Drain the rest on paper towels and set aside for garnishing.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pierce the chicken pieces with a fork and add to the bowl of marinade paste; mix well.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight, turning the chicken occasionally.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the chicken and marinade to a large heavy-based cooking pot or pan.  Bring slowly to a boil, cover, lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.  Lift out the chicken pieces with a slotted spoon and place them in a 6-quart casserole dish; cover and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Crumble the saffron into the warm milk and set aside to soak.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Boil the marinade paste, stirring, over a medium heat, until reduced to 9 to 10 tablespoons.  Spoon the paste over the chicken.  Cover again.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour about 3 quarts water into a large cooking pot or flameproof casserole.  Add 3 teaspoons of salt and bring to a boil.  Add the rice, bring back to a boil, then simmer for precisely 5 minutes.  Drain the rice in a colander, then place it on top of the chicken in the casserole.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the saffron-infused milk over the rice, streaking it with orange lines.  Sprinkle the reserved cardamom, bay leaves, and oil over the rice (retaining 1 tablespoon oil, for frying the raisins, if using).  Cover the casserole dish with foil, cut 2 inches wider than the rim of the dish.  Now put the lid on and use the protruding foil edges to seal the dish as best you can by crinkling it and pushing it against the sides.  Bake in the oven for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare the garnishes, if including raisins fry them briefly in the reserved oil.  Lightly toast the almonds if you wish.  Quarter the hard-cooked eggs lengthwise, or cut into slices.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon the rice and chicken onto a large warm platter.  Sprinkle with the fried onions, raisins, almonds and hard-cooked eggs.  Serve hot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- pounded 1/4" thick
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- seasoned with
                        salt and pepper, for dredging the cutlets
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic -- or to taste
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  8             slices  tomato, 1/4"-thick
  1                cup  sliced drained marinated artichoke hearts
  8             slices  mozzarella, 1/4"-thick
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley leaves

Sprinkle the chicken cutlets with salt and pepper, to taste, and dredge them in the flour, coating them thoroughly and shaking off the excess.

In a heavy skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and the oil over moderately-high heat until the foam subsides.  Saute the cutlets in 2 batches for 1 minute on each side, or until they are just cooked through, transferring them as they are cooked to a heated flameproof platter.

Remove the skillet from the heat, add the garlic, and cook it over moderately-low heat, stirring, until it just begins to color.  Add the wine and the lemon juice and simmer the mixture until it is reduced by half.

Remove the skillet from the heat, add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, and swirl the skillet until it is incorporated.  Pour the sauce over the cutlets and top the cutlets with the tomato, the artichoke hearts, and the mozzarella.  Broil the cutlets under a preheated broiler about 3 inches from the heat until the mozzarella is melted and sprinkle the cutlets with the parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHOCOLATE TART DOUGH ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  confectioners' sugar
  1              large  egg yolk
     3/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder
                        === CARAMEL FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  water
  2               cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  creme fraiche
                        === CHOCOLATE GANACHE GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  3 1/2         ounces  extra-bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
  1              pinch  fine sea salt -- (optional)
                        = (such as fleur de sel)

To prepare the tart dough, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and confectioners' sugar until just combined, about 1 minute.  Add the egg yolk and vanilla and beat until smooth.  Sift in the flour and cocoa powder and beat on low speed until just combined.  Scrape the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and form it into a disk.  Wrap and chill until firm, about 1 hour, or up to 3 days.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  On a lightly floured surface, roll the tart dough to an 18- by 12-inch rectangle, 3/16-inch thick.  Using a 2 1/2-inch round cutter, cut out 24 rounds of dough and press them into mini-muffin tins or 2-inch tart pans, trimming away any excess dough; prick the dough all over with a fork.  Chill the tart shells for 20 minutes.

Line the tart shells with foil and fill with dried beans, rice or pie weights.  Bake for 15 minutes.  Remove the foil and weights and bake for 5 to 10 minutes longer, or until the pastry looks dry and set.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool.  (The tart shells can be made 8 hours ahead.)

To prepare the filling, place 1/2 cup water in large saucepan.  Add the sugar and corn syrup and cook the mixture over medium-high heat, swirling the pan occasionally, until you have a dark caramel, about 10 minutes.  Carefully whisk in the butter, cream, and creme fraiche (the mixture will hiss and bubble up, so stand back), whisking until smooth.  (The caramel can be made up to 5 days ahead and refrigerated.)  Divide the caramel among the tart shells while still warm (or reheat the caramel in the microwave or over low heat until it is pourable) and let sit until the caramel is set, at least 45 minutes.

To make the ganache glaze, in a saucepan, bring the cream to a boil.  Place the chocolate in a bowl.  Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let sit for 2 minutes, then whisk until smooth.  Pour some of the glaze over each of the tarts while still warm.  Let the glaze set at room temperature for at least 2 hours before serving.  Sprinkle with salt, if desired, just before serving.

This recipe yields 2 dozen tarts.

Variation:  For a large tart, line a 10-inch tart pan with the pastry dough, then prick, weight, and bake as directed, adding 5 to 10 minutes to the baking time.  When the tart shell is cool, spoon the warm caramel to set before pouring the warm ganache onto the tart.

  1              pinch  salt
                        === MILK CHOCOLATE GANACHE ===
  12            ounces  milk chocolate
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter
                        === HAZELNUT PRALINE ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/2           cup  toasted -- skinned hazelnuts,
                        coarsely chopped
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Cocoa powder
                        Chocolate shavings

For the Flourless Chocolate Cake:  Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 12- by 18-inch jelly roll pan, and line with buttered paper.

Position a rack at the middle level.  Cut the chocolate finely and combine it with the water in a heat-proof bowl.  Place the bowl over a pan of hot, but not simmering, water and stir occasionally until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whip, beat the yolks with half the sugar until very light.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt until they are just beginning to hold a very soft peak, then beat in the remaining sugar in a slow stream, beating faster.

Mix the chocolate mixture into the yolks, then fold in the egg whites.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.  Bake the layer for about 15 minutes, until firm to the touch.

Remove the pan from the oven and loosen the cake with a small, sharp knife.  Pulling on the paper, slide the layer on the work surface to cool, about 20 minutes.

For the Ganache:  Cut chocolate finely and set aside.  Bring cream and butter to a boil; remove from heat and add chocolate.  Whisk until smooth and refrigerate until thickened.

For the Praline:  Combine sugar and lemon juice in a medium pan and stir well to mix.  Place over low heat and stir occasionally until sugar is melted and caramelized.  Stir in hazelnuts and scrape mixture to a buttered pan.  Allow to cool and harden, then break up and grind to a coarse powder in the food processor.

To assemble cake, cut layer into 2 (9-inch) disks and dice scraps.  Whip the ganache on the mixer with the whip to lighten it.  Place 1 cake layer on a cardboard and spread with 1/3 of the ganache.  Sprinkle with half of the praline and the cake scraps.  Sprinkle the cake scraps with more pralines.  Spread another third of the ganache on the praline and top with the other layer.  Use the rest of the ganache to enclose the whole cake and press chocolate shavings against the side of the cake.  Dust top of cake with cocoa powder and mark a lattice pattern in the cocoa with a serrated knife.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  vegetable shortening -- plus more
                        for deep frying
  1                cup  sugar
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1                cup  canned evaporated milk
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus more
                        when forming the doughnuts
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground mace
  1           teaspoon  fine salt
                        === FOR COATING THE DOUGHNUTS === -- (optional)
  1                cup  granulated sugar
                        = (or 1 cup granulated sugar
                        mixed with 1 tbspn ground cinnamon)
                        = (or 1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar)

In small saucepan, heat the 1/4 cup shortening until melted.  Set aside to cool slightly but remain liquid.

In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the sugar and melted shortening together on medium speed, until just combined.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add the milk and vanilla, continue beating until the mixture is light, about 2 minutes.

Sift the flour, baking powder, nutmeg, mace, and salt into a medium bowl.  Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture on low speed until just combined.  The texture of the dough will be soft and loose.  Remove bowl from the mixer, scrape the dough off the paddle blade with a spatula.  Transfer the dough to a large piece of plastic wrap and wrap it well.  Refrigerate the dough for 4 hours or overnight.

Roll the chilled dough out about 1/2-inch thick on a very lightly dusted workspace.  Dip the edges of a 2 1/2-inch doughnut cutter in flour and cut the dough into doughnuts.  Place the donuts and holes on a baking sheet lined with parchment.

Spoon enough vegetable shortening into a tall heavy-bottomed pot so it fills the pan a third of the way.  Heat the shortening over medium heat until a deep frying thermometer set in the oil registers 375 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with paper towels.

Working in batches, fry the doughnuts and holes, turning once, until they are golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Transfer the doughnuts from the fat with a slotted spoon or skimmer to the paper towels to drain and cool.  Repeat until all the doughnuts and holes are fried.  Make sure the oil comes back to the correct temperature before frying each batch.

For sugared doughnuts, roll the doughnuts in sugar or cinnamon sugar while they are still warm.  For confectioners' sugared covered doughnuts, allow the doughnuts to cool completely before rolling in the confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields 2 dozen doughnuts and holes.

Cook's Note:  These are best just after making.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  well-shaken buttermilk
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8                     live soft-shelled crabs -- cleaned
                        = (preferably 4" to 5" wide)
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  1                cup  self-rising cake flour -- see cook's note
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Cilantro-Lime Tartar Sauce -- (see recipe)

Whisk together buttermilk, eggs, salt, and pepper and pour into a 3-quart shallow dish.  Add crabs and soak, covered and chilled, for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Heat enough vegetable oil to measure 1-inch deep in a wide shallow skillet to very hot.

Whisk together flour and cornmeal and transfer to a large sealable plastic bag.  Lift 1 crab out of buttermilk, letting excess drip off, and shake in bag to coat with flour.  Knock off excess flour and transfer to a tray.  Repeat with remaining crabs, arranging them in 1 layer as coated.

Shallow-fry the crabs, 4 at a time, turning over halfway through frying (watch out for popping or use a frying screen), until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.  Reheat oil to very hot between batches.  Drain crabs on paper towels and serve with Cilantro-Lime Tartar Sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Cooks' Note:  If you can't find self-rising cake flour, you can use 1 cup all-purpose or cake flour mixed with 2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt.

  4                     plum tomatoes - (abt 10 oz) -- stemmed

  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  brown loaf sugar -- grated
                        = (preferably Colombian panela or
                        Mexican piloncillo)
                        = (or demerara natural brown cane sugar)
  2             pounds  calabaza -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
                        =(or Caribbean pumpkin, acorn, or
                        hubbard squash)
  8               cups  well-flavored chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              ounce  dark chocolate
                        = (preferably 58.5% or 60% cacao content)
                        === FOR GARNISH ===
  1                cup  Mexican cream or creme fraiche
  1                cup  cubed Manchego cheese
                        Kekchi Cacao-Chile Balls -- (listed below)
                        === KEKCHI CACAO-CHILE BALLS ===
  3             ounces  cacao nibs - (abt 2/3 cup)
  3             ounces  piquin chiles - (abt 1 cup)
  1              stick  true canela - (1" long) -- coarsely chopped
                        = (soft Ceylon cinnamon)
     1/2      teaspoon  allspice berries
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  Spanish smoked paprika

Heat a griddle, medium-sized cast-iron skillet, or Mexican comal over medium heat.  Add the cacao nibs and dry-roast for 2 minutes, until fragrant, turning constantly with a wooden spoon or spatula.  Turn out into another container and set aside.

Stem and seed the chile.  Place on a hot comal, griddle or iron skillet and roast briefly turning with tongs.  Place in a bowl with warm water to soften.

Roast the tomatoes, onion, and garlic until blistered on all sides.  Peel the onion and garlic.  Place in a food processor or blender together with the roasted cacao nibs and the spices and puree.

Heat the oil in medium, heavy-bottomed pot.  Add the puree and the brown sugar and saute for 5 minutes.  Add the pumpkin and the stock.  Correct seasoning.  Bring to a boil over medium heat.  Lower the heat and cover until the pumpkin is soft, about 15 minutes.

Puree in a food processor or blender, in batches.  Strain the soup pushing the solids against the strainer with the back of a spoon.  Put back in the pot and heat over medium heat.  Add the chocolate and stir until dissolved, about 3 minutes.

Serve the soup hot garnished with a dollop of Mexican cream or creme fraiche and a tablespoon or so of the cubed cheese.  Pass the Kekchi Cacao-Chile balls around the table with a small cheese grater and invite your guests to grate a pinch of this super-hot condiment on the soup for extra heat and cacao flavor.

Kekchi Cacao-Chile Balls:  Heat a griddle, medium-sized cast-iron skillet, or Mexican comal over medium heat.  Add the cacao nibs and dry-roast for 2 minutes, until fragrant, turning constantly with a wooden spoon or spatula.  Turn out into another container and set aside.

Add the chiles, cinnamon stick, and allspice berries to the griddle and roast the same way, stirring for 2 minutes.  Scrape into an electric spice mill or coffee grinder with the salt and paprika; grind to a fine powder.

Combine the spice mixture and roasted cacao in a mini-food processor and process into a warm, sticky paste, 3 to 4 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Scrape out onto a work surface and shape into 12 small balls.  Let sit until thoroughly dried.  Store in a tightly sealed jar.  When ready to use, grate over any dish of your choice.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Heat a griddle, medium-sized cast-iron skillet, or Mexican comal over medium heat.  Add the cacao nibs and dry-roast for 2 minutes, until fragrant, turning constantly with a wooden spoon or spatula.  Turn out into another container and set aside.

Stem and seed the chile.  Place on a hot comal, griddle or iron skillet and roast briefly turning with tongs.  Place in a bowl with warm water to soften.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast the tomatoes, onion, and garlic until blistered on all sides.  Peel the onion and garlic.  Place in a food processor or blender together with the roasted cacao nibs and the spices and puree.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the oil in medium, heavy-bottomed pot.  Add the puree and the brown sugar and saute for 5 minutes.  Add the pumpkin and the stock.  Correct seasoning.  Bring to a boil over medium heat.  Lower the heat and cover until the pumpkin is soft, about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Puree in a food processor or blender, in batches.  Strain the soup pushing the solids against the strainer with the back of a spoon.  Put back in the pot and heat over medium heat.  Add the chocolate and stir until dissolved, about 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve the soup hot garnished with a dollop of Mexican cream or creme fraiche and a tablespoon or so of the cubed cheese.  Pass the Kekchi Cacao-Chile balls around the table with a small cheese grater and invite your guests to grate a pinch of this super-hot condiment on the soup for extra heat and cacao flavor.

Kekchi Cacao-Chile Balls:  Heat a griddle, medium-sized cast-iron skillet, or Mexican comal over medium heat.  Add the cacao nibs and dry-roast for 2 minutes, until fragrant, turning constantly with a wooden spoon or spatula.  Turn out into another container and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the chiles, cinnamon stick, and allspice berries to the griddle and roast the same way, stirring for 2 minutes.  Scrape into an electric spice mill or coffee grinder with the salt and paprika; grind to a fine powder.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the spice mixture and roasted cacao in a mini-food processor and process into a warm, sticky paste, 3 to 4 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Scrape out onto a work surface and shape into 12 small balls.  Let sit until thoroughly dried.  Store in a tightly sealed jar.  When ready to use, grate over any dish of your choice.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  pecans -- coarsely chopped
  3 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/8      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  whole milk
  3              large  eggs
     2/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar plus additional
                        for sprinkling
  3        tablespoons  dulce de leche
                        = (or chocolate-hazelnut spread)
     1/2           cup  heavy cream

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Toast pecans in a shallow baking pan in middle of oven, shaking occasionally, until fragrant and a few shades darker, 8 to 10 minutes.  Toss immediately with 1/2 tablespoon butter and 1/4 teaspoon salt.

Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a well-seasoned crepe pan or an 8-inch nonstick skillet.  Blend milk, eggs, flour, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a blender until smooth.  Pour in melted butter, leaving a film of butter in skillet, and blend until well combined.

Heat skillet over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Half fill a 1/4-cup measure with batter and holding skillet off heat, pour in batter, immediately swirling and tilting the skillet to create a thin even layer.  (If batter sets before skillet is coated, reduce heat slightly.  Next crepe will be better.)  Return skillet to heat and cook until crepe is golden around edges and dry in center, about 45 seconds.  Flip crepe carefully and cook until golden, about 15 seconds more.  Sprinkle crepe lightly with sugar.

Make more crepes with remaining batter, stacking them as cooked and lightly sprinkling each with sugar.

Preheat broiler and butter an 8-inch round flameproof shallow baking dish.

Heat dulce de leche and cream in a small saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until smooth.  Reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 1 minute.

Fold crepes into eighths and arrange in baking dish.  Sprinkle lightly with sugar, then broil about 6 inches from heat until edges are crispy, about 45 seconds.  Serve with sauce and pecans.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  water -- divided
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     3/4           cup  unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder
  8 1/2         ounces  extra-bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
                        === CANDIED KUMQUATS ===
  2 1/2           cups  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  water
  2               cups  washed and sliced kumquats

In a medium saucepan, combine 2 cups of the water and the sugar and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally.  Reduce the heat to low and gradually add the cocoa powder, whisking until smooth.  Cook the mixture at a gentle simmer for 30 minutes, until syrupy.

Put the chocolate in a large bowl and add half the cocoa syrup, whisking until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth.  Add the remaining syrup and 2 cups water and whisk well.  Strain the mixture through a fine sieve and let cool.

Chill the sorbet mixture, covered, until very cold, at least 4 hours, and up to 2 days.  Freeze in an ice-cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions.  Serve with Candied Kumquats.

Candied Kumquats:  In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar and 1 1/2 cups water.  Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Add the kumquats, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for about 6 minutes, or until the kumquats appear translucent.  Drain well before serving.  The kumquats will keep, refrigerated, for several weeks.  (Makes about 2 cups)

This recipe yields about 1 quart.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  frisee
                        = (French curly endive)
  6             ounces  slab bacon
                        = (or thick-cut bacon slices)
  2        tablespoons  distilled white vinegar
  4              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallot
  3        tablespoons  red-wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Tear frisee into bite-size pieces and put in a large bowl.  If using slab bacon, cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Cut bacon slices crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick sticks (lardons).

In a heavy skillet cook bacon over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden and remove skillet from heat.

Have ready another skillet with 1-inch warm water.  Half-fill a 4-quart saucepan with water and stir in white vinegar.  Bring liquid to a bare simmer.  Break each egg into a teacup.  Slide 1 egg into simmering liquid and immediately push white around yolk with a slotted spoon, moving egg gently.  (Egg will become oval, with yolk completely covered by white.)  Add remaining 3 eggs in same manner.

Simmer eggs about 1 1/2 minutes for runny yolks to about 3 minutes for firm yolks.  (Serving this salad with runny, not fully cooked yolks may be of concern if there is a problem with salmonella in your area.)  Immediately transfer eggs to skillet of warm water.

Reheat bacon in its skillet over moderate heat.  Add shallot and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Add red-wine vinegar and boil 5 seconds.  Immediately pour hot dressing over frisee and toss with salt and pepper to taste.  Divide salad among 4 plates and top with drained poached eggs.  Season eggs with salt and pepper and serve salad immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1              large  egg
  1                cup  dark molasses
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  5               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  ground ginger
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
  1 1/4      teaspoons  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === SUGAR ICING ===
  2              large  egg whites
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
  3               cups  confectioners' sugar -- sifted
                        Food coloring -- (optional)

In a large bowl, with an electric mixer cream the butter, add the sugar, and beat the mixture until fluffy.  Beat in the egg, the molasses, and the vinegar.

Into another bowl, sift together the flour, the ginger, the baking soda, the cinnamon, the cloves, and the salt and stir the mixture into the butter mixture, a little at a time.  The dough will be soft.  Divide the dough into fourths, dust it with flour, and wrap each piece in waxed paper.  Flatten the dough slightly and chill it for at least 3 hours or overnight.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Roll out the dough, 1 piece at a time, 1/4-inch thick on a floured surface and cut out cookies with a 4-inch gingerbread man cutter dipped in flour.  Transfer the cookies with a spatula to buttered baking sheets, arranging them 2-inches apart, and bake them in the oven for 6 to 8 minutes or until no imprint remains when they are touched lightly with the fingertip.  Transfer the cookies with the spatula to racks and let them cool.  Make cookies with the dough scraps in the same manner.  If desired, pipe the sugar icing decoratively on the cookie using a pastry bag fitted with a small decorative tip.  Let the cookies stand for 20 minutes, or until the icing is set.

Sugar Icing:  In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar, a pinch of salt, and 2 teaspoons water until the mixture is frothy, beat in the sugar, a little at a time, and beat the mixture until it holds stiff peaks.  Beat in the food coloring, if desired.

Decorate baked cookies with the icing using a spatula or a pastry bag fitted with a small decorative tip and let the cookies stand for 20 minutes, or until the icing is set.  (Makes enough icing for about 50 (4-inch) cookies)

This recipe yields 50 gingerbread men.

Caution:  There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  green beans
                        = (preferably long beans)
  2             medium  carrots
  3                     fresh hot green chilies - (to 4)
  1                     cube fresh ginger - (1")
  1                     cube fresh galangal - (1") -- optional
  4                     garlic cloves - (to 6)
  2                     shallots
                        = (or 1/2 onion)
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  8                     fresh or dried curry leaves - (to 10)
                        = (or 2 bay leaves)
     3/4      teaspoon  salt

Trim the beans and cut into 1-inch pieces.  Peel the carrots and cut into 2-inch lengths, then cut each piece lengthwise into quarters and halve these.

Finely chop the green chilies.  Peel the ginger and cut into paper-thin slices.  Stack a few slices together at a time and cut them into minute dice.  If using fresh galangal, peel and dice it in the same way.  Peel and finely chop the garlic and shallots.

Set a wok over a high heat and swirl in the oil.  When the oil is hot, put in the chilies, ginger, galangal, garlic, shallots, and curry (or bay) leaves.  Stir and fry briefly until the spices start to brown.

Add the green beans, carrots, and salt.  Stir and fry for 1 minute.  Pour in 3/4 cup water and cover with a lid.  Turn the heat to medium and cook for about 5 minutes or until the vegetables are just tender.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     duck breast halves -- boned
  2             cloves  garlic -- peeled, minced
  1                     lime -- zested and juiced
  2        tablespoons  sorghum
                        = (or firmly packed brown sugar)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === WILD RICE-DRIED CHERRY PILAF ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  1                cup  wild rice
  3               cups  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  long-grain white rice
     1/2           cup  dried cherries
  1         tablespoon  sorghum
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

With a sharp knife, score the skin on each duck breast, but don't cut through to the meat.

In a small bowl, combine the garlic, lime juice and zest, sorghum, salt and pepper.  Use a small brush to paint the surface of each duck breast with the sorghum mixture and let marinate for 1 hour.

Prepare a very hot grill and cook the duck breast, skin-side down, for about 4 minutes (watch for flare-ups).  Turn and continue grilling for 3 minutes, or until the duck breast is still pink in the center.  To serve, slice and fan out on the plate.

Wild Rice-Dried Cherry Pilaf:  In a covered casserole, heat the olive oil over medium heat and saute the onion until translucent, about 4 minutes.  Add the wild rice and chicken broth, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and let simmer for 20 minutes.  Add the white rice, dried cherries, and sorghum.  Cover again and cook until the rice is tender, about 20 minutes.  Season, to taste, and serve.

             Herb-Crusted Sauteed Salmon Fillets With Pistou

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of James Peterson
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PISTOU ===
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1                cup  spun-dry washed basil leaves - -- (tightly packed)
                        = (from 1 large bunch basil)
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped fine and
                        crushed to paste with side of chef's knife
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE SALMON ===
  4                     salmon fillets, 1" thk - (6 to 8 oz ea) -- skin and pin
                        bones removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh marjoram leaves
  1         tablespoon  fresh oregano leaves
     1/2    tablespoon  fresh rosemary leaves
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  4             medium  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped fine
                        = (or 2 cups assorted cherry tomatoes,
                        quartered)

Pistou:  Make the pistou within an hour of cooking the salmon, if made sooner it will lose color.  Bring 2 quarts of water to a rapid boil with 2 tablespoons of salt, plunge in the basil leaves, and stir them around with a wooden spoon, leaving them in the water for no more than 2 seconds.  Drain in a colander and immediately cool by rinsing them in cold water.

Combine the basil, garlic, 1/2 cup of water in a blender and puree for 1 minute, until smooth.  Transfer the basil mixture to a bowl and gently work in the olive oil with a wooden spoon.  Season with salt and pepper.

Just before sauteing the salmon, gently heat the pistou mixture in a saucepan while stirring.  Don't allow the pistou mixture to come to a boil.

Salmon:  Season the salmon liberally on both sides with salt and pepper and let sit in refrigerator for between 30 minutes and 4 hours.  Remove from refrigerator, pat dry, and sprinkle top and bottom with the chopped herbs.  Press the herbs onto the salmon to help them adhere.

Heat the oil in a large non-stick pan just large enough to hold the salmon, until the oil ripples and barely begins to smoke.  Place fillets skin-side down in the pan first.  Saute over high heat for 3 to 5 minutes on the first side, turn them over with a spatula, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes on the second side.

If the salmon starts to brown or the oil smokes, turn the heat down to medium.  Cooking time should be 8 to 10 minutes per inch of total thickness (depending on how you like your salmon done).  The salmon should spend more time sauteeing on the first side (the eventual presentation side) so that you're sure to end up with a savory golden crust or crisp skin.

Remove salmon from pan with spatula and pat dry on both sides with a paper towel to eliminate fat.  Transfer fillets to heated plates.  Wipe out the hot saute pan and add in the chopped or quartered tomatoes, stirring them just long enough to warm them.  Season with salt and pepper.  Ladle the pistou over and around each piece of salmon and spoon the warmed tomatoes over just before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  medium shrimp
  2                     fresh lemongrass stalks
  4                     fresh or dried kaffir lime leaves
                        = (or 1 tbspn finely grated lemon zest)
  6               cups  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
                        = (or salt to taste)
  3        tablespoons  lime juice -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  chile paste
  1                can  straw mushrooms - (15 oz)
                        = (or 12 medium fresh mushrooms)
  3                     fresh hot green chiles -- for garnish
  3        tablespoons  fresh cilantro leaves -- for garnish

Wash the raw shrimp, then peel and devein, saving the peelings.  Wash the shrimp again, drain and pat dry.  Cover and refrigerate.

Cut each lemongrass stick into 3 (2-inch) pieces, starting from the rounded bottom end; discard the straw-like top.  Lightly crush the 6 pieces with a heavy pestle, a mallet, or the blade of a knife.

Combine the lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, the stock, and shrimp peelings in a pan.  Bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer very gently for 20 minutes.  Strain this stock and return to the rinsed-out pan.

Add the fish sauce, lime juice, and chile paste.  Stir and taste again, adding more fish sauce or lime juice if required.

Drain the straw mushrooms and add them to the seasoned stock.  If using fresh mushrooms cut into quarters, drop into lightly salted boiling water, and boil for 1 minute.  Drain and add to the seasoned stock.  (The soup may be prepared to this stage several hours ahead if necessary and refrigerated.)

Prepare the garnishes shortly before you are ready to serve the soup.  Cut the green chilies into very fine rounds, and wash and dry the cilantro leaves.

Just before serving, heat the stock with the mushrooms in it.  When it begins to bubble, drop in the peeled shrimp.  Cook over a medium heat for about 2 minutes or just until the shrimp turn opaque.  Serve the soup immediately in individual bowls, garnished with the green chiles and cilantro leaves.

This recipe yields 6 soup servings or 4 main-course servings.

                         Hot Garlic Potato Chips

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Union Square Cafe
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Idaho potatoes -- peeled
  1 1/2         quarts  vegetable oil -- for frying
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  pressed garlic
  2        tablespoons  shopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

With a mandoline or sharp knife, slice the potatoes about 1/16-inch thick.  You should have about 6 cups.  Place the potato slices in a large bowl and rinse with cold water until the water runs clean.  Thoroughly dry the potatoes, first in a salad spinner, then on paper towels.  This is important because any moisture left on the potatoes will cause the oil to splatter.

Pour the oil into a 6-quart heavy bottomed, straight-sided saucepan, 8 to 10 inches in diameter.  The oil should be 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches deep and the pan no more than a quarter full.  This prevents any bubbling over when frying the potatoes.  Heat the oil to 315 degrees on a deep-fat thermometer.  (To check the temperature without a thermometer, drop a small piece of bread the size of a crouton into the oil.  It should float to the surface and lightly brown in about 2 minutes.)

Carefully fry the potato slices in 2 or 3 batches until light brown and crisp.  You will need to stir the potatoes with a slotted spoon almost constantly to ensure even cooking.  Each batch should take 15 to 20 minutes to cook.  (If the potatoes brown in much less time, the oil is too hot.  This will result in a chip that is neither cooked through nor crisp.)

As you remove each batch of crisp potato chips, place them on a cookie sheet lined with paper towels.  When all the potatoes are done, place them in a mixing bowl large enough to hold them comfortably.

Over a medium flame, heat the butter and garlic.  Drizzle over the potatoes, add the chopped parsley, salt and pepper, and mix thoroughly with a rubber spatula.  Be careful not to crush the chips.  Serve hot.

The chips can be made several hours in advance.  Store in a tightly closed container and reheat in a 350 degree oven until hot.  Toss with the seasoned garlic butter at the last minute.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cardamom
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

  8                     lamb rib chops, 3/4" thick

In a small bowl, combine the cumin, cardamom, salt, and pepper.

In 2 large non-stick skillets, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in each pan over moderately-high heat until it is hot but not smoking.  Add half the onions and half the tomatoes in one layer to each pan, and cook for 3 minutes.

  1              piece  unsmoked lean bacon - (1 lb)
  1              piece  Canadian bacon - (1 lb)
  1              piece  smoked pork loin - (1 lb)
  1              piece  smoked pork sausages - (1 lb)
  2          teaspoons  juniper berries
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2            bottles  medium-dry white wine - (750 ml ea)
  5             pounds  waxy potatoes
  8                     cured pork chops
  8                     frankfurters
     1/2           cup  schnapps or gin
                        Dijon mustard -- for serving

Drain and rinse with sauerkraut with cold water, then leave it to drain in a colander.

Melt 4 tablespoons of the fat in a large flameproof casserole.  Add the onions and saute them over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tender, 7 to 10 minutes.  Spread half of the sauerkraut over the onions, first squeezing it in your fists to extract all the water.  Set the apple, both kinds of bacon, the smoked sausages, and smoked pork loin on top.  Sprinkle with juniper berries and add seasoning, mainly pepper.

Cover the meat with the rest of the sauerkraut, squeezing it dry also, and pour over the wine.  Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit inside the casserole and press it directly on top of the sauerkraut.  Cover and simmer on top of the stove until the sauerkraut is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  About halfway through cooking, pour over the schnapps.

Half an hour before the sauerkraut is cooked, put the potatoes in a pan of cold salted water, cover and bring them to a boil.  Simmer until tender when pierced with a knife, 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain and keep them warm, peeling them just before serving.

Heat 1 tablespoon fat in a frying pan and cook the cured pork chops until well done, 5 to 7 minutes on each side.  Add them to the casserole 15 minutes before the sauerkraut is cooked.  Warm the frankfurters in very hot water until heated through, about 1 minute.  Leave them in the water to keep warm, draining them just before serving.

To serve, taste the sauerkraut and adjust the seasoning.  Lift out both kinds of bacon and the pork loin and carve them in generous slices.  Drain the sauerkraut well and pile it on a large heated platter.  Arrange the meats and sausages on top, with the potatoes around the edge.  Pass mustard at the table.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Cook's Note:  Cut down the number of meats.  For instance, I would eliminate the unsmoked bacon, the smoked pork loin, and the pork sausage or frankfurters, leaving the Canadian bacon, cured pork chops, and one kind of sausage.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     eggs
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  freshly squeezed lemon juice
                        = (from 3 to 4 lemons)
                        Freshly-grated zest from 1/2 lemon
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- slightly softened,
                        and at room temperature
     1/2           cup  chilled heavy cream
  1            package  puff pastry - (2 sheets) -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  chopped pistachios

Additional equipment needed:  Flower-shaped or round cookie cutter, preferably fluted, 2 to 2 1/2 inches across, round cookie cutter, 1 inch across, cookie sheet.

Bring about 2-inches of water to a simmer in a large saucepan.

In the bowl of a mixer, fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the eggs and sugar together until very light yellow and fluffy.  Mix in the lemon juice and lemon zest.  Rest the mixing bowl in the saucepan, with the bowl's base resting above, not in, the simmering water (pour out some water if necessary).  Cook, whisking occasionally, until the mixture is thickened and custard-like, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, half-fill a large bowl with ice and cover with cold water.  Remove the bowl with the custard in it from the hot water and whisk in the butter until melted.  Rest the bottom of the bowl in the ice bath and let cool, folding the mixture occasionally to cool and thicken it.

In a mixer, fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the cream until stiff.  Fold into the cooled lemon custard.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.  (The recipe can be made up to this point and kept refrigerated up to 3 days in advance.)

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Flour a work surface and lay out the puff pastry.  Roll the sheets lightly with a rolling pin until smooth and flattened.  Use your large cookie cutter to cut out rounds from the puff pastry.  Hollow out the centers by pushing halfway down with your small cookie cutter.  Do not pull out the centers yet; you'll do that after they are baked.  Arrange on an un-greased cookie sheet and bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.  After 10 minutes, rotate the pan to ensure even cooking.  When baked, immediately remove to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature.

Cut around the centers with a paring knife to loosen, but don't cut all the way through to the bottom.  You want to leave a thin layer of pastry to hold the filling.  Pull out the centers to make a hollow in the center of each pastry round.

Not more than 4 hours before serving, spoon or pipe a generous dollop of custard into each pastry round.  Sprinkle the custard with chopped pistachios.  Serve within 4 hours.

This recipe yields ?? daisies.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR MADELEINES ===
  2               cups  cake flour (not self-rising)
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  freshly-grated lemon zest -- plus
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated lemon zest
                        = (from about 7 large lemons)
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  2               cups  sugar
  6              large  eggs
                        === FOR LEMON SYRUP ===
     1/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  lemon vodka
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice

To make Madeleines:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees and spray Madeleine pan generously butter and flour pan (preferably non-stick), knocking out excess flour.

In a bowl sift the flour, baking powder, salt, and zest together.

In another bowl with an electric mixer beat together butter, lemon juice, and sugar until mixture is light and fluffy.  Add the lemon zest.  Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, and add flour mixture, beating until just combined.

Spoon some of the batter into prepared Madeleine molds, filling the mold 3/4 full.  Using both hands, pick up the Madeleine tray and lightly tap against the table to spread the batter evenly.  This will eliminate any air pockets and ensure that molds are not overfilled.

Bake Madeleines in middle of oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until edges are browned and tops are golden.  Loosen edges and transfer Madeleines to a rack set over a baking dish.  Make more Madeleines in pan, cleaned and freshly sprayed.

To make Lemon Syrup:  While first batch of madeleines is baking, in a small saucepan bring syrup ingredients to a boil, stirring, and remove from heat.

Brush warm madeleines with some of hot syrup and repeat with remaining madeleines as they are baked, keeping syrup warm.

This recipe yields about 42 madeleines.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR PUDDING CAKE ===
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3              large  eggs -- separated
  1                cup  1% milk
  1              large  lemon -- zested
  5        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        === FOR RASPBERRY COULIS ===
  1            package  frozen raspberries in syrup - (10 oz)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice -- or to taste

Make Pudding Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Whisk together flour, salt, and 1/2 cup sugar in a bowl.  Whisk together yolks, milk, zest, and juice and add to dry ingredients, whisking until combined well.

Beat whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer until they hold soft peaks, then gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, beating, and continue to beat until whites hold stiff, glossy peaks.  Whisk about one-fourth of whites into batter to lighten, then fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly (batter will be thin).

Pour batter into a lightly oiled 1 1/2-quart gratin or other shallow baking dish and bake in a hot water bath until puffed and golden, 40 to 45 minutes.

Make Raspberry Coulis while cake is baking:  Puree raspberries with syrup, sugar, and lemon juice in a blender or food processor.  Pour mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing on solids.

Serve pudding cake with syrup.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cooks' Notes:  Coulis keeps 3 days, covered and chilled.  You can also make this coulis with fresh raspberries.  The amounts will be slightly different: Use 2 1/2 cups fresh raspberries and 1/4 cup sugar.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  Idaho potatoes -- peeled, quartered
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Place the potatoes in a 2-quart saucepan with 1 teaspoon of the salt and cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer, covered, until completely tender, about 30 minutes.  Test the potatoes by piercing them with a paring knife -- there should be no resistance.  Place in a colander and allow to drain well for several minutes.

Combine the butter, heavy cream and milk in another saucepan and heat gently until the butter has melted.  Keep warm.  Working with the saucepan used to cook the potatoes, pass the potatoes through a food mill or a potato ricer.  If you have any difficulty, add a little of the hot milk and butter to the potatoes.

To serve, place the potatoes over a low fame and begin adding the warm milk mixture.  Whip the potatoes with a wooden spoon or spatula while heating.  When all the liquid is absorbed, season with the remaining salt and white pepper.  Serve piping hot.

Mashed potatoes are best served immediately, but if you are unable to do so, or need them for another recipe, keep the potatoes hot for up to 1 hour by placing them in the top of a double boiler, covered, and held over barely simmering water.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  egg whites
                        = (from about 4 eggs)
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  mint extract or
                        mint flavoring - (not mint oil)
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- grated, or
                        finely chopped
  2             ounces  semisweet chocolate

Additional equipment needed:  A pastry bag fitted with a large plain or star tip, 2 cookie sheets, well greased, or lined with parchment paper, or lined with nonstick baking mats, or 2 nonstick cookies sheets.

Heat oven to 325 degrees.

Heat the egg whites and sugar in the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water until warm to the touch (this will help you get more air into the whites when you whip them).  Transfer to a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip until soft peaks form.  Add the mint extract and continue whipping just until stiff and glossy.  Fold in the chopped unsweetened chocolate.

Scrape the mixture into a pastry bag.  Pipe bite-size kisses onto the cookie sheets and bake until the meringues are the color of milky coffee, 25 to 30 minutes.  To test, remove one meringue from the oven, let cool one minute, then taste.  It should be dry and crisp all the way through.  Let cool on the pans.

Melt the semisweet chocolate.  Dipping the tines of a fork into the chocolate, drizzle the meringues with melted chocolate.  Let sit until chocolate is set, 30 minutes to an hour (or let set in the refrigerator for 15 minutes).

Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

This recipe yields 90 cookies.

Additional equipment needed:  A pastry bag fitted with a large plain or star tip, 2 cookie sheets, well greased, or lined with parchment paper, or lined with nonstick baking mats, or 2 nonstick cookies sheets.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat oven to 325 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the egg whites and sugar in the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water until warm to the touch (this will help you get more air into the whites when you whip them).  Transfer to a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip until soft peaks form.  Add the mint extract and continue whipping just until stiff and glossy.  Fold in the chopped unsweetened chocolate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Scrape the mixture into a pastry bag.  Pipe bite-size kisses onto the cookie sheets and bake until the meringues are the color of milky coffee, 25 to 30 minutes.  To test, remove one meringue from the oven, let cool one minute, then taste.  It should be dry and crisp all the way through.  Let cool on the pans.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt the semisweet chocolate.  Dipping the tines of a fork into the chocolate, drizzle the meringues with melted chocolate.  Let sit until chocolate is set, 30 minutes to an hour (or let set in the refrigerator for 15 minutes).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  medium-dry sherry
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- sliced
  1                     lemon -- sliced
  3             sprigs  thyme - (to 4)
  3                     bay leaves - (to 4)
  1                     dried red chile pepper
  4                     whole cloves
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4 1/2         pounds  mussels

Combine all ingredients except the mussels in a very large pan.  (You may want to tie the more pungent flavorings such as the chile pepper, cloves, and peppercorns in a piece of cheesecloth so they are easy to remove after cooking.)  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, uncovered for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, scrub the mussels under running water, pulling off the beards.  Discard any mussels that are broken or do not close when tapped on the counter.

Stir the mussels into the hot marinade.  Cover the pan and cook over high heat, stirring them once, until the mussels open, about 5 minutes.  Take care not to overcook them or they will be tough.  Leave them to cool in the cooking liquid.

Transfer the mussels to a bowl, with the marinade, discarding any that have not opened.  Discard the chile pepper.  Cover tightly and refrigerate the mussels for 24 hours, stirring occasionally; they will be plump and absorb almost all the liquid.  Let them come to room temperature before serving in bowls, discarding the seasonings in the cheesecloth.

Alternative:  Serve the mussels at once, while still piping hot.  Discard the chile pepper, or the bag of seasonings if used, and taste the broth.  If you find it too spicy, stir in some cream.  Serve the mussels with plenty of bread.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4                white onion -- thinly sliced
     1/8         small  red onion -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  mild French extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        Additional extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
  1         tablespoon  red-wine vinegar -- plus additional
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- plus additional
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cans  good-quality tuna in olive oil - (6 oz ea) -- including olive oil
                        Lemon juice -- to taste
  2                     Kaiser rolls -- plain
                        Lettuce leaves -- as needed
                        = (combination of Boston, green-leaf, or
                        other green leafy lettuce)
  8                     plum tomato slices
  2                     hard boiled eggs -- sliced
  4                     anchovy fillets -- drained
                        Nicoise olives -- to taste
                        Chopped scallions -- to taste
                        Sliced radishes -- to taste

Combine the red and white onion with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 1 tablespoon red-wine vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and several grinds of black pepper in a bowl.

Using your hands, mix and squeeze everything together for 5 minutes.  (Don't rush through this part; the onions need time to release their juices and mellow.)

Work in canned tuna in olive oil, including the oil.  Season with fresh lemon juice, red-wine vinegar, and salt, then add pepper, to taste.

Cut Kaiser rolls in half crosswise and spread each bottom half with lettuce leaves.  Use a couple of varieties (whatever looks good) for the difference in texture.

On top of each lettuce layer, arrange 4 tomato slices (skip this step if you don't have really tomatoes on hand).  Then add about half the tuna mixture and 3 to 4 slices of hard-boiled egg.

Crisscross each sandwich with 2 drained anchovy fillets and strew with Nicoise olives (pit them if desired), chopped scallion greens, and sliced radishes.  Then drizzle generously with more olive oil and top with the remaining Kaiser halves, pressing gently but firmly.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
     2/3           cup  scalded milk
     2/3           cup  warm water -- (105 to 115 deg)
  2            packets  active dry yeast
     3/4           cup  sugar
  5               cups  sifted flour - (about)
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  cardamom
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  mace
                        Vegetable shortening or cooking oil -- for deep frying
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  superfine sugar -- mixed with
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon

Melt butter in milk and cool to lukewarm.  Place water in a warm large mixing bowl, sprinkle in yeast, and stir until dissolved; add milk mixture and sugar.  By hand, beat 2 1/2 cups flour in until smooth; mix in eggs, salt, and spices.  Mix in remaining flour, adding a little extra, if needed, to form a soft but manageable dough.  Knead lightly 1 minute on a floured pastry cloth; shape into a ball, place in a greased large bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Punch dough down, roll 1/2-inch thick on pastry cloth, using a floured, stockinette-covered rolling pin.  Cut with a floured doughnut cutter and place 1 1/2-inches apart on un-greased baking sheets.  Reroll and cut scraps.  Cover with cloth and let double in bulk.

Meanwhile, begin heating fat in a deep fat fryer.  When doughnuts have risen and fat has reached 375 degrees, ease 4 doughnuts into fat, 1 at a time.  Fry about 2 minutes until golden brown all over, using tongs to turn.  Drain on paper toweling.

Note:  Never fry more than 4 doughnuts at a time and keep fat as near to 375 degrees as possible; if too hot, doughnuts will brown before they cook inside.

While doughnuts are warm, roll in topping.

This recipe yields 3 dozen doughnuts.

Variations:

Jelly Doughnuts:  Prepare as directed, but roll dough 1/4-inch thick instead of 1/2-inch.  Cut in 2 1/2-inch rounds and put 1 teaspoonful tart jelly in the center of 1/2 the rounds.  Top with remaining rounds, moisten touching edges slightly, and pinch to seal.  Let rise, then fry as directed.  Roll in confectioners' sugar while still warm.

Crullers:  Prepare as directed, but instead of cutting into doughnuts, cut in strips 8-inches long and 1/2- to 3/4-inch wide; let rise, then twist strips several times and pinch ends.  Fry at once and roll in topping while still warm.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  ripe plum tomatoes -- washed, cored,
                        and split lengthwise
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  1                     fresh rosemary sprig -- cut in half
  2                     sage leaves - (to 3)
  3             medium  garlic cloves -- split

Place the tomatoes cut side up on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle with the salt and let sit for 1 hour.  Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Roast the tomatoes for 5 to 6 hours.  The tomatoes are done when they are dried but still slightly plump, they should definitely not be leathery, nor as dry as commercial sun-dried tomatoes.

Allow the tomatoes to cool to room temperature, then transfer them to a jar or bowl.  Stir in the olive oil, herbs, and garlic, cover tightly and refrigerate.  The tomatoes will improve if marinated 2 to 3 days before using.  They will keep for up to 2 weeks stored in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  minced onions
  1              small  sweet red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into strips
  1              small  sweet green bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into strips
  1                cup  drained chopped canned tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme
  1                     chicken - (2 1/2 lbs) -- cut serving pieces,
                        and patted dry
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     chorizos -- cut 1/4"-thk half
                        circles
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  3               cups  long-grain rice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground saffron
                        = (or saffron threads)
  5               cups  simmering chicken stock - (to 6)
  12                    extra-large shrimps in shells -- shelled, deveined,
                        leaving tails intact
  12                    hard-shelled clams -- scrubbed
                        = (such as littlenecks)
  12                    mussels -- scrubbed
  1                cup  peas
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish
                        Minced fresh parsley

Make the sofrito:  In a heavy 12-inch skillet heat 3 tablespoons olive oil until hot, add the onions, and pepper strips and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes, garlic, and thyme and cook, stirring for 5 minutes more, until most of the liquid in the pan evaporates and the mixture is thick.

Season the chicken with salt and pepper.  In the skillet heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over moderately-high heat until hot.  Add the chicken and cook it, turning.  Add sausages and cook until lightly browned.  Transfer to a plate and deglaze pan with 1/2 cup dry white wine.

About a 30 minutes before you plan to serve the paella, preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a 14-inch paella pan or shallow casserole at least 14-inches in diameter, combine the sofrito, rice, and the saffron.  Pour in 5 cups simmering stock and, stirring constantly, bring to a boil over high heat.  Remove the pan from the heat immediately and season with salt.  Arrange the chicken, sausage, shrimp, clams, and mussels on top of the rice.

Set the pan on the floor of the oven or the lowest shelf and bake uncovered for 20 minutes.  Scatter the peas at random over the whole and bake for 5 to 10 minutes more or until all the liquid has been absorbed by the rice and the grains are tender but not too soft.  If necessary, add the remaining cup stock, if the rice needs to be more soft.  Do not stir the paella once it goes in oven.

Let paella stand at room temperature covered with a cloth for 5 minutes before serving.  Garnish with the lemons and parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Make the sofrito:  In a heavy 12-inch skillet heat 3 tablespoons olive oil until hot, add the onions, and pepper strips and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes, garlic, and thyme and cook, stirring for 5 minutes more, until most of the liquid in the pan evaporates and the mixture is thick.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season the chicken with salt and pepper.  In the skillet heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over moderately-high heat until hot.  Add the chicken and cook it, turning.  Add sausages and cook until lightly browned.  Transfer to a plate and deglaze pan with 1/2 cup dry white wine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
About a 30 minutes before you plan to serve the paella, preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 14-inch paella pan or shallow casserole at least 14-inches in diameter, combine the sofrito, rice, and the saffron.  Pour in 5 cups simmering stock and, stirring constantly, bring to a boil over high heat.  Remove the pan from the heat immediately and season with salt.  Arrange the chicken, sausage, shrimp, clams, and mussels on top of the rice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Set the pan on the floor of the oven or the lowest shelf and bake uncovered for 20 minutes.  Scatter the peas at random over the whole and bake for 5 to 10 minutes more or until all the liquid has been absorbed by the rice and the grains are tender but not too soft.  If necessary, add the remaining cup stock, if the rice needs to be more soft.  Do not stir the paella once it goes in oven.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Let paella stand at room temperature covered with a cloth for 5 minutes before serving.  Garnish with the lemons and parsley.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  18            ounces  dry-roasted unsalted peanuts
                        Peanut oil -- as needed
  1              pound  confectioners' sugar
  1 1/3            cup  graham cracker crumbs
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
  12            ounces  milk chocolate

Additional equipment needed: 2 cookie sheets, about 50 paper bonbon cups or mini-muffin cups, any color

Grind the peanuts in a food processor until smooth.  If the mixture seems too thick and grainy, add peanut oil a little bit at a time by drizzling a thin stream through the feed tube with the motor running.  Puree until smooth and the consistency of peanut butter.

Transfer the peanut butter to the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or any large bowl) and add the confectioners' sugar, graham cracker crumbs, and butter.  Mix together until smooth.  Form the mixture into bite-size balls and set aside on an un-greased cookie sheet.  Chill until slightly firmed, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, arrange the paper cups on a cookie sheet.  Melt the chocolate.  Dip the tops of the peanut butter balls into the melted chocolate and set each one, chocolate-side up, in a paper cup.  Let the chocolate set before serving, about 30 minutes at room temperature (or refrigerate 10 minutes if you're in a hurry).

Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.

This recipe yields about 50 balls.

                Persimmon Flans With Honeyed Whipped Cream

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Judith Fertig
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  3                     eggs
     1/2           cup  persimmon pulp
     1/2           can  evaporated milk - (12 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
     1/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  blossom or wildflower honey

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup sugar with cinnamon, coriander, and nutmeg.  Using an electric mixer at moderate speed, being mixing, adding the eggs one by one.  Then add the persimmon pulp until the mixture holds together.  Add the evaporated milk, vanilla, and lemon juice, and mix until the batter is smooth.  Set aside.

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the remaining 3/4 cups of sugar with water and cook over medium heat until the mixture caramelizes, about 10 minutes.  When the sugar has caramelized, immediately remove from the heat to stop cooking.

Assemble four (6 to 8-ounce) ramekins or custard cups.  Wearing an oven mitt on the hand that holds the saucepan, carefully pour a little caramel into the bottom of each ramekin.  Then pour about 1/3 cup of persimmon batter on top of the caramel.  Set the prepared ramekins in a deep-sided baking dish and pour enough water around them to reach halfway up the sides.  Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the flans are set.  Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.  Refrigerate each flan, covered with plastic wrap, to set.

Just before serving, whip the cream in a medium bowl until it forms soft peaks.  Blend in the honey, then whip again.  Set aside.

Remove the flans from the refrigerator and run a small paring knife around the rim of each.  Hold a dessert plate over the top of each ramekin and invert so that the flan and caramel are positioned in the center of each plate.  Place a dollop of honeyed whipped cream on each portion and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                     butternut squash - (abt 2 lbs) -- peeled, seeds and

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  1         tablespoon  crumbled dried sage
  2          teaspoons  freshly-grated lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4                     Cornish hens - (1 1/2 lbs ea) -- rinsed, patted dry

In a small bowl blend together 4 tablespoons of the butter with the sage, zest, and salt.  Loosen the skin covering the breast meat on each hen by slipping your fingers under the skin and sliding them between the skin and the meat.  Divide the butter mixture between the hens, inserting it under the skin of each hen and smoothing it evenly by rubbing the outside of the skin, and season the hens with salt and pepper.  Tie each hen's legs together with kitchen string.

In a large ovenproof heavy skillet, or small flameproof roasting pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter over moderately-high heat until the foam subsides.  In it saute the hens, breast-sides up, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the underside is golden brown, and roast them in the middle of a preheated 450 degree oven, basting them with the pan juices every 10 minutes, for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted in the fleshy part of the thigh registers 180 degrees.  Let the hens stand for 5 minutes, then discard the string.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1              large  Idaho potato -- peeled, and
                        steamed for 15 minutes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Clarified butter or oil -- as needed
  1         tablespoon  butter
  3             ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, sliced
  3             ounces  button mushrooms -- sliced
  1           teaspoon  thyme
  1         tablespoon  chopped shallots
     1/4           cup  Madeira

Cool potatoes and rub through the large holes of the grater onto a baking sheet or tray.  Toss lightly with a sprinkling of salt and pepper, leaving them loosely massed; set aside, until ready to use.

Film a frying pan with clarified butter or oil, and when hot, spread in 1/2 to 2/3 cup of grated potato.  Saute over moderate heat for 4 to 5 minutes, pressing the potatoes together lightly with a spatula, until the bottom has crusted and browned.  Flip over, and saute to brown the other side a few minutes more.  Transfer to a baking sheet, and keep warm while finishing the rest.

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add all mushrooms and thyme; saute 5 minutes.  Add shallots; saute until mushrooms are tender, about 3 minutes.  Add Madeira and simmer until almost all liquid evaporates, about 2 minutes.  Set sauce aside.

Film a frying pan with clarified butter or oil, and when hot, spread in 1/2 to 2/3 cup of grated potato.  Saute over moderate heat for 4 to 5 minutes, pressing the potatoes together lightly with a spatula, until the bottom has crusted and browned.

  2        tablespoons  coarsely chopped rosemary
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 20    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  4          teaspoons  double-acting baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  2              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  mashed cooked baking potatoes
                        = (like russets - abt 1 pound)
     1/2           cup  milk
  2          teaspoons  freshly-grated orange zest -- if desired
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        === FOR THE COATING ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon -- or to taste

Into a bowl sift the flour, the baking powder, the salt, the cinnamon, and the nutmeg.  In a small bowl whisk together the eggs, the butter, the sugar, the potatoes, the milk, the zest, and the vanilla until the mixture is combined well, add the potato mixture to the flour mixture, and stir the dough until it is just combined.

Chill the dough, covered, for 1 hour, or until it is cold and can be handled easily.  Roll out half the dough 1/2-inch thick on a well-floured surface and with a 3- to 3 1/2-inch doughnut cutter cut out doughnuts, reserving the center pieces.  With the other half of the dough either cut out round doughnuts in the same manner or shape the dough into crullers.

For the crullers, roll the dough into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle about 14  by 5 inches and cut into 5- by 1/2-inch strips.  To form each cruller, twist 2 strips of dough together, and pinch the ends to secure them.  Fry the round doughnuts, the reserved doughnut centers, and the crullers in batches in 2 inches of 375 degree oil, or until they are golden, transferring them as they are fried to paper towels to drain.

Make the Coating:  In a shallow bowl stir together the sugar and the cinnamon

While the doughnuts are still warm, roll them, 1 at a time, in the sugar mixture, coating them well.  The doughnuts keep, wrapped in plastic wrap, for 1 day.

This recipe yields about 20 doughnuts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CAKE ===
  1                cup  chopped dates
                        = (or whole dark or golden raisins)
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  3                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2               cups  peeled apple chunks
                        = (from about 3 apples)
  1                cup  chopped walnuts
                        === FOR THE GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  maple syrup
  1 1/2           cups  confectioners' sugar

Additional equipment needed:  1 or 2 bundt muffin tins (makes mini bundt cakes with no hole) or 1 regular muffin tin, buttered and floured (or use nonstick).

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the dates in a bowl and toss them with 2 tablespoons of the flour until lightly coated (this will prevent them from sinking in the cake batter during baking).

Beat the eggs and sugar in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer) until fluffy.  With the mixer running, slowly pour in the oil.

In a separate bowl, mix the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and vanilla.  Mix into the egg mixture.  Mix in the apples and nuts, then stir in the dates by hand, distributing them evenly in the batter.

Spoon into the muffin tins and bake about 35 minutes, until springy and dry in the center.  Let cool in the pan on a wire rack, then turn out.

Meanwhile, make the glaze:  Stir the maple syrup and sugar together in a bowl.  Glaze the cooled cakes by spooning the glaze around the tops of the cakes and letting it drip down the sides.

This recipe yields 24 cakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LOBSTER SALAD ===
     1/2         pound  fully-cooked lobster meat
                        = (or a 2 1/2-lb live lobster)
     1/2        medium  cucumber -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely diced
     1/4           cup  bottled mayonnaise
     1/2    tablespoon  fresh tarragon
  2              small  scallions -- thinly sliced
                        Kosher or sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  2                     New England-style hot dog buns - (to 3)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (to 3) -- softened
                        Pickles and potato chips -- as accompaniment

Prepare the lobster salad.

If using live lobsters, steam or boil them.  Let cool at room temperature.  Use a cleaver to crack and remove the meat from the claws, knuckles and tails.  Remove the cartilage from the claws and the intestines from the tails of the cooked meat.  Cut the meat into 1/2-inch dice.  You may pick all the meat from the carcass and add it to the meat or freeze the carcass for soup or broth.

Place the cucumber in a colander for at least 5 minutes to drain the excess liquid.  Combine the lobster, cucumber, mayonnaise, and tarragon.  Add the scallions.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Preheat a large heavy skillet (12 to 14 inches) over medium-low heat (a black cast-iron pan is perfect).  Lightly butter both sides of each bun.  Place them in the pan and cook for about 2 minutes until golden brown.  Turn the buns over and toast the other side.  Or toast the buns under a broiler instead.

When the buns are ready, stuff them with the chilled lobster salad.  Place each roll on a small paper or china plate; garnish with pickles and potato chips.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 2 to 3 servings.

Prepare the lobster salad.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If using live lobsters, steam or boil them.  Let cool at room temperature.  Use a cleaver to crack and remove the meat from the claws, knuckles and tails.  Remove the cartilage from the claws and the intestines from the tails of the cooked meat.  Cut the meat into 1/2-inch dice.  You may pick all the meat from the carcass and add it to the meat or freeze the carcass for soup or broth.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the cucumber in a colander for at least 5 minutes to drain the excess liquid.  Combine the lobster, cucumber, mayonnaise, and tarragon.  Add the scallions.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat a large heavy skillet (12 to 14 inches) over medium-low heat (a black cast-iron pan is perfect).  Lightly butter both sides of each bun.  Place them in the pan and cook for about 2 minutes until golden brown.  Turn the buns over and toast the other side.  Or toast the buns under a broiler instead.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the buns are ready, stuff them with the chilled lobster salad.  Place each roll on a small paper or china plate; garnish with pickles and potato chips.  Serve at once.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 to 3 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TURKEY CUTLETS ===
  2                     turkey cutlets - (6 oz ea) -- pounded 1/4" thick
                        All-purpose flour -- seasoned with
                        Salt -- and with
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- for dredging
  2              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  fine fresh bread crumbs
     3/4           cup  finely-shredded Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        === SALAD ===
  1              bunch  watercress -- coarse stems
                        discarded, leaves washed well and spun dry
                        = (alternatively use mesclun salad greens)
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced red onion
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        Lemon wedges -- as an accompaniment

Make turkey cutlets:  Pat the turkey dry and spread the seasoned flour on a plate.  In a small shallow bowl, beat eggs lightly, and season them with salt and pepper.  In another small shallow bowl, stir together bread crumbs and Parmesan.

Dredge cutlets in flour, shaking off excess, and dip in egg, letting excess drip off.  Coat cutlets with bread crumb mixture and put on a waxed-paper-lined tray.  You can at this point chill cutlets for 15 minutes.

In a 12-inch non-stick skillet, heat oil over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking and saute cutlets 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side, or until golden and just cooked through.  Remove skillet from heat.

Make the salad:  In a bowl, combine watercress and onion and drizzle with oil, tossing to coat.  Add lemon juice and salt and toss well.

Transfer cutlets with a slotted spatula to paper towels to drain briefly and arrange on plates.  Top cutlets with salad and serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GANACHE ===
  4             ounces  extra-bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
                        === CAKES ===
  3 1/2         ounces  extra-bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened, plus
                        additional for buttering the tins
  3              large  eggs -- separated
     1/4           cup  almond flour
     1/4           cup  cake flour
     1/4           cup  confectioners' sugar

Line an 8- by 4-inch loaf pan or 6-inch gratin dish with plastic wrap.  To prepare the ganache, put the chocolate in a bowl.  Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan and pour the hot cream over the chocolate.  Let stand until the chocolate begins to melt, about 2 minutes, then whisk until smooth.

Pour the ganache into the loaf pan or gratin dish and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.  When the mixture has set, unmold, and cut out 6 (1 1/2-inch) rounds (you can use a knife or a cookie cutter).  Refrigerate until ready to use (up to 5 days).

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a muffin pan and set aside.

To make the cakes, in the top of a double boiler, or in metal bowl suspended over a pot of simmering (not boiling) water, melt the chocolate.  Whisk in the softened butter and turn off the heat.  Let cool for 5 minutes, then whisk in the egg yolks, one at a time.

Sift together the almond and cake flours and fold the flours into the chocolate mixture.

Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites to soft peaks.  Sift in the confectioners' sugar and continue beating to stiff peaks.  Fold 1/3 of the egg white mixture into the chocolate mixture, then gently fold in the remaining whites in two additions.

Scoop or pipe a 1/4-cup measure of cake batter into each muffin tin.

Place a ganache round in the center of each muffin cup, then spoon in enough batter to cover.  Bake the cakes for 20 minutes, or until the tops are firm.  Allow the cakes to rest for 1 minute before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     red snapper - (abt 4 lbs) -- scaled, gutted,
                        and gills removed
  4                     egg whites -- or more if needed
     1/2           cup  cold water
  6             pounds  coarse sea salt or kosher salt - (to 7)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Rinse and dry the fish thoroughly.  Whisk together the egg whites and water and combine with the salt in a large mixing bowl.  Work the mixture with your hands to distribute the water and egg whites in the salt.  The salt mixture should hold together when you press a mound of it together between the palms of your hands.  If it doesn't, work in another egg white.

Fill a baking dish that is 2 inches longer than the fish about 1/3 full of the salt mixture.  Place the fish on top.  Cover the fish with the rest of the salt mixture and smooth the salt over with a spatula.

Place the fish in the oven for about 40 minutes.  The only way to know whether the fish is done is by inserting an instant-read thermometer through the layer of salt and measuring the temperature of the fish.  When it reaches 135 degrees, take it out, and serve immediately.

Bring the fish to the table on a baking sheet or on a large platter and crack it with a mallet or even a hammer.  Pull back the salt layer, then peel off the skin with a fork.  Serve on hot plates.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

<DirT>
Rinse and dry the fish thoroughly.  Whisk together the egg whites and water and combine with the salt in a large mixing bowl.  Work the mixture with your hands to distribute the water and egg whites in the salt.  The salt mixture should hold together when you press a mound of it together between the palms of your hands.  If it doesn&apos;t, work in another egg white.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill a baking dish that is 2 inches longer than the fish about 1/3 full of the salt mixture.  Place the fish on top.  Cover the fish with the rest of the salt mixture and smooth the salt over with a spatula.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the fish in the oven for about 40 minutes.  The only way to know whether the fish is done is by inserting an instant-read thermometer through the layer of salt and measuring the temperature of the fish.  When it reaches 135 degrees, take it out, and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring the fish to the table on a baking sheet or on a large platter and crack it with a mallet or even a hammer.  Pull back the salt layer, then peel off the skin with a fork.  Serve on hot plates.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GINGER-MUSTARD GLAZE ===
     1/3           cup  teriyaki sauce
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  white wine vinegar
                        === TUNA BURGERS ===
  1 1/2         pounds  yellowfin tuna -- free of any
                        skin or gristle
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  3        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  4                     fresh hamburger buns with seeds
     1/4           cup  Japanese pickled ginger -- (optional)
                        = (available in Japanese specialty shops)

Combine all the ginger-mustard glaze ingredients in a 1-quart saucepan and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer until the glaze coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.  Strain through a sieve and reserve in a warm place until tuna burgers are cooked.  Can be prepared up to 2 days in advance and stored, covered, in the refrigerator.

Grind the tuna in a meat grinder or chop with a large sharp knife, to the texture of hamburger meat.  Do not use a food processor, which will shred the tuna rather than chop it.  Transfer the ground tuna to a bowl and combine with the garlic, mustard, cayenne, salt and pepper.  Mix thoroughly.

Divide the tuna into 4 equal portions.  Using your hands, roll each part into a smooth ball and then flatten into a compact patty.  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and sear the tuna burgers until browned and medium-rare, 3 to 4 minutes a side.

Serve each burger on a buttered toasted bun and spread with a tablespoon of warm glaze.  Garnish the burgers with equal amounts of pickled ginger slices.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  medium-size shrimp
  2                     plump Mexican vanilla beans
  2                     ripe plantains
                        = (should be soft with blackened skin or
                        large patches of black)
  1                cup  safflower or corn oil -- for frying plantains
  2             pounds  plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and quartered
                        = (or canned tomatoes, drained)
  3                     chipotles en adobo -- or to taste
     1/4           cup  light olive oil or vegetable oil
                        Salt -- to taste
  1             medium  white onion -- peeled, and
                        thinly julienned
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
                        = (if using an unsweetened extract,
                        add 1 tspn light brown sugar)
  2             ounces  fruity dark chocolate
                        = (abt 70% cacao content
                        === SERVING SUGGESTIONS ===
                        White rice or Moors and Christians rice

Peel and de-vein the shrimp leaving on the tails, and set aside.  Cut the vanilla beans into 1-inch pieces with a knife, and then chop to a fine bread crumb texture in a small food processor or spice grinder, about 1 tablespoon.  Set aside.

Cut off the brown ends of the plantains and slit the skin lengthwise from end to end along its ridges, preferably with a table knife.  With your fingertips, work off the skin.  Slice crosswise into 1/4-inch rounds or at an angle.

Heat the vegetable oil over moderate heat in a medium-sized, heavy-bottomed saucepan or deep skillet until barely rippling (about 350 degrees).  Fry the plantain rounds until golden, for about 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove from the skillet and place on paper towels to drain.  Keep in a warm place.

Place the tomatoes and chiles in a blender or food processor and process to a fine puree.  Heat the olive oil in a 9-inch skillet or medium saucepan over medium heat until it ripples.  Stir in the puree and salt.  Saute stirring occasionally for approximately 20 minutes or until the sauce thickens and the oil starts to separate from the solids and begins to fry again.

Stir in the onions, the ground vanilla, the vanilla extract, the optional sugar, and the dark chocolate, and cook until the chocolate dissolves, about 3 minutes, while stirring.  Add the shrimp and the plantains and cook for 3 more minutes.  Serve immediately with white rice or Moors and Christians rice.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.
