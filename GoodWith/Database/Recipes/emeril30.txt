Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  toasted walnuts
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
  1              large  egg
  1                     sheet puff pastry -- thawed
  3                     fresh apricots -- pitted, and
                        cut into 1/8"-thk slices
  2                     fresh peaches -- pitted, and
                        cut into 1/8"-thk slices
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  apricot jam
     1/4           cup  cognac or brandy
                        === CREME FRAICHE ===
  1                cup  creme fraiche or sour cream
  4        tablespoons  sugar

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

In the bowl of a food processor or blender, finely grind the walnuts with the sugar to make a paste.  Place in a small bowl and mix well with the egg.

On a lightly floured surface unfold the pastry and roll into a rectangle about 14- by 9-inches.  Transfer to a buttered large baking sheet and spread the walnut paste evenly over the bottom, leaving a 1/4-inch border.  Fold the dough border over to form an edge.  Arrange the apricot and peach slices in overlapping rows on top of the paste and sprinkle with the sugar.

Bake until edges are just golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Transfer to a wire rack.

In a small saucepan combine the jam and Cognac and bring to a simmer, stirring, just until the jam is melted.  Brush the hot galette with the jam and let sit for 5 minutes before serving.

To make the creme fraiche garnish, beat together the creme fraiche with the sugar.  Serve with the galette.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

            Apricot-Glazed Roast Duck With Caramelized Apples

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === APRICOT GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  apricot jam
  2        tablespoons  brandy
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
                        === DUCK ===
  4                     boneless duck breasts
  1         tablespoon  Emeril's Original Essence -- see * Note
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  very thinly-sliced yellow onions
  2          teaspoons  light brown sugar
  5                     Braeburn or Gala apples -- cored, and
                        cut into eighths
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, halved
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  Calvados or apple cider
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

To make the glaze, in a small saucepan, combine all the ingredients.  Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened and reduced almost by half, about 8 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Score the fat on the duck breasts, making a diamond pattern.  Season the duck on all sides with the Essence.  To a hot saute pan, add duck, skin-side down and cook until fat is rendered and skin is crispy, about 5 minutes.  Turn the duck over and brush with the apricot glaze, cook another 5 minutes, for medium-rare.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook until almost caramelized, about 6 minutes.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and when melted, add the sugar and cook until melted.  Add the apples, teaspoon of salt, black pepper, and cook until caramelized, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Add the Calvados and thyme to the apples, and cook, scraping with a wooden spoon to deglaze the pan.

Remove from the heat and keep warm until ready to serve.  Serve the duck with the caramelized apples and the remaining apricot glaze.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dry red wine
  1                cup  Ruby Port
     1/4           cup  sugar

             Baked Onions With Rice, Apple, And Nut Stuffing

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  red onions - (abt 8 to 10 oz ea)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1                cup  diced apples
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1            package  wild rice - (6 oz) -- cooked according
                        to package directions
     1/2           cup  lightly toasted walnuts
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh sage
  2                     tablepoons chopped fresh parsley
     1/2           cup  grated Dry Jack or white cheddar
     1/2           cup  chicken stock - (to 1)
                        = (or vegetable stock)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and set aside.

Peel the onions.  Trim the stem ends so they will stand upright and remove the top 1/2 inch.  Rub oil on each onion and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Place in a baking dish, and bake, root-ends down, until golden brown and just tender, about 45 minutes to 1 hour (depending upon the size).  Remove from the oven and let rest until cool enough to handle.

When cool enough to handle, push out the centers, leaving a shell.  Return one piece of the removed onion to each to form a bottom and chop the remaining onion centers to measure 1 cup.

In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the 1 cup of chopped onion and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the garlic, apples, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the cooked rice, walnuts, sage, and parsley, and stir well.  Add 1/4 cup of the cheese and stir well.

Stuff the onions with the rice mixture and place in a baking dish.  Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup cheese over the tops of the onions, and add stock to come 1/2 inch up the sides of the onions.  Bake until tender and bubbly, about 20 to 30 minutes, basting occasionally.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Peel the onions.  Trim the stem ends so they will stand upright and remove the top 1/2 inch.  Rub oil on each onion and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Place in a baking dish, and bake, root-ends down, until golden brown and just tender, about 45 minutes to 1 hour (depending upon the size).  Remove from the oven and let rest until cool enough to handle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When cool enough to handle, push out the centers, leaving a shell.  Return one piece of the removed onion to each to form a bottom and chop the remaining onion centers to measure 1 cup.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the 1 cup of chopped onion and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the garlic, apples, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the cooked rice, walnuts, sage, and parsley, and stir well.  Add 1/4 cup of the cheese and stir well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stuff the onions with the rice mixture and place in a baking dish.  Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup cheese over the tops of the onions, and add stock to come 1/2 inch up the sides of the onions.  Bake until tender and bubbly, about 20 to 30 minutes, basting occasionally.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7              large  sweet potatoes - (abt 3 lbs)
  4              large  oranges
  1              stick  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
  3              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  fresh orange juice
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  brandy
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake until tender, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let rest until just cool enough to handle.

Lower the oven to 350 degrees.

Make the orange cups by cutting the oranges in half and scooping out the pulp, leaving only the shell.  Set aside.

While still somewhat hot, peel the potatoes and place in a large bowl.  Discard the skins and tough, stringy fibers.  Add the butter, and with an electric mixer, beat out the lumps.  Add the sugar, eggs, orange juice, heavy cream, and brandy, and mix until smooth.  Add the cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt, and mix well.  Re-season, to taste.

Spoon the sweet potato mixture into the orange cups, mounding and smoothing the top.  Bake until puffed and slightly golden, about 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1                     turkey - (10 to 12 lbs)

  2                     thyme sprigs
  1 1/2           cups  chicken or turkey stock - (to 2) -- for basting
                        === BRINE ===
  1                cup  salt
  1                cup  brown sugar
  2                     oranges -- quartered
  2                     lemons -- quartered
  6                     thyme sprigs
  4                     rosemary sprigs
                        === TURKEY BROTH ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
                        Reserved turkey neck and giblets
  1              large  carrot -- coarsely chopped
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  1              large  celery stalk -- coarsely chopped
  1              small  bay leaf
  3               cups  turkey stock, chicken stock, or
                        canned low-salt chicken broth
  3               cups  water
                        === PAN GRAVY ===
  4               cups  turkey broth
  1                cup  dry white wine
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the Brine:  To make the brining solution, dissolve the salt and sugar in 2 gallons of cold water in a non-reactive container (such as a clean bucket or large stockpot, or a clean, heavy-duty, plastic garbage bag.)  Add the oranges, lemons, thyme, and rosemary.  (Note: If you have a big turkey and need more brine than this, use 1/2 cup salt and 1/2 cup brown sugar for every gallon of water.)

Remove the neck, giblets, and liver from the cavity of the turkey and reserve for the gravy.  Rinse the turkey inside and out under cold running water.

Soak the turkey in the brine, covered and refrigerated, for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Remove the turkey from the brine and rinse well under cold running water.  Pat dry with paper towels, inside and out.  Place breast-side down in a large, heavy roasting pan, and rub on all sides with the butter.  Season lightly inside and out with salt and pepper.  Stuff the turkey with the onion, orange, celery, carrot, bay leaves, and thyme.  Loosely tie the drumsticks together with kitchen string.

For the Turkey Broth:  Heat the oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium high heat.  Add the turkey neck, heart, and gizzard to the pan and saute until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute.  Add the chopped vegetables and bay leaf to the pan and saute until soft, about 2 minutes.  Pour the stock and 3 cups of water into the pan and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer until the stock is reduced to 4 cups, about 1 hour, adding the chopped liver to the pan during the last 15 minutes of cooking.

Strain the stock into a clean pot or large measuring cup.  Pull the meat off the neck, chop the neck meat and giblets, and set aside.

Roast the turkey, uncovered, breast-side down for 1 hour.  Remove from the oven, turn, and baste with 1/2 cup stock.  Continue roasting with the breast-side up until an instant-read meat thermometer registers 165 degrees when inserted into the largest section of thigh (avoiding the bone), about 2 3/4 to 3 hours total cooking time.  Baste the turkey once every hour with 1/2 to 3/4 cup chicken or turkey stock.

Remove from the oven and place on a platter.  Tent with aluminum foil and let rest for 20 minutes before carving.

For the Pan Gravy:  Pour the reserved turkey pan juices into a glass-measuring cup and skim off the fat.  Place the roasting pan on 2 stovetop burners over medium heat add the pan juice and 1 cup turkey broth and the white wine to the pan, and deglaze the pan, stirring to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Add the remaining 3 cup of broth and bring to a simmer, then transfer to a measuring cup.

In a large heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium high heat.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, to make a light roux.  Add the hot stock, whisking constantly, then simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.  Add the reserved neck meat and giblets to the pan and adjust seasoning, to taste, with salt and black pepper.  Pour into a gravy boat and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

For the Brine:  To make the brining solution, dissolve the salt and sugar in 2 gallons of cold water in a non-reactive container (such as a clean bucket or large stockpot, or a clean, heavy-duty, plastic garbage bag.)  Add the oranges, lemons, thyme, and rosemary.  (Note: If you have a big turkey and need more brine than this, use 1/2 cup salt and 1/2 cup brown sugar for every gallon of water.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the neck, giblets, and liver from the cavity of the turkey and reserve for the gravy.  Rinse the turkey inside and out under cold running water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Soak the turkey in the brine, covered and refrigerated, for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the turkey from the brine and rinse well under cold running water.  Pat dry with paper towels, inside and out.  Place breast-side down in a large, heavy roasting pan, and rub on all sides with the butter.  Season lightly inside and out with salt and pepper.  Stuff the turkey with the onion, orange, celery, carrot, bay leaves, and thyme.  Loosely tie the drumsticks together with kitchen string.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Turkey Broth:  Heat the oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium high heat.  Add the turkey neck, heart, and gizzard to the pan and saute until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute.  Add the chopped vegetables and bay leaf to the pan and saute until soft, about 2 minutes.  Pour the stock and 3 cups of water into the pan and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer until the stock is reduced to 4 cups, about 1 hour, adding the chopped liver to the pan during the last 15 minutes of cooking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Strain the stock into a clean pot or large measuring cup.  Pull the meat off the neck, chop the neck meat and giblets, and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast the turkey, uncovered, breast-side down for 1 hour.  Remove from the oven, turn, and baste with 1/2 cup stock.  Continue roasting with the breast-side up until an instant-read meat thermometer registers 165 degrees when inserted into the largest section of thigh (avoiding the bone), about 2 3/4 to 3 hours total cooking time.  Baste the turkey once every hour with 1/2 to 3/4 cup chicken or turkey stock.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the oven and place on a platter.  Tent with aluminum foil and let rest for 20 minutes before carving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Pan Gravy:  Pour the reserved turkey pan juices into a glass-measuring cup and skim off the fat.  Place the roasting pan on 2 stovetop burners over medium heat add the pan juice and 1 cup turkey broth and the white wine to the pan, and deglaze the pan, stirring to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Add the remaining 3 cup of broth and bring to a simmer, then transfer to a measuring cup.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cans  cannellini beans - (15 oz ea)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  minced yellow onions
  3          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  cayenne
     1/3           cup  very finely-grated Parmesan
                        = (or crumbled goat cheese)
  1 1/2           cups  fresh parsley leaves
                        Toasted pita bread triangles

Place the beans in a colander and rinse under cold running water.  Drain.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the onions and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the garlic and cook until soft and fragrant, about 2 minutes.  Add the drained beans, 4 teaspoons of the lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, the black pepper and cayenne, and cook, stirring, until softened and warmed through, 3 minutes.  Remove from the pan and transfer to a decorative platter.  Sprinkle with the Parmesan.

In a blender or bowl of a small food processor, combine the parsley, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of garlic, 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon of salt in a blender or small food processor.  Process on high speed for 30 seconds.  Add the remaining 1/3 cup oil with the motor running and process until smooth.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.

Drizzle the parsley pesto over the beans and serve with the toast for dipping.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CANNOLI SHELLS ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  dry Marsala
                        = (or other dry red wine)
  2                     egg whites -- beaten
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Cannoli molds
                        = (tubes for shaping shells during frying)
                        === CANNOLI FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1              pound  ricotta
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
  2          teaspoons  nut-flavored liqueur
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped candied fruit
     1/2           cup  melted semi-sweet chocolate
     1/4           cup  chopped pistachios

Into a bowl sift together the flour, sugar, and salt.  With your fingers, work the wine gradually into the dry ingredients to form a stiff dough.  Form into a ball, wrap in plastic and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thickness.  With a cutter, cut out rounds 5-inches in diameter.  In batches, as necessary, wrap each round onto a cannoli mold, sealing the edges with egg white.

In a deep sautÈ pan, heat the oil to 350 degrees.

Fry the cannoli in batches until just golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes.  Drain on paper towels, let cool, then gently slip the molds from the cannolis.  (Note: Shells can be made 3 days in advance and kept at room temperature in an airtight container.)

In a mixing bowl whip the cream.  Fold in the ricotta with a rubber spatula, working until creamy.  Fold in the sugar, nut liqueur, and candied fruit.

Place 1 cannoli shell on a flat surface.  Working from either end, fill the cannoli with the ricotta filling (using a pastry bag, if desired), pressing gently to ensure that the middle is filled.  Dip both ends in the melted chocolate, then into the pistachios, and place on a waxed paper lined baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining cannoli, and serve.

This recipe yields 12 to 15 cannoli.

             Chicken And Goat Cheese Tamales With Chile Verde

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Tamales


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  corn husks - (8 oz) -- approximately 40 hus
                        === TAMALE FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable shortening
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
     3/4           cup  corn kernels
     1/2           cup  diced green bell pepper
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced jalapeÒo
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  1              pound  shredded cooked chicken meat
     1/2           cup  diced roasted peeled seeded
                        New Mexico chile peppers
     1/4           cup  minced fresh cilantro leaves
  6             ounces  crumbled goat cheese
                        === TAMALE DOUGH ===
     2/3           cup  vegetable shortening -- plus
     1/3           cup  vegetable shortening -- melted
  4               cups  masa harina
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-sodium chicken broth)
                        === CHILE VERDE ===
  1              pound  fresh mild green New Mexico chiles
                        = (or Anaheims)
  1              pound  fresh hot green New Mexico chiles -- (Big Jim's)
                        = (or anchos or poblanos)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped white onion
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced seeded jalapeÒo pepper
  2          teaspoons  dried Mexican oregano
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-sodium chicken broth)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
                        Sour Cream -- for accompaniment

Separate the dry corn husks into individual pieces and remove any corn silk threads inside the husks.  Bring a large pot of water to a boil and remove from the heat.  Place the separated husks in the water, weight with a large, round baking dish, and cover.  Allow the husks to soak for 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.

To make the filling, heat the shortening in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat.  Add the onions, corn, and bell peppers, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, jalapeÒo, chili powder, salt, cumin, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the chicken, chile peppers, and cilantro, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Remove the pan from the heat and let sit until cool enough to handle.  When cool, fold in the goat cheese.

To make the dough, place the solid shortening in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, and cream until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Combine the masa harina and salt in a bowl.  With the mixer on medium speed, alternately add the masa harina and chicken stock to the whipped shortening, thoroughly mixing after each addition.  Gradually add the melted shortening to the dough mixture with the mixer on medium speed.

Place one large soaked cornhusk on a flat work surface.  Using a 1/4-cup measure, spoon 1/4 cup of the masa batter into the center where the husks join and with the back of a spoon, spread it into a 4-inch square.  Place about 1 generous tablespoon of the chicken mixture into the center of the masa.  As though wrapping a package, fold the sides of the husk over the filling, then bring the bottom and the top over the filling, overlapping as much as possible to tightly enclose the filling.  (You now will have a small package, measuring approximately 3 inches by 2 inches.)

Wrap a piece of kitchen twine around the middle of the tamale, as though wrapping a present, twisting the twine up and down at the middle to tie around all 4 sides, and knotting the twine at the top.  Place the filled tamale on a large platter or in a roasting pan.

Lay or stand the tamales in a steamer insert 2-inches over a pot of gently boiling water, being careful not to pack them too tightly.  Cover the top of the tamales with a layer of the remaining corn husks, then cover with a lid.  Steam the tamales, covered, over the boiling water for 2 hours, replenishing the water as needed, so the pot does not go dry.  Remove the tamales from the steamer insert and let cool for 10 minutes before handling.

To serve, unwrap the tamales and top each with a spoonful of Chile Verde and a dollop of sour cream.

Chile Verde:  Roast the peppers by placing them on an open gas flame, turning them frequently with tongs until all sides are charred black, about 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternately, the peppers can be roasted under a broiler, or on top of a gas or charcoal grill.)  Place the blackened peppers in a plastic or paper bag, and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.  Peel the peppers, and remove the seeds and the stems.  Chop the peppers and set aside.

In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until tender, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, jalapeÒos, oregano, salt, and cumin, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the flour and cook, stirring, without allowing to color, for 2 minutes.  Add the chopped peppers, and stir well to combine.  Add the chicken stock, stir well, and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.

Remove the chile verde from the heat, add the cilantro, and adjust seasoning, to taste.

This recipe yields 32 to 36 tamales.

Separate the dry corn husks into individual pieces and remove any corn silk threads inside the husks.  Bring a large pot of water to a boil and remove from the heat.  Place the separated husks in the water, weight with a large, round baking dish, and cover.  Allow the husks to soak for 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the filling, heat the shortening in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat.  Add the onions, corn, and bell peppers, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, jalapeÒo, chili powder, salt, cumin, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the chicken, chile peppers, and cilantro, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Remove the pan from the heat and let sit until cool enough to handle.  When cool, fold in the goat cheese.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the dough, place the solid shortening in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, and cream until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Combine the masa harina and salt in a bowl.  With the mixer on medium speed, alternately add the masa harina and chicken stock to the whipped shortening, thoroughly mixing after each addition.  Gradually add the melted shortening to the dough mixture with the mixer on medium speed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place one large soaked cornhusk on a flat work surface.  Using a 1/4-cup measure, spoon 1/4 cup of the masa batter into the center where the husks join and with the back of a spoon, spread it into a 4-inch square.  Place about 1 generous tablespoon of the chicken mixture into the center of the masa.  As though wrapping a package, fold the sides of the husk over the filling, then bring the bottom and the top over the filling, overlapping as much as possible to tightly enclose the filling.  (You now will have a small package, measuring approximately 3 inches by 2 inches.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wrap a piece of kitchen twine around the middle of the tamale, as though wrapping a present, twisting the twine up and down at the middle to tie around all 4 sides, and knotting the twine at the top.  Place the filled tamale on a large platter or in a roasting pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lay or stand the tamales in a steamer insert 2-inches over a pot of gently boiling water, being careful not to pack them too tightly.  Cover the top of the tamales with a layer of the remaining corn husks, then cover with a lid.  Steam the tamales, covered, over the boiling water for 2 hours, replenishing the water as needed, so the pot does not go dry.  Remove the tamales from the steamer insert and let cool for 10 minutes before handling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, unwrap the tamales and top each with a spoonful of Chile Verde and a dollop of sour cream.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Chile Verde:  Roast the peppers by placing them on an open gas flame, turning them frequently with tongs until all sides are charred black, about 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternately, the peppers can be roasted under a broiler, or on top of a gas or charcoal grill.)  Place the blackened peppers in a plastic or paper bag, and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.  Peel the peppers, and remove the seeds and the stems.  Chop the peppers and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until tender, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, jalapeÒos, oregano, salt, and cumin, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the flour and cook, stirring, without allowing to color, for 2 minutes.  Add the chopped peppers, and stir well to combine.  Add the chicken stock, stir well, and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the chile verde from the heat, add the cilantro, and adjust seasoning, to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 32 to 36 tamales.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     rectangles parchment paper - (12" by 16")
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     boned skinned chicken breast halves -- (6 oz ea)
  2          teaspoons  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2               cups  finely-sliced leeks
  2               cups  finely-sliced carrots
  2               cups  finely-sliced celery
     1/4           cup  white wine
  2               cups  fresh carrot juice
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/8      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
  4        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut tspn pieces
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley
                        Steamed long-grain white rice -- for serving

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Fold parchment sheet in half to form an 8-inch by 12-inch rectangle.  With scissors, cut each folded sheet into a heart shape.  Brush the inside of each sheet with 1 1/2 teaspoons of olive oil.

Season each chicken breast with 1/2 teaspoon of Essence, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon of white pepper.  Place one chicken breast in the center of each sheet, and top with 1/2 cup each of leeks, carrots, and celery.  Lightly season the vegetables with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.  Pour 1 tablespoon of wine over each chicken breast.

Fold the parchment paper over the chicken and vegetables, and seal by making small folds in the paper, turning the pouch slightly after each fold.  Continue on all sides until the pouch is well sealed.  Place the pouches on a baking sheet and bake until expanded like a balloon, about 25 to 30 minutes.

To make the Carrot Jus, in a small saucepan combine the carrot juice, cayenne, allspice, ginger and remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  Place the pan over medium heat, and bring to a gentle boil.  With a whisk, swirl the butter into the juice several pieces at a time.  If the jus separates, return it to a boil while whisking for a few seconds.

Remove the papillote packages from the oven and place on serving plates.  To serve, cut an "x" into each package and peel back the paper.  Pour the Carrot Jus over the chicken, garnish with the parsley, and serve with steamed rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  whole milk
     3/4           cup  fresh mint leaves - (packed)
  4                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  mint liqueur
                        = (recommended: creme de menthe)
  3             ounces  semisweet chocolate chips - (abt 1/2 cup)
                        = (or coarsely chopped chocolate bar)
                        === CHOCOLATE COOKIE CRUST ===
     1/2           cup  graham cracker crumbs
     3/4           cup  finely-ground chocolate sandwich cookies
                        = (chocolate cookie only,
                        cream stuffing removed)
  4        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                     egg white

In a medium saucepan, bring the cream, milk, and mint to a gentle boil.  Remove from the heat.

In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until thick.  Whisk 1 cup of the hot cream into the egg mixture.  In a slow, steady stream, gradually add the egg mixture to the pan of hot cream.  Cook over moderately-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 3 to 5 minutes.

Remove the pan from the heat and strain the mixture into a clean bowl through a fine mesh strainer.  Pour into a container and cover with waxed paper or plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to keep a skin from forming.  Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.

When cold, stir in the mint liqueur and chocolate chips.  Pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine, and churn and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.  When the ice cream has come together, transfer to the chocolate cookie crust and finish the ice cream pie, or transfer to an airtight container and place in the freezer until ready to use.

To Assemble Ice Cream Pie:  Place the piecrust in the freezer for at least 1 hour.  Remove the ice cream from the freezer and let sit at room temperature until soft enough to spread, 5 to 10 minutes.

Remove the crust from the freezer and unwrap.  Transfer the ice cream to the piecrust, filling to the top, and smooth with a spatula or the back of a spoon.  Place in the freezer until firm, and serve.

Chocolate Cookie Crust:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a bowl, combine all the ingredients in a bowl, except the egg white, and blend with a mixer.  Transfer to a 9-inch pie pan and spread across the bottom and up the sides using your fingers.  Place another 9-inch pie pan on top and firmly press against the contours of the pan to pack the crust down onto the pan.  (Some of the filling may spill over the edges of the pan.)

Bake until golden, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool.  Brush the crust with the egg white.  Refrigerate before using.  (Makes 1 (9-inch) crust)

This recipe yields 1 ice cream pie, about 8 servings.

            Chocolate Shortcakes With Fresh Berries And Cream

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              pints  fresh blackberries -- rinsed, drained
  1               pint  huckleberries
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  gin or kirsch
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  1              large  egg
     1/2           cup  cold milk
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  gin
                        Powdered sugar

In a large bowl combine the fruit, sugar and gin.  Marinate at room temperature for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Into a large bowl, sift the flour, cocoa, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Add the butter to the dry ingredients, and mix well with fingertips or a pastry blender to incorporate and the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the egg and milk, and mix just until the mixture comes together to form a sticky dough.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Drop the batter onto the sheet in 1/4-cup dollops, leaving 2 inches of space between each, and gently smooth with the back of a spoon.  Bake until a tester inserted into the middle comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes.

In a medium bowl, whip the cream to soft peaks.  Add the sugar and gin and whip until stiff peaks form.  Keep cold until ready to use.

Transfer the cakes to wire racks to cool.  Carefully split the shortcakes horizontally and place the bottom half on each of 6 dessert plates.  Top with a heaping tablespoon of berries and cream, then top with the remaining shortcake halves.  Top with the remaining berries and cream, and garnish by sifting powdered sugar over each serving.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Into a large bowl, sift the flour, cocoa, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Add the butter to the dry ingredients, and mix well with fingertips or a pastry blender to incorporate and the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the egg and milk, and mix just until the mixture comes together to form a sticky dough.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Drop the batter onto the sheet in 1/4-cup dollops, leaving 2 inches of space between each, and gently smooth with the back of a spoon.  Bake until a tester inserted into the middle comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes.

<DirT>
In a medium bowl, whip the cream to soft peaks.  Add the sugar and gin and whip until stiff peaks form.  Keep cold until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the cakes to wire racks to cool.  Carefully split the shortcakes horizontally and place the bottom half on each of 6 dessert plates.  Top with a heaping tablespoon of berries and cream, then top with the remaining shortcake halves.  Top with the remaining berries and cream, and garnish by sifting powdered sugar over each serving.  Serve immediately.

  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter
     1/2         pound  andouille -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1 1/2           cups  chopped yellow onions

                        Basic Cornbread, recipe follows
  3             slices  white or whole wheat bread -- torn 1/2" pieces
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
  1                cup  chicken stock - (to 2) -- as needed
                        === BASIC CORNBREAD ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- plus
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  1                cup  buttermilk
  1                     egg

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter a 13- by 9-inch baking dish and set aside.

In a large skillet, cook the sausage until brown and the fat is rendered, about 5 minutes.  Add onions, celery, bell peppers, and garlic, and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a large bowl to cool.

With your fingers, crumble the corn bread into the bowl, add bread, the green onions, parsley, and thyme, and mix well with your hands.  Add the salt, pepper, cayenne, and eggs, and mix well with your hands.  Add enough broth, 1/2 cup at a time, to moisten the dressing, being careful not to make it mushy.

Transfer to the prepared dish and cover with aluminum foil.  Bake until heated through, about 25 minutes.  Uncover and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Basic Cornbread:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Pour 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil into a 9-inch baking pan or heavy cast iron skillet.  Place the pan into the oven as it preheats, allowing it to heat for at least 10 minutes.

Combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, and cayenne in a large mixing bowl and stir with a wooden spoon.  Add the buttermilk and egg to the mixture, and stir well to blend.  Pour the cornmeal batter into the preheated pan and bake in the oven for 25 minutes or until lightly golden brown.  Remove from the oven and let cool before serving or using in the dressing.  (Note: When making the dressing, make cornbread the day before.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  12             large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  mayonnaise

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  ground pork
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped yellow onion
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
     3/4           cup  whole milk
     1/4           cup  fine bread crumbs

In a large saute pan, add the pork and cook until no longer pink, about 3 minutes.  Add the onions and garlic, and cook for 1 minute.  Add the salt, pepper, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg and cook for 1 minute.  Add the milk and bread crumbs and cook for 3 minutes over medium heat, stirring to break up the meat.

Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pork is very tender and most of the liquid is evaporated, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Remove the lid and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is thick and all the liquid is evaporated, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Transfer to a decorative bowl or several smaller ramekins, smoothing the top with a rubber spatula.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled and firm, at least 4 hours or overnight.  Serve with thinly sliced French bread or toasted French bread croutons.

This recipe yields about 2 cups for 4 to 6 servings.

                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  water

  1              pinch  cayenne
                        === EGG FU YUNG ===
  1                cup  shredded cooked chicken or pork
     1/2           cup  bean sprouts
     1/2           cup  finely-sliced celery
     1/2           cup  finely-sliced yellow onions
     1/2           cup  finely-sliced mushrooms
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped green onions

  1                cup  masa flour
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
                        Creole Seasoning -- to taste
  6               cups  Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes -- hot, (see recipe)
  2               cups  Emerilís Homemade Worcestershire Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a small bowl, combine the oil and Creole Seasoning.  Mix well.  Spread each side of the steaks completely with the Creole seasoning mixture.  Place in a shallow pan, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Remove and bring the room temperature before grilling, about 30 minutes.

Preheat the grill and fryer.  Place the steaks on the grill and cook for about 4 to 6 minutes on each side for medium-rare.  Remove from the grill and let rest for a couple of minutes before serving.

Season the oysters with Creole seasoning.  In a mixing bowl, combine the flours.  Season with Creole seasoning.  Dredge the oysters in the seasoned flour, coating completely.  Fry in batches until crispy and golden.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with Creole seasoning.

Place the steaks and potatoes on each serving plate.  Spoon a quarter of the Worcestershire sauce over each steak.  Pile the oysters on top of the steak.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BEEF BROTH ===
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
  2               cups  sliced yellow onions -- plus
  1                     yellow onion -- halved
  3                     star anise pods -- plus
  1              piece  star anise
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, smashed
  5             pounds  meaty beef bones
  2                     carrots -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh gingerroot
  1                     cinnamon stick -- broken in half
  2        tablespoons  whole black peppercorns
                        === TO ASSEMBLE THE PHO ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  12            ounces  rice vermicelli noodles
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce
     1/2         pound  beef sirloin -- very thinly sliced
  1                cup  thinly-sliced yellow onion
  2               cups  bean sprouts
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  4              small  red chiles -- sliced
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onion tops
                        Lime wedges -- as garnish

Preheat the grill.

In a large non-stick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the sliced onions and cook until just beginning to color, about 6 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Remove from the heat.

Press three star anise into the flesh of the halved onions and place on the grill.  Grill until blackened, about 8 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Add the bones to a large stockpot and cover with water by 2 inches and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes, skimming the top to remove any foam that forms on the surface.  Add grilled and sauteed onions, and the remaining ingredients, stir well, and simmer partly covered for at least 6 and up to 10 hours, adding more water as needed to keep the bones covered by 1-inch.  Strain through cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer.  Remove meat from bones and set aside.  Discard everything but the meat from the bones and the broth.

Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil, and heat enough vegetable oil in a large saucepan to come 4 inches up the sides.  Add half of the noodles to the water and boil until just tender, then drain in a colander.  Add the remaining noodles to the hot oil and fry briefly until golden brown and crisp, then transfer to paper towels to drain.

To make the Pho, bring the soup to a simmer, as needed, and add the fish sauce.  Transfer to a large tureen or pot that can be placed on the table and kept warm.  Drain the boiled noodles in a colander and divide among 6 soup bowls.  Divide the remaining ingredients and the reserved meat from the bones among the bowls and ladle the broth over each portion at the table.   Garnish with lime wedges and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1              pound  thin Chinese egg noodles
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  oyster sauce
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white or black pepper
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2                     soft-shelled crabs -- cleaned, lungs
                        removed, and quartered
     1/4         pound  calamari -- body sacs cut
                        into 1" pieces, tentacles trimmed
     1/4         pound  small peeled de-veined shrimp
     1/4         pound  bay scallops
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
     1/2           cup  half-inch slices green onion tops
  4             ounces  straw mushrooms -- wiped clean
  4             ounces  snow peas -- ends snapped,
                        and strings removed

Lightly grease a 9-inch round cake pan with peanut oil and set aside.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add the noodles and cook until just tender, about 4 minutes.  Drain and transfer to a large bowl.  Toss with the sesame oil, to coat lightly.  Place in the greased cake pan.

In a wok or large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the peanut oil over high heat to almost smoking.  Add the noodle cake and fry over medium-high heat, swirling occasionally to prevent the noodles from sticking.  Cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 6 minutes.  With a spatula, flip the noodle cake and brown the other side.  Remove from the wok and keep warm until ready to serve.

In a small bowl, combine the oyster sauce, soy sauce, cornstarch, salt, and pepper, and stir to dissolve the cornstarch.

In a wok or large saute pan, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the crab quarters, and cook, stirring for 30 seconds.  Add the calamari, shrimp and scallops and cook, stirring, until the shrimp are pink and the seafood is just cooked through, about 2 minutes.  Add the pepper flakes, green onions, mushrooms, and snow peas, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the oyster sauce mixture and cook until thickened.

Serve immediately over the noodle cake.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                          English Summer Pudding

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     loaf homemade style white bread -- crusts removed
                        = (such as challah or brioche)
  6               cups  assorted summer fruit - (to 8) -- see * Note,
                        rinsed well, drained, and large fruit,
                        strawberries/plums, halved, quartered
     1/2           cup  sugar - (to 1) -- depending on
                        sweetness of fruit, plus
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  ruby port or brandy
  1               pint  heavy cream

* Note:  Such as blueberries, strawberries, red currants, black currants, red or golden raspberries, and/or small plums.

Line a large bowl (about 6 to 8 cup capacity) with plastic wrap.  Cut the bread into diagonal halves and arrange them, puzzle-like, into the bottom and up the sides of the bowl.

In a large saucepan, heat the fruit, sweetening sugar and port and cook until the fruit is tender and beginning to burst, but still holds its shape, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool slightly.  Using a slotted spoon, spoon the fruit into the bread-lined bowl, and spoon most of the juices over the fruit.  Reserve the remaining cooking juices.

Top the fruit with a flat layer of the remaining bread, so that the fruit is completely covered.  Cover with the plastic wrap and place a plate over the top.  Add 2 heavy cans or a 2-pound weight to the plate and let sit at least 8 hours, or overnight, refrigerated.

In a large bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks just begin to form.  Add the 1/4-cup sugar and whip until almost stiff.

To serve, remove the weights and plate and unwrap.  Place a large serving plate on top of the bowl and gently invert.  Shake gently to release the pudding onto the plate and remove the plastic wrap.  Spoon the reserved fruit juices over the top and serve with sweetened whipped cream.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Line a large bowl (about 6 to 8 cup capacity) with plastic wrap.  Cut the bread into diagonal halves and arrange them, puzzle-like, into the bottom and up the sides of the bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large saucepan, heat the fruit, sweetening sugar and port and cook until the fruit is tender and beginning to burst, but still holds its shape, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool slightly.  Using a slotted spoon, spoon the fruit into the bread-lined bowl, and spoon most of the juices over the fruit.  Reserve the remaining cooking juices.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Top the fruit with a flat layer of the remaining bread, so that the fruit is completely covered.  Cover with the plastic wrap and place a plate over the top.  Add 2 heavy cans or a 2-pound weight to the plate and let sit at least 8 hours, or overnight, refrigerated.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks just begin to form.  Add the 1/4-cup sugar and whip until almost stiff.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, remove the weights and plate and unwrap.  Place a large serving plate on top of the bowl and gently invert.  Shake gently to release the pudding onto the plate and remove the plastic wrap.  Spoon the reserved fruit juices over the top and serve with sweetened whipped cream.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  vanilla ice cream
  1                cup  crushed frosted cornflakes
  1                cup  sweetened coconut flakes
                        = (or 1 cup chopped walnuts, or
                        one cup cookie crumbs)
  2              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Hot chocolate sauce -- (optional)
                        Whipped cream -- (optional)

With an ice cream scoop, form 4 large balls of ice cream.  Place on a waxed paper lined sheet and cover with plastic wrap.  Freeze for at least 2 hours.

In a bowl, combine the cornflake crumbs with either the coconut, walnuts or cookie crumbs (or any combination).  Spread the mixture in a shallow dish.

Dip the ice cream balls in the crumb mixture and freeze for 30 minutes.

In a bowl, beat the eggs and sugar.  Dip the coated ice cream balls into the eggs, then roll in the crumb mixture, coating completely.  Freeze for 1 hour.  (If necessary, or for a thicker crust, roll again in eggs and crumbs until the balls are completely coated.)

Heat the oil in a large pot or fryer to 400 degrees.  One at a time, lower the balls into the oil and fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Remove from the oil and place in a dessert bowl.  Drizzle with chocolate sauce and whipped cream, as desired.  Repeat with the remaining ice cream.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

  2          teaspoons  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low sodium chicken broth)
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh cilantro
  2             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  heavy cream

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a large non reactive container, combine lemon juice, orange juice, kosher salt, light brown sugar, yellow onions, oranges, jalapeÒos, cilantro, garlic, chili powder, ground cumin, and oregano with 1 gallon water and stir to dissolve the sugar and salt.

Put the turkey in a large colander and rinse under cold, running water, then add the turkey breast to the brine, cover, and refrigerate, turning occasionally, for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Remove the turkey from the brine and put it breast-side up in a large, heavy roasting pan and pat dry with paper towels.  Rub the turkey with vegetable oil and sprinkle both sides with Essence.  Roast until deep golden brown and an instant read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees, about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Transfer to a platter and let stand for 15 minutes before carving.

Poblano Chocolate Mole:  To roast the peppers, place them directly on the burners of a gas stove over medium heat and turn them frequently with tongs until all sides are charred black, 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternatively, the peppers can be roasted under a broiler or over a hot gas or charcoal grill.)  Transfer the peppers to a plastic or paper bag, seal the bag, and let cool for about 15 minutes.  Peel the peppers, remove the seeds and stems, and coarsely chop the flesh.

Roast the onion halves over medium heat, using the same procedure, until the cut surfaces are lightly charred and the onion is slightly softened, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.  Remove and discard the root ends from the onions; coarsely chop the onions.

Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the pistachios, pumpkinseeds, and pine nuts and cook, stirring occasionally, until the nuts are browned.  Add the peppers, onions, chili powder, garlic, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper and stir for 1 minute.  Add the chicken stock and cilantro and bring to a boil over high heat.

Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 45 minutes.  Add the chocolate and stir until melted.  Add the cream, stir well, and simmer for an additional 15 minutes.  Puree with an immersion blender.  Serve over the sliced turkey.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

<DirT>
In a large non reactive container, combine lemon juice, orange juice, kosher salt, light brown sugar, yellow onions, oranges, jalapeÒos, cilantro, garlic, chili powder, ground cumin, and oregano with 1 gallon water and stir to dissolve the sugar and salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the turkey in a large colander and rinse under cold, running water, then add the turkey breast to the brine, cover, and refrigerate, turning occasionally, for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the turkey from the brine and put it breast-side up in a large, heavy roasting pan and pat dry with paper towels.  Rub the turkey with vegetable oil and sprinkle both sides with Essence.  Roast until deep golden brown and an instant read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees, about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Transfer to a platter and let stand for 15 minutes before carving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Poblano Chocolate Mole:  To roast the peppers, place them directly on the burners of a gas stove over medium heat and turn them frequently with tongs until all sides are charred black, 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternatively, the peppers can be roasted under a broiler or over a hot gas or charcoal grill.)  Transfer the peppers to a plastic or paper bag, seal the bag, and let cool for about 15 minutes.  Peel the peppers, remove the seeds and stems, and coarsely chop the flesh.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast the onion halves over medium heat, using the same procedure, until the cut surfaces are lightly charred and the onion is slightly softened, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.  Remove and discard the root ends from the onions; coarsely chop the onions.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the pistachios, pumpkinseeds, and pine nuts and cook, stirring occasionally, until the nuts are browned.  Add the peppers, onions, chili powder, garlic, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper and stir for 1 minute.  Add the chicken stock and cilantro and bring to a boil over high heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 45 minutes.  Add the chocolate and stir until melted.  Add the cream, stir well, and simmer for an additional 15 minutes.  Puree with an immersion blender.  Serve over the sliced turkey.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  chorizo sausage -- removed from casings
                        and chopped
  1                can  chickpeas - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced onion
     1/4           cup  chopped red bell pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2                     fresh bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Snails/Escargot


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  18             large  button or crimini mushroom caps, 2" dia -- wiped clean
  3               cans  snails - (7 oz ea) -- well rinsed under
                        cold running water and drained
                        === GARLIC COMPOUND BUTTER ===
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- at room temperature
  4          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        === GOAT CHEESE, FENNEL AND BACON STUFFING
  4             slices  smoked bacon -- chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fennel
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
  4             ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
  1         tablespoon  bread crumbs
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  minced fresh thyme
  1              pinch  salt
                        Hot French bread -- for dipping

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Spread the mushrooms, stem-side up, on a baking sheet and roast for 5 minutes.  Turn and continue roasting until tender, about another 5 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool on the pan.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the butter, garlic, lemon, salt, pepper and cayenne on high speed for 30 seconds.  Transfer to a bowl and fold in the parsley.  Transfer to a sheet of plastic wrap and roll into a tight log, about 1-inch in diameter.  Refrigerate until hard, about 1 hour.

In a skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until beginning to brown and the fat is rendered, about 6 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Discard all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan.  Cook the fennel and onions in the fat until soft, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and spread on a plate to cool.

In a bowl combine the goat cheese with the bread crumbs, pepper, garlic, thyme and salt.  Add the cooled fennel-onion mixture and bacon, and mix well.  Re-season as needed with salt and pepper.

Place 6 small, round baking dishes on a baking sheet.  Place 3 mushroom caps, stem-sides up, flat in the bottom of each baking dish.  Place 1 snail inside each mushroom, and 3 snails in the dish between the mushrooms.  Top each mushroom cap with about 2 teaspoons of the goat cheese mixture.

Cut the compound butter log into thin slices and lay the slices across the baking dish, covering the snails and mushrooms.  Bake until bubbly, about 10 minutes.  Increase the heat to broil and cook until the cheese begins to turn golden brown around the edges, 1 to 2 minutes.

Carefully remove from the oven and serve immediately with hot French bread for dipping into the butter.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     sheets phyllo dough -- thawed
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1              pound  lamb sausage -- casings removed
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh oregano
  1                cup  crumbled feta - (abt 1/2 lb)

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

Lay the phyllo on the counter and cover with a damp kitchen cloth or damp paper towels.

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1/4 cup of the oil.  Add the lamb and cook, stirring, until no longer pink, about 3 minutes.  Add the onions, garlic, salt, Essence, pepper and nutmeg, and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the oregano, stir well, and transfer to a large bowl.  Add the cheese and mix well.

Place 4 sheets of phyllo on the counter in front of you, and re-cover the remaining sheets.  Brush the top sheet with 2 tablespoons of the oil.  With a knife, cut the sheets in half lengthwise and then in half again, leaving 4 piles of phyllo, each about 3-inches wide.  Working with 1 pile of phyllo, cover the remaining pieces.

Place about 1/4 cup of the filling along the bottom of the phyllo.  Bring up the bottom edge over the filling, then fold into a triangle (like folding a flag) to form a triangular package.  Tuck the ends under and seal with oil.

Repeat with the remaining phyllo and filling, placing the filled packages on the prepared baking sheet.  Bake until golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes.

Remove from the oven and serve 1 or 2 phyllo triangles per person.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh pasta sheets
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
  1                cup  olive oil

     1/2           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic

  1           teaspoon  turmeric
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  garam masala
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice

With a fork, prick holes in the chicken pieces.  Using a knife, cut diagonal slices 1-inch apart, and 1/2-inch deep into the larger pieces.  Place the chicken in a baking dish.

In a blender, combine the oil, onion, garlic, ginger, pepper, and process on high speed to a paste.  Add the paprika, salt, cumin, turmeric, coriander, garam masala, and cayenne, and process until well blended.  Add the yogurt and lemon juice, and process to a smooth sauce, scraping down the sides to combine all the ingredients.  Pour the marinade over the chicken.  Turn to coat evenly, rubbing the marinade into the holes and slits.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap, refrigerate for at least 4 hours, and up to 24 hours, turning occasionally.

Preheat a grill.

Remove the chicken from the marinade.  Place on the grill and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on the first side.  Turn, baste as needed, and cook on the second side for 8 to 10 minutes.  Turn and continue cooking, as necessary until the chicken is cooked through, but still tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.  (Alternately, bake in a preheated 425 degrees oven on a baking sheet for 35 minutes.)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  pomegranate juice
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  2                     shallots -- minced
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     oranges -- peeled, segmented
  1              small  red onion -- thinly sliced
  8             ounces  goat cheese -- cut crosswise
                        into 6 slices
  6                     thin slices prosciutto
  1              large  radicchio head -- rinsed, patted dry,
                        and torn bite sized pieces
  1              bunch  arugula or watercress -- rinsed, patted dry,
                        and cut bite sized pieces
  6              large  Bibb lettuce leaves -- rinsed, patted dry
  1                     Belgian endive head -- stem removed,
                        and cut crosswise into thin shreds
                        Pomegranate seeds -- as garnish

In a small bowl, combine the pomegranate juice and orange zest, vinegar, shallots, salt, pepper and mustard and whisk thoroughly to combine.  Add the oil in a steady stream and whisk until emulsified.  Fold the segmented oranges and sliced onions into 1/4 cup of the dressing and toss to combine and set aside.

Wrap each slice of goat cheese in a slice of prosciutto.  Heat a large skillet over medium high heat.  Add the wrapped cheeses and sear on both sides.  Remove from the heat.

In a large salad bowl, combine the greens.  Add the marinated orange sections and onion slices, and toss gently with enough extra dressing to coat evenly.  Divide among salad plates and top each with a seared goat cheese package and a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds.  Spoon a little extra dressing over each salad and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  Jerusalem artichokes
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  8             ounces  button mushrooms

  3             pounds  very ripe tomatoes -- seeded, quartered
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  3        tablespoons  vodka
                        === CRABMEAT TIMBALES ===
  1              pound  jumbo lump crabmeat -- picked over
                        for shells and cartilage
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh tarragon
  1           teaspoon  minced chives
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4           cup  finely-diced zucchini -- green part only
     1/4           cup  finely-diced yellow squash -- yellow part only
     1/4           cup  finely-diced red pepper
  4          teaspoons  thinly-sliced fresh basil leaves

Place the tomatoes in a food processor and pulse to chop, not puree.  Season with the salt and white pepper.  Place in a large piece of cheesecloth and draw up the ends to form a tight package.  Hang over a bowl overnight in the refrigerator.

Discard the tomatoes.  (If the tomato juice is not perfectly clear, strain through a coffee filter.)  Stir in the vodka and adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.

Combine the crabmeat, parsley, tarragon, chives, extra-virgin olive oil, salt, and white pepper in a medium bowl, and mix gently.

Place a 1/2-cup ring mold (or 3-inch diameter ring) in the center of a shallow, rimmed soup bowl.  Stuff 1/2 cup of the crabmeat mixture into the mold, and ladle 1/2 cup of the tomato water into the bowl.  Remove the ring mold, and garnish the rim of the bowl with 1 tablespoon each of the zucchini, squash, and red bell pepper.  Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the basil in the broth and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  French green lentils
  3              whole  garlic cloves -- smashed
  2                     bay leaves
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
     1/2         pound  thick-cut bacon -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/4"-thk strips
  1                     carrot -- finely chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  7          teaspoons  red wine vinegar
  2                     plum tomatoes -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3               cups  frisee
  3               cups  arugula
  4             ounces  crumbled goat cheese

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a medium saucepan, combine the lentils, garlic, bay leaves, and thyme.  Cover with water by 1-inch, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until just tender yet still firm, 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain and discard the garlic, bay leaves, and thyme.  Place the lentils in a large bowl and set aside.

In a skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until crisp.  Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels, leaving 3 tablespoons of fat in the pan.  Add the carrots, celery, shallots and garlic, and cook until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the vegetables to the bowl with the lentils.  Add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, and 4 teaspoons of the vinegar, tomatoes, parsley, Essence, salt and pepper, and toss to mix well.

In a separate bowl, combine the frisee, arugula and bacon.  In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 3 teaspoons of red wine vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Toss the dressing with the greens and divide among 4 plates.  Top with the lentil salad and the goat cheese.  Serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

       Lobster, Leek And Corn Risotto With Mussels, Oysters, Dulse

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     live lobsters - (1 1/2 lbs ea)
  6               cups  lobster or shrimp stock
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2                     leeks -- well rinsed,
                        and thinly sliced - (abt 2 cups)
  1 1/2           cups  fresh white corn kernels - (abt 2 ears)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  Arborio rice
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1              dozen  mussels -- cleaned, debearded
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
  1              dozen  oysters, shucked
     1/4           cup  dulse flakes (dried seaweed)
  8                     chive stalks -- for garnish

Place the lobsters in a large pot of boiling salted water and cook until cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove and drain in a colander.  Rinse under cold running water and drain.  When cool enough to handle, remove the tail meat, and chop into 1/2-inch pieces.  Remove the claw meat and set aside whole.

In a large, heavy saucepan, bring the stock to a simmer.  Remove from the heat, cover and keep warm until needed.

In a heavy pot, heat the oil and butter over medium-high heat.  Add the leeks and cook, stirring, until begin to soften, about 5 minutes.  Add the corn, garlic, salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until the leeks are soft but not brown and the corn is tender, about 3 minutes.  Add the rice and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the wine and simmer, stirring, until absorbed, about 2 minutes.  Add the hot stock 1/2 cup at a time, and cook, stirring constantly, until each addition of stock is nearly completely absorbed.

Continue until all of the stock has been added and the risotto is creamy.  During the last addition of the stock, add the mussels and cook until they open and the risotto is at the right consistency.  (It will take about 20 to 25 minutes to add all of the stock and for the risotto to reach the right consistency.)  Stir in the cream, oysters and reserved lobster tail meat and cook for 2 minutes.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Divide the risotto among 4 serving plates.  Garnish each with 1 lobster claw and 1 tablespoon of dulse.  Arrange 2 chive stalks across each bowl and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  3               cups  fresh lime juice - (abt 20 to 24 limes)
  1                cup  high-quality tequila
                        = (recommended: Cuervo Gold or Encantado)
     1/2           cup  orange liqueur
                        = (recommended: Cointreau or Triple Sec)
     1/2           cup  bitter orange liqueur
                        = (recommended: Blue Curacao)
     1/2           cup  coarse sugar crystals -- for garnish
  4                     thin slices lime
  2          teaspoons  fine lime zest

In a heavy medium saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low, stir, and simmer until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool slightly.

In a large bowl, combine the syrup with the lime juice, tequila, orange liqueur and bitter orange liqueur, and whisk well.  Pour into a rectangular freezer-proof container and freeze just until ice crystals begin to uniformly form, about 2 hours.

Remove from the freezer and scrape the mixture with a fork to break up the crystals.  Return to the freezer and freeze for 30 minutes.  Remove again from the freezer and scrape, then return to the freezer.  Continue the scraping/freezing process another 3 times, for a total of 4 hours.  (If not serving after 4 hours, tightly cover with plastic wrap and freeze until ready to serve.)

To serve, place the sugar crystals on a plate.  Dip the rims of 4 tall, stemmed glasses in water and then into the sugar to form a crust.  Divide the Margarita Ice between the glasses.  Garnish each rim with a lime slice, sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of lime zest, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields about 1 quart for 4 servings.

     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
     3/4           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
                        === SALMON SALAD ===
  8             ounces  cured salmon
  6              large  hard-boiled eggs
  1         tablespoon  capers -- finely minced
  1           teaspoon  caper juice/brine
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise - (to 1/2)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                     tin Beluga caviar - (7 oz)
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

For the Corn Cakes:  Heat the olive oil in a medium-size saute pan over medium heat.  Add the corn, shallots, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and the black pepper and cook, stirring, until the corn and shallots are tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Combine the eggs and cream in a large mixing bowl and whisk to blend well.  Add the cornmeal, flour, masa harina, baking powder, cayenne, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the water.  Mix well.  Fold in the corn-and-shallot mixture.

Heat 1/2 teaspoon of the oil in a large nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat.  When the oil is hot, but not smoking, gently drop the batter, a tablespoon at a time, into the pan.  You can cook about eight cakes at a time.  Cook until the cakes are lightly golden on both sides, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side.  Repeat until all of the oil and the batter are used up.

For the Salmon Salad:  Chop the salmon into small pieces.  Chop the eggs and add to the salmon.  Add the capers and caper juice.  Mix well.  Stir in enough mayonnaise to desired consistency.  Mix well.  Season with salt and pepper.  Drain the cakes on paper towels.  Sprinkle with the Essence.

To assemble, spread a tablespoon of the salmon salad over each corn cake.  Place on a large platter.  Top the salmon with the caviar.  Garnish with chives.

This recipe yields 32 hors d'oeuvres servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4         pound  fresh figs -- stemmed, peeled,
                        and roughly chopped
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  champagne vinegar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  canola oil
  6               cups  mixed baby greens -- washed, spun dry
  2                     very ripe tomatoes -- sliced
  3             ounces  myzithra (hard sheep's milk cheese) -- cut very thin
                        curls or slices
                        = (or use dry jack cheese)

In an 8-inch non-stick skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the figs, and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is evaporated, 4 to 5 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a blender, and add the honey, balsamic and champagne vinegars, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.  Blend on high speed for 30 seconds.  With the machine running, slowly add the oil, and blend until completely incorporated.  Cool completely before serving.

In a large bowl, combine the baby greens and tomatoes.  Toss with 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Divide the salad evenly between 4 plates, being sure that each has 4 tomato slices, and top with the cheese slices.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CANOLA OIL PIE CRUST ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
     1/4           cup  canola oil
  2        tablespoons  cold milk
  2        tablespoons  ice water -- more or less
                        === BERRY FILLING ===
  2               cups  mixed berries
                        = (Saskatoon berries, huckleberries,
                        blueberries, blackberries, and currants)
  3                     nectarines -- pitted, sliced
                        = (abt 1 3/4 cups)
     1/4           cup  sugar - (to 1/3) -- plus
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream or milk

Into a medium bowl sift together the flour, sugar, and salt.  Stir in the oil and mix with a fork or pastry blender until the size of peas.  Stir in the milk and mix until begins to form a dough.  Stir in enough water to form a smooth ball.  Flatten into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap.  Allow to rest refrigerated for 20 to 45 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a large bowl, toss the berries and nectarines with 1/4 cup of the sugar and the lemon zest.  Let sit 3 minutes, then taste to determine if more sugar is needed, adding more as needed.  Add the cornstarch and mix well.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a large circle, about 10-inches across.  Transfer to a baking sheet.  Spread the fruit filling into the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch border around the edge.  Fold the edges over the filling, overlapping the dough into folds.  With a pastry brush, brush the cream onto the dough border and sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons of sugar on top.

Bake until the dough is golden brown and the fruit is bubby, about 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on the baking sheet for at least 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        === CRUST ===
  25                    graham crackers -- broken into pieces
                        = (or 3 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs)
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)

                        === BUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING ===
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  2 1/4           cups  milk
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  water -- plus
     1/4           cup  water
  1            package  powdered unflavored gelatin -- abt 2 1/2 tspns
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  cornstarch - (packed)
                        === CHOCOLATE GANACHE ===
  6             ounces  quality semi-sweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        === MOUSSE ===
  8             ounces  semi-sweet chocolate -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2               cups  chilled heavy cream -- divided
  2        tablespoons  Cognac or brandy
     1/4           cup  confectioners' sugar
                        === TOP OF PARFAIT ===
  1                cup  chilled heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  Cognac or brandy
                        Dark chocolate curls

Equipment:  A 9- by 3 1/2-inch spring form pan and a large pastry bag

To make the crust:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Pulse the graham crackers and brown sugar in a food processor to a fine crumb.  Melt the butter in a small saucepan, add it to the crumb mixture, and pulse until just combined.  Pour the mixture into the spring form pan and press it firmly along the bottom and all the way up the sides of the pan to make an even crust.  Bake until the crust browns, about 15 minutes.  Cool and refrigerate while making the Butterscotch Pudding.

To make the Butterscotch Pudding:  In a small medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Whisk in the dark brown sugar and cook, stirring, until melted and bubbly.  Gradually add in the heavy cream and stir over low heat until the butterscotch is dissolved.  Whisk in the milk and salt.  Remove from the heat and set aside until lukewarm.  Pour the 2 tablespoons of water into a small bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over the top, do not stir.  Set aside to let the gelatin bloom.

In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and the remaining 1/4 cup water.  Stir the cornstarch mixture into the butterscotch mixture.  Cook, stirring constantly, over medium-high heat until the mixture thickens.  Reduce the heat to low; stir briskly, and bring to a simmer and cook for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and stir in the gelatin mixture and vanilla.  Whisk until smooth.  Cover the surface of the pudding with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator while you make the Ganache.

To make the Ganache:  Put the 6 ounces of chocolate in a medium bowl.  In a small saucepan, bring the cream and butter to a boil over high heat.  Pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate; set it aside for 5 minutes before whisking until smooth.

Pour the chocolate ganache into the chilled crust; then swirl the pan so the ganache evenly covers the sides and bottom of the crust.  Set the crust aside at room temperature while you make the chocolate mousse.

To make the Mousse:  Put the 8 ounces of chocolate in a large bowl.  In a small saucepan, bring 1/2 cup of the cream, the brandy, and vanilla to a boil over medium-high heat.  Pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate; set it aside for 5 minutes before whisking until smooth.  Cool the chocolate mixture to room temperature, whisking occasionally.

In a large bowl, beat the remaining 1 1/2 cups cream until it holds a soft peak.  Sift the sugar over the cream, and continue beating until slightly thicker; take care not to over whip the cream.  Fold a third of the whipped cream into the chocolate to lighten the mixture.  Fold in the remaining cream.

To assemble the Parfait Pie:  Pour the pudding into the prepared crust and smooth the top with a spatula.  Pour the chocolate mousse on top of the pudding, smooth the top if needed.  Refrigerate until set, about 6 hours.  In a medium bowl whip the cream and brandy until it holds a soft peak.  Spoon dollops of the whipped cream over the chocolate to cover and decorate with the chocolate shavings.  Carefully remove the spring form ring.  Transfer the Parfait Pie to a cake stand and serve.  Cut with a warm serrated knife.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Equipment:  A 9- by 3 1/2-inch spring form pan and a large pastry bag
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the crust:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pulse the graham crackers and brown sugar in a food processor to a fine crumb.  Melt the butter in a small saucepan, add it to the crumb mixture, and pulse until just combined.  Pour the mixture into the spring form pan and press it firmly along the bottom and all the way up the sides of the pan to make an even crust.  Bake until the crust browns, about 15 minutes.  Cool and refrigerate while making the Butterscotch Pudding.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Butterscotch Pudding:  In a small medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Whisk in the dark brown sugar and cook, stirring, until melted and bubbly.  Gradually add in the heavy cream and stir over low heat until the butterscotch is dissolved.  Whisk in the milk and salt.  Remove from the heat and set aside until lukewarm.  Pour the 2 tablespoons of water into a small bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over the top, do not stir.  Set aside to let the gelatin bloom.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and the remaining 1/4 cup water.  Stir the cornstarch mixture into the butterscotch mixture.  Cook, stirring constantly, over medium-high heat until the mixture thickens.  Reduce the heat to low; stir briskly, and bring to a simmer and cook for 1 minute.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  dried active yeast
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  warm water -- abt 110 degrees
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- plus more as
                        needed while kneading
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  clarified butter -- plus
  1           teaspoon  clarified butter
                        = (or use vegetable oil)

In a glass-measuring cup, combine the yeast and sugar.  Add the water and stir well.  Let rest until foamy, about 5 minutes.

Sift together the flour and salt into a large bowl.  Make a well in the center of the flour and pour the yeast mixture and oil into the center.  Mix together with your fingers until a smooth dough forms, working in a small amount of additional flour as needed.  Knead for 3 minutes.

Oil a small bowl with the remaining butter or oil.  Place the dough into the bowl, turning to coat, and let rest until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Divide the dough into 6 pieces and gently roll into 6 circles on a lightly floured surface.  Bake on a baking stone, or a lightly greased baking sheet, until just golden brown and puffed, about 12 minutes.

Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIECRUST ===
  8             ounces  flour
                        = (abt 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tbspns)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4             ounces  cold butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  3        tablespoons  ice water
                        === PARMESAN AND SPINACH PIE ===
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped pancetta or bacon
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  2             pounds  spinach -- rinsed, blanched,
                        and finely chopped
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  grated nutmeg
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  1 1/2           cups  grated Parmesan
  1         tablespoon  melted unsalted butter
                        Aged balsamic vinegar

For the crust:  Into a large bowl, sift the flour and salt.  Add the butter pieces and shortening and work them into the flour by hand until the dough starts to come together and form small pea shapes.  Work the ice water into the dough 1 tablespoon at a time with your fingers until it just comes together, being careful not to over mix.  Form the crust into a disk shape, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to rest for at least 30 minutes before rolling out.

Brush the bottom and sides of a 10-inch springform pan with the butter and set aside.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

To make the filling, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the pancetta and cook until just crisp, about 2 minutes.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the spinach, salt, pepper, and nutmeg, mix well, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Add the egg and cheese, and mix well.  Let cool.

Divide the dough into 2 portions, one about 2/3 and the other 1/3 of the dough.  Roll each portion on a lightly floured surface into a thin round.  Press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared pan.  Fill with the cooled spinach mixture, and top with the smaller round of dough, pressing firmly to seal the filling.

With a sharp knife, cut slits into the top crust and brush with the melted butter.  Bake until the crust is golden and the filling is set, about 40 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.  Serve with aged balsamic vinegar.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

     1/2          head  cauliflower - (abt 1 lb) -- cut into flowerets,
                        blanched in salted water until tender
     1/2         bunch  broccoli - (abt 1/2 lb) -- cut into flowerets,
                        blanched in salted water until tender
  1                     fennel bulb -- trimmed, cored,
                        cut lengthwise 1/2" wedges, blanched in
                        salted water until tender
  2          teaspoons  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     1/2           cup  flour
     3/4           cup  warm water
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              large  egg - plus
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten together
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/3         pound  minced prosciutto

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Pat dry the vegetables and place on a baking sheet.  Season lightly with the Essence.

Put the water in a medium bowl.  Little by little, using a fork, gradually beat the flour into the water.  Add 1/2 cup of the grated Parmesan and 1/4 teaspoon of salt and stir well to combine.  Add the beaten egg and egg yolk and mix well.

In a large heavy skillet, heat enough oil to come 1/4-inch up the sides of the pan to 350 degrees.  In batches, lightly coat the vegetables in the batter.  Carefully transfer to the hot oil and fry, turning to brown evenly, being careful not to add too many pieces at once.

Transfer to paper towels to drain, and season with salt.  Sprinkle lightly with the remaining grated Parmesan and the minced prosciutto.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 appetizer portions.

Put the water in a medium bowl.  Little by little, using a fork, gradually beat the flour into the water.  Add 1/2 cup of the grated Parmesan and 1/4 teaspoon of salt and stir well to combine.  Add the beaten egg and egg yolk and mix well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9               cups  well-flavored beef broth
  1 1/2           cups  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/2           cup  fine dry bread crumbs
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1                     lemon -- zested, juiced
  3              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh marjoram
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh oregano

In a large saucepan, bring the beef broth to a slow boil.  In a bowl, combine 1 cup of the Parmesan cheese, the bread crumbs, nutmeg and lemon zest and juice and make a well in the center.  Add the eggs to the well and slowly incorporate into the dry ingredients, until it comes together and resembles cooked polenta.  (If the mixture is too thin, add a bit more grated cheese and bread crumbs.)

Transfer the cheese mixture to a food mill fitted with the large die.  Hold the food mill as high above the steaming broth as possible, and turn the handle so that the Parmesan mixture is forced through the mill into the slowly boiling broth.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes without stirring.  Remove from the heat and let sit 5 minutes.  Ladle into soup bowls and top each with a sprinkling of fresh herbs and the remaining grated cheese.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  unsalted butter
  2          teaspoons  ground toasted walnuts -- plus
  1         tablespoon  chopped toasted walnuts
  1           teaspoon  flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  flour
     1/2                celery stalk -- very thinly sliced
  1              large  pear -- peeled, cored,
                        and diced
     1/2           cup  whole milk -- scalded
  2        tablespoons  Muscat de Beaune de Venise
                        = (or other sweet, late-harvest wine)
  3              large  egg yolks
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  crumbled Stilton
  3        tablespoons  grated Gruyere
  4              large  egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
                        === PEAR COMPOTE ===
  1 1/2           cups  Muscat de Beaune de Venise
                        = (or other late-harvest white wine)
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                     whole clove
  2             pounds  pears -- peeled, cored,
                        and diced

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Generously butter 6 (1/2-cup) ramekins with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the butter.  Combine the ground walnuts and 1 teaspoon flour in a small bowl.  Sprinkle the dish with the walnut-flour mixture, and knock out the excess.  Set aside.

Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a large, heavy saucepan over high heat.  Add the celery, chopped walnuts, and pear, and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the remaining flour and cook, stirring constantly, until foamy and slightly thick, 2 minutes.  Whisk in the hot milk and wine, and cook, whisking constantly, until smooth and thick, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Mix egg yolks, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.  Add the egg yolks to the sauce, and whisk well to blend.  Fold in the Stilton and Gruyere.

Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar in a large clean bowl until stiff but not dry.  Fold one-third of the whites into the egg yolk mixture to lighten.  Fold in the remaining whites, being careful not to overmix.  Divide the souffle mixture among the 6 prepared dishes.

Place the souffles on a baking sheet and place in the oven.  Reduce the heat to 375 degrees and bake until puffed, golden and gently set in center, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Spoon Pear Compote over each and serve immediately.

Pear Compote:  In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the wine, sugar, and clove over medium-high heat.  Cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves.  Add the pears and simmer until tender, about 5 minutes.  Transfer the pears to a medium bowl.  Bring the liquid to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and discard the clove.  Pour the syrup over the pears and let cool to room temperature.  Serve with the Pear, Stilton, and Walnut Souffles.  (Makes about 1 cup)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  fish stock
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine
  6             slices  lemon
  4              whole  black peppercorns
  1              slice  yellow onion
  1                     bay leaf
  1              sprig  thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne
  1                     Arctic Char fillet - (2 to 2 1/2 lbs)
     3/4         pound  fiddlehead ferns -- rinsed, trimmed
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  chopped shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1              pound  chanterelle mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and tough ends removed, quartered
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley

In a large, deep skillet or sautÈ pan, combine the fish stock, wine, lemon, peppercorns, onion slice, bay leaf, thyme, salt and cayenne and bring to a gentle boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add the fish skin-side down, cover, and poach at a simmer until just cooked through, about 8 minutes.

While the fish is cooking, bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the fiddlehead ferns and blanch until just tender, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Drain in a colander and shock in an ice bath.  Drain on paper towels.

In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and garlic, and cook for 1 minute.  Add the mushrooms, salt, pepper and thyme, and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the wine and chicken stock, and simmer, stirring, until the liquid has almost evaporated, 4 minutes.  Add the fiddlehead ferns and parsley and cook over high heat until warmed through, about 1 to 2 minutes.

Remove the fish from the poaching liquid and place on a serving platter.  Spoon the fiddlehead fern-chaterelle mixture over the fish and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  water
     1/2      teaspoon  white vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3              large  eggs

Bring 3 cups of water to a boil with the vinegar and salt in a small saucepan over high heat.

Crack an egg into a cup and slide the egg gently into the water.  Crack another egg into the cup and while the water returns to a boil, slide this egg into the water as well.  Repeat with the third egg.  When the water returns to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the eggs are set.  Watch carefully and remove the eggs when the yolks are still soft, about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.  (Test by lifting an egg slightly out of the water on a slotted spoon and gently pressing the center with your finger; the yolk should be soft and the white firm.)

Drain on paper towels.  Poached eggs can be made ahead and immersed in a bowl of water in the refrigerator.  Reheat by immersing briefly in simmering water.

This recipe yields 1 to 3 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  pork loin or butt -- removed from the
                        bone and diced
     1/2         pound  pork fat
     1/4         pound  veal
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  1                     garlic head -- peeled, minced
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped green onions
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  mustard seeds
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     feet hog casings -- (optional)
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        === POLISH HONEY ONION SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  4               cups  thinly-sliced yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  beef or chicken stock
  6        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  Creole mustard
                        = (or other spicy whole grain mustard)
  2        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Pass the pork, pork fat, and veal through a food grinder fitted with a coarse die.  Place the meat in a large bowl and combine with the remaining ingredients, except the oil.  Mix well by hand.  Heat a teaspoon of oil in a small skillet, and cook about 2 teaspoons of the mixture to test the seasoning.  Adjust seasonings, to taste.

With the sausage attachment on a mixer, stuff the casings, if being used.  Twist and tie off to make 4-inch sausages.  (Alternately, shape into patties.)

Heat a large pot of vegetable oil to 360 degrees.  With a sharp fork, prick each sausage twice, then carefully ease in batches into the hot oil.  Cook until cooked through and golden brown, turning, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Serve with Polish Honey sauce.

Polish Honey Onion Sauce:  In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until caramelized, about 15 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Cook, stirring, occasionally, until reduced by 1/2.  Add the honey, mustard and vinegar, and reduce heat to medium-low.  Simmer until thickened, about 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool for at least 10 minutes before serving with the sausages.  (Makes 1 cup)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                        = (or anchos or poblanos)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped white onion
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced seeded jalapeÒo pepper
  2          teaspoons  dried Mexican oregano
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-sodium chicken broth)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro

Place pork butt, yellow onions, cumin, bay leaves, Mexican oregano, salt, black peppercorns and cayenne in a large saucepan and cover with water by 1-inch.  Bring to a boil.

Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 45 minutes, skimming the surface to remove any scum that forms.  Drain in a colander.

Shred the drained pork and return to the pot.  Add the Chile Verde and stir well.  Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until heated through.  Serve hot with tortillas and other desired condiments.

Chile Verde:  Roast the peppers by placing them on an open gas flame, turning them frequently with tongs until all sides are charred black, about 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternately, the peppers can be roasted under a broiler, or on top of a gas or charcoal grill.)  Place the blackened peppers in a plastic or paper bag, and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.  Peel the peppers, and remove the seeds and the stems.  Chop the peppers and set aside.

In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until tender, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, jalapeÒos, oregano, salt, and cumin, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the flour and cook, stirring, without allowing to color, for 2 minutes.  Add the chopped peppers, and stir well to combine.  Add the chicken stock, stir well, and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.

Remove the chile verde from the heat, add the cilantro, and adjust seasoning, to taste.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  3          teaspoons  olive oil
     2/3           cup  chopped yellow onion
  3             ounces  finely-chopped pancetta
  2          teaspoons  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note

  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh oregano
  1 1/3           cups  ricotta
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan -- plus additional
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan, if desired -- for garnish
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  1                     box cannelloni - (8 oz)
                        = (or manicotti shells)

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

For the Sauce:  Heat the olive oil in large pot over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, Essence, salt and red pepper, and sautÈ until the onions are soft, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the garlic and sautÈ for 30 seconds.  Add the wine and reduce by 1/2.  Add the tomatoes and their juices, the basil, thyme, oregano and bay leaves and bring to boil.

Reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce has thickened somewhat, but is still chunky, about 45 minutes.  Add the cream and simmer for 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Discard the bay leaves, adjust the seasoning, to taste, and let sit while making the filling.

For the Cannelloni:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat the olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, pancetta, Essence, salt, and red pepper and cook until the onions are soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and saute for 30 seconds.  Add the tomato paste and wine, and stir well to incorporate.  Cook until half of the wine has evaporated, about 2 minutes.  Add the shrimp and cook until just pink, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the basil and oregano, stir well, and remove from the heat.  Spread the mixture onto a baking sheet or large plate to cool quickly.

In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan, the shrimp mixture and egg.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.

Butter a 13- by 9-inch baking dish.  Spread about 1 cup of the tomato sauce over the bottom of the dish.  Working from both ends, using a pastry bag, stuff each manicotti shell with about 1/4 cup of filling and place on the tomato sauce.  Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling, lining up in rows in the pan.

Pour the remaining sauce over the cannelloni and cover tightly with foil.  Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Uncover and continue baking until golden brown and bubbling, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving.

If desired, sprinkle each serving with additional grated Parmesan.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

     1/4           cup  olive oil
  10             large  yellow onions -- thinly sliced
                        = (abt 12 to 14 cups)
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar
  4          teaspoons  minced fresh thyme
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  red wine vinegar -- or to taste
     1/2           cup  water

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Remove the meat from the rabbits, tear or cut into small pieces, and set aside.  Discard the bones or reserve for another use.

In a large saute pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, celery and bell peppers, and cook until soft, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the mushrooms, salt and 1 teaspoon of the pepper and Essence and cook, stirring, until soft and they have given up their liquid, about 6 minutes.  Add the brandy and stir to deglaze the pan.  Add the bacon, and fat back, and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the veal stock and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool completely.

In a large bowl, combine the rabbit meat, cooled onion mixture, garlic, cumin, chili powder, kosher salt, remaining teaspoon of pepper, basil, oregano and thyme.  Stir well to mix.  Tightly cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 6 hours, or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Line a 12- by 3- by 4-inch terrine with plastic wrap.  Bring a kettle of water to the boil.

In a small bowl, beat the egg with the heavy cream.  Add the bread and soak until dissolved.  Combine with the rabbit mixture.

In 2 batches in a food processor (or with a meat grinder, or the grinder attachment on a mixer), pulse to grind the rabbit mixture to a coarse texture.  Pour into the prepared terrine and cover with the plastic wrap.  Wrap the terrine with a second sheet of plastic, and then tightly in heavy aluminum foil to make airtight.

Place the terrine in a medium roasting pan and transfer to the middle rack of the oven.  Pour the hot water into the pan, reaching halfway up the sides of the terrine.  Bake until the terrine is cooked through, 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours.

Carefully remove the pan from the oven and remove the terrine from the pan.  Unwrap the foil to allow the terrine to cool to room temperature, or refrigerate before slicing and serving with the Onion Marmalade.

Onion Marmalade:  In a large, regular surface (not non-stick) saute pan, heat the oil over high heat.  Add the onions, sugar, thyme, salt and pepper, and saute until starting to caramelize, about 10 minutes.  As the onions caramelize, add the vinegar and water in stages, stirring and scraping the edges of the pan, until the onions are very soft and completely caramelized, about 30 minutes.

Remove from the heat and cool at least 15 minutes before serving with the terrine.  (Makes about 3 cups)

This recipe yields 1 terrine, 8 to 10 servings

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Basic Sweet Piecrust -- (see below)
  2             pounds  fresh rhubarb -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1"-thk pieces
  2             pounds  Macintosh apples - (6 to 8 apples) -- cored, peeled,
                        and each cut 12 equal slices
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  apple, cherry, or grape brandy
  1                cup  bleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  chopped walnuts
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" pieces,
                        and chilled
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        === BASIC SWEET PIECRUST ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  solid vegetable shortening
  6        tablespoons  ice cold water - (to 7)

Preheat the oven to 370 degrees.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured surface.  Roll out the dough on the floured surface into an 11-inch round about 1/8-inch thick.  Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie pan.  Trim off any overhanging dough to make a 1/2-inch wide overhang around the edge of the pan.  Flute the edges of the dough with your fingertips.

In a large bowl, mix the rhubarb, apples, sugar, 1/2 cup of the brown sugar, the cornstarch, lemon juice, and brandy, and toss to coat the fruit evenly.  Pour the mixture into the piecrust.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, walnuts, remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and nutmeg and mix well with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Sprinkle evenly over the filling.

Bake until the top is golden brown and the juices are bubbling, 30 to 35 minutes.  Cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.

Basic Sweet Piecrust:  In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt.  Mix well.  Add the shortening and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the water and let sit 1 minute.  Using either a fork or your hands, carefully press the mixture together to form a soft ball.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

                        === TAWNY PORT GRAVY ===
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
                        Giblets and neck from the goose
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
     1/4           cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  chopped carrots
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  5                     bay leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  Tawny port
  2               cups  water
                        === GOOSE FAT ROASTED POTATOES ===
  2             pounds  fingerling potatoes
  2          teaspoons  salt -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  goose fat, or duck fat
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  fresh chopped rosemary
  5             sprigs  rosemary -- as garnish

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Combine 1/2 cup of the onions, celery, bell peppers, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the cayenne in a mixing bowl.  Remove any excess fat around the opening of the cavity of the goose.  Prick other fatty areas with a fork at intervals.  Do not prick the breast.  Stuff cavity of goose with vegetable mixture.  Season the outside of the goose with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, and the black pepper.  Place the goose in a large roasting pan and roast for about 1 hour and 45 minutes, or until the drumsticks and thighs are easy to remove.

Combine the remaining 1/2 cup onion, carrots, bay leaves, and port wine in a medium-sized sauce pan over medium heat and bring to a boil.  Cook over medium heat until the mixture thickens and reduces to about 1/2 cup, about 30 minutes.  Strain through a fine mesh strainer and let cool.

Using a pastry brush, glaze the goose with the port wine reduction, and return to the oven for 5 minutes to allow the glaze to caramelize and set.  Remove from the oven and let rest for 20 minutes before carving.  Serve with the Port Gravy, and Goose Fat-Roasted Potatoes.

Tawny Port Gravy:  In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the giblets and neck, and brown, stirring, 3 to 4 minutes.

Add the onions, celery, carrots, salt, pepper, bay leaves, and thyme and cook, stirring often, for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the flour and stir to combine.  Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes.

Add the wine, bring to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Add the water and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for about 1 hour.  Remove from the heat and strain into a clean container and keep warm until ready to serve.  (Makes about 2 cups)

Goose Fat Roasted Potatoes:  Scrub potatoes and place in a large pot.  Cover with cold water and add 1 teaspoon salt.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until just fork tender, 10 to 15 minutes.  Drain and cool under cold running water.  When completely cooled, slice them in half lengthwise, and place in a bowl.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Season the potatoes with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper.  Place a 12-inch, non-stick, ovenproof saute pan or skillet over medium-high heat and add the goose fat.

Once the fat is hot, add the seasoned potatoes to the saute pan, cut-side down.  Sear on the stovetop for 1 minute, then place the pan in the oven.  Roast for 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove the pan from the stove, and add the garlic and chopped rosemary.  Toss the potatoes in the pan to coat them and serve immediately garnished with the rosemary sprigs.  Makes 4 servings)

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheesecake

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  toasted bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  toasted pine nuts
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/2         pound  pepper jack cheese -- grated
     1/2         pound  queso blanco -- grated
  1              pound  cream cheese -- room temperature
  4                     eggs
  8                     fresh New Mexico green chiles -- roasted, peeled,
                        seeded, and chopped
  2                     jalapeÒos -- seeded, diced
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === CILANTRO PESTO ===
  2               cups  fresh cilantro leaves - (tightly packed)
     1/4           cup  lightly-toasted pine nuts
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
     1/4           cup  grated queso blanco
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  olive oil

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

To make the crust, place the bread crumbs, pine nuts, and butter in a food processor and process until thoroughly combined.  Press mixture into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan.  Set aside.

In the bowl, beat the pepper jack, queso fresco, and cream cheese until smooth.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after the addition of each.  Fold in the peppers, jalapeÒos, garlic, cilantro, salt, and pepper.  Pour mixture into the prepared pan and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, checking after 45 minutes.  (Cake should be golden and puffed, and just set in the center.)  Remove from the oven and cool completely on a rack before serving.

To make the Cilantro Pesto:  In a blender, combine the cilantro, pine nuts, and garlic, and puree on high speed.  Add the cheese, pepper, and salt, and process to combine.  Scrape the sides of the blender, and with the machine running, add the olive oil.  Blend until well combined.

To serve, drizzle the cheesecake with the Cilantro Pesto, slice, and serve.

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

In the bowl, beat the pepper jack, queso fresco, and cream cheese until smooth.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after the addition of each.  Fold in the peppers, jalapeÒos, garlic, cilantro, salt, and pepper.  Pour mixture into the prepared pan and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, checking after 45 minutes.  (Cake should be golden and puffed, and just set in the center.)  Remove from the oven and cool completely on a rack before serving.

To make the Cilantro Pesto:  In a blender, combine the cilantro, pine nuts, and garlic, and puree on high speed.  Add the cheese, pepper, and salt, and process to combine.  Scrape the sides of the blender, and with the machine running, add the olive oil.  Blend until well combined.

<DirT>
To serve, drizzle the cheesecake with the Cilantro Pesto, slice, and serve.

  1         tablespoon  chopped shallots
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/2         pound  butter -- cold and cubed
  1         tablespoon  chili paste
                        = (found in Asian markets)
                        === CRUNCHY ASIAN SLAW ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     2/3           cup  unsalted roasted peanuts
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  chili paste
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  Napa cabbage -- cored, shredded
     1/2         pound  red cabbage -- cored, shredded
     1/2         pound  fresh spinach -- cleaned, stemmed,
                        and thinly sliced
     2/3           cup  thinly-sliced red onions
     1/3           cup  chopped green onions, green part only
     1/3           cup  fresh cilantro leaves - (loosely packed)
                        === GARNISH ===
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives

Put the scallops, egg white, onions, cilantro, salt, cayenne, and sesame oil in a food processor and pulse 2 or 3 times to finely chop.  Do not puree.  Working 1 dumpling at a time, place 1 tablespoon of the filling the center of each wrapper.  Lightly wet the edges of the wrappers with water.  Fold in half, forming a semicircle and crimp the edges.  Place the finished dumplings on a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with a damp cloth.

Fill half of the wok with water.  Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil.  Line the bottom of a medium bamboo steamer with lettuce leaves.  Lay the dumplings on top of the lettuce leaves and cover with the lid.  Place the steamer in the wok and steam for 6 to 8 minutes.  Carefully remove the steamer and remove the dumplings.

Heat the oil in a large sautÈ pan, over medium heat.  When the oil is hot, add the dumplings.  Cook for about 1 minute or until crispy on the first side.  Remove from the pan.  Spoon the Chili Butter Sauce in the center of each plate.  Mound the Crunchy Asian Slaw in the center of the sauce.  Lay the dumplings around the slaw.  Garnish with chives.

Chili Butter Sauce:  In a small saucepan, over medium heat, combine the shallots, garlic and wine.  Bring to a boil and reduce by half.  Whisk in the butter, 1 cube at a time, until all of the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon.  Strain through a fine mesh sieve.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the chili and mix well.  (Makes about 1 1/2 to 2 cups)

Crunchy Asian Slaw:  In a skillet, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the peanuts, stirring often, toast them for 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the and set aside.  In a mixing bowl, combine the vinegar, sesame oil, honey, chili paste, and mayonnaise.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mix well.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining ingredients.  Mix well.  Add the dressing and peanuts, toss to mix well and evenly.  Season with salt and pepper.  Keeps for 1 day before getting soggy.  (Makes 6 to 8 servings)

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1 1/2           cups  milk
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  melted unsalted butter
  1              large  egg
  4 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Honey -- as needed

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the yeast, milk, sugar, and butter, and mix well for 2 minutes.  Add the egg, and mix well.  Add 4 cups of the flour, the cornmeal and salt.  Beat at low speed until all the flour is incorporated, then on medium speed until a ball of dough forms, adding more flour as needed if too sticky.

Remove from the mixer, form into a ball, and place in a lightly oiled bowl.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled, about 1 hour.

Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and pat into a thick rectangle, about 1-inch thick.  Roll out until about 1/4-inch thick, and with a sharp knife, cut the dough into squares, about 2 1/2- to 3-inch square.

Heat the fryer to 360 degrees.

Drop the dough into the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the sopapillas as they are cooking, and turning them constantly to cook on all sides until golden, about 3 minutes per batch.  Remove the sopapillas from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Serve the sopapillas hot, drizzled with honey.

This recipe yields about 3 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/4         pound  Canadian bacon -- diced
  1              pound  chard -- stems removed,
                        leaves rinsed well and chopped
  5        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  6             ounces  Canadian goat cheese -- crumbled
                        = (recommended: Saputo)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8             ounces  assorted Canadian wild mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        wiped clean, and thinly sliced
  1                     venison leg - (6 to 7 lbs) -- boned, butterflied,
                        fat and sinew trimmed, and pounded to
                        an even 1/2" thickness
  2        tablespoons  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
  1         tablespoon  canola or vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  sliced shallots
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme
  1                cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  chicken stock
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  water

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

In a large, heavy skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the bacon and cook, stirring until golden, about 1 minute.  Remove bacon from the pan with a slotted spoon.  Add 1 tablespoon of the butter, 2 tablespoons of the shallots and the garlic, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the chard and cook, stirring, until tender and wilted, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the pan and spread on a plate to cool.

Wipe the pan clean and melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in the pan.  Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of shallots and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms are tender and have given off their liquid, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the pan and spread on a plate to cool.

In a bowl, toss together the bacon, chard and mushrooms.  Add the cheese and mix well.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Spread the meat flat on a work surface and season the inside with 1 tablespoon of the Essence.  Spread the chard filling along the venison, leaving 1/2-inch space along the sides.  Roll the meat tightly over the stuffing.  With butcher's twine, tie the roll firmly every 2 inches.  Rub the outside of the venison roll with the oil and season with the remaining tablespoon of Essence.

Place in a large roasting pan and cook for 10 minutes at 450 degrees.  Lower the heat to 350 degrees, and cook until the roast is brown and tender, about 1 hours and 15 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

     1/4           cup  lemon-flavored vodka
  2        tablespoons  grated lemon zest
  2        tablespoons  grated lime zest
  2        tablespoons  grated orange zest

Remove any tiny pin bones from the salmon with a pair of needle nose pliers or tweezers.  Rinse the salmon under cold running water and pat dry.  Place salmon, skin-side down, on several large sheets of plastic wrap.

In a small mixing bowl, combine salt, sugar, dill, vodka and lemon, lime and orange zests.  Spread the sugar/salt/citrus mixture evenly over the fleshy side of the fish, pressing it into the flesh.  Wrap the salmon tightly in the plastic wrap and place skin-side down in a large baking dish.  Place a flat glass or ceramic dish on top of the salmon and weight the dish with several heavy cans or a brick and refrigerate for at least 24 hours and up to 48 hours.

Unwrap the salmon and rinse all of the cure off under cold, running water.  Pat dry and slice diagonally into paper-thin slices.

This recipe yields 24 servings as an hors d'oeuvre.

Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Tart dough -- (see below)
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped walnuts
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Chocolate Sauce -- (see below)
                        === TART DOUGH ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4             ounces  cold butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/4" pieces
  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  3        tablespoons  ice water
                        === CHOCOLATE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  4             ounces  semi sweet chocolate -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  nut-flavored liqueur

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to an 11-inch circle.  Transfer to a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and trim any excess from the edges.  Place in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes to rest.  Cover with parchment paper and weight with pie weights.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove the paper and weights and cook until just golden, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool.

In a deep saucepan, combine the butter, honey, sugar, and brown sugar.  Bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the walnuts and cream.  Add the vanilla and stir.  Pour into the prepared tart shell and spread evenly.  Bake until set, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Remove from the oven and cool for 30 minutes.  Drizzle Chocolate Sauce decoratively over the tart and let sit for 15 minutes.  Serve as desired.

Tart Dough:  Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large mixing bowl.  Using a pastry blender or your fingers, work in the butter pieces and shortening until the dough begins to come together and form small pea shapes.  Work in the ice water with your fingers until it just comes together, being careful not to over mix.  Form the crust into a disk shape, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to rest for at least 30 minutes before rolling out to fit into a pie pan.  (Makes 10-inch tart dough)

Chocolate Sauce:  In a small, heavy saucepan, bring the cream to a bare simmer over low heat.  Place the chocolate pieces in a medium bowl.  Remove the cream from the heat and whisk slowly into the chocolate.  Add the liqueur and continue whisking until the chocolate melts and the sauce thickens.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

              Wasabi-Crusted Salmon With Orange-Ginger Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  wasabi powder
  1         tablespoon  water
  1         tablespoon  rice wine vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  soy sauce
  4                     salmon fillet pieces - (6 oz ea) -- skin removed
  1           teaspoon  Emerilís Original Essence -- see * Note
  1                cup  panko crumbs
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
                        Orange-Ginger Sauce -- (see below)
     1/4           cup  toasted black and white sesame seeds -- for garnish
                        Steamed long-grain white rice -- for accompaniment
                        === ORANGE-GINGER SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  2        tablespoons  orange zest
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  fresh orange juice
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2             sticks  cold unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  wasabi powder

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Place the wasabi in a small bowl.  Slowly add in the water, whisking, to make a paste.  Add the vinegar and soy, and whisk well.  Place the salmon fillets in a glass baking dish and coat evenly on both sides with the wasabi mixture.  Season lightly with the Essence.

Place the panko crumbs in a shallow dish.  Turn both sides of the fillets in the crumbs to coat evenly, pressing to make the crumbs adhere.  Set on a waxed paper lined baking sheet and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

In a large skillet or sautÈ pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the fish and cook until medium-rare, about 3 to 4 minutes per side, depending upon the thickness of the fish.  Divide among 4 serving plates, drizzle with the Orange-Ginger Sauce, and dust with the seeds.  Serve immediately with steamed rice, and pass the remaining sauce at the table.

Orange-Ginger Sauce:  In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the shallots, ginger, orange zest, wine, and orange juice and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced in volume by 2/3.  Add the cream and cook until reduced by 1/2.

Whisking constantly, add the butter a bit at a time, waiting until each is completely incorporated before adding the next piece.  Continue whisking until the sauce is smooth.  Add the soy sauce, salt, to taste, and wasabi.  Serve warm with the Wasabi-Crusted Salmon. (Note: If not being served immediately, place in a hot water bath, covered, and stir occasionally.  Makes about 1 cup)

             Whole Fish Baked In Tomatoes, Onions, And Garlic

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  fish, such as rocaz - (3 to 4 lbs)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
  2               cups  chopped seeded tomatoes
  1                cup  sliced yellow onions
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
  2        tablespoons  minced oregano
  1         tablespoon  minced thyme

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Put the fish in a large colander and rinse under cold running water.  Pat dry with paper towels and transfer to a large non-reactive baking dish.  Season both sides of the fish with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/2 teaspoon of Essence.

In a large bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil with the tomatoes, onions, wine, garlic, parsley, oregano, thyme, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of Essence, and paprika.  Arrange half of the tomato mixture under the fish, lay the fish on top, and arrange the remaining tomato mixture over the top.

Bake until the juices run clear and the onions are beginning to crisp and slightly blacken along the edges, about 40 minutes, basting occasionally with the pan juices.

Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes.  With 2 spoons, loosen the head from the body of the fish, lift away and discard.  Run 1 of the spoons along the spine of the fish, and gently break the flesh into 2 fillets.  Lift the fillets onto the serving platter.  Carefully lift the spine and other bones out of the fish and discard.  Place the remaining fish fillets on the platter and serve with the tomato topping.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FRIED CHICKENS ===
  2              whole  fryer chickens - (abt 4 1/2 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  hot sauce
  2               cups  buttermilk
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
                        Creole Seasoning -- see * Note
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
                        === POTATO SALAD ===
  3             pounds  new potatoes -- quartered, and
                        cooked until tender and cooled
  1                cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  Creole or whole grain mustard
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Hot Sauce -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped red onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  6              large  hard-boiled eggs -- sliced
     1/2         pound  cooked crispy bacon -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions, green part only
  1             recipe  Southern Cooked Greens -- (see recipe)

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

For the Fried Chickens:  Season the both chickens with salt and pepper.  Place each chicken in a large zip-lock bag.  Add 1 cup of the hot sauce and buttermilk to each bag.  Seal each bag and shake several times to incorporate all of the ingredients.  Place in the refrigerator and marinate overnight.

Remove the chicken from each bag and pour the marinade in a large mixing bowl.  In another large mixing bowl, add the flour and season with Creole Seasoning.  Mix well.  Dredge each chicken in the seasoned flour, coating completely.  Dip each chicken in the reserved marinade, letting the excess drip off.  Dredge the chicken for a second time in the seasoned flour, coating completely.  Shake off any excess.

Assemble the frying rig according to manufactureís directions.  To fry each chicken, fill the pot three quarters of the way full with the peanut oil and heat the oil to between 350 and 360 degrees.  Place one chicken in the basket insert and carefully and slowly lower it into the hot oil.  Turn the chicken every 5 minutes, using long-handled forks.  A whole chicken will take 3 to 5 minutes per pound to cook.  It is done when the internal temperature reaches 170 to 180 degrees on an instant read meat thermometer.

Carefully lift the basket out of the hot oil.  This can be done by inserting a broomstick through the handles and having 2 strong people lift the basket out of the pot.  Using the long-handled forks, transfer the chicken to a large brown paper bag and let stand for about 15 minutes before removing to carve.  Repeat the procedure for the second chicken.  Carve the chickens into individual pieces.

For the Potato Salad:  In a large mixing bowl, combine the potatoes, mayonnaise, mustard, and lemon juice.  Season with hot sauce, salt and pepper.  Mix thoroughly.  Add the onions and garlic.  Mix thoroughly.  Fold in the eggs, bacon and green onions.  Mix well.

To serve, mound the Potato Salad in the center of each plate.  Lay a couple pieces of chicken next to the salad.  Serve with the Southern Cooked Greens.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.
