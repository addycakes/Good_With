Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  annatto seeds
  2               cups  pure olive oil

Toast the annatto seeds in a heavy saucepan until they just start to smoke.  Add the olive oil.  When the oil begins to simmer, remove from the heat and allow to cool.  Strain the oil and store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place for several months.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

Comments:  The ochre hue characteristic of so many dishes of the Caribbean and Latin America comes from annatto.  Annatto seeds, also known as achiote, deliver a mildly pungent flavor, but not a spicy one.  Use this infused oil when cooking rice, or brush it on chicken or fish before you put them on the grill.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
     1/2         pound  cellophane noodles (bean threads)
                        = (or angel hair pasta)
  1              pound  ground pork
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Asian (toasted) sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  6                     scallions, white and green parts -- thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 2") -- peeled, grated fine
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  Asian chile paste
  2               cups  shredded Napa cabbage
     2/3           cup  chicken stock -- preferably homemade
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.  Add the noodles and bring back to a boil.  Boil for 1 minute for cellophane noodles and 2 to 3 minutes for angel hair pasta.  Drain in a colander and rinse under running water.  Set aside.

Stir the pork with 2 tablespoons of the soy sauce, the sesame oil, the cornstarch, and 1/2 of the scallions in a small bowl.

Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat until almost smoking.  Add the ginger, garlic, and chile paste.  Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the pork mixture and cook for 1 minute longer.  Stir in the cabbage and the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce.  Cook, stirring, until the cabbage is almost wilted, 1 to 2 minutes.

Add the cooked noodles and cook, cutting them slightly with the side of the spatula, until the pork is no longer pink, about 1 minute.  Pour in the chicken stock and add the remaining scallions.  Season with salt and pepper and reduce the heat to medium-low.  Cover loosely with foil and simmer until the noodles have absorbed some of the stock, about 3 minutes

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  sliced peeled baking apples
                        = (such as Gravenstein)
     2/3           cup  maple or white sugar
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  rose water
                        === FLAKE PIECRUST ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  lard
                        Cold water -- as needed
  1 1/2           cups  unsalted butter - (about) -- softened

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Slice apples into mixing bowl and add sugar, cream, and rose water, and mix thoroughly, so that rose water will be distributed evenly.  Line a 9-inch pie dish with favorite pastry.  Fill with apple mixture and cover with top crust in which a few small vents have been slashed for steam to escape.  Flute the edges well to keep juice from escaping.  Bake in a moderate oven for 50 minutes.

Flake Piecrust:  In a bowl, rub the flour and lard together.  Add enough water to make a dough (not too stiff).

On work surface, roll the dough out and spread with some of the butter.  Fold over evenly and butter.  Make a second fold.  Roll out again, being careful not to squeeze the butter out.  The layers of dough and butter repeated provide the flakiness of the crust.

Use a pinch of ginger in piecrust to eliminate the taste of lard in case it is not fresh.  (Makes two 8- to 9-inch) crusts)

This recipe yields one 9-inch pie.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  crimini mushrooms -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped shallot
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  creme fraiche or sour cream
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh tarragon leaves
  12            slices  Black Forest or Virginia ham - (10 oz) -- without holes
  12             large  eggs
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Fresh tarragon leaves
                        === ACCOMPANIMENT ===
                        Buttered brioche or challah toast

Special equipment:  A muffin tin with 12 (1/2-cup) muffin cups

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Prepare mushrooms:  Cook mushrooms and shallot in butter with salt and pepper in a large heavy skillet over moderately-high heat, stirring, until mushrooms are tender and liquid they give off is evaporated, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in creme fraiche and tarragon.

Assemble:  Fit 1 slice of ham into each of 12 lightly oiled muffin cups (ends will stick up and hang over edges of cups).  Divide mushrooms among cups and crack 1 egg into each.  Bake in middle of oven until whites are cooked but yolks are still runny, about 15 minutes.  Season eggs with salt and pepper and remove (with ham) from muffin cups carefully, using 2 spoons or small spatulas.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cooks' Note:  The eggs in this recipe are not fully cooked, which may be of concern if salmonella is a problem in your area.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  mayonnaise
  4        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2         tablespoon  crab boil seasoning
                        = (Old Bay recommended)
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  freshly-chopped parsley leaves
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  1              pound  lump or backfin crabmeat
  1              pound  jumbo lump crabmeat
  2             slices  white bread -- crusts removed,
                        and torn into small pieces
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- as needed

Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, fry the crab cakes, turning once, until golden brown and heated through.  (Alternatively, bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes.)

Serve immediately.

Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  egg yolks
  4        tablespoons  water
  4           packages  frozen puff pastry sheets - (17 1/4 oz ea) -- thawed, but
                        kept chilled
  2           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  chopped crystallized ginger - (4 oz)
  2              pints  strawberries - (1 lb) -- hulled, then
                        halved or quartered if large
     3/4           cup  red currant jelly
  4              pints  blueberries - (2 1/2 lbs)
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for garnish

Special equipment:  Parchment paper and a large flat board (at least 20 inches square) for serving.

Prepare and bake pastry in 4 quadrants.  Stir together yolks and 2 tablespoons water for egg wash.  Put a baking sheet in freezer.

Unfold 1 pastry sheet on a 12-inch square of parchment and brush all over with egg wash.  Prick entire surface evenly with a fork.

Unfold a second pastry sheet on a cutting board and cut out a 1 1/4-inch-wide right-angle strip along 2 adjacent edges with a sharp small knife, reserving remaining square for another use.  Place right angle on 1 corner on top of 2 adjacent edges of pricked pastry to form first quadrant of tart.  Transfer pastry on parchment to baking sheet in freezer and chill until firm, about 10 minutes.

Transfer pastry on parchment from freezer to cutting board and trim a 1/4-inch-wide strip from all 4 edges using tip of small knife and a ruler and cutting all the way through pastry.  Make 1/4-inch-long vertical cuts through double layers of edge about 1/2-inch apart (to help sides rise evenly).

Return pastry on parchment to baking sheet in freezer and chill until firm but not solid, about 10 minutes more.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees and heat another baking sheet on lowest rack in oven until hot, about 2 minutes.

Remove baking sheet from oven and transfer pastry on parchment from freezer to hot sheet.  Bake pastry on lowest rack of oven until puffed and deep golden brown (a little darker than usual so double edges are cooked through), 14 to 16 minutes.  Transfer pastry on parchment to a rack to cool.

Repeat procedure with remaining 3 packages puff pastry to make remaining 3 quadrants of tart.

Make ginger cream:  Blend cream cheese and granulated sugar in a food processor until sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth.  Add ginger and pulse until finely chopped and mixture is combined well.

Prepare fruit and assemble tart:  If very puffed, gently flatten inner parts of pastry (single layer) slightly with your palm.  Fit quadrants together on flat board to form a giant square tart shell, trimming inside edges of each quadrant slightly with a serrated knife to help quadrants fit together smoothly.  "Glue" inner edges together with a little ginger cream, then spread remaining ginger cream evenly over tart, leaving double edges as a border.

Arrange strawberries in a decorative pattern over cream.  Bring jelly to a boil with remaining 2 tablespoons water, whisking until smooth, then simmer glaze 1 minute.  Toss 3/4 of glaze with blueberries in a large bowl and spoon blueberries onto tart to cover cream between strawberries, mounding slightly.  Brush strawberries with remaining glaze.

This recipe yields about 16 servings.

Cooks' Notes: 
   ï  All 4 quadrants of pastry can be prepared (but not baked) 1 day ahead and stacked in freezer between sheets of parchment paper.  Let each section stand at room temperature until no longer frozen solid but still firm, about 5 minutes, before baking. 
   ï  Ginger cream can be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. 
   ï  Assembled tart can be kept at cool room temperature 3 hours before serving

Cooks&apos; Notes: &#013;&#010;   ï  All 4 quadrants of pastry can be prepared (but not baked) 1 day ahead and stacked in freezer between sheets of parchment paper.  Let each section stand at room temperature until no longer frozen solid but still firm, about 5 minutes, before baking. &#013;&#010;   ï  Ginger cream can be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. &#013;&#010;   ï  Assembled tart can be kept at cool room temperature 3 hours before serving

            Black Bean, Tropical Fruit And Queso Blanco Salsa

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Salsa

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALSA ===
  1                cup  well-rinsed canned black beans
     1/3           cup  finely-diced red bell pepper
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped scallions -- white and light
                        green parts only
  1                     Scotch bonnet chile -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and minced
     3/4           cup  crumbled queso blanco
     3/4           cup  diced mango
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped orange sections
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Spanish sherry vinegar
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  fresh orange juice
  1                cup  diced ripe avocado
                        === DRESSING ===
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced shallot
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-chopped Italian parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  toasted and ground cumin seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  Spanish sherry vinegar
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

To make the Salsa:  In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients except the avocado in the order listed.  Very gently, fold in the avocado, to avoid smashing the delicate ingredients.  Cover and refrigerate until chilled.

To make the Dressing:  In a small bowl, combine all ingredients and whisk them well.  Cover and refrigerate.  To serve, gently fold the dressing into the salsa.  Season to taste and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  My talented friend chef Douglas Rodriguez gave me the inspiration for this salsa at a fantastic party he threw.  Queso blanco, a staple of Latin cuisine, is uniquely textured, simply yet assertively flavored, and quite pleasant to nibble.  In this recipe, the cheese balances the acidity of the orange and mango.  A no-brainer with chips, queso blanco salsa is a great accompaniment to grilled chicken breasts as well.  You can prepare the dressing up to a day before you assemble the salsa.  And the salsa is also good a day after ó assuming there is any left over.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     racks baby back ribs
                        Soaked wood chips -- if desired
  2                     lemons -- cut in halves
     1/4           cup  Classic BBQ Rub -- (see recipe)
                        Favorite barbecue sauce

Build charcoal fire or preheat gas grill.  Remove silver skin from back of ribs, if desired.  Set up the grill for indirect heat and if using wood chips, place soaked chips directly on charcoal, or in smoking box of gas grill.  Rub the cut lemons over front and back of ribs squeezing to release as much juice as possible.  Set aside for 5 minutes.  Rub ribs liberally with spice rub and let sit, covered, for 15 to 20 minutes.

Place ribs (bone-side down) in the center of the cooking grate or in a rib holder/rack over direct medium-low heat, making sure they are not over a direct flame.  Grill covered (at about 325 degrees, if your grill has a thermometer) for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until meat is tender and has pulled back from the ends of the rib bones.

Do not open the grill for the first 30 minutes ó this means no peeking; especially important if using wood chips.  If the ribs start to burn on the edges, stack them on top of one another in the very center of the grill and lower your fire slightly.  Twenty minutes before serving, unstack ribs, if necessary and brush with barbecue sauce.  Remove ribs from grill and let rest 10 minutes before cutting into individual or 2 to 3 rib portions.  Warm remaining sauce in a saucepan and serve on the side, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CARAMELO ===
  2               cups  sugar
  1         tablespoon  water - (to 2)
                        === FLAN ===
  1                can  sweetened condensed milk - (14 oz)
  1                can  unsweetened coconut milk - (14 oz)
  5              large  eggs
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
  6                     opened and cleaned 6-oz tuna cans

Make the Caramelo:  In a small heavy saucepan bring sugar and water to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved.  Boil syrup, without stirring, until golden caramel.  Immediately pour the some of the caramel into each tuna can, tilting them to coat the bottom and sides.  Let caramel cool.

(Drizzle any remaining caramel onto a sheet of parchment or waxed paper in decorative squiggles.  Let the squiggles harden and use them as a garnish for the flan.)

Make the Flan:  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

In a large bowl, whisk together condensed milk, coconut milk, eggs, and vanilla until smooth.  Divide the mixture among the tuna cans.

Place the tuna cans in a shallow baking dish and place on the middle rack in the oven.  Pour in enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the cans.  Bake the flan until just set, but still wiggly in the center, about 30 to 45 minutes.  Transfer the flan to a rack and let cool.  Chill the flan in the refrigerator.  (The flan can be prepared up to 3 days in advance.)

When ready to serve, dip the cans in a saucepan of hot water.  Using a finger, gently press down the edges of the flan, until the caramel runs up the side, which indicates that it's loosened.  Invert each flan onto onto a plate.  Break the caramel squiggles into pieces and insert them into the top of each flan.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  4              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  milk
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmesan
     3/4      teaspoon  salt - (to 1)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-milled black pepper
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  chopped onions
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped
  1             medium  cauliflower -- broken small florets
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh basil
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried basil)
     3/4      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Generously oil a 9-inch pie pan.

Potato Crust:  Place 2 firmly packed cups grated raw potatoes in a colander placed over a bowl; toss the potatoes with 1/2 teaspoon salt and set aside for 10 minutes.  Squeeze out the excess water.  Combine the drained potatoes, 1 large egg, beaten, and 1/4 cup grated onion in a medium bowl.

Pat the potato mixture into the oiled pie pan, building up the sides of the crust with lightly floured fingers.  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until golden brown, brushing the crust with oil after the first 20 minutes to crisp it.

Remove crust from the oven and reduce the temperature to 350 degrees.

Meanwhile, beat together the eggs, milk, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and the pepper in a small bowl; set aside.

Blanch cauliflower.  Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the cauliflower, onions, garlic, and 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of the remaining salt; cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Add the parsley, basil, and thyme; cook, covered, for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat.

Layer the baked potato crust with 1/2 of the cheese, then the cauliflower mixture, then the remaining cheese.  Pour the milk mixture over the top and lightly dust with paprika.  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until set.  Remove from the oven and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2         pounds  skinless chicken -- cut small pieces
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     bell peppers, 2 green and 2 red -- cored, seeded,
                        and sliced
  3                     onions -- sliced
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4) -- sliced
  2               cans  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz ea)
                        Water -- as needed

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Arrange the chicken in a 9- by 13-inch baking pan.  Coat the chicken with a little oil and season with salt and pepper.  Bake the chicken until lightly browned, about 20 to 30 minutes.

Remove the pan from the oven and drain off some of the fat.  Add the peppers, onion, garlic, and tomatoes (you may not need all of the tomatoes ó adjust to taste), and mix to combine.  Continue baking the chicken until well browned and tender.  I usually turn the chicken during the baking time.  Add more water if sauce is too thick.  Skim top if necessary, but since you've skinned and drained the chicken already, you shouldn't have to skim much.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  hulled green pumpkin seeds - (abt 7 oz)
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin seeds
  6                     black peppercorns
  4                     allspice berries
  3                     cloves
  1              pound  fresh tomatillos
                        = (or a 28-oz can tomatillos)
  6                     fresh serrano chilies
     1/2         large  white onion
  4                     garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh cilantro leaves - -- (packed)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  3               cups  homemade chicken broth
                        = (or low-sodium canned chicken broth)
  6               cups  shredded cooked chicken
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped toasted hulled pumpkin seeds
                        Chopped fresh coriander leaves

Heat a large heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot and toast pumpkin seeds, stirring constantly, until they have expanded and begin to pop, 3 to 5 minutes.  Transfer seeds to a plate to cool.  In skillet heat sesame and cumin seeds, peppercorns, allspice, and cloves, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute, and transfer to the plate.  When seeds and spices are cool, grind them in batches in a clean electric spice/coffee grinder.

If using fresh tomatillos, discard husks and rinse with warm water to remove stickiness.  Stem serrano chilies.  In a saucepan simmer fresh tomatillos and serranos in salted water to cover 10 minutes.  (If using canned tomatillos, drain them and leave serranos uncooked.)  Transfer tomatillos and serranos (use a slotted spoon if simmered) to a blender and puree with onion, garlic, 1/4 cup cilantro and salt until completely smooth.

Heat the oil in a 5-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat.  Pour in the tomatillo puree and cook, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes.  Add 2 1/2 cups of the broth and stir in the powdered pumpkin-seed mixture.  Simmer sauce, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes.

In blender, puree 1/2 cup broth and remaining 1/4 cup cilantro until completely smooth.  Stir puree and chicken into sauce and heat until hot.

Transfer the chicken mixture to a bowl or plate and garnish with pumpkin seeds and cilantro.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  fresh or dried avocado leaf -- toasted, and
                        finely ground (optional)
  2              whole  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- halved
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
                        Mixed cilantro and mint leaves -- for garnish
                        === SERVING SUGGESTION ===
                        Warm corn tortillas

Stem and seed the chiles, reserving 1 tablespoon of the seeds, or more to taste.

Toast the chiles in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat.  Transfer the chiles to a bowl, cover with hot tap water, and soak for 20 minutes.  Drain.

Meanwhile, toast the chile seeds in the skillet.  In a clean coffee or spice grinder, finely grind the chile seeds, sesame seeds, peppercorns, cloves, and cinnamon.

In a blender, combine the chiles, ground spices, 1/2 cup chicken broth, and garlic and blend.

Heat the lard in a saucepan over medium-high heat.  Pour in the blended sauce and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom, until somewhat reduced, about 10 minutes.  Add the remaining 3 cups chicken broth, bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until thickened, about 20 minutes more.  Season with salt and pepper.  (The sauce may be prepared up to 3 days ahead and stored in the refrigerator.)

Preheat a grill or grill pan.  Lightly brush the chicken with oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill the chicken, turning to make cross-hatched marks, until just cooked through, about 12 minutes.  Transfer the chicken to a platter and let rest for 5 minutes.

Slice the chicken and transfer to a platter.

Reheat the sauce and stir in the avocado leaf.  Ladle the sauce over the chicken, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and garnish with herb leaves.  Serve with corn tortillas.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Condiments                      Spice Blends

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  smoky paprika
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1         tablespoon  onion powder
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  celery salt
  1           teaspoon  oregano -- crushed

Combine paprika, salt, sugar, brown sugar, cumin, chili powder, pepper, cayenne, onion powder, garlic powder, celery salt and oregano in bowl; mix well.  For a smoother rub, puree ingredients in a spice grinder until well combined and all pieces are uniform (the rub will be very fine and tan in color).  This step is important if adding to any homemade barbecue sauce.

This recipe yields about 1 cup.

Comments:  Extra rub can be stored in an airtight container for up to six months.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 2/3           cups  uncooked rice - (19 oz) -- pulverized in a
                        spice grinder
  1              ounce  crumbled true cinnamon bark -- plus
                        four-inch pieces for garnish -- (optional)
  4               cups  hot water
  15                    blanched almonds -- lightly toasted,
                        and finely ground
  1                can  coconut milk - (13 1/2 oz)
  1                cup  sugar - (8 oz)
  1                cup  cold water - (8 oz)
  1                     lime -- zest cut into long
                        wide strips
                        Ice cubes
                        Light rum -- (optional)
  6                     fresh mint sprigs - (to 8)

One day in advance, combine the rice, crumbled cinnamon, and hot water in a bowl.  Cool, cover, and set aside.  Refrigerate if the weather is hot.

The next day, stir the nuts and coconut milk into the soaked rice.  Working in batches, add the rice mixture to a blender and process until quite smooth.  Each batch should take about 5 minutes.  Strain through a medium-mesh sieve and pour into a pitcher.

In a saucepan over low heat, combine the sugar, cold water, and lime zest.  Cook stirring, until the sugar is just dissolved.  Let cool.  Then remove the lime zest.  Pour the cooled syrup into the pitcher and mix well.  If the drink is too thick for your taste, add more water.  Cover and refrigerate until chilled.

Stir well and pour over ice cubes in tall glasses.  If desired, add a splash of rum to each glass before adding the horchata.  Garnish with a mint sprig and a piece of cinnamon bark.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  cilantro
  1              pound  fresh salmon fillets - (to 1 1/2)
     1/8      teaspoon  salt -- (optional as the
                        fish sauce is quite salty)
     1/8      teaspoon  Asian white pepper
                        = (you can substitute black pepper if you
                        can't find it)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (peanut oil can be substituted as well,
                        but I like the rich flavor of the
                        non-traditional olive oil)
  2        tablespoons  green curry paste
  4                     garlic cloves
  1                     shallot
  2                     kaffir lime leaves
  1                     lime
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
     1/4           cup  white wine
                        = (the drier the better, I am not married
                        to any particular vintage or variety)
     1/4           cup  chicken or fish stock
                        = (you can substitute a dreaded chicken
                        or fish bouillon cube if you're in a
                        pinch)
                        Cooked jasmine rice -- (optional)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place the bunch of cilantro in a bowl and let it soak for a few minutes to remove the dirt.

Put each salmon fillet in a parchment paper pouch, flesh-side up.  Season the fish with salt and pepper.  Pour the olive oil over the fish, then smear the green curry paste on top of the salmon.

Dice the garlic and shallots and sprinkle them on top, then place the lime leaves on top, as well.

Cut the lime in 1/2 and squeeze the lime juice over the fish.

Finally add the fish sauce, wine and chicken stock.

Drain the bowl of cilantro leaves and pat them dry with a paper towel.  (You can wrap them in a fresh paper towel, place them in a baggie and put them in the refrigerator.  The leaves will stay fresh longer that way.)  Garnish the top with some chopped cilantro leaves.

Close up the pouches and place on a baking sheet.  Bake 20 to 30 minutes.  Chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour and serve with fresh cilantro sprigs.

Jasmine rice can also accompany the dish if you are eating it hot.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments: "An Asian dish to spice up your potluck!"  I am half-Asian and always looking to surprise my friends at potlucks with all kinds of exotic Pan-Asian treats. I have personally found that many of them are not that hard to make ó it's just finding the right ingredients. This latest dish was born out of a need to eat healthy while being satisfied and became a staple meal while I was performing in Boca Raton, Florida, last December. It also allowed me to stay trim for my form-fitting gown! The fish can be served hot or cold ó I prefer it cold for the warm months ó and the leftovers make a nice salmon salad. (Just add a little of that naughty mayo.)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place the bunch of cilantro in a bowl and let it soak for a few minutes to remove the dirt.

Put each salmon fillet in a parchment paper pouch, flesh-side up.  Season the fish with salt and pepper.  Pour the olive oil over the fish, then smear the green curry paste on top of the salmon.

<DirT>
Dice the garlic and shallots and sprinkle them on top, then place the lime leaves on top, as well.

<DirT>
Cut the lime in 1/2 and squeeze the lime juice over the fish.

<DirT>
Finally add the fish sauce, wine and chicken stock.

<DirT>
Drain the bowl of cilantro leaves and pat them dry with a paper towel.  (You can wrap them in a fresh paper towel, place them in a baggie and put them in the refrigerator.  The leaves will stay fresh longer that way.)  Garnish the top with some chopped cilantro leaves.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Close up the pouches and place on a baking sheet.  Bake 20 to 30 minutes.  Chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour and serve with fresh cilantro sprigs.

Jasmine rice can also accompany the dish if you are eating it hot.

Comments: &quot;An Asian dish to spice up your potluck!&quot;  I am half-Asian and always looking to surprise my friends at potlucks with all kinds of exotic Pan-Asian treats. I have personally found that many of them are not that hard to make ó it&apos;s just finding the right ingredients. This latest dish was born out of a need to eat healthy while being satisfied and became a staple meal while I was performing in Boca Raton, Florida, last December. It also allowed me to stay trim for my form-fitting gown! The fish can be served hot or cold ó I prefer it cold for the warm months ó and the leftovers make a nice salmon salad. (Just add a little of that naughty mayo.)

Comments:  "It shouts out loud: I really care for you!!!!"  I lived in Columbia, South America, and Sancocho is the ultimate in comfort food there!  And like in Italian homes, each family has their own version of lasagna, this is my personalized version of the soup.  It is believed that it is so powerful that it can bring the dead back to life.  That is why it is served after ever party and makes the perfect Sunday meal!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHIMICHURRI ===
  1                     Spanish onion
     1/3           cup  olive oil
     1/3           cup  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  1              bunch  fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1              bunch  fresh cilantro leaves
  3             sprigs  fresh oregano -- leaves picked
  2                     large cloves garlic
  1                     jalapeÒo -- stemmed, chopped
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === AREPITAS ===
  2               cups  harina pan (precooked white corn flour)
                        = (or cornmeal)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
  1           teaspoon  fine salt
  2               cups  lukewarm water
     1/2           cup  milk
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- plus
                        more for frying
     1/2         pound  queso fresco -- crumbled

Make the Chimichurri:  In a food processor, pulse the onion until finely chopped but not pureed.  Transfer the onion to a bowl.  Add the olive oil, lime juice, parsley, cilantro, oregano leaves, garlic, and jalapeÒo and pulse until finely chopped.  Transfer the herb mixture to the bowl with the onion and stir to combine.  Season the chimichurri with salt and pepper.

Make the Arepitas:  In a large bowl, whisk together the harina pan, Parmesan, and salt.  In another large bowl, whisk together the water, milk, and 3 tablespoons oil.  Stir the milk mixture into the flour mixture.  Using your hand, knead the mixture until a firm but malleable dough is formed.  Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, pour the oil for frying into a large pot to a depth of 2 inches.  Heat the oil over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 365 degrees.

Form the dough into 1- to 1 1/2-inch round balls.  Using the palms of your hands, form the dough balls into rounded "UFO" shapes.

Working in batches, add the dough balls to the oil and fry, turning occasionally, until puffed and golden brown.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the arepitas to paper towel-lined plate and season with salt.

Serve the arepas in a bowl with the chimichurri and queso fresco in separate bowls on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  4               ears  corn -- shucked
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     3/4      teaspoon  cornstarch

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  crushed red pepper
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1                     fryer chicken - (abt 4 lbs) -- cut 8 pieces
  2             ounces  smoky bacon -- cut medium dice
  3 1/2    tablespoons  canola oil
                        === CURRY SAUCE ===
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1                     Scotch bonnet chile -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and minced
  1              large  red onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  Madras curry powder
  1                cup  fresh orange juice
  2              whole  star anise
  1              pinch  saffron threads
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  1                     bay leaf -- broken in half
  1 1/2           cups  unsweetened coconut milk
  1                     European cucumber -- peeled, cut
                        lengthwise in half, seeded, and
                        cut into small pieces
  2              large  ripe tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  fresh pineapple in 1/2" pieces
                        = (golden or regular)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Mix together the flour, salt, and the peppers together in a bowl.  Dust the chicken with the flour, shaking off any excess.  Reserve.

For the Chicken:  In a large skillet, cook the bacon in the canola oil over medium heat, until it has rendered some of its fat.  Add the chicken in batches, skin-side down and sear, 2 minutes per side, turning once, until golden on all sides.  Transfer the chicken to a roasting pan fitted with a rack; set the skillet aside.  Bake the chicken for 25 to 35 minutes.

For the Curry Sauce:  Set the skillet you seared the chicken in over medium-high heat and add the garlic, Scotch bonnet, and red onion.  Stir well to coat and cook until caramelized, about 10 minutes.  Add the curry powder, stir well, and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the orange juice, star anise, and saffron and cook, stirring for 2 minutes, as the juice reduces by half.

Add the chicken stock and stir, then add the vanilla bean, bay leaf, and coconut milk and stir.  Bring to a simmer and cook for about 20 minutes until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.

While the sauce is simmering, put the cucumber in a colander and toss with salt.  Let stand for 20 minutes, stirring now and then to distribute the salt.  (The salt will pull excess water out of the cucumber.)  Rinse the cucumber well under cold running water and drain.  Blot with paper towels.

Pass the curry sauce through a fine-mesh strainer into a smaller skillet.  Add the tomatoes and heat through.  Keep warm over very low heat.

To serve, put 2 pieces of chicken on each plate.  Spoon the curry sauce over and scatter the cucumber and pineapple over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Curry and coconut, star anise and saffron ó here is a recipe that demonstrates the powerful union of Caribbean and Asian food so often found in New World cuisine.  The coconut milk's richness inclines me toward a simple starch accompaniment.  I often serve it with basic white rice.

                Dijon-Baked Chicken With Rice And Broccoli

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Sandi Richard
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10                    boneless skinless chicken thighs - (to 12)
                        = (abt 1 3/4 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
  3        tablespoons  frozen chopped onions
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/2           cup  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  Asian-style hot chili sauce
                        = (can be chili-garlic sauce)
  1 1/2           cups  basmati or white rice
  3               cups  water
  5               cups  frozen broccoli florets
     1/8      teaspoon  favorite supermarket-style seasoning mix

The night before:  Unravel thighs to flatten and scrunch together in a large shallow oven-safe pan.  Combine the following in a small mixing bowl in this order: spices, honey, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, and hot chili sauce.  Stir.  Pour evenly over chicken.  Flip the chicken around with a fork until each piece is well coated.  End by making sure the rough side of the thigh is down.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

The next day:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Combine rice and water in a larger oven-safe pot.  Stir.  Cover and place in preheated oven.

Turn chicken over with a fork.  Place in preheated oven, beside rice.  Set timer for 50 minutes.  About halfway through the cooking time for chicken, I like to flip the chicken over again.  When the timer rings for chicken, turn off heat but leave it in the oven.

Rinse broccoli in colander.  Place in a microwave-safe pot or casserole dish with lid.  Cover, then microwave at high for 5 minutes.  When timer rings, add seasoning mix to broccoli.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  If you forget to marinate this overnight, don't worry; it's still great if you cook the chicken in the sauce as soon as you make it.  It's just better when it marinates.

  1                     small bunch fresh baby spinach -- washed
  1              pound  farfalle pasta (bowties)
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- sliced small pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Grated Locatelli Romano cheese -- as needed

Toast pignole nuts in small frying pan.  Add raisins to boiling water until plump, and drain.  In large frying pan, heat oil and saute garlic.  Add spinach and stir, cooking until wilted.

Cook farfalle according to package directions.  When done, drain and place farfalle in a large bowl with nuts, raisins, spinach mixture, prosciutto, salt and pepper, and grated cheese.  You won't believe how good this is.  My husband was reluctant to try it because of the raisins, but he changed his mind as soon as he tasted it.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Fizzy Sour Cherry Lemonade

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh or thawed frozen sour cherries -- stemmed
  2               cups  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2           cups  superfine sugar - (to 2)
  3               cups  white rum -- (optional)
  4               cups  chilled sparkling water - (to 6)
                        Fresh sour cherries with stems -- for garnish

Blend cherries (including pits) in a blender at low speed until skins have broken down enough to brightly color liquid (some of pits will be coarsely chopped).  Pour through a sieve into a 4-quart pitcher, pressing on and discarding solids.  Add lemon juice and sugar, to taste, stirring until sugar is dissolved.  (Sour cherry lemonade can be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.)

Pour 3 tablespoons white rum, if using, into each of 16 tall (10-ounce) glasses filled with ice.  Add 1/2 cup cherry lemonade to each and top off with sparkling water.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  We've spiked this lemonade with white rum to make a refreshing summer cocktail, but you can omit the alcohol.  One batch will completely fill your blender, so if you need more, make multiple batches rather than doubling or tripling the recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  small creamer potatoes - (abt 30) -- unpeeled, and
                        scrubbed well
  4             pieces  leek (white part only) -- split lengthwise,
                        and thinly sliced
  2                     jarred or homemade roasted red peppers
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh tarragon leaves
     2/3           cup  Champagne Vinaigrette -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a pot with a steamer insert, steam the potatoes until tender, about 15 minutes.  (The potatoes can also be cooked in boiling salted water for the same amount of time.)  Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.

In a pot of boiling water, blanch the leeks for 30 seconds, or until tender.  Rinse in cold water and drain.  Set aside.

Cut the roasted peppers in half crosswise and then cut them into 1/2-inch slices.

Cut each potato into 8 pieces.  In a medium bowl, mix the potatoes, leeks, peppers, thyme, and tarragon.  In a separate bowl, stir together the Champagne vinaigrette with the mustard.  Drizzle the vinaigrette on the potato salad and toss gently until the vinaigrette coats the salad evenly.  Season with the salt and pepper and toss again.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

           Garlic Crusted Sliced Pork Loin With Fresh Succotash

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Kate Manchester
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PORK LOIN ===
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced fine
  3             pounds  boneless pork loin -- trimmed and tied
                        === SUCCOTASH ===
  2               cups  frozen baby lima beans
                        = (or fresh shelling beans)
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4               ears  fresh sweet corn - (to 6) -- scraped from cob
                        = (you will need 2 cups total ñ a little
                        more is ok)
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     shakes paprika
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley

Make the Pork Loin:  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Place the first 5 ingredients in the bowl of a mini chopper.  Process until the mixture resembles a coarse paste.  Rub the paste over the surface of the pork and allow the pork to sit for 30 minutes at room temperature, or in the refrigerator for up to 6 hours ó leave roast at room temperature for 30 minutes before roasting if refrigerated.  Roast the pork for 30 to 50 minutes, check temperature with a meat thermometer.  The temperature should read 140 degrees.  Remove the pork as soon as it reaches the correct temperature, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes.

Make the Succotash:  Place the beans in a saucepan and cover with salted water.  Simmer until tender, 6 to 8 minutes for frozen beans, and 25 minutes for fresh shelling beans.  Drain the beans, and using the same saucepan, add the butter and the corn and saute quickly, about 2 minutes.  Add the cream, sugar, beans, and salt and pepper.  Cook over low heat for about three minutes more.

Spoon the succotash into 6 shallow bowls, sprinkle with paprika and parsley.  Top each with 3 to 4 (1-inch) slices of the pork loin and serve immediately.

This recipe yields about 6 servings.

Make the Pork Loin:  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the first 5 ingredients in the bowl of a mini chopper.  Process until the mixture resembles a coarse paste.  Rub the paste over the surface of the pork and allow the pork to sit for 30 minutes at room temperature, or in the refrigerator for up to 6 hours ó leave roast at room temperature for 30 minutes before roasting if refrigerated.  Roast the pork for 30 to 50 minutes, check temperature with a meat thermometer.  The temperature should read 140 degrees.  Remove the pork as soon as it reaches the correct temperature, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the Succotash:  Place the beans in a saucepan and cover with salted water.  Simmer until tender, 6 to 8 minutes for frozen beans, and 25 minutes for fresh shelling beans.  Drain the beans, and using the same saucepan, add the butter and the corn and saute quickly, about 2 minutes.  Add the cream, sugar, beans, and salt and pepper.  Cook over low heat for about three minutes more.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon the succotash into 6 shallow bowls, sprinkle with paprika and parsley.  Top each with 3 to 4 (1-inch) slices of the pork loin and serve immediately.

  9              large  vine-ripened tomatoes
  2             medium  cucumbers -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1             medium  red onion -- chopped
  1                     bell pepper -- chopped
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  6        tablespoons  red wine vinegar -- or to taste

  2              small  sweet potatoes -- peeled, and each
                        cut into 4 long slices
  4             medium  zucchini -- each cut
                        into 4 long slices
  2              small  radicchio -- cut into quarters
  1             medium  eggplant -- cut 4 long slices;
                        then each slice cut in half widthwise
  3                     small bunche green onions -- trimmed
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1               pint  small ripe cherry tomatoes -- tossed in a bowl
                        with a little oil
  1                     lemon -- cut into wedges

Make the Soprano Sauce:  Combine the anchovies, garlic and capers in a small bowl or a food processor.  Slowly whisk in the olive oil and season further with salt, if desired.  Set aside.

Build a charcoal fire or preheat gas grill.

Make the Vegetables:  Lightly coat cut vegetables with oil and sprinkle with salt.  One by one lay the vegetable slices and green onions on the cooking grate over direct medium heat.  (Do this in batches if necessary so the grill is not crowded.)  Cook about 5 minutes.  Turn the vegetables over.  Cook 3 or 4 minutes longer.

As soon as vegetables are done, remove from grill and transfer to a platter: the zucchini, radicchio and green onions should be done first; the eggplant will take a little longer and the sweet potatoes will be the last to cook through.  While the vegetables are warm, coat with Soprano Sauce.  Let cool to room temperature and coat again if necessary.

When all the other vegetables are done, place the tomatoes onto the cooking grate to mark and warm through, about 2 minutes.  Coat with Soprano Sauce and place onto the platter with the other vegetables, if desired.  Decorate with lemon wedges and serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     firm but ripe bananas -- unpeeled
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  8                     small scoops best-quality vanilla ice crea
                        Bittersweet Chocolate Sauce -- (listed below)
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped pecans or walnuts -- toasted
                        Whipped cream -- (optional)
                        Maraschino cherries or strawberries -- (optional)
                        === BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE SAUCE ===
  8             ounces  bittersweet chocolate chips
                        = (or chopped block chocolate)
     1/3           cup  heavy whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  sweet cream butter -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  superfine sugar
     1/8           cup  liqueur
                        = (either Kahula, Frangelico or Chambord)
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract

Build charcoal fire or preheat gas grill.

Slice bananas in 1/2 lengthwise and crosswise so each banana yields 4 pieces.  Set aside.  Mix the sugar and cinnamon, sprinkle on cut sides of bananas.  Let bananas sit for 5 minutes.

Place bananas cut-side down on a clean cooking grate over direct low heat.  Cook for 2 minutes or until grill marks appear.  Using a pair of long-handled tongs, turn over and let cook 5 more minutes or until the skin pulls away from the banana.

Remove skins from banana halves and place 4 banana halves in the bottom of each serving bowl.  Top each serving with 2 scoops of ice cream.  Ladle about 1/4 cup of heated chocolate sauce over each sundae ó let your taste determine the quantity here, add just a touch for a hint of chocolate or pour it on for a serious chocolate fix.  Sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon of chopped nuts, top with whipped cream, and place a cherry or strawberry on top.

Bittersweet Chocolate Sauce:  Make the chocolate sauce up to 2 days in advance.  Place chocolate in a medium-size metal mixing bowl.  Heat cream to almost boiling, add butter and sugar and stir to combine.  Remove from heat and pour over chocolate.  Whisk vigorously until melted, and well combined.  Add liqueur and vanilla and stir constantly until mixture is cool the touch.  Cover with plastic wrap and set aside or refrigerate up to 2 days.  Warm before serving.  (Makes about 1 cup)

                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            medium  leeks - (abt 4 1/2 lbs) -- tough outer
                        leaves discarded
                        Vegetable oil -- for grilling
     1/3           cup  minced assorted fresh herbs
                        = (such as chives, parsley, mint, basil,
                        and tarragon)
     1/4           cup  finely-diced red bell pepper -- plus
                        more for garnish
     1/4           cup  finely-diced pitted kalamata or
                        other brine-cured black olives
  4          teaspoons  Dijon-style mustard
  3        tablespoons  white-wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped flat-leaf parsley -- for garnish
                        Diced hard-boiled egg -- for garnish

Trim the leeks to about 7 inches long.  Split them lengthwise to within 1 1/2 inches of the root end, leaving the root end intact.  Submerge the leeks in a large bowl of water, let them soak to release any dirt or sand, for several minutes.  Lift the leeks out of the water and discard the water.

Pour about 1-inch of water into a large saucepan, and set up a collapsible steamer inside.  Bring the water to boil and steam the leeks, covered, until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes.  Shock the leeks in a bowl of ice water and drain.  Cut the leeks apart at the root ends and drain them on paper towels.  Transfer the leeks to a shallow dish.

Brush the leeks with the vegetable oil and, working in batches, grill them over medium heat until charred and soft, about 4 minutes per side.  (The leeks may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.)

In a bowl whisk together the herbs, bell pepper, olives, mustard, and vinegar.  While whisking, add the oil in a stream until emulsified.  Season with salt and pepper.

Pour the vinaigrette over the leeks and turn them to coat evenly.  Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or up to overnight.

When ready to serve, arrange the leeks on a platter and pour any remaining vinaigrette over the top.  Garnish with red pepper, parsley, and egg.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Trim the leeks to about 7 inches long.  Split them lengthwise to within 1 1/2 inches of the root end, leaving the root end intact.  Submerge the leeks in a large bowl of water, let them soak to release any dirt or sand, for several minutes.  Lift the leeks out of the water and discard the water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour about 1-inch of water into a large saucepan, and set up a collapsible steamer inside.  Bring the water to boil and steam the leeks, covered, until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes.  Shock the leeks in a bowl of ice water and drain.  Cut the leeks apart at the root ends and drain them on paper towels.  Transfer the leeks to a shallow dish.

          Grilled Smoked Sausage With Apple Fennel 'Sauerkraut'

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Elizabeth Karmel
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sausage

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  fennel bulb
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              large  Vidalia onion -- chopped
  5                     Granny Smith apples -- grated
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  1           teaspoon  caraway seeds
     1/2           cup  hard cider or apple juice
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     smoked sausages
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  8                     poppy-seed hot dog buns or French rolls
                        Spicy brown or Dijon mustard

Clean and cut the fennel in long strips (julienne) and trim tops, reserving for later use.

Heat oil in heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat, add onion and kosher salt.  Cook until onion begins to brown, add strips of fennel, stir, and let cook covered for about 5 minutes or until fennel begins to wilt, reduce heat to medium-low.

Meanwhile, mix grated apple with lemon juice and add to pan, cover and cook, stirring occasionally for 15 minutes.  Add butter, mixing well.  Add caraway seeds, reserved fennel tops and hard cider or apple juice.  Cook for an additional 5 minutes, uncovered.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat and let sit to allow the flavors to mingle.  (The sauerkraut can be made up to 2 days in advance and kept covered in the refrigerator until ready to use.)

Build charcoal fire or preheat gas grill.  Just before serving, warm sauerkraut and grill sausages.  To grill sausages, place on the cooking grate over direct medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes, turning occasionally to mark all sides of the sausage.  Meanwhile, split the buns and brush a little butter on the inside.  Toast until lightly browned.  When ready to serve, place 1 sausage and a generous amount of the sauerkraut on the bun and serve with mustard on the side.  Enjoy immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  sweet potatoes - (abt 4; preferably long)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
     3/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves

Cover potatoes with cold water in a large pot, then bring to a boil.  Simmer until slightly resistant in center when pierced with a sharp small knife, 25 to 30 minutes, then transfer to a large bowl of cold water to stop cooking.  Drain well.  When cool enough to handle, peel potatoes with a sharp small knife and quarter lengthwise.

Prepare grill for cooking.

Whisk together lime juice, salt, and pepper and add oil in a slow stream, whisking.  Whisk in cilantro.

When fire is hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 1 to 2 seconds), grill potatoes in 2 or 3 batches on lightly oiled grill rack (over coals if using a charcoal grill), uncovered, turning, until grill marks appear and potatoes are just tender, 3 to 6 minutes total.

Serve potatoes warm or at room temperature, drizzled with vinaigrette.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Cooks' Notes:  Potatoes can be boiled and peeled 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Vinaigrette can be made 2 hours ahead and kept at room temperature.

If you aren't able to grill, potatoes can be cooked in a well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately-high heat, turning, until grill marks appear, 3 to 6 minutes total.

                          Hainanese Chicken Rice

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Violet Oon

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHILE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice - (to 3)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh red chiles
  5                     garlic cloves -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === CHICKEN AND RICE ===
  1                     chicken - (abt 2 lbs)
  1                     scallion -- cut 1" pieces
  4             slices  fresh peeled ginger
  6         tablespoon  vegetable oil or olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves - (to 8) -- finely chopped
  4               cups  long-grain uncooked rice
  1           teaspoon  fine salt

Make the Chile Sauce:  Combine all the ingredients in a bowl, mix well, and season with salt, to taste.  Set aside

Make the Chicken and Rice:  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (enough water to immerse the chicken).  Stuff the cavity of the chicken with the scallion and ginger.  Add the chicken to the boiling water, breast-side down.  Lower the heat to a simmer just under boiling point and cook, covered, until just cooked through, about 40 minutes.

Transfer the chicken to an ice water bath for about 5 to 6 minutes.  (This is to arrest the cooking and will make the chicken skin crisp.)  Drain.  De-bone the chicken and cut into bite-sized pieces.  Reserve the chicken stock, and keep hot.

Heat the oil in a wok or saucepan over high heat.  Add the garlic and stir-fry until fragrant.  Add the rice and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add enough of the hot reserved chicken soup to reach 1/2 inch above the top of the rice.  Bring to the boil, add the salt, and lower the heat to low.  When steam holes form in the rice, cover the wok, and steam until cooked, about 30 minutes.

Whisk 1/4 cup of the hot chicken stock into the chile sauce.

Arrange the rice and poached chicken on a platter and drizzle with the chile sauce.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Hainanese Chicken Rice comes from the Chinese sub tropical island of Hainan and many of the sons and daughters of Hainan immigrated to Singapore in the past 100 years.  The most popular dish of Hainan is the Chicken Rice in which a chicken is used in all ways ó poached for the meat, the soup used to make a deliciously flavored rice and to also infuse the chile sauce.  This has become one of Singapore's top loved dishes and you will find Hainanese Chicken Rice in every street corner coffee shop and food court as well as in the coffee houses of all hotels in Singapore.

Make the Chile Sauce:  Combine all the ingredients in a bowl, mix well, and season with salt, to taste.  Set aside
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the Chicken and Rice:  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (enough water to immerse the chicken).  Stuff the cavity of the chicken with the scallion and ginger.  Add the chicken to the boiling water, breast-side down.  Lower the heat to a simmer just under boiling point and cook, covered, until just cooked through, about 40 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the chicken to an ice water bath for about 5 to 6 minutes.  (This is to arrest the cooking and will make the chicken skin crisp.)  Drain.  De-bone the chicken and cut into bite-sized pieces.  Reserve the chicken stock, and keep hot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the oil in a wok or saucepan over high heat.  Add the garlic and stir-fry until fragrant.  Add the rice and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add enough of the hot reserved chicken soup to reach 1/2 inch above the top of the rice.  Bring to the boil, add the salt, and lower the heat to low.  When steam holes form in the rice, cover the wok, and steam until cooked, about 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk 1/4 cup of the hot chicken stock into the chile sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the rice and poached chicken on a platter and drizzle with the chile sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Hainanese Chicken Rice comes from the Chinese sub tropical island of Hainan and many of the sons and daughters of Hainan immigrated to Singapore in the past 100 years.  The most popular dish of Hainan is the Chicken Rice in which a chicken is used in all ways ó poached for the meat, the soup used to make a deliciously flavored rice and to also infuse the chile sauce.  This has become one of Singapore&apos;s top loved dishes and you will find Hainanese Chicken Rice in every street corner coffee shop and food court as well as in the coffee houses of all hotels in Singapore.

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  short-grain sushi rice
     1/2           cup  seasoned rice vinegar
  8             ounces  fresh tuna
                        = (preferably big-eye or yellow-fin)
  2          teaspoons  Asian mayonnaise
                        = (Kewpie brand recommended)
  2          teaspoons  Shriracha (Thai-style hot sauce)
  2                     sheets unsalted nori (Japanese dried seawe
                        Toasted sesame seeds -- as needed
  1              bunch  kaiware (daikon radish sprouts)
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Bamboo sushi mat wrapped in plastic wrap

Make the Rice:  Wash rice well by rinsing 2 to 3 times without breaking the rice.  Cook the rice in a rice cooker according the manufacturer's instructions.  While the rice is still hot, transfer it to a bowl and add the vinegar.  Using a rubber spatula or wooden paddle, mix the rice until well coated with the vinegar, slightly cooled and glossy, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Transfer the rice to a parchment paper-lined sheet pan, cover with a tea towel, and let cool for 30 minutes.

To make the Filling:  Finely chop the tuna and transfer to a bowl.  In another bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise and Shriracha (add more Shriracha, if desired).  Gently mix together the tuna and mayonnaise mixture.

To make the Sushi Roll:  Fold the nori sheets in half and break them apart.  Working with 1/2 sheet at a time, lay it on the bamboo mat shiny-side down.  Spread an even layer of rice (not too thick) on the nori, and sprinkle lightly with the sesame seeds.  Flip the nori over, and arrange the tuna mixture across the middle of the sheet, forming a horizontal line.  Put about 20 pieces of kaiware evenly on top of the tuna line (make sure the sprouted ends face towards the ends of the roll, jutting out from the sides).  Roll the nori over the tuna by lifting the near end over the top and rolling to meet the far end; then use the sushi mat to press the roll together.  Repeat to make 4 rolls.

This recipe yields 4 rolls.

In a food processor, puree the beans and the onion mixture with the broth and season with salt and pepper.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and chill.

Make the Tuna Layer:  In a bowl toss together the tuna, onion, olives, parsley, vinegar and olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper.

Assemble the Salad:  Spread the bean puree in the bottom of a trifle bowl, top with the tuna mixture, and spoon the cucumber mixture over the top.  Chill covered, for at least 3 hours or overnight.

When ready to serve, sprinkle the top with the garnish and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                        Lemon Lime Soda Pound Cake

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  3               cups  sugar
  5                     eggs -- separated
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  lemon lime soda
  3          teaspoons  lemon juice

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Grease a 10-inch tube pan and dust with flour.

In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter until fluffy.  Slowly add 2 cups of the sugar and mix until just incorporated.  Raise the speed to high and mix until light and fluffy.  Add the egg yolks, 1 at a time, until incorporated.

Reduce the mixer's speed to low.  Alternately add the flour and soda until a smooth batter is formed.  Transfer the batter to a large bowl.

Clean the bowl of the mixer and place the egg whites inside.  Using the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites until foamy.  Add the lemon juice and beat until soft peaks are formed.  Add the remaining sugar and beat until stiff peaks are formed.

Working in 3 batches, using a rubber spatula, fold the egg whites into the batter.

Pour the batter into the pan and bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes to 1 hour.  Allow to cool completely about 2 hours, then unmold and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Categories    : Cheesecake                      Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  20                    reduced-fat vanilla wafers
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
                        === FILLING ===
  16            ounces  1% cottage cheese - (abt 2 cups)
  8             ounces  reduced-fat cream cheese (Neufchatel) -- cut into pieces
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1              pinch  salt
  3              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh lemon verbena
                        = (or lemon balm)
                        === TOPPING ===
  2             quarts  fresh strawberries
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        Lemon verbena or lemon balm sprigs -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Coat a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray.  Wrap the outside of the pan with a double thickness of foil.  Put a kettle of water on to boil for the water bath.

To make Crust:  Pulse vanilla wafers in a food processor into fine crumbs.  Add oil and pulse to blend.  Press crumb mixture evenly into bottom of prepared pan.  (Rinse and dry the workbowl.)

To make Filling:  Process cottage cheese in food processor until very smooth and silky, stopping to scrape down the sides once or twice.  Add cream cheese and process until smooth.  Add 1 cup sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, vanilla and salt; process until well blended.  Add eggs and pulse several times just until mixed in.  Sprinkle in lemon verbena (or lemon balm); mix with a rubber spatula.  (Do not process.)  Scrape the filling into the crust-lined pan.

Place the cheesecake in a shallow roasting pan and pour in enough boiling water to come 1 inch up the outside of the springform pan.  Bake until the edges are set but the center quivers slightly, 50 to 55 minutes.  Turn off the oven.  Let the cheesecake cool in the oven, with the door ajar, for 1 hour.

Remove foil from pan.  Cover cheesecake with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours.

To make Topping:  About 1/2 hour before serving, rinse strawberries.  Set aside 3 whole berries for garnish; hull remaining berries and slice into a bowl.  Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar and toss to coat.  Let stand until strawberries are juicy, 20 to 30 minutes.

To serve, place cheesecake on a serving platter and run a knife around the inside edge of the pan; remove pan rim.  Make 3 lengthwise cuts in each whole berry; press lightly and arrange fanned berries in the center of the cheesecake.  Garnish with a sprig of lemon verbena (or lemon balm).  Cut cheesecake into slices and place on dessert plates.  Top each serving with strawberries and juice and garnish with another lemon verbena (or lemon balm) sprig.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  With its exquisite lemon-oil fragrance, lemon verbena adds a sophisticated accent to a creamy vanilla cheesecake.  Lemon verbena is also a perfect complement to strawberries.  A generous quantity of fruit and a delicate slice of cheesecake makes for a balanced finish to a special meal.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  fresh green lima beans
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

                        Water -- as needed
  1              pound  extra-lean ground beef
  3        tablespoons  frozen chopped onions
  1           teaspoon  Italian seasoning
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2               cups  whole-wheat macaroni - (to 2 1/2)
     1/2           cup  low-fat mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  low-fat sour cream
     1/2      teaspoon  supermarket-style garlic and herb
                        seasoning mix
  1 1/2         pounds  precut mixed vegetables

                       Miniature JalapeÒo Souffles

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Hors d'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- plus
                        extra for buttering the tins
  2 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  very-finely chopped pine nuts
  1              small  jalapeÒo -- seeded, minced
  6        tablespoons  whole milk
     1/4           cup  grated Gruyere cheese
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1              large  egg -- separated

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Butter a nonstick mini-muffin tin with 12 (1/8-cup) wells that measure 1 3/4 inches in diameter and 3/4-inch deep.  Mix 1 tablespoon of the flour with 1/2 the pine nuts in a small bowl.  Dust the tins with the flour and nut mixture.  Tap out the excess.

Melt the 1 tablespoon butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons flour and the jalapeÒo.  Cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes.  Whisk in the milk and add the cheese, salt, pepper, mustard, and egg yolk.  Cool to room temperature.

Beat the egg white until firm but not stiff.  Stir a 1/4 of the white into the cheese sauce.  Gently fold in the remaining white.  Spoon into the prepared tins, sprinkle with the remaining pine nuts, and bake until puffed and golden, 7 to 10 minutes.  Cool in the tins on wire racks.  When cool, run a small knife around the edge of each souffle.  (The souffles will fall as they cool.)  They can be prepared up to a day in advance and refrigerated.  Bake in the muffin tins in a preheated 400 degree oven for 5 to 7 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 12 hors d'oeuvres.

Comments:  The beauty of these little souffles is their resilience.  You can make them a day ahead, toss them in the refrigerator, and then just reheat them when your guests arrive.  People aren't usually served mini-souffles, so they will be charmed.  Indeed you might find yourself reaching frequently for those mini-muffin tins.  You can minimize just about any cake or muffin.  If your jalapeÒo lacks bite (as so many do these days), just reach for a pickled jalapeÒo, either your own homemade version, or your favorite store-bought brand.  I always keep a jar on the door of the refrigerator to toss into those dishes that need a little perking up.

One night on "Cooking Live" when I was removing the seeds and ribs from a jalapeÒo without the protection of surgical gloves, a viewer called in to say that at least I could make my job easier by using a grapefruit spoon.  If you happen to have one kicking around the house, try it.  It works nicely.

Melt the 1 tablespoon butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons flour and the jalapeÒo.  Cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes.  Whisk in the milk and add the cheese, salt, pepper, mustard, and egg yolk.  Cool to room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat the egg white until firm but not stiff.  Stir a 1/4 of the white into the cheese sauce.  Gently fold in the remaining white.  Spoon into the prepared tins, sprinkle with the remaining pine nuts, and bake until puffed and golden, 7 to 10 minutes.  Cool in the tins on wire racks.  When cool, run a small knife around the edge of each souffle.  (The souffles will fall as they cool.)  They can be prepared up to a day in advance and refrigerated.  Bake in the muffin tins in a preheated 400 degree oven for 5 to 7 minutes before serving.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 12 hors d&apos;oeuvres.

Comments:  The beauty of these little souffles is their resilience.  You can make them a day ahead, toss them in the refrigerator, and then just reheat them when your guests arrive.  People aren&apos;t usually served mini-souffles, so they will be charmed.  Indeed you might find yourself reaching frequently for those mini-muffin tins.  You can minimize just about any cake or muffin.  If your jalapeÒo lacks bite (as so many do these days), just reach for a pickled jalapeÒo, either your own homemade version, or your favorite store-bought brand.  I always keep a jar on the door of the refrigerator to toss into those dishes that need a little perking up.
</DirT>
<DirT>
One night on &quot;Cooking Live&quot; when I was removing the seeds and ribs from a jalapeÒo without the protection of surgical gloves, a viewer called in to say that at least I could make my job easier by using a grapefruit spoon.  If you happen to have one kicking around the house, try it.  It works nicely.

  1                     ball fresh mozzarella
  4             slices  white bread -- crusts trimmed
  2              large  eggs -- beaten, or more as
                        needed
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Plain bread crumbs -- as needed
                        Olive oil -- for frying
                        === QUICK MARINARA SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
  1              pinch  sugar
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Cut the mozzarella into enough 1/4-inch thick slices to cover 2 slices of the bread.  Reserve the remaining mozzarella for another use.  Top the cheese with the remaining 2 slices of bread, to make 2 sandwiches, and press down to compact.

In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, garlic, and parsley and season with salt and pepper.  Put the bread crumbs on a plate.

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, pour the in oil to a depth of 1/4-inch.  When the oil is hot, dip each sandwich into the egg mixture, dredge in the bread crumbs, and fry, turning once, until crisp and the cheese has melted.

Cut each sandwich in half and serve, while still hot, with the marinara sauce on the side for dipping.

Quick Marinara Sauce:  Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant.  Add the tomatoes and sugar and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 30 minutes.

Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the basil and parsley.  (Makes about 3 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    garlic cloves -- minced (abt 1/3 cup)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried hot red pepper flakes
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1                can  whole tomatoes in puree - (28 oz)
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano -- crumbled
  1           teaspoon  dried basil -- crumbled
     1/4           cup  drained bottled capers - (abt 1 1/4 oz)
     1/2           cup  kalamata olives - (abt 3 oz) -- pitted, chopped
                        = (or other brine-cured black olives)
     1/3           cup  dry red wine
     1/2         pound  dried sun-dried tomato linguine
     1/2         pound  squid ink linguine
  3             pounds  mussels (preferably cultivated) -- cleaned
                        Chives -- for garnish

Cook garlic and red pepper flakes in oil in a deep 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes.  Add tomatoes with puree, tomato paste, herbs, capers, olives, and wine and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally and breaking up tomatoes, until sauce is thick, about 15 minutes.

Cook linguine in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until al dente, then drain in a colander.

While pasta cooks, increase heat under sauce to moderately-high and add mussels, then cook, covered, until mussels just open wide, checking frequently after 3 minutes and transferring to a bowl.  (Discard any mussels that remain unopened after 6 minutes.)

Serve linguine with mussels and sauce and garnish with chives.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cooks' Note:  Just before cooking, clean mussels by scrubbing them well with a brush under cold water and scraping off any barnacles with a knife.  If beard is still attached, remove it by pulling it from tip to hinge or by pulling and cutting it off with knife.  The tomato sauce, without mussels, can be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  green beans -- ends trimmed
  1              pound  yellow wax beans -- ends trimmed
  12            cloves  Roasted Garlic -- (listed below)
  20                    grape or cherry tomatoes -- halved
     1/4           cup  Sun-Dried Tomato And Basil Vinaigrette -- (see recipe)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sea salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ROASTED GARLIC ===
  2              whole  heads garlic
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Make an ice-water bath.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add both kinds of beans, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the beans are just tender.  Drain and place in the bowl of ice water for a few minutes.

When the beans are cool, drain immediately and place them in a large bowl.  Add the garlic, tomatoes, and vinaigrette and toss until mixed.  Season with the salt and pepper.

Roasted Garlic:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cut off the top 1/3 of the garlic heads crosswise to expose the cloves.  Drizzle each head with 1 tablespoon of the oil and wrap in aluminum foil.  Place the garlic on a baking sheet and roast in the oven for about 40 minutes, or until soft.  Allow to cool, then squeeze garlic cloves out of their skins.

Store the garlic in plastic wrap or covered with olive oil in a glass jar.  The roasted garlic will keep for about 2 weeks in the refrigerator. (Makes 2 heads of garlic)

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  russet potatoes
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Scrub the potatoes well and dry with paper towels.  Poke several holes in them with a skewer to allow steam to escape.  Place the potatoes on a small baking sheet and bake, uncovered, until tender, about 1 hour.

Allow the potatoes to cool to room temperature.  Refrigerate in a plastic bag with a resealable closure overnight.

Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/3-inch dice.  Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and add the onion.  Cook, stirring often, until softened, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Use a slotted spoon to transfer the onion to a small bowl.

Add the vegetable oil to the skillet and heat until almost smoking.  Add the potatoes and leave to form a crisp crust.  Do not disturb the potatoes until the crust is formed, about 5 minutes.  Check to see if a crust has formed; if so, give a quick stir.  If not, continue cooking for another 1 to 2 minutes, until the crust has formed.

With a spatula, turn over large chunks of the crusted potatoes.  Season with salt and pepper and continue cooking until golden brown.  Stir in the onion, season again with salt and pepper, and stir until the hash is heated through, about 3 minutes.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Ices/Sorbets

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  water
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
  2 1/2           cups  strained fresh pink grapefruit juice
  1           teaspoon  grenadine - (to 2)
  4        tablespoons  strained fresh lemon juice - (to 6)
  2          teaspoons  Pernod

Combine the water and sugar in a small saucepan and bring it to a simmer over a medium flame.  Stir until all the sugar is dissolved.  Allow the syrup to cool, then chill it for at least 1 hour.

Combine the syrup with the grapefruit juice, 1 teaspoon of grenadine, 4 tablespoons of lemon juice, and the Pernod.  Taste.  Now add more lemon juice if needed ó this will depend on the acidity of all the fruit.  Remember, this sorbet should not be too sweet.  Add more grenadine if you want it to be pinker.

Chill the mixture for 2 hours, then freeze it in an ice cream maker, according to manufacturer's instructions.

This recipe yields about 1 quart.

Comments:  Living in a citrus-growing area, I've found out how much these fruits change once they're off the tree.  Use the freshest fruit you can get your hands on.  If you're fortunate enough to have a tree or know someone who does, pick the grapefruits when you're ready to squeeze the juice and make the sorbet.  You'll have a great treat.

Combine the water and sugar in a small saucepan and bring it to a simmer over a medium flame.  Stir until all the sugar is dissolved.  Allow the syrup to cool, then chill it for at least 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the syrup with the grapefruit juice, 1 teaspoon of grenadine, 4 tablespoons of lemon juice, and the Pernod.  Taste.  Now add more lemon juice if needed ó this will depend on the acidity of all the fruit.  Remember, this sorbet should not be too sweet.  Add more grenadine if you want it to be pinker.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Chill the mixture for 2 hours, then freeze it in an ice cream maker, according to manufacturer&apos;s instructions.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 1 quart.

Comments:  Living in a citrus-growing area, I&apos;ve found out how much these fruits change once they&apos;re off the tree.  Use the freshest fruit you can get your hands on.  If you&apos;re fortunate enough to have a tree or know someone who does, pick the grapefruits when you&apos;re ready to squeeze the juice and make the sorbet.  You&apos;ll have a great treat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TARRAGON SAUCE ===
  4                     large bunche fresh tarragon - (abt 1 oz to
  2                     large bunche fresh chives - (abt 2/3 oz)
  2              large  shallots
  1 1/2           cups  fresh flat-leaf parsley
  2               cups  mayonnaise
     2/3           cup  rice vinegar (not seasoned)
  4          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SALMON ===
  5               cups  dry white wine
  5               cups  water
  6             pounds  skin-on salmon fillet
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
     1/2         pound  cooked sugar snap peas -- diagonally cut into
                        thirds

Make the Sauce:  Pick enough tarragon leaves to measure 1 cup (do not pack).  Chop enough chives to measure 2/3 cup.  Coarsely chop shallot.  In a food processor puree tarragon, chives, and shallot with remaining sauce ingredients until smooth and season with salt and pepper.  (Sauce may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring sauce to cool room temperature before serving.)

Make the Salmon:  Bring the wine and water to a simmer in a large, deep skillet with a tight-fitting lid.  Cut salmon into 12 pieces and season with salt and pepper.  Submerge 3 salmon pieces, skin-sides down, in simmering liquid (add hot water, if necessary, to just cover salmon) and poach at a bare simmer, covered, 8 minutes, or until just cooked through.  Transfer cooked salmon with a slotted spatula to a platter to cool and poach remaining salmon in same manner.  When salmon is cool enough to handle, peel off skin and if desired with a sharp knife scrape off any dark meat.  Salmon may be cooked 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring salmon to cool room temperature before serving.

When ready to serve, spoon sauce onto a large serving platter or divide among 12 plates and garnish with peas.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  white fennel bulbs
  3              large  yellow onions
  5        tablespoons  fruity green olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     2/3           cup  dry red wine
  2              large  leeks, white only -- sliced
                        = (abt 1 1/2 cups)
  1           teaspoon  butter
  6               cups  any low-fat vegetable broth - (to 7)
  1                cup  coarse or regular polenta -- (yellow cornmeal)
  3             ounces  Gorgonzola
                        Chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves

Trim the fennel bulbs, wash them well, cut them in halves lengthwise, and then slice them about 1/4-inch thick.  Peel the onions and slice them the same way.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large non-stick pan and cook the fennel and onions in it slowly, stirring often, adding a little salt and pepper, to taste, until they are completely soft and golden brown.  Stir in the wine, and continue cooking until almost all the liquid is gone, then set the pan aside.

Clean the leeks thoroughly, cut them in halves lengthwise, then slice them quite thinly crosswise.  Heat the remaining olive oil and the butter in a non-stick pan and saute the leeks, stirring them often, until they are soft and beginning to color.  Add a little sprinkle of saltóbut not too much.

Heat 6 cups of broth in a medium-sized saucepan and whisk in the polenta.  Lower the heat and simmer the polenta, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, or at least very often, until it is thick and smooth, about 30 minutes.  Stir in the sauteed leeks; break the Gorgonzola into chunks and stir it in.  Keep stirring until the cheese is all melted into the cornmeal.  The polenta should be thick and smooth, but not stiff.  If it is holding a shape as you stir it, gradually mix in a bit more vegetable broth.

Meanwhile, warm up the caramelized fennel and onion mixture.  This too could be moistened with a bit of vegetable broth, if needed.

Ladle the polenta into warm, shallow bowls or onto warm plates, and spoon some of the fennel and onion mixture around the polenta.  Scatter some fresh flat-leaf parsley across the top and serve at once with a good red wine.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  3              large  red potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  1                cup  diced onion

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  Annatto Oil -- (see recipe)
  1                     Scotch bonnet chile -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and minced
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2        medium  Spanish onion -- diced
  1                     carrot -- peeled, diced
  1                     celery stalk -- diced
  2              small  bay leaves -- broken in half
  1                cup  long-grain white rice
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock -- warmed

Melt the butter with the Annatto Oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the Scotch bonnet and garlic, stir, and cook for 15 seconds.  Add the onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaves and stir well.  Allow the vegetables to cook, stirring frequently, until well-glazed, about 10 minutes.

Stir in the rice, salt and pepper.  Add the chicken stock, stir once and bring to a simmer, then immediately turn the heat down to very low.  Cover and cook until the rice has absorbed the stock, 12 to 15 minutes.  Cover and let stand for 5 minutes, then serve.

This recipe yields 3 1/2 cups.

Comments:  Red rice gets its color from annatto seeds, also called achiote, a word that comes from Nahuatl, the Aztec language.  Achiote comes from a plant native to Mexico, and it gives this rice a subtle vegetable flavor.  This goes well with Poulet a la Creole.  It can be kept warm, covered, in a warm spot, for 20 to 30 minutes before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BEEF AND SAUCE ===
  1                     beef tenderloin roast - (abt 4 lbs) -- trimmed and tied
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2               cups  dry white wine
  4             medium  shallots -- minced
  4          teaspoons  dried tarragon
  16                    cornichons (French pickles) -- julienned
                        = (or dill gherkins)
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  4        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  4          teaspoons  minced fresh tarragon leaves
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Green Beans With Red Onion And
                        Mustard Vinaigrette -- (see recipe)
                        Roasted cauliflower florets -- as needed
                        Roasted halved new potatoes -- as needed
                        = (tossed with olive oil and chopped
                        rosemary leaves)
                        Roasted baby carrots -- as needed
                        = (tossed with butter and chopped chives)
                        Roasted cherry or grape tomatoes -- as needed

Make the Beef and Sauce:  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and season the tenderloin with salt and pepper.  Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until almost smoking.  Add the roast and cook, turning often, until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes.  Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 25 to 30 minutes or until a meat thermometer inserted into the center registers 130 degrees for medium-rare.  Transfer the roast to a warmed platter and cover loosely with foil.

Place the roasting skillet on top of the stove, being careful not to touch the hot handle with bare hands.  Add the wine, shallots, and dried tarragon and bring to a boil over high heat.  Cook rapidly, stirring to pick up any browned bits in the bottom of the skillet, until reduced to 1/4 cup.  Add the cornichons, cream and any meat juices that have accumulated on the platter.  Simmer for 3 minutes longer.  Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the butter, mustard, fresh tarragon, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Cut the beef crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices.  Decoratively arrange the beef, sauce, and garnish on a large platter.  Serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  When people phone the show and ask for a great, easy-to-prepare entree for a crowd, I always recommend roasting tenderloin of beef.  It's expensive, but you get 100 percent yield out of the cut, it slices up easily and elegantly, and it's delicious served hot or at room temperature.  You can even serve it chilled, with horseradish sauce, say, at a backyard party.  Whip up the horseradish sauce from scratch by mixing together sour cream, lemon juice, prepared or freshly grated horseradish (soak the freshly grated stuff in a little white wine vinegar first), and salt and pepper, to taste.  If you're serving your roast hot, you can still season and sear it about 1 hour before your guests arrive, then put it in the oven about 50 minutes before you want to eat it.  This recipe's sauce, made in the pan in which the tenderloin was roasted, takes advantage of the roast's succulent drippings.

A special occasion dish calls for a special occasion wine.  Match your succulent roast tenderloin with the best medium/full-bodied red in the house.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     fresh ears corn -- husks on
     1/2           cup  JalapeÒo Mayonnaise -- (see recipe)
  3               cups  finely-shredded queso fresco
                        === GUAJILLO CHILE POWDER ===
  4                     guajillo chiles -- seeded
  3                     chiles de arbol
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

Preheat a grill or grill pan.  Grill the corn, turning frequently, to avoid over charring, about 10 minutes.

Let the corn cool just enough to handle and peel back the husks, leaving them attached at the bottom.  (The husks are going to serve as handles when eating the corn.)  Remove the corn silk and generously spread the ears with mayonnaise.  Sprinkle the corn with the cheese and chile powder.  Serve immediately.

Guajillo Chile Powder:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Put the chiles on a small baking sheet and bake until browned, about 3 minutes.  Let cool.

In a clean coffee or spice grinder, finely grind the chiles and transfer to a bowl.  Stir in the salt and use as desired.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 tablespoons.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     'baby' chickens - (3 1/2 lbs ea)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Classic BBQ Rub -- (see recipe)
                        = (or salt and fresh ground pepper)
                        Sassy Brown Sugar and Bourbon Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        = (or favorite bbq sauce)

Build charcoal fire or preheat gas grill.  Using poultry shears or a chef's knife, split chicken down the breast bone to cut the chicken in half.  Brush lightly with olive oil on all surfaces and sprinkle with salt and pepper or Classic BBQ Rub.  Set aside.

Using a rib holder, place the 4 chicken halves vertically skin-side facing out in each of the 4 slots.  The chicken in the holder will resemble slices of toast in an old-fashioned toast holder.  Place the rib/chicken holder in the center of the cooking grate over indirect medium-low heat (making sure no heat is directly under the chicken.)  Grill for 1 hour, or until chicken registers 185 degrees in the thickest part of the thigh.  After 30 minutes, check the internal temperature with an instant-read thermometer.  Brush liberally with barbecue sauce during the final 15 to 20 minutes only.  If the chicken is sauced too early, it will burn on the outside before the interior meat is cooked through.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2           cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  American-style chile sauce
     1/4           cup  apple-cider vinegar
     1/8           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
  2          teaspoons  Classic BBQ Rub -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  unsweetened cocoa
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large saucepan on the stove, add tomatoes, sugar, molasses, bourbon, ketchup, chile sauce, vinegars, and Worcestershire sauce, stirring after each additional ingredient to combine.  Add the classic spice rub and simmer until the flavors have blended and the sauce has thickened somewhat, about 30 minutes.

Let the sauce cool for about 10 minutes or until it is warm but no longer "boiling" hot.  Puree using an immersion or traditional blender.  Taste and adjust seasonings with salt, about 1/2 teaspoon, and freshly ground pepper.  Remember, the ribs will have plenty of spice rub on them, so don't over-season the sauce.  Add the cocoa powder and mix well to combine.  Let sit 5 minutes and stir again to make sure cocoa powder is well distributed.  Let cool and pour into a clean glass jar for storing.  The sauce can be made in advance and kept for 2 weeks in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields 4 cups.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     limes -- zested
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
                        === CHIMICHURRI ===
  1                     Spanish onion
     1/3           cup  olive oil
     1/3           cup  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  1              bunch  fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1              bunch  fresh cilantro leaves
  3             sprigs  fresh oregano -- leaves picked
  2                     large cloves garlic
  1                     jalapeÒo -- stemmed and chopped
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Make the Green Rice:  Combine the water and rice in saucepan with a tight-fitting lid.  Season the water with salt.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, covered, until tender, about 20 minutes.  Set the rice aside, covered, for 10 minutes.  Fluff the rice with a fork and stir in the chimichurri.  Set aside, covered, until ready to use.

Meanwhile, make the Black Beans:  Heat the oil in the saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the cumin seeds and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the bell pepper and onion and cook, stirring, until soft, about 8 minutes.  Stir in the black beans and sugar.  Bring to boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add the vinegar and season with salt and pepper.  Set aside, covered, until ready to use.

Make the Salsa:  Preheat a grill pan over high heat.  Grill the pineapple rings, turning once, until charred, about 2 minutes.  Transfer the rings to a cutting board and chop.

In a bowl, combine the pineapple, mango, bell pepper, onion, cilantro, olive oil, ginger, jalapeÒo, and lime juice.  Season with salt and pepper and set aside.  (The salsa can be prepared up to 2 days in advance.)

Make the Mahi Mahi:  Arrange the fillets in baking pan, season with salt and pepper, and rub with the zest.  Preheat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes.  Raise the heat to high and heat the butter and oil.  Working in batches, if necessary, sear the halibut fillets, turning once, until well browned and just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.

Divide the rice and beans among the center of 6 plates, top with the fillets, and spoon some the salsa over each.

Make the Chimichurri:  In a food processor, pulse the onion until finely chopped but not pureed.  Transfer the onion to a bowl.  Add the olive oil, lime juice, parsley, cilantro, oregano leaves, garlic, and jalapeÒo and pulse until finely chopped.  Transfer the herb mixture to the bowl with the onion and stir to combine.  Season the chimichurri with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Hors d'Oeuvres
                Mushrooms

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter
  8             ounces  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems discarded,
                        and caps finely chopped
  2                     shallots -- minced
     1/4           cup  water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh tarragon leaves
  2              whole  large eggs
  6              large  egg whites
     1/4           cup  finely-shredded Parmesan
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        Freshly-grated black pepper -- to taste
  8                     thin slices prosciutto
  24                    thin fresh chives -- lightly blanched

Melt butter in a 9- to 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat; then cook mushrooms and shallots, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes.  Add water and cook, stirring, until liquid is evaporated and mushrooms are tender and golden, about 5 minutes.  Stir in tarragon.

While mushrooms are cooking, lightly beat together whole eggs, whites, Parmesan, kosher salt, and pepper, to taste.

Preheat broiler.

Add egg mixture to mushrooms; then cook over high heat, stirring briskly, until eggs are softly scrambled, 2 to 4 minutes.  Reduce heat to low and form frittata into a 6 1/2-inch square with a spatula.  Cook over low heat until bottom is set, about 2 minutes.

Place skillet under broiler (wrap nonmetal handles in foil), 5 to 6 inches from heat, and broil until eggs are just firm to the touch and barely golden, 1 to 2 minutes.

Transfer frittata to a cutting board and cool.  Trim edges of square, then cut frittata into 24 rectangles.

Cut each prosciutto slice lengthwise into 3 strips.  Wrap a prosciutto strip lengthwise around each egg rectangle, then tie a chive around crosswise.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 24 hors d'oeuvres.

Cooks' Note:  Frittata squares can be made a day ahead and chilled, covered with a dampened paper towel, then with plastic wrap.  Bring to room temperature before serving.

Melt butter in a 9- to 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat; then cook mushrooms and shallots, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes.  Add water and cook, stirring, until liquid is evaporated and mushrooms are tender and golden, about 5 minutes.  Stir in tarragon.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While mushrooms are cooking, lightly beat together whole eggs, whites, Parmesan, kosher salt, and pepper, to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat broiler.

<DirT>
Add egg mixture to mushrooms; then cook over high heat, stirring briskly, until eggs are softly scrambled, 2 to 4 minutes.  Reduce heat to low and form frittata into a 6 1/2-inch square with a spatula.  Cook over low heat until bottom is set, about 2 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place skillet under broiler (wrap nonmetal handles in foil), 5 to 6 inches from heat, and broil until eggs are just firm to the touch and barely golden, 1 to 2 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer frittata to a cutting board and cool.  Trim edges of square, then cut frittata into 24 rectangles.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut each prosciutto slice lengthwise into 3 strips.  Wrap a prosciutto strip lengthwise around each egg rectangle, then tie a chive around crosswise.  Serve at room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 24 hors d&apos;oeuvres.

<DirT>
Cooks&apos; Note:  Frittata squares can be made a day ahead and chilled, covered with a dampened paper towel, then with plastic wrap.  Bring to room temperature before serving.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for the pans
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  fine salt
  1           teaspoon  cocoa powder
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable oil
  1                cup  buttermilk -- room temperature
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  red food coloring - (1 oz)
  1           teaspoon  white distilled vinegar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === CREAM CHEESE FROSTING ===
  1              pound  cream cheese -- softened
  4               cups  sifted confectioners' sugar
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Crushed pecans -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil and flour 3 (9- by 1 1/2-inch round) cake pans.

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder.  In another large bowl, whisk together the oil, buttermilk, eggs, food coloring, vinegar, and vanilla.

Using a standing mixer, mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined and a smooth batter is formed.

Divide the cake batter evenly among the prepared cake pans.  Place the pans in the oven evenly spaced apart.  Bake, rotating the pans halfway through the cooking, until the cake pulls away from the side of the pans, and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

Remove the cakes from the oven and run a knife around the edges to loosen them from the sides of the pans.  One at a time, invert the cakes onto a plate and then re-invert them onto a cooling rack, rounded-sides up.  Let cool completely.

Frost the cake.  Place 1 layer, rounded-side down, in the middle of a rotating cake stand.  Using a palette knife or offset spatula spread some of the cream cheese frosting over the top of the cake.  (Spread enough frosting to make a 1/4- to 1/2-inch layer.)  Carefully set another layer on top, rounded-side down, and repeat.  Top with the remaining layer and cover the entire cake with the remaining frosting.  Sprinkle the top with the pecans.

Cream Cheese Frosting:  In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a hand-held electric mixer in a large bowl, mix the cream cheese, sugar, and butter on low speed until incorporated.  Increase the speed to high, and mix until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.  (Occasionally turn the mixer off, and scrape the down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.)

Reduce the speed of the mixer to low.  Add the vanilla, raise the speed to high and mix briefly until fluffy (scrape down the bowl occasionally).  Store in the refrigerator until somewhat stiff, before using.  May be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days.  (Makes enough to frost a 3 layer (9-inch) cake)

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  32                    corn tortillas - (6" dia)
                        About 1/2 cup vegetable oil

  1           teaspoon  sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Brush both sides of tortillas with oil and with scissors cut each tortilla into about 5 randomly shaped wavy strips.  In 2 large shallow baking pans arrange 1/2 of strips in 1 layer.  (Strips should curl up on their own, but if necessary gently twist or fold them over.)

In a small bowl combine chili powder, salt, and sugar and through a small sieve sprinkle 1/2 of mixture over tortilla strips in pans.  Bake tortilla strips in upper and lower thirds of oven until just crisp, 6 to 8 minutes, and transfer to paper towels to cool.  Make more chips in same manner with remaining tortilla strips and chili mixture.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

            Spicy Roasted Squash Soup With Pumpernickel Toast

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === WITCH CROUTONS ===
  15            slices  pumpernickel bread
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter (1/4 cup) -- softened
                        === SOUP ===
  1                     butternut squash - (12 lbs) -- halved lengthwise,
                        and seeded
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh jalapeÒo chile -- including seeds
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  7               cups  chicken broth or water
  5               cups  water -- plus
                        additional for thinning
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice -- or to taste
                        Hot Sauce -- as needed
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Witch-shaped cookie cutter

Make the Witch Croutons:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Trim and discard crusts from bread.  Spread 1 side of each slice evenly with butter and season with salt and pepper.  Cut into witch shapes with cookie cutter and arrange, buttered-side up, on a baking sheet.  Toast bread, turning once, in middle of oven until golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Transfer the croutons to a rack to cool.

Make the Soup:  Put squash, cut-side down, in a greased shallow baking pan and roast in the oven until very tender, about 1 1/4 hours.  Cool and scoop out flesh.

Puree squash in batches in a blender with jalapeÒo, cumin, and broth until very smooth (add water, as needed, to facilitate pureeing).  Transfer to a 6- to 8-quart heavy pot and stir in the 5 cups of water.  Simmer, stirring, for 10 minutes, then stir in lemon juice, enough water to thin to desired consistency, and salt and pepper, to taste.

Divide soup among bowls, top with a witch crouton, and drizzle drops of hot sauce around the sides.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Cooks' Notes:  Toasts may be made 2 days ahead, cooled completely, and kept between layers of paper towels or waxed paper in an airtight container, at room temperature.  The squash puree may be made 2 days ahead.  Cool completely; then chill, covered.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PANNA COTTA ===
  3               cups  sliced strawberries - (1 lb)
  1 3/4           cups  well-shaken low-fat buttermilk
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  2 1/2      teaspoons  unflavored gelatin
                        = (from less than two 1/4-oz envelopes)
     1/4           cup  whole milk
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
                        === COMPOTE ===
  2 1/2           cups  strawberries - (3/4 lb) -- trimmed
                        = (preferably small berries)
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
  2          teaspoons  superfine granulated sugar
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
  6                     six-oz stainless-steel or ceramic molds

Make panna cotta:  Blend strawberries, buttermilk, and sugar in a blender until very smooth.  Pour through a very fine sieve into a medium bowl, pressing hard on solids and scraping the bottom of the sieve.  Discard solids.

Sprinkle gelatin over milk in a small bowl and let stand 1 minute to soften.

Bring cream to a boil in a small saucepan.  Remove from heat and add gelatin mixture, stirring until dissolved.

Whisk cream mixture into strawberry puree and pour into molds.  Chill molds, covered, until firm, at least 8 hours.

To unmold:  Dip molds in a small bowl of hot water 2 or 3 seconds, then invert onto dessert plates and remove molds.  Let stand at room temperature 20 minutes to soften slightly.

Make compote while panna cottas stand:  Halve strawberries lengthwise if small, or quarter if larger.  Whisk together orange juice and superfine sugar in a bowl until sugar is dissolved and add strawberries, tossing to coat.  Set the compote aside to macerate for 10 minutes.

Serve panna cotta with compote.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cooks' Note:  Panna cotta can be chilled in molds, covered, up to 2 days.

                            Stuffed Artichokes

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  artichokes
  5                     garlic cloves - (to 6)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil - (to 3)
  3             pounds  tomatoes
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil leaves
  3        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2    tablespoon  vinegar or lemon juice -- (optional)
  2               cups  coarse breadcrumbs - (to 2 1/2)
                        = (from a good country loaf)
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan

Trim off and discard the stems of the artichokes, leaving about 1/2 inch.  Scrub the artichokes clean under running water.  Using sharp scissors, cut 1/2 inch off the top of each leaf, and with a very sharp knife slice about 1-inch off the top of the artichoke.

To a large kettle of boiling salted water, add 2 or 3 whole garlic cloves and 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  Cook the artichokes, covered, for 45 to 55 minutes, or until tender.  Remove them carefully with tongs or a big slotted spoon, and place them upside-down on a rack to drain as they cool.

To make the filling, cut the tomatoes into 1/4-inch dice and chop the remaining garlic.  Mix the tomatoes and garlic with the chopped herbs, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil, and a touch of vinegar or lemon juice if you want it.  Stir in most of the bread crumbs, check the consistency, then stir in more as needed to make a fairly thick mixture.  Finally, add the Parmesan.

When the artichokes are cool enough to handle turn them right-side up and gently pull open the leaves from the center of each one.  Pull out the thin leaves from the very center and then scrape out the fibrous choke with a teaspoon.

Spoon some of the filling into the center cavity of each artichoke, then spoon a bit more here and there between the leaves.  Distribute it evenly between the 6 artichokes, using about 2/3 cup for each.  A little bit more olive oil can be drizzled over the artichokes just before serving.

Serve these at room temperature or chilled, and don't hold them longer than 3 or 4 hours.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Trim off and discard the stems of the artichokes, leaving about 1/2 inch.  Scrub the artichokes clean under running water.  Using sharp scissors, cut 1/2 inch off the top of each leaf, and with a very sharp knife slice about 1-inch off the top of the artichoke.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To a large kettle of boiling salted water, add 2 or 3 whole garlic cloves and 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  Cook the artichokes, covered, for 45 to 55 minutes, or until tender.  Remove them carefully with tongs or a big slotted spoon, and place them upside-down on a rack to drain as they cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the filling, cut the tomatoes into 1/4-inch dice and chop the remaining garlic.  Mix the tomatoes and garlic with the chopped herbs, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil, and a touch of vinegar or lemon juice if you want it.  Stir in most of the bread crumbs, check the consistency, then stir in more as needed to make a fairly thick mixture.  Finally, add the Parmesan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the artichokes are cool enough to handle turn them right-side up and gently pull open the leaves from the center of each one.  Pull out the thin leaves from the very center and then scrape out the fibrous choke with a teaspoon.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon some of the filling into the center cavity of each artichoke, then spoon a bit more here and there between the leaves.  Distribute it evenly between the 6 artichokes, using about 2/3 cup for each.  A little bit more olive oil can be drizzled over the artichokes just before serving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve these at room temperature or chilled, and don&apos;t hold them longer than 3 or 4 hours.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dried bread crumbs
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed
  3              large  eggs -- beaten
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  2                     lengthwise 1/4"-thk slices eggplant -- peeled
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     thin veal cutlets - (abt 3 oz) -- pounded very thin
                        between 2 sheets of plastic wrap
  1              ounce  thinly-sliced prosciutto
  2                     rectangles fresh mozzarella 1/2" by 2" -- plus
  2                     thin slices fresh mozzarella
  2               cups  homemade or store bought tomato sauce
                        Grated Parmesan -- as needed

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Put the bread crumbs, flour, and eggs each in separate shallow, lipped plates.

Pour the oil in a medium skillet to a depth of 1/2-inch, and heat over medium-high heat.  Dredge the eggplant in the flour, shake off any excess, and then dip in the eggs.  Add the eggplant to the skillet and fry, turning once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and season with salt and pepper.

Season the veal with salt and pepper, and dredge in the bread crumbs.  Lay 1/2 of the prosciutto over each veal cutlet, place 1 rectangle of the mozzarella along the center of each, and roll tightly.  Tuck in the ends of the rolls and press to seal.  Dip each roll in the eggs, add to the skillet and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned, about 4 minutes.

Meanwhile, spread about 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce on 1 side of each eggplant slice, and sprinkle with some of the Parmesan.  Wrap each veal roll in an eggplant slice

Spread about 2 tablespoons of the tomato sauce in the bottom of a small, shallow baking dish or skillet and arrange the veal rolls on top.  Spoon the remaining 2 tablespoons of sauce on top of the rolls and cover with the mozzarella slices.  Sprinkle with a little Parmesan and bake in the oven until hot and browned, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Using a spatula, transfer the veal rolls to a plate and serve.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     frozen pie shell - (9" dia) -- thawed
  3              large  tomatoes - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- cut 1/2"-thk slices
                        Kosher salt -- for sprinkling
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
  1                cup  coarsely-grated Gruyere
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Additional kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Line the shell with foil and fill with pie weights, dried beans, or rice.  Bake in the lower third of the oven for 20 minutes.  Carefully remove the weights and foil.  Return to the oven and bake for 10 minutes more or until light golden.  Cool in the pan on a wire rack.

Turn up the oven to 400 degrees.

Sprinkle the tomatoes with salt and drain in a colander for 10 to 15 minutes.  Spread the mustard over the bottom of the shell and sprinkle the cheese over it.  Arrange the tomatoes over the cheese in 1 overlapping layer.  Bake until the pastry is golden brown and the tomatoes are very soft, 35 to 40 minutes.

In a small bowl, stir together the parsley, thyme, garlic, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste to blend.  Sprinkle the pie with this mixture while hot and spread out gently with the back of a spoon.  Serve the pie hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  3              large  unripe (green) or
                        barely ripe (slightly yellow) plantains - -- (to 4)
  2               cups  olive or canola oil -- for frying

With a sharp small knife cut ends from each plantain and cut a lengthwise slit through skin.  Cut plantains crosswise into 1-inch-thick pieces and, beginning at slit, pry skin from pieces.  In a 12-inch nonstick skillet heat 1/2-inch oil over moderate heat until just hot enough to sizzle when a plantain piece is added.  Fry plantains in batches, without crowding, until tender and just golden, 2 to 3 minutes on each side.  With tongs transfer plantains as fried to paper towels to drain.

Remove skillet from heat and reserve oil.  With the bottom of a heavy saucepan or a wide solid metal spatula flatten plantains to 1/4-inch thick (about 3 inches in diameter).  Into a bowl of warm salted water dip flattened plantains, 1 at a time, and drain them well on paper towels.

Heat reserved oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and fry flattened plantains in batches, without crowding, until golden, about 3 minutes.  With tongs transfer tostones as fried to paper towels to drain and season with salt if desired.

Serve tostones immediately.

This recipe yields 18 to 24 tostones.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     vanilla beans
  3               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  whole milk
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  3              large  eggs

With a knife halve vanilla beans lengthwise.  Scrape seeds into a large heavy saucepan and stir in pods, cream, milk, and sugar.  Bring mixture just to a boil, stirring occasionally, and remove pan from heat.

In a large bowl lightly beat eggs.  Add hot cream mixture to eggs in a slow stream, whisking, and pour into pan.  Cook custard over moderately-low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard thickly coats the back of a spoon, or until a thermometer registers 170 degrees.  (Do not let boil.)  Pour custard through a sieve into a clean bowl.  Place the bowl in a large bowl of ice water and let the custard chill, stirring occasionally.

Freeze custard in an ice-cream maker, in 2 batches if necessary.  Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden.  Ice cream may be made 1 week ahead.

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 quarts.

Variation 1:  To make chocolate ice cream, put 1/2 pound of finely chopped bittersweet chocolate in a large bowl, and pour the hot thickened custard over the top.  Let sit for 1 minute, and stir until smooth.  Chill and freeze as above.

Variation 2:  To make strawberry ice cream, hull and slice 1 pound (1 1/4 pints) fresh strawberries, puree in a food processor.  Transfer the puree to a bowl, stir in 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and chill.  Add the puree to the chilled custard and freeze as above.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === POACHED VANILLA PEACHES ===
  2               cups  water
  1                cup  sugar
  1                     vanilla bean -- split
  8                     peaches -- split, and
                        seeds removed
                        === WHIPPED MINTED YOGURT ===
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  mint leaves - (loosely packed)
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  full-fat Greek yogurt
                        Mint sprigs -- for garnish
                        Raspberries -- for garnish

Make the Peaches:  Place the water, sugar, and vanilla bean in a medium saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved.  Once the sugar has dissolved, remove the vanilla bean and scrape the inside of the bean into the liquid.  Add as many peaches to the pan as it will hold without piling or crowding, and poach over a low simmer for about 8 minutes or until the fruit is soft.  Remove the peaches and finish poaching the remainder of the fruits.  When done, place the peaches in a glass baking dish, cut-side down.  Pour the vanilla syrup over the peaches, and refrigerate until chilled, for up to 8 hours.

For the Yogurt:  Place the water and sugar in a small saucepan, stir and simmer until sugar is dissolved.  Add the mint leaves and simmer for 2 minutes, remove from heat, cover and let stand for 5 minutes.  Strain and chill the syrup.

In a bowl, whip the syrup and cream with a hand-held mixer until stiff.  In another bowl, whip the yogurt until smooth and fold it into the cream mixture.

To serve the peaches:  Place 2 peach halves in a shallow bowl, and dollop with some of the minted yogurt cream.  Garnish with fresh mint sprigs and raspberries.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BEEF ===
  2             pounds  flank steak -- cut 2" strips
  8               cups  beef stock
     1/2                yellow onion -- chopped
     1/4         bunch  cilantro leaves -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1                     bay leaf
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === TAQUITOS ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  5                     plum tomatoes -- cored, diced
  1                     yellow onion -- diced
     1/4         bunch  cilantro leaves -- chopped
  1                     chipotle en adobo -- chopped
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  16                    corn tortillas
                        Flour and water -- as needed
                        === RED RICE ===
  6                     plum tomatoes -- roasted
     1/2                yellow onion -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
  2               cups  white rice
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  diced carrot
     1/2           cup  fresh green peas

Make the Beef:  In a large pot, combine the steak, stock, onion, cilantro, garlic, and bay.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer until very tender, about 2 hours.  Remove bay leaf.  Let cool and shred the beef.  (Strain the stock and reserve for another use.)

Meanwhile, make the Taquitos:  Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the tomato, onion, cilantro, and chipotle and cook, stirring, until soft.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Let cool and mix with the shredded beef.

In a large saucepan, pour the oil to a depth of 2 inches.  Heat the oil over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil reads 365 degrees.  Working in batches, fry the tortillas until just limp (not crisp!), about 2 to 3 seconds.

Mix a little flour and water together in a small bowl to make a paste.  Fill each tortilla with about 1 1/2 ounces of the beef filling and roll to form a tube.  Seal each taquito with the paste.  Refrigerate the taquitos until ready to serve.

Make the Red Beans:  Puree the tomatoes, onion, and garlic in a blender.

Put the rice in a strainer in the sink and rinse, letting the water run over it for at least 5 minutes.  Drain the rice and shake to remove any excess moisture.

Heat the oil in a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, over medium heat.  Add the rice and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 8 minutes.  Add the tomato puree and stir to combine.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and cook, covered, for 25 minutes.

Remove the rice from the heat and let rest for 10 minutes.  Fluff the rice with a fork.  Stir in the carrots and peas.

Reheat the oil to 365 degrees and fry the taquitos until crispy and hot.  Serve immediately with the rice and beef.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STEAK ===
  2             pounds  tri-tip steak -- cut large chunks
  1                cup  water
     1/4           cup  anejo tequila
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                     serrano chile -- diced
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ENCHILADAS ===
  5               cans  tomatillo sauce - (7 oz ea)
  1 1/2           cups  tomato sauce
  1              pound  pepper Jack cheese -- grated
  3               cans  black beans - (15 1/2 oz ea)
  1                can  diced chiles - (7 oz)
  2              dozen  flour tortillas
                        === EQUIPMENT ===
  2                     baking pans - (9" by 13")

One day ahead, make the steak:  In a slow cooker, combine the steak, water, tequila, garlic, and 1 serrano chile.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and cook, on low, until very tender, about 12 hours or overnight.  Shred the steak.

Make the enchiladas:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Combine the tomatillo and tomato sauces in a saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring, until hot.  Stir in 1/4 cup of the cheese.

Heat the black beans in another saucepan.

Combine little of the sauce, a bit of the black beans, a smidgen of the cheese, small morsels of the steak, and hints of the diced canned chiles in each tortilla and roll, keeping the ends untucked.  Arrange the rolls in the pans and pour the remaining sauce over the top.  Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and remaining chiles.

Cover the pans with foil and bake for 15 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  "Not your mother's enchilada."  This recipe was born during the always-popular Cinco de Mayo office celebration.  While everyone was busy signing up for chips, dips, and salsa, I wanted something different and uniquely authentic, as well as something that could serve as a meal.  The result was a dish that not only was the first to go, but served me personally as a springboard to creative cooking.
