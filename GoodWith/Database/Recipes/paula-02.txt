--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  canned diced tomatoes
  2               cups  tomato sauce
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  diced onion
     1/2           cup  diced green bell pepper
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Italian seasoning
  1 1/2      teaspoons  House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  seasoning salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  2              small  bay leaves
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef
  8             ounces  uncooked angel hair pasta
  1                cup  grated cheddar

Bake in the oven for 30 minutes.  Top the casserole with the remaining cheese, return it to the oven, and continue to cook until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 5 more minutes.  Cut into squares before serving.

                        === CAKE ===
                        Butter -- for greasing pans
  3               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus more for pans
  2               cups  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3                     eggs -- beaten
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
  4              large  ripe bananas -- mashed
  1                cup  chopped pecans
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === FROSTING ===
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  1              pound  confectioners' sugar -- sifted

Butter and flour 3 (9-inch) round cake pans; set aside.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cake:  In a mixing bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.  Add the eggs and oil and stir just until the dry ingredients are moistened; do not beat.  Stir in the banana, pecans, and vanilla.

Frosting:  In a bowl, blend together the cream cheese and butter.  Gradually add the confectioners' sugar and beat until light and fluffy.  Beat in the vanilla.  Stir in the pecans, or reserve them to sprinkle over the frosted cake.

Fill and frost the cake when it is completely cool.

                            Basic 1-2-3-4 Cake

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  2               cups  sugar
  4                     eggs
  3               cups  sifted self-rising flour
  1                cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour 3 (9-inch) cake pans.

Using an electric mixer, cream butter until fluffy.  Add sugar and continue to cream well for 6 to 8 minutes.  Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add flour and milk alternately to creamed mixture, beginning and ending with flour.  Add vanilla and continue to beat until just mixed.

Divide batter equally among prepared pans.  Level batter in each pan by holding pan 3 or 4 inches above counter, then dropping it flat onto counter.  Do this several times to release air bubbles and assure you of a more level cake.

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until done.  Cool in pans 5 to 10 minutes.  Invert cakes onto cooling racks.  Cool completely and spread cake layers with your favorite frosting to make a 3-layer cake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Butter -- for greasing pans
                        Flour -- for dusting pans
  1                     box white cake mix -- mixed according
                        to package directions
                        Red food coloring -- as needed
  1                     conical sugar ice cream cone
  3               cans  chocolate frosting
  1                     eight-inch wooden skewer
  1                     tube marzipan
                        Confectioners' sugar
  2        tablespoons  light corn syrup
                        Colored sugar crystals
                        Decorative candies

Grease and flour 1 (9-inch) round baking pan and 1 (9-inch) square baking pan.  Prepare the cake mix according to package directions, adding a few drops of red food coloring to batter.  Remove cakes from pans and cool completely on wire racks.  Trim the tops of each cake to make them an even thickness.

Cut a 5-inch, 3 1/2-inch, 2 1/2-inch, and a 2-inch circle from the square cake layer.  Press the cutter straight into the cake without twisting.  Twisting can cause the cake to be uneven.  Remove the scraps and use them to fill the ice cream cone.  Pack the scraps firmly into the ice cream cone.

Drape a cake stand with black fabric.  Place 3 pieces of waxed paper around the edges of the stand, leaving an open space in the middle.  Place the large round cake in the center of the stand, on the waxed paper.  The waxed paper will prevent the cake stand from getting dirty while making the cake.  Ice the cake with the chocolate frosting.

Place the 5-inch circle in the center of the cake.  Ice the top completely.  Place the 3 1/2-inch cake in the center of the 5-inch cake.  Ice the top completely.  Place the 2 1/2-inch cake on top of the 3 1/2-inch cake and ice the top.  Place the 2-inch cake on top of the 2 1/2-inch cake and ice the top.  Insert 1 end of the skewer into the cake stuffed ice cream cone.  Press the other end of the skewer through the center of the cake layers to stabilize the cake and attach the ice cream cone.

Fit a pastry bag with a flat, thick tip.  Alternately, use a resealable plastic bag and snip off 1 corner.  Fill the bag with the remaining frosting.  Pipe icing onto the cake from the 5-inch layer, up to the tip of the cone.  Using this method, pipe icing all around the cake.  Don't worry if everything is covered.  Once the icing is roughly piped on, holding the tip of the ice cream cone, spread it evenly on the cake with a spatula.

To make the hat band:  Cut a 2-inch piece of marzipan off the tube.  Dust a work surface with confectioners' sugar.  Place a few drops of food coloring on the marzipan and knead with your hand until desired color is reached.  Roll out the marzipan, dusting the surface with confectioners' sugar as necessary to prevent sticking.  Roll out to a 17-inch long rectangle that is about 1/8-inch thick.  Cut into a 16-inch long by 1-inch wide strip.  Brush the strip lightly with corn syrup.  Sprinkle with colored sugar crystals.  Set aside to dry for 15 minutes.  Use extra marzipan for another purpose.

Wrap the hatband around the 5-inch cake.  Decorate the cake with candy.  Hold the cake still with a spatula and gently pull out the waxed paper.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8                     tenderized beef round steaks - (4 oz ea)
                        = (have butcher run them through cubing
                        machine)
  1           teaspoon  House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  seasoning salt
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  4               cups  hot water
     1/2      teaspoon  monosodium glutamate -- (optional)
                        = (Ac'cent recommended)
  1              bunch  green onions -- sliced
                        = (or 1 medium yellow onion)

Combine 1 1/2 cups flour and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper in a small bowl.  Sprinkle 1 side of the meat with the House Seasoning and the other side with the seasoning salt, and then dredge the meat in the flour mixture.

Heat 1/2 cup oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 2 or 4 of the steaks to the hot oil, and fry until browned, about 5 to 6 minutes per side.  Remove each steak to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.  Repeat with the remaining steaks, adding up to 1/4 cup more oil, as needed.

Make the gravy by adding the 2 tablespoons remaining flour to the pan drippings, scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon.  Stir in the remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and the salt.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until the flour is medium-brown and the mixture is bubbly.  Slowly add the water and the Ac'cent, if using, stirring constantly.

Return the steaks to the skillet and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to low, and place the onions on top of the steaks.  Cover the pan, and let simmer for 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                            Cheese Ball Goblin

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 20    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature,
                        plus
  2           packages  whipped cream cheese - (8 oz ea)
  4        tablespoons  butter -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  milk
  2               cups  shredded mixed cheeses
                        = (such as cheeses for tacos)
                        Green food coloring -- as needed
  2              large  tortilla chips
  1              whole  pepperoncini pepper
  2                     pimiento-stuffed olives
  1                     red bell pepper -- cut 2 thin strips,
                        and 6 small triangles
  6                     pitted green olives
  20             small  carrot sticks
  3               cups  shredded red cabbage
                        Toothpicks
                        Assorted crackers
                        Assorted vegetables

Place 2 packages of cream cheese, butter, and milk in a mixing bowl, scraping down the sides of the bowl a few times.  Beat with an electric mixer until smooth and combined.  Add the shredded cheese and mix until well combined.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or up to 24 hours.

Remove the chilled cheese mixture from the refrigerator.  Place the mixture on a piece of waxed paper and form the cheese ball into a head-like shape.  Place 3 pieces of waxed paper around the edges of a serving plate, leaving open space in the center.  Place the cheese in the center of the platter so some of it is right on the platter, but the edges are on the waxed paper.  This will ensure that the platter does not get dirty while you make your goblin.

In a medium bowl, stir the remaining softened cream cheese until totally smooth.  With a spatula, spread the whipped cream cheese over the head.  It's O.K. if it's not totally smooth -- this will give your goblin spooky skin.

Place a few drops of green food coloring in a small bowl.  Add 1 tablespoon of water and mix well.  With a pastry brush, paint the tortilla chips with the food coloring until they are the desired color.  Set aside to dry for a few minutes.

Once the chips are dry, press them into the sides of the cheese ball to form ears.  Skewer the pepperoncini with a toothpick and then attach it to the center of the head to make a nose.  Press the pimiento-stuffed olives into the head to form eyes.  Use the 2 red bell pepper strips to make eyebrows.  Take the pepper triangles and insert them into the holes in the pitted green olives.  The green olives will serve as toes, and the red pepper strips will be scary toenails.  Once the olives are assembled, press them into the bottom of the head to form the toes.

Press the carrot sticks into the head to form teeth.  Leave them sticking out a bit to make scary teeth.  It's O.K. if your carrot sticks are different lengths and thicknesses.  Hold the head onto the platter with a spatula and gently pull away the waxed paper.  Finally, press the cabbage into the top of the head to make hair.

Serve with crackers and assorted vegetables.

This recipe yields 20 servings.

Place 2 packages of cream cheese, butter, and milk in a mixing bowl, scraping down the sides of the bowl a few times.  Beat with an electric mixer until smooth and combined.  Add the shredded cheese and mix until well combined.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or up to 24 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the chilled cheese mixture from the refrigerator.  Place the mixture on a piece of waxed paper and form the cheese ball into a head-like shape.  Place 3 pieces of waxed paper around the edges of a serving plate, leaving open space in the center.  Place the cheese in the center of the platter so some of it is right on the platter, but the edges are on the waxed paper.  This will ensure that the platter does not get dirty while you make your goblin.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium bowl, stir the remaining softened cream cheese until totally smooth.  With a spatula, spread the whipped cream cheese over the head.  It&apos;s O.K. if it&apos;s not totally smooth -- this will give your goblin spooky skin.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a few drops of green food coloring in a small bowl.  Add 1 tablespoon of water and mix well.  With a pastry brush, paint the tortilla chips with the food coloring until they are the desired color.  Set aside to dry for a few minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Once the chips are dry, press them into the sides of the cheese ball to form ears.  Skewer the pepperoncini with a toothpick and then attach it to the center of the head to make a nose.  Press the pimiento-stuffed olives into the head to form eyes.  Use the 2 red bell pepper strips to make eyebrows.  Take the pepper triangles and insert them into the holes in the pitted green olives.  The green olives will serve as toes, and the red pepper strips will be scary toenails.  Once the olives are assembled, press them into the bottom of the head to form the toes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Press the carrot sticks into the head to form teeth.  Leave them sticking out a bit to make scary teeth.  It&apos;s O.K. if your carrot sticks are different lengths and thicknesses.  Hold the head onto the platter with a spatula and gently pull away the waxed paper.  Finally, press the cabbage into the top of the head to make hair.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve with crackers and assorted vegetables.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  graham cracker crumbs
  4        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  melted butter - (1/2 stick)
                        === FILLING ===
  3           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  5                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  sour cream
  4        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === PRALINE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1                cup  dark corn syrup
     1/2           cup  chopped pecans
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

For the crust, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and butter.  Pat this mixture into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch spring form pan.

Make the filling:  In a large bowl, beat together the cream cheese and granulated sugar.  Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, and then beat in the vanilla.  Pour the filling into the crust and bake for 1 hour.  Remove the cake from the oven and cool for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the topping:  In a bowl, mix the sour cream, sugar, and vanilla until well blended.  Spread this mixture over the warm cake and return to the oven for 4 minutes.  Let the cake cool to room temperature in the pan, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.

At serving time, use a table knife to loosen the cake from the pan.  Remove the sides of the pan and place the cake on a platter, leaving it on pan bottom.

To make the praline sauce, in a small heavy saucepan stir together the brown sugar and cornstarch.  Stir in the corn syrup and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thick.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the nuts and vanilla.  Cool slightly.  Serve the cheesecake, passing the sauce in a bowl with a small ladle.  Store any leftovers in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fryer chicken - (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
                        Water -- as needed
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz) -- sweetened with
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1                can  creamed corn - (16 oz)
  1                cup  ketchup
     1/2           cup  barbecue sauce
  1         tablespoon  liquid smoke
                        = (available in grocery store)
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Celery salt -- to taste
                        Cooked rice -- as accompaniment

In a large pot, place the chicken and enough water to cover chicken and bring to a boil.  Cook chicken until meat falls off the bone, approximately 45 minutes.  Drain the chicken and reserve 2 cups of stock.  Remove the skin and bones and chop meat.

In a separate pot, mix the chicken and remaining ingredients.  Simmer slowly for 30 minutes, stirring often to prevent sticking.  Add a little bit of the stock if the stew becomes too thick.  Serve stew over steamed rice.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

In a large pot, place the chicken and enough water to cover chicken and bring to a boil.  Cook chicken until meat falls off the bone, approximately 45 minutes.  Drain the chicken and reserve 2 cups of stock.  Remove the skin and bones and chop meat.

<DirT>
In a separate pot, mix the chicken and remaining ingredients.  Simmer slowly for 30 minutes, stirring often to prevent sticking.  Add a little bit of the stock if the stew becomes too thick.  Serve stew over steamed rice.

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil -- plus
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil -- for greasing pan
  1                cup  self-rising cornmeal
     3/4           cup  self-rising flour
  1                cup  cream-style corn -- see Cook's Note*
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  sour cream
  1                cup  grated sharp cheddar -- (optional)
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Generously season a cast-iron skillet with up to 1/4 cup vegetable oil.  Preheat the pan either in the oven or on the stove over medium-high heat.

Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl, stirring with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until combined.  Pour batter into the preheated cast-iron skillet.  Place skillet in the oven and bake until golden brown, approximately 30 minutes.  If making individual size cornbreads in smaller pans, they will require a shorter cooking time.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

* Cook's Note:  Frozen creamed corn is sold in the frozen vegetables section of most grocery stores.  It is much better than using canned corn.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  herb flavored cheese
                        = (Boursin recommended)
     1/2           cup  finely-minced crabmeat
                        = (may use imitation)
  18                    uniform-sized mushrooms -- stem removed
  1                     box phyllo pastry
                        = (will need at least 18 sheets)
     1/3           cup  butter -- melted
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg -- beaten

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Combine cheese and crab in a small bowl.  Divide crab mixture among the upside-down mushroom caps, stuffing the mushrooms.

Carefully lay 6 sheets of phyllo dough on top of one another, brushing every other sheet with melted butter.  Cut phyllo lengthwise down the center and then cut each half into 3 pieces to make 6 rectangles.

Place a mushroom, cheese-side up, in the center of each square.  Season with salt and pepper.  Lift sides of pastry over mushrooms to resemble small bundles and form a "neck," pinching edges together to seal.  Repeat the entire procedure 2 more times.

Place on a greased baking sheet and brush with beaten egg.  Bake for about 15 minutes until pastry is crisp and golden.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 18 bundles.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  self-rising flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  heavy whipping cream

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.

In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, and cream until the dough forms a ball.  Turn the dough out onto a surface dusted with additional flour.  Fold the dough in half and knead 5 to 7 times, adding just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to your hands.

Gently roll out dough to 1/2-inch thickness.  Using a 3-inch biscuit cutter coated with flour, cut dough into biscuits.  Place on baking sheet coated with cooking spray, leaving at least 1-inch between each biscuit.  Bake for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 biscuits.

                   Double Chocolate Gooey Butter Cakes

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 24    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick) -- melted, plus
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick) -- melted, plus
                        additional butter -- for greasing pan
  1            package  chocolate cake mix - (18.25 oz)
  3                     eggs
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- softened
  3        tablespoons  cocoa powder - (to 4)
  1                     box powdered sugar - (16 oz)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  chopped nuts

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a 13- by 9-inch baking pan.

In a large bowl, combine the cake mix, 1 egg, and 1 stick melted butter, and stir until well blended.  Pat mixture into prepared pan and set aside.

In a stand mixer, or with a hand mixer, beat the cream cheese until smooth.  Add the remaining 2 eggs, and the cocoa powder.  Lower the speed of the mixer, and add the powdered sugar.  Continue beating until ingredients are well mixed.  Slowly add the remaining 1 stick of melted butter, and the vanilla, continuing to beat the mixture until smooth.  Stir in nuts with a rubber spatula.

Spread filling over cake mixture in pan.  Bake for 40 to 50 minutes.  Be careful not to overcook the cake; the center should still be a little gooey when finished baking.  Let cake partially cool on a wire rack before cutting into pieces.

This recipe yields 20 to 24 servings.

                       Easy Corned Beef And Cabbage

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  bacon
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1               head  green cabbage -- coarsely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                can  corned beef

Cook the bacon in large pot over medium heat until almost crisp.  Remove the bacon from the pot and set aside.

Melt the butter in the pot with the bacon grease.  Add the cabbage, stirring well to coat the cabbage in fat.  Add about 1/3 cup water, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Cover pot with a lid, and cook over medium heat for about 10 to 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, chop the bacon into small pieces.

Remove the lid from the pot, and scatter chunks of corned beef and chopped bacon over top of the cabbage.  Cover and cook until desired doneness.  I personally like a little bit of crunch left to the cabbage.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings (If serving 6, use 2 cans corned beef).

Tip:  Cabbage is one of those vegetables that naturally contains water in its leaves.  Begin by adding just a small amount of water.  As cabbage cooks, if it needs more liquid, then add more water.

                         Fettuccine Chicken Salad

Recipe By     :Paula Deen

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  boneless skinless chicken breasts
  2          teaspoons  House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2           packages  fresh fettucine - (9 oz ea)
  2               cups  mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions, green part only -- plus
                        extra for garnish
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
  1           teaspoon  seasoning salt
                        Tomato wedges -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Slice the chicken breasts lengthwise into 1-inch wide strips.  Place chicken on a baking sheet, sprinkle it with 1 teaspoon of House Seasoning and all of the thyme, and then drizzle it with olive oil.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until cooked through but still juicy; do not overcook.

While the chicken is cooking, cook the pasta according to package directions.  Drain the pasta, rinse it in cold water, and drain it again.  Pat the excess moisture off the pasta with a paper towel if necessary, and put the pasta in a large bowl for tossing.

Remove the chicken from the baking sheet and set aside.  Pour the juices from the baking sheet into a medium bowl.  To the bowl, add the mayonnaise, green onions, parsley, basil, the remaining teaspoon of House Seasoning, and the seasoning salt, and stir until well blended.

Pour the dressing over the pasta and toss gently.  Place the chicken strips on top of the pasta.  Garnish with tomato wedges and additional sliced green onions.  This dish can be made 1 day before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Slice the chicken breasts lengthwise into 1-inch wide strips.  Place chicken on a baking sheet, sprinkle it with 1 teaspoon of House Seasoning and all of the thyme, and then drizzle it with olive oil.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until cooked through but still juicy; do not overcook.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the chicken is cooking, cook the pasta according to package directions.  Drain the pasta, rinse it in cold water, and drain it again.  Pat the excess moisture off the pasta with a paper towel if necessary, and put the pasta in a large bowl for tossing.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the chicken from the baking sheet and set aside.  Pour the juices from the baking sheet into a medium bowl.  To the bowl, add the mayonnaise, green onions, parsley, basil, the remaining teaspoon of House Seasoning, and the seasoning salt, and stir until well blended.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the dressing over the pasta and toss gently.  Place the chicken strips on top of the pasta.  Garnish with tomato wedges and additional sliced green onions.  This dish can be made 1 day before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9             pounds  fresh peaches
  2          teaspoons  Fruit Fresh -- (fruit preservative)
  3 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  quick-cooking tapioca -- plus
  2        tablespoons  quick-cooking tapioca
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR PIES ===
  1                     double-crust 9" pie shell
  4        tablespoons  butter - (1/2 stick)
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon or nutmeg

To peel the peaches, first bring a pot of water to a boil.  Using a paring knife, score the peaches with an X into the skins only.  Gently drop the peaches in the boiling water for approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the peaches and place them in iced water for a minute.  The skins should slip off easily.  If not, place back into the boiling water for another 30 seconds.

Slice the peaches and put them in a bowl.  Sprinkle Fresh Fruit and sugar, and stir into peaches.  Stir in remaining ingredients and mix well.

Line 4 pie pans with heavy foil or freezer paper, placing a piece of plastic wrap over foil.  Put 4 to 5 cups filling each pan.  Loosely fold wrapping around pie and freeze until firm.  When filling is frozen solid, remove from pans and wrap tightly.  Return to freezer until ready to use.

On pie baking day, for each pie, simply place frozen pie filling in pie shell, add 1/2 stick of butter and sprinkle with cinnamon or nutmeg.  Top pie with an additional pastry crust, seal well, and bake for 50 to 60 minutes in a preheated 375 degree oven.

This recipe yields filling for 4 pies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  self-rising flour
  1                cup  self-rising cornmeal -- or from a mix
                        = (Aunt Jemima's recommended)
  2                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     3/4           cup  buttermilk
     1/3           cup  water -- plus
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil or bacon grease
                        Oil, butter, or clarified margarine -- for frying

Mix well all ingredients, except for the frying oil.

Heat the frying oil or butter in a medium or large skillet over medium heat.

Drop the batter, by full tablespoons, into the hot skillet.  Use about 2 tablespoons of batter per hoecake.  Fry each hoecake until brown and crisp; turn each hoecake with a spatula, and then brown the other side.

With a slotted spoon, remove each hoecake to drain on a paper towel-lined plate.  Leftover batter will keep in refrigerator for up to 2 days.

This recipe yields about 17 hoecakes.

                        === CAKE ===
                        Basic 1-2-3-4 Cake -- (see recipe)
                        = (but substitute)
  1                cup  canned unsweetened coconut milk
                        = (for regular milk)
                        === FILLING ===
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  sour cream
  4        tablespoons  milk
     1/2           cup  flaked -- sweetened coconut
                        === FROSTING ===
                        Seven Minute Frosting -- (see recipe)
                        Flaked sweetened coconut -- for sprinkling

Follow directions for Basic 1-2-3-4 Cake, substituting coconut milk for regular milk.

While cake is baking, prepare filling.  Stir together sugar, sour cream, milk, and coconut in a bowl until well blended.

Remove cake layers from oven and allow cake to remain in pans as you prepare to stack and fill.  Remove first layer and invert onto cake plate.  Using the wrong end of a wooden spoon, poke holes approximately 1-inch apart until entire cake has been poked.  Spread 1/3 of filling mixture on cake layer.  Top with second layer, repeat process.  Top with last layer and repeat process again.  (As I stack layers together I stick them with toothpicks to prevent cake from shifting).

Prepare 7-Minute Frosting.  Frost top and sides of cake.  Sprinkle top and sides of cakes with additional coconut.

This recipe yields 1 (3-layer) cake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  plain enriched white cornmeal -- sifted
  2 1/2           cups  water
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Oil -- as needed

Mix together the cornmeal, water, and salt, and allow mixture to sit for a few minutes.

Spray a flat hoe skillet with a non-stick cooking spray and drizzle with oil, approximately 1 1/2 tablespoons.  Heat skillet over medium heat.  Pour about 3 (2-ounce) ladles full of the batter on the skillet.  The batter will sizzle and have a lacy appearance.  If the batter gets too thick add a bit of water.

When the edges are slightly brown, place a wet glass plate over the hoecake.  With a dishcloth, grab the handle of the pan, flip the pan and hoecake onto the plate.  Slide the hoecake off the plate back in the pan to cook the other side, and cook until golden brown.

Stir the batter and add oil to the pan before making your next hoecake.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  butter
     1/3           cup  dark corn syrup
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
  1         tablespoon  Irish Cream Liqueur -- (optional)
                        === FILLING ====
  1 1/2           cups  solid shortening
                        = (Crisco recommended)
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick)
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1                     egg white
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  hot milk

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line a cookie sheet with foil.  Lightly grease the foil; set aside (if you don't grease the foil, the cookies will stick and be ruined).

In a medium saucepan combine sugar, butter, and syrup.  Cook mixture over low heat until butter melts; remove from heat.  Stir together flour and ginger; add dry mixture to butter mixture, mixing well.  Stir in Irish Cream, if desired.

Drop batter by rounded teaspoons 3 to 4 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheet.  Bake only 2 or 3 cookies at a time because you must work quickly to form the cones before they cool and become brittle.

Bake in preheated oven for 9 to 10 minutes or until bubbly and golden brown.  Quickly invert cookies onto another cookie sheet, and wrap each cookie around the greased handle of a wooden spoon or a metal cone.  If cookie gets too brittle to roll, run back in the oven for a minute to soften.  When cookie is set, slide cookie off spoon or cone; cool on a wire rack.  Fill cookies with filling.

To store:  Place unfilled cookies in a single layer in an airtight container; cover.  Store at room temperature in a cool, dry place for up to 3 days or freeze unfilled cookies for up to 3 months.  Thaw cookies and fill.

Filling:  Cream together shortening and butter.  Add sugar and beat well.  Add egg white and vanilla; beat thoroughly.  Add hot milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat until creamy.  Put into pastry tube with star tip and fill cookies.

This recipe yields 30 cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry
                        = (half of a 17 1/4-oz pkg)
     1/2           cup  almond paste
  1                     egg yolk -- white reserved
     1/4           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  2          teaspoons  milk
  1                     egg white
                        Sugar -- for sprinkling
                        === CHOCOLATE DIPPING SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6                     milk chocolate bars - (1.5 oz ea)
  2               cups  whipping cream
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla

Let pastry stand at room temperature for 20 minutes or until easy to roll.  Unfold pastry on a lightly floured surface.  Roll into a 14-inch square.  Cut square in half with a fluted pastry wheel. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

For filling:  Crumble almond paste in a small mixing bowl.  Add egg yolk, brown sugar, and milk.  Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well mixed.  Spread filling over 1 pastry half *.  Place remaining pastry half on top of filling.

* Almond filling will be very stiff.  To make spreading easier, drop a dollop of filling uniformly over pastry.  Spray a piece of waxed paper with non-stick cooking spray.  Press almond paste evenly over entire dough.  Spray waxed paper as often as necessary to prevent filling from sticking.

Using the fluted pastry wheel, cut dough crosswise into fourteen 1-inch-wide strips.  Then cut each strip in half crosswise to make 28 pieces.  Twist each piece twice.  Place twists about 2 inches apart on cookie sheets lined with foil or parchment paper.  Brush twists with slightly beaten egg white.  Sprinkle with sugar (coarse sugar if available).

Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden.  Transfer to wire racks to cool.  Serve with Chocolate Dipping Sauce.

Chocolate Dipping Sauce:  In a saucepan stir together sugar, cornstarch and salt.  Crumble candy bars in 1 at a time.  Gradually stir in cream.  Cook and stir over medium heat until chocolate is melted.  Temper egg yolk with 1/2 cup of hot sauce.  Add back to pot and cook and stir until mixture comes to a boil.  Remove from heat.  Stir in vanilla and pour into a serving bowl.  Any remaining sauce can be poured into custard cups, refrigerated and served as pudding.

     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2          teaspoons  House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce
  14 1/2        ounces  canned diced tomatoes seasoned with
                        garlic, basil, and oregano
                        = (or 2 cups fresh diced tomatoes)
  4               cups  sliced Cajun-style fresh link sausage
  4               cups  cut okra -- (fresh or frozen)
  2               cups  oysters and liquor
     1/2         pound  crabmeat
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh peeled shrimp
  3               cups  bay scallops
                        File powder -- to taste

In a large pot combine oil and flour.  Cook over medium heat stirring constantly until the roux has browned to a light chocolate color.  Add onion, pepper, celery and garlic.  Saute for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly.

Slowly add chicken broth, and chicken base, stirring as you go.  Add water, bay leaves, thyme, basil, parsley, lemon pepper, cayenne pepper, House Seasoning, soy sauce and tomatoes.

Cut sausage into 1/2-inch pieces.  Add to pot along with okra.  Cover pot and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Tip:  Add file powder after putting gumbo into individual serving bowls.  Adding file into the pot will make the gumbo too thick as File powder acts as a thickening agent.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           servings  cooked grits
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  diced tasso ham*
  2        tablespoons  diced leeks
  2        tablespoons  diced onion
  2        tablespoons  diced green peppers
  20            medium  to large shrimp -- peeled, de-veined,
                        with tails on
  1         tablespoon  white wine - (to 2)
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Green onion tops -- chopped

* Cook's Note:  Tasso is a Cajun ham and is often hard to find outside of Louisiana, but you can find it at some specialty gourmet shops or by mail order.  If not, you can substitute salt pork, pancetta, or prosciutto, but you will have to beef up your seasonings, as tasso is very flavorful.

Cook grits according to package directions; set aside and keep warm.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add tasso and saute until crisp.  Add diced vegetables and saute until onions are translucent.  Add shrimp and saute for 30 to 45 seconds, or until pink.  Remove from the pan and set aside.

Deglaze the pan with a little white wine.  Slowly add the cream and let reduce until thickened.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Divide grits among 2 serving plates.  Line plate edges with shrimp (10 shrimp per serving).  Pour sauce over grits.  Garnish with green onion tops.

For a great wedding idea, use martini glasses to serve shrimp and grits, with the grits on the bottom and shrimp and sauce on top.

* Cook&apos;s Note:  Tasso is a Cajun ham and is often hard to find outside of Louisiana, but you can find it at some specialty gourmet shops or by mail order.  If not, you can substitute salt pork, pancetta, or prosciutto, but you will have to beef up your seasonings, as tasso is very flavorful.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook grits according to package directions; set aside and keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add tasso and saute until crisp.  Add diced vegetables and saute until onions are translucent.  Add shrimp and saute for 30 to 45 seconds, or until pink.  Remove from the pan and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Deglaze the pan with a little white wine.  Slowly add the cream and let reduce until thickened.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide grits among 2 serving plates.  Line plate edges with shrimp (10 shrimp per serving).  Pour sauce over grits.  Garnish with green onion tops.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For a great wedding idea, use martini glasses to serve shrimp and grits, with the grits on the bottom and shrimp and sauce on top.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1                cup  butter -- room temperature
  2               cups  sugar
  4                     eggs
  3               cups  self-rising flour -- sifted
  1                cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FROSTING ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  cocoa powder
     1/2           cup  butter
     2/3           cup  half-and-half
  2         tablespoon  corn syrup
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1                     box confectioners' sugar - (16 oz) -- sifted, plus
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour 3 (9-inch) round cake pans.

Using an electric mixer, cream the butter until fluffy.  Add the sugar and continue to cream for approximately 6 to 8 minutes.  Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add the flour and milk, alternately to creamed mixture, beginning and ending with the flour.  Add the vanilla and continue to mix until incorporated.

To bake 6 layers of cake 3 at a time, divide the batter in half, then divide each half among the 3 pans.  Level the batter in each pan by dropping pan flat onto counter top to release air bubbles.  Bake each cake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown.  Cool in pans for 5 to 10 minutes.  Invert cakes and repeat process with the rest of the cake batter.

Prepare frosting while cakes are cooling.  Mix sugar, cocoa, butter, half-and-half, corn syrup, and salt in a saucepan, stir, and bring to a boil.  Continue to boil, stirring occasionally for 3 minutes.  The syrup will become thick.

Remove syrup from heat, and beat in the confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract with an electric mixer.  Allow frosting to rest for a couple of minutes.  At this time, if the frosting is too thick for spreading, add a bit of half-and-half, 1 tablespoon at a time, to bring frosting to proper spreading consistency.

This recipe yields 16 to 20 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     racks pork ribs
                        House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
                        === JERRY'S BASTING SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  white vinegar
     3/4           cup  lemon juice
  4             dashes  Worcestershire sauce
  3             dashes  hot red pepper sauce - (to 4)
  1              small  onion -- minced
  3             dashes  salt - (to 4)
                        Seasoned pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  water - (to 3)
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        Favorite BBQ sauce -- for serving

Prepare smoker to 250 degrees.  I use charcoal and wood chips such as hickory.

Remove membrane from ribs if desired.  Rub thoroughly with House Seasoning.  Place ribs on smoker grate and cover.  Slow smoke ribs for 2 to 3 hours.  Every 15 minutes brush ribs with vinegar solution.  We serve our ribs without sauce.  If you like sauce cooked on, brush ribs with sauce about 15 minutes before they are done, turning often, watching carefully that the sauce does not burn.  Ribs are done when they are tender enough to easily pull from the bones.  If you're not a sauce eater, remove ribs, cut and serve with BBQ sauce on the side.

Jerry's Basting Sauce:  In a medium saucepan, mix all ingredients and bring to a boil.  Remove from heat.  Use this sauce to brush ribs or chicken to keep moist.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  crescent rolls
                        Flour -- for dusting
  4        tablespoons  spicy mustard
  10            ounces  thinly-sliced ham
  10            ounces  thinly-sliced salami
  10            ounces  bologna
  12            ounces  Monterey Jack -- grated
                        Liquid food coloring -- as needed
  3                     egg yolks -- divided use
  2                     whole cloves
                        Toothpicks
  2              small  pimiento-stuffed olives
                        Jarred roasted red peppers strips - -- (1" long)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line a cookie sheet with foil.  Grease the foil and set aside.

Dust a flat surface lightly with flour.  Spread out the crescent dough -- do not separate.  Pinch together the seams so that you have 1 piece of dough.  Roll out to make a large rectangle.  Make sure the dough is not stuck to the surface at all.

Brush the dough with the mustard, leaving a 1-inch border.  Layer the meats down the center of the rectangle, leaving a 1-inch border on either end.  You can feel free to use your favorite cold cuts.

Top the meats with the cheese.  Fold 1 side of the dough over the filling, lengthwise.  Then, fold the other half over and press to seal the filling inside.  Take 1 egg yolk, and beat lightly with a fork.  Brush the egg yolk over the top of the dough.  The yolk will act as the glue to hold.  Fold the dough in half again lengthwise.  Pinch the seam with your fingers to seal.  Press the outside of the dough to make sure everything is sealed tight and to make an even thickness for the body of your snake.  Taper 1 end of the dough to form a tail shape.  Form the other end into a head shape.

Beat the 2 remaining egg yolks together.  Transfer to 3 separate small bowls.  Add some food coloring to each bowl -- whatever colors you like!  Using a clean paintbrush, "paint" the snake with the egg yolk/food coloring mixture.

Transfer the snake to the foil lined sheet tray.  Form into an "s" shape so it looks like the snake is slithering.  Insert 2 cloves into the head to look like nostrils and 2 stuffed olives for eyes.  Create a mouth or tongue with the roasted red peppers.  Bake the snake for 25 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     bone-in 1 1/2" to 2"-thick pork chops -- split to bone
  1              pound  bulk sausage -- split 4 equal
                        portions
                        House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  salt
     1/4           cup  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  garlic powder
                        Olive oil -- for brushing

Set up grill for direct grilling.  When coals are white hot, spread them evenly and place grate on top to heat.

Meanwhile, stuff each pork chop with sausage and rub meat liberally with House Seasoning.  Secure each pork chop with a wooden skewer or toothpicks (remember to remove before serving).

Brush oil on grill grate to prevent sticking.  Place pork chops on grate and grill until nicely browned, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Turn and repeat process.  An internal temperature of 160 degrees is recommended for pork.  Make sure your sausage stuffing and pork chop is thoroughly cooked.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     racks St. Louis-cut ribs
                        === RIB RUB ===
  2        tablespoons  finely-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  ground oregano
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  2          teaspoons  celery salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper

To make the rib rub, combine all the ingredients.  Rub over the surface of the ribs to coat.

Preheat a BBQ pit or an oven to 250 degrees.

Rub both sides of the rack of ribs evenly with the rib rub.  Place on the pit or in the oven, bone-side sown, and roast for about 3 hours.  About 15 minutes before the ribs are done, turn the rack over and let the other side get some color.  (In the oven, turn the ribs occasionally, then broil to brown.)

When the ribs are done, the rack relaxes and droops when you lift it at the center.  Cut the ribs parallel to the bones and serve with lots of napkins.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Tom Perini
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried pinto beans
     1/4         pound  salt pork
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4) -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chili powder

First, rinse the dried beans and remove any stones or dirt.  Cut the pork into thin strips and rinse.  Cover the beans with water, add the pork and garlic and boil until tender over medium heat (low boil), about 2 1/2 hours.  Beans should always be covered with water.  If needed, add more hot water to cover ó especially if you want more bean broth.

When the beans are tender, season with salt, to taste, and chili powder.  Then let the beans sit and absorb these flavors for a while.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Cook's tip:  If you want to speed up the cooking process, you can soak the beans in water overnight.  Then drain and begin the cooking steps.  Also, salting the beans when they first begin to cook can make them tough, so always salt after beans are tender.

First, rinse the dried beans and remove any stones or dirt.  Cut the pork into thin strips and rinse.  Cover the beans with water, add the pork and garlic and boil until tender over medium heat (low boil), about 2 1/2 hours.  Beans should always be covered with water.  If needed, add more hot water to cover ó especially if you want more bean broth.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the beans are tender, season with salt, to taste, and chili powder.  Then let the beans sit and absorb these flavors for a while.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook&apos;s tip:  If you want to speed up the cooking process, you can soak the beans in water overnight.  Then drain and begin the cooking steps.  Also, salting the beans when they first begin to cook can make them tough, so always salt after beans are tender.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE===
  2               cups  canned diced tomatoes
  2               cups  tomato sauce
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  onions -- diced
     1/2           cup  green bell peppers -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- diced
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Italian seasoning
  1 1/2      teaspoons  House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  seasoning salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  2                     bay leaves
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef
                        === LASAGNA ===
  6                     long lasagna noodle strips - (to 9)
  12            ounces  cottage cheese -- mixed with
  1                     beaten egg -- and
     1/2           cup  Parmesan
  1                cup  Gruyere grated cheese
  1                cup  grated Swiss cheese
  2               cups  grated cheddar
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz)
  1                cup  grated mozzarella

To make the sauce, in a stockpot, combine the tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, onions, peppers, garlic, parsley, seasoning mixtures, sugar and bay leaves.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 1 hour.

Crumble the ground beef in a saucepan.  Cook until no pink remains, then drain off the fat.  Add the ground beef to the stockpot.  Simmer for another 20 minutes.

While the sauce simmers, cook the pasta according to the package directions (if sauce is too thin, for your taste, you can thicken it up at this time by mixing 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and a 1/4 of a cup of cold water.  Bring sauce back to a boil.  Stir in cornstarch mixture, stirring constantly).  Remove bay leaves.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

To assemble lasagna, place a thin layer of sauce in the bottom of a 9- by 13- by 2-inch pan.  Layer 1/3 of each, noodles, cottage cheese mixture, Gruyere, Swiss and cheddar cheeses.  Pinch off small pieces of cream cheese and dot over other cheeses.  Add another layer of sauce.  Repeat layering 2 to 3 times ending with sauce.  This may be covered and refrigerated at this point.

Bake for 20 minutes.  Remove from oven and top with mozzarella and continue to bake for another 10 to 15 minutes.  Note: If lasagna has been refrigerated, bake for 40 minutes total.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  smoked meat
                        = (smoked turkey wings are excellent)
  4             quarts  water
  1           teaspoon  House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  2                     chicken bouillon cubes
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
  1              bunch  turnip greens with roots
  4        tablespoons  butter - (1/2 stick)
  1           teaspoon  sugar -- (optional; may be
                        used if greens are bitter)
                        === CORNMEAL DUMPLINGS ===
  1                cup  all-purpose cornmeal
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1                     egg
     2/3           cup  liquid from cooked turnips

Place smoked meat in water along with House Seasoning, bouillon, and ginger.  Cook over low heat for 1 1/2 hours.

Strip turnip leaves free of the big stem that runs down the center of each leaf.  Wash in a sink full of clean water.  Drain and wash twice more, since greens can often be sandy.  Peel and slice or quarter roots.

Add greens to meat; cook for another 30 minutes, stirring often.  Add roots and continue to cook for approximately 15 minutes, or until roots are tender.  (Reserve 2/3 cup turnip liquid for the dumplings.)  Add butter and sugar.  Serve with Cornmeal Dumplings.

Cornmeal Dumplings:  Mix all ingredients together.  Dipping by teaspoonfuls, gently roll batter in the palms of your hands into approximately 1-inch balls; drop into boiling turnip liquid.  Make sure each dumpling is completely covered in liquid by shaking the pot gently; do not stir.  Boil for about 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Cover with a towel and let harden.

This recipe yields 1 gallon.

Comments:  For fruit ice cream such as strawberry or peach:  2 cups sliced fresh fruit covered with 1 cup sugar.  Add to mixture before whole milk, and mix well.

Note:  For those concerned about raw eggs, pasteurized liquid eggs may be substituted.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs. Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."
