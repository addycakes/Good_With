            Beef Carpaccio With Olive Salad And Mustard Aioli

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === AIOLI ===
  1                     egg
                        Juice and zest of one lemon
  1                     garlic clove -- finely sliced
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1 1/4           cups  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SALAD ===
     1/2           cup  Moroccan olives -- pitted
     1/2           cup  Picholine olives -- pitted
  1              bunch  fresh marjoram -- leaves stripped
                        and stems discarded
  1              pound  fresh beef top round -- sliced thinly
                        = (by your butcher)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             pieces  heavy-duty aluminum foil - (8" by 8")

To make aioli:  Place egg, lemon juice, garlic and mustard in a blender and blend until smooth (1 minute).  Starting two drops at a time with machine going, slowly pour in olive oil until sauce begins to thicken.

Finish adding the last 1/4 cup olive oil in a thin stream and season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Aioli should be the consistency of unwhipped heavy cream.  If it is too thick thin with cool water, adding a teaspoon at a time and blending between additions.)  Set aside.

To make olive salad:  Mix the Moroccan and picholine olives, the lemon zest and the marjoram leaves together in a small bowl and set aside.

To make carpaccio:  Pound the slices of top round between the two pieces of foil with a drop of oil on each side until as thin as construction paper.  Flip pieces of pounded beef on to chilled plates and continue pounding and flipping meat until entire plates are covered, including the rims.

To prepare the dish:  Divide the olive salad into piles in the centers of the meat.  Season the meat with salt and freshly-ground pepper.  Drizzle the aioli over the meat with a teaspoon and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

To make aioli:  Place egg, lemon juice, garlic and mustard in a blender and blend until smooth (1 minute).  Starting two drops at a time with machine going, slowly pour in olive oil until sauce begins to thicken.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Finish adding the last 1/4 cup olive oil in a thin stream and season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Aioli should be the consistency of unwhipped heavy cream.  If it is too thick thin with cool water, adding a teaspoon at a time and blending between additions.)  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make olive salad:  Mix the Moroccan and picholine olives, the lemon zest and the marjoram leaves together in a small bowl and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make carpaccio:  Pound the slices of top round between the two pieces of foil with a drop of oil on each side until as thin as construction paper.  Flip pieces of pounded beef on to chilled plates and continue pounding and flipping meat until entire plates are covered, including the rims.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare the dish:  Divide the olive salad into piles in the centers of the meat.  Season the meat with salt and freshly-ground pepper.  Drizzle the aioli over the meat with a teaspoon and serve.

  1             medium  red onion -- thinly-sliced
                        Juice and zest of 1 lemon

Place in oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours and cook until meat is falling off the bone.  Remove and let stand 10 minutes before serving with the Risotto Milanese.

Gremolata:  Mix chopped parsley, toasted pine nuts, and lemon zest together loosely in a small bowl.  Set aside to sprinkle over meat when ready to serve.

Place the risotto in a deep platter, over which you can place osso buco.  Sprinkle with gremolata and serve.

This recipe yields 4 main course servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
     1/2        medium  Spanish onion -- chopped 1/8" dice
     1/2         small  carrot -- chopped 1/8' dice
     1/2                celery rib -- cut 1/8" thick
                        slices
  1           teaspoon  anchovy paste
  1         tablespoon  hot chili flakes
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1                cup  dry red wine
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2         pound  fresh boar shoulder -- cut 1" cubes
                        = (may substitute lamb or venison)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Add hot chicken stock, 1 ladle at a time, waiting until stock is absorbed each time until rice is cooked and has a creamy texture, about 15 minutes.  Stir in radicchio, parmesan cheese and butter and stir until well mixed.  Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.

This dish stands on its own as a pasta course but also serves as an excellent side dish for roasted meats.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  8        tablespoons  virgin olive oil -- divided
  2              large  onions -- thinly sliced
     1/4         pound  pancetta -- cut 1/4" cubes
  1              pound  calf's liver -- cut four 1" slices
     1/4           cup  flour -- seasoned with

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  dry white wine

     1/4         pound  trumpet mushrooms
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped parsley

Turn liver over to the other side, and add balsamic vinegar, Basic Tomato Sauce, onions and pancetta, bring to a boil and reduce heat.  Add wine and mushrooms and simmer 6 to 7 minutes until liver is medium to medium-rare.

Add parsley, stir to mix, remove liver to serving plate, pour sauce over and serve. This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  dried white beans
                        = (cannellini or great northern)
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- chopped 1/2" dice
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  4             ounces  virgin olive oil, plus extra for garnish
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  2               cups  chicken broth, preferably homemade
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for garnish
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves -- for garnish

Soak white beans overnight in 2 quarts water.  The following day, drain the beans and cook in 2 new quarts of unsalted water in an 8-quart sauce pan for approximately 50 minutes to 1 hour, maintaining the water level constantly above the beans.  At this point the beans will be tender but not bursting from their skins.

In a 3-gallon stockpot with a heavy bottom, saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil over medium heat about 8 to 10 minutes until the onion has softened.  Cook 1 more minute and add the 2 tablespoons rosemary, chicken stock, and the Basic Tomato Sauce.

Bring to a boil, add the entire contents of bean pot, liquid and all, and bring back to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes.  Some beans will break up, others will retain their shape.  The soup should be thick and you should still see the beans.

Season with salt and pepper and ladle into soup bowls.  Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle each bowl with freshly chopped rosemary.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a 3-gallon stockpot with a heavy bottom, saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil over medium heat about 8 to 10 minutes until the onion has softened.  Cook 1 more minute and add the 2 tablespoons rosemary, chicken stock, and the Basic Tomato Sauce.

<DirT>
Bring to a boil, add the entire contents of bean pot, liquid and all, and bring back to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes.  Some beans will break up, others will retain their shape.  The soup should be thick and you should still see the beans.

          Tortelli Of Gorgonzola With Walnuts And Tomato Butter

Recipe By     :Mario Batali

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  Salt
                        === FILLING ===
  8             ounces  gorgonzola cheese
                        = (sweet or mountain picante)
  8             ounces  ricotta cheese
  2              large  eggs
  1              pinch  ground cinnamon
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated parmesan cheese -- plus
  4        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SAUCE ===
  4             ounces  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  chopped walnut pieces

To make the filling:  Mix the gorgonzola, ricotta, eggs, cinnamon, and 1/4 cup of the grated cheese in a large stainless steel mixing bowl until smooth and homogenous.  Set aside.

To assemble the tortelli:  Roll the Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough out into 4 sheets.  Lay 1 sheet of pasta on a lightly-floured cutting board.  Starting 1 inch from the top side of the sheet of the pasta, place "spots" of 1 teaspoon filling mixture in horizontal rows.  Each "spot" should be about 2 inches from the previous one.  Repeat this for half of the sheet.  The idea is to fold the bottom half of the pasta up over the "spots" and then press down the pasta around each mound of filling.

Using a 2-inch round pastry cutter, either jagged or straight edge, cut out the individual tortelli.  Remove them one by one from the board, carefully pressing the edges together all around to eliminate any air pockets and securing the pasta together.  Place on a floured board or plate and continue with the remaining pasta sheets until filling is finished.  If the tortelli are not to be cooked within the hour, cover with a cotton dish towel and set aside.

Boil 6 quarts water and add 2 tablespoons salt.

To make the sauce:  In a large 12- to 14-inch skillet, heat the Basic Tomato Sauce, butter and walnut pieces, until the butter is melted, set aside.

Drop the tortelli into the boiling water and cook at a low boil.  Fresh tortelli will cook very quickly no more that 1 to 2 minutes.  You will know they are done when they float to the top of the water.  (If the tortelli have dried, you may have to increase the cooking time from 2 to 4 minutes.)

To complete the dish:  Carefully remove the tortelli from the water with a slotted spoon.  Place the pasta into the sauce pan and coat lightly with the sauce by shaking gently back and forth.  Pour into a warm serving dish.  Sprinkle with grated cheese and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Green Pasta -- (see recipe)
     1/2         pound  fresh sheep's milk ricotta cheese
                        = (cow's milk may be substituted)
  1 1/2           cups  freshly-grated Parmigiano Reggiano
  2                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped Italian parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8             ounces  butter
  8                     sage leaves

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt.

Roll pasta into sheets on thinnest setting of pasta roller and set on board covered with damp kitchen towel.  In a large bowl, make the filling by mixing thoroughly the ricotta, parmigiano Reggiano, eggs, nutmeg and chopped parsley.  Season with salt and freshly ground pepper then set aside.

To make the tortelloni cut the pasta into 3" squares four at a time, so the pasta doesn't dry out.  Place an ample teaspoon of the filling in the center of each square and fold point to point to form a triangle.  Bring the two ends together to form a large tortelloni or ring shape, sealing points together with pressure.  Continue until all are shaped, holding finished tortelloni on a cookie sheet covered with a kitchen towel.

Melt butter with sage leaves and set aside.

Drop pasta into boiling water and cook until tender, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Turn off heat and using a slotted spoon or spider, remove tortelloni from water and place in pan with butter, sage and parmigiano, tossing gently over medium heat until well-coated.  Pour into large serving bowl and serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  baby artichokes
  6                     jumbo eggs
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino

Peel and clean the artichokes.  Slice paper thin into acidulated water.  Set aside.

In a non-stick saute pan, heat the oil until just smoking.  Drain the artichokes and pat them dry with towels.  Saute the artichokes a handful at a time until they are golden-brown.  Continue until all are done.

Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a bowl and just break the yolks.  Do not whisk or stir.  Add cheese and let stand.

When all the artichokes are done, place them all back in the pan.  Pour the eggs over the artichokes and swirl the pan to allow the eggs to drip through and make contact with the pan.  Cook until the eggs set, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Toss onto a plate and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  flour -- divided
  1 3/4           cups  lukewarm water
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil from Liguria
     1/2                red onion -- sliced paper thin
  2              small  Japanese eggplants -- chopped 1" dice
  1              small  zucchini -- chopped 1" dice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  Basic Pesto -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino cheese

On a floured board, make a well with 2 cups of the flour.  Add water to well and make dough by traditional well method.  Knead 10 minutes and allow to rest 10 minutes.

Place 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat oil until just smoking.  Add onion and cook until softened but not browned, about 4 to 5 minutes.

Add eggplant and zucchini and cook until softened and light brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, remove from heat, and set aside.

Roll dough into 1-inch dowel and cut off a 1-inch piece.  To form pointed semi-curl, first roll forward on pasta to form small pencil and then backward 30 degrees to the left to form squiggle.  Continue with remaining dough.

When ready to serve, place squiggles of pasta (trofie) into water and cook until they float.  Drain well and toss into pan with eggplant.  Add Basic Pesto and toss over medium heat until well coated and warmed through.  Serve immediately with grated cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        into shards

Season turkey pieces with salt and pepper and place in egg mixture.  Drain to remove excess and dredge in bread crumbs, pressing to coat each one evenly.  Lay on plate and refrigerate 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

In a 14- to 16-inch saute pan (large enough to hold all 4 turkey pieces at the same time) over medium heat, heat oil and butter until foam from butter dissipates.  Place turkey pieces in pan and cook slowly until golden-brown on one side, about 6 to 7 minutes.  DO NOT RUSH THIS STEP OR THEY WILL BURN.  Turn and cook the other side.

When both sides are golden-brown, pour the Basic Tomato Sauce and chicken stock around meat and bring to a boil.  Place 1 slice Prosciutto over each piece and sprinkle with shaved Parmesan and place uncovered in oven for 10 minutes.  Remove and place in warmed serving platter.  Drizzle with spoonfuls of sauce and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  flour -- plus extra
                        for dusting pan
  3                     eggs
  3 1/2           cups  sugar -- divided
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
                        Zest and juice of 6 large oranges
                        Segments of 4 oranges

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Oil and dust with flour an 8-inch cake pan.

In a mixer, beat eggs and 1 1/2 cups sugar until light yellow, about 6 to 7 minutes.  Add oil and milk and blend well.  Add yeast and mix 20 seconds.  Add flour, 1 cup at a time until all is incorporated.  Pour into prepared cake pan and place in oven.

                        Juice and zest of 1 large lemon
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley

Core fennel and cut in half.  Cut each half into 1/8-inch julienne.

Heat remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan until smoking.  Add 4 pieces dredged veal and cook until light golden-brown on each side, about 2 minutes.  Remove to plate and continue with remaining pieces.

When second batch is browned, add first batch back into pan and add chicken broth and lemon juice and cook 2 to 3 minutes, until liquid is nearly gone.  Remove veal to platter, add fennel and parsley and pour sauce over meat.  Sprinkle with lemon zest and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  olive oil -- for frying
     1/2           cup  unbleached flour
     1/2           cup  superfine semolina flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  cold water
  3        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
     1/2         pound  cauliflower in florets -- sliced 1/8" thick
     1/2         pound  broccoli in florets -- sliced 1/8" thick
  6             medium  crimini mushrooms -- halved
  1             medium  zucchini -- cut 1/4" thick round
  6                     baby artichokes -- stems on
  2                     lemons -- cut 1/8" thick round
  12                    zucchini flowers
                        Kosher salt -- for sprinkling
  2                     lemons -- cut into wedges

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Place a large platter covered with a towel in oven.  Trim the artichokes of tough outer leaves, peel the stems and cut into quarters.  Soak chokes in cool acidulated water.

Heat oil to 370 degrees in a 6-inch tall frying pan with basket.  Make batter by stirring together flour, semolina, baking powder and salt.  Slowly add cold water, stirring until smooth batter is formed.  Add oil and stir through.

To cook, dip vegetables in order of ingredients in as little batter as possible and fry until each is golden-brown and crisp.  Drain after frying on paper towels.  When drained, arrange on platter.

Move quickly -- each vegetable should take 3 to 4 minutes at most.  When finished with zucchini blossoms, sprinkle whole platter with kosher salt and serve immediately with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Heat oil to 370 degrees in a 6-inch tall frying pan with basket.  Make batter by stirring together flour, semolina, baking powder and salt.  Slowly add cold water, stirring until smooth batter is formed.  Add oil and stir through.

To cook, dip vegetables in order of ingredients in as little batter as possible and fry until each is golden-brown and crisp.  Drain after frying on paper towels.  When drained, arrange on platter.

Move quickly -- each vegetable should take 3 to 4 minutes at most.  When finished with zucchini blossoms, sprinkle whole platter with kosher salt and serve immediately with lemon wedges.

     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     eggs
     1/4           cup  milk
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  2        tablespoons  Nocino

  8                     egg yolks
                        Juice and zest of 2 lemons
     1/4           cup  sugar

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a mixing bowl, stir together walnuts, hazelnuts, sugar, and bread crumbs until well mixed.  Add olive oil, eggs, milk, baking powder, and Nocino and stir to form a thick and chunky puree.  Pour into a buttered and sugared 8-inch quiche pan and bake until firm but moist, 35 to 40 minutes.

Meanwhile, place yolks, juice, zest, and sugar into a copper bowl and whisk until frothy and light, 1 minute.  Place over pan with boiling water and cook carefully, whisking furiously, until as firm as whipped cream, and place in refrigerator.  Remove cake and serve warm, with cool sabayon.

                        by 1/4" strips
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2               cups  polenta (cornmeal)
     1/4           cup  Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Bake the sausage for 20 minutes at 350 degrees and drain.  Crumble the cooked sausage to resemble rough bread crumbs.  Set aside.

In a medium saute pan, heat the olive oil.  Gently saute the whole garlic cloves until golden-brown on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the peppers and saute until soft, but not browned, about 7 to 8 minutes longer.  Remove from heat.  Separate and let cool.

Bring the mozzarella to room temperature.  Place the sausage, peppers, garlic and mozzarella around a cutting board, all in separate bowls.

Bring 6 cups water to a boil, adding the salt and sugar.  Slowly add the cornmeal to the boiling water in a thin stream, whisking continuously.  Lower heat and cook until the polenta resembles the texture of hot cereal.  Remove the pot from heat.

Moving quickly, pour the polenta into a 12-inch long by 4-inch wide by 4-inch deep terrine mold to about 3/4-inch from the top.  Sprinkle all the crumbled sausage over the polenta.  Cover the sausage with about 1 1/2 cups warm polenta.  Using a spatula, flatten and smooth the polenta to create a flat surface.  Next, layer the peppers and the garlic cloves.  Repeat with another layer of 1 1/2 cups warm polenta over the peppers.  Remember to smooth and flatten the polenta layer to make a nice flat surface all the way to the edges.  Lay the mozzarella over the polenta (but do notbring the mozzarella to the edges).  Pour another layer of warm polenta over the mozzarella to fill the terrine.  Smooth the top layer all the way to the edges.  There may be left over polenta.

Chill the terrine overnight.

To serve, invert the terrine over a cutting board.  It should come out quite easily.  Slice the terrine as you would slice bread, about 3/4-inch thick.  Place the slice flat on a baking sheet.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes.  Sprinkle with grated cheese and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 appetizer servings.

          White Bean Ravioli With Balsamic Vinegar Brown Butter

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  cooked white beans -- divided
     1/2           cup  virgin olive oil
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  balsamic vinegar -- divided
     1/2           cup  freshly-ground Parmesan cheese
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             recipe  Roasted Beet Pasta -- (see recipe)
                        = (rolled out on thinnest
                        setting to 4 sheets)
  6             ounces  sweet butter
                        === GARNISH ===
  4        tablespoons  freshly-ground Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped Italian parsley

Filling:  In a food processor, blend one cup cooked white beans with virgin olive oil, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, grated Parmesan cheese, egg and parsley until smooth (about 1 minute).  Remove to medium mixing bowl and stir in remaining cup of beans.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Assembly:  Lay out 1 sheet of pasta and cut into 8 pieces, 3 1/2-inches by 3 1/2-inches.  Place 1 1/2 tablespoons filling in center of each square and fold corner to corner to form triangle shaped pillow.  Press edge firmly around to seal.  Continue with all remaining pasta.  Should yield 32 ravioli.  These can be set aside on a baking tray in refrigerator for 6 hours, separated by a kitchen towel.

To cook:  Bring 6 quarts water to boil in a large spaghetti pot and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop ravioli into water and return to boil.  Lower heat slightly and cook just below boiling for 3 minutes.

Meanwhile, place sweet butter in 10-inch to 12-inch saute pan and cook until foam subsides and butter begins to brown.  Turn off heat and add remaining 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar (careful; it will spatter).  Remove ravioli from cooking liquid with spider and place in pan with butter and vinegar.  Toss over medium heat and sprinkle with remaining cheese and parsley.  Divide among 4 plates and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

          Zampone With Potatoes And Balsamic Mustard Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  Zampone sausage - (abt 4 to 5 lbs)
  2             pounds  Russet potatoes
  4        tablespoons  melted butter
  1                cup  whole milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  freshly-snipped chives

Wash and dry the Zampone.  Prick the Zampone about 20 times all over with a needle.  Place in a pot large enough to submerge the sausage in water.  Fill the pot with warm water and bring to just a boil.  Lower the heat slightly, so the water remains almost boiling.  Cover and continue cooking for 1 1/2 hours.

Meanwhile peel potatoes and cut into 3/4-inch cubes.  Place in acidulated water.

Uncover and check the internal temperature of the sausage with a meat thermometer.  Cook until the temperature reads 150 degrees.  Turn off the heat and let stand.

In a 12- to 14-inch non-stock saute pan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the potatoes and saute slowly until lightly browned on all sides.  Add the milk and simmer uncovered, until softened, about 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Allow to stand in a warm place.

In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the mustard and vinegar.  Slowly add the extra-virgin olive oil in a thin stream, forming an emulsion.  Stir constantly until all the oil is added.  Add the snipped chives and check seasoning.

Remove the Zampone from the water.  Carefully slice half the sausage into 1/2-inch rounds.  On a large serving platter, spread the potatoes around the base.  Place the Zampone pieces and slices over the potatoes.  Pour the vinaigrette into a serving pitcher, allowing each person to dress his or her own portion.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  zucchini
  3        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
     1/2        medium  red onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, sliced thin
  1              bunch  fresh oregano -- leaves only
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  ricotta
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
  8                     sage leaves
     1/4         pound  Cacio di Roma
                        = (or other semi-soft sheep's milk cheese)

To make panzotti, rinse and dry zucchini and trim both ends.  Slice into 1/16-inch rounds and set aside.

In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, heat olive oil until smoking.  Add onion and garlic and cook over medium heat until lightly browned and softened, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add zucchini and oregano leaves and cook until very soft, about 7 to 8 minutes.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

In a mixing bowl, stir together coated zucchini mixture, egg, ricotta, Pecorino, nutmeg and parsley until well mixed and season lightly with salt and pepper.

Roll out Basic Fresh Egg Pasta into sheets on second thinnest setting and cut into 3-inch rounds with water glass or pasta cutter.  Place 1/2 tablespoon zucchini mixture into each and fold into a half moon.  Continue until all the pasta is used.  Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop pancotti into water and cook until pasta is tender, about 3 to 4 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt butter in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan and add sage leaves.  Drain pasta in a colander and pour into butter mixture.  Toss to coat well and pour into a heated pasta dish.  Shave cacio over pasta using a vegetable peeler and serve.

                   Zucchini Stuffed With Lamb And Mint

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  zucchini
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- finely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  ground lamb -- crumbled
  2                     eggs
  1              bunch  fresh mint leaves -- picked, left whole
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Trim zucchini and cut in half lengthwise.  Using a spoon or a melon baller, remove a canal down center of each zucchini half, leaving 1/4-inch all around and the ends closed.  Roughly chop the excess zucchini flesh and set aside.

In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, heat olive oil until just smoking.  Add onion and garlic and cook over medium-high heat until softened, about 6 to 7 minutes.  Add zucchini pieces and crumbled lamb and cook until lamb is cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Drain fat from lamb mixture and place in a large mixing bowl.  Add eggs, half of the mint leaves and the Basic Tomato Sauce and mix well.

Season both the mixture and the zucchini boats with salt and pepper.  Stuff the lamb mixture into zucchini boats and pile high.  Place in an oven-proof baking dish just large enough to hold the 8 pieces and sprinkle with bread crumbs.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until crisp on top and remove.  Serve warm or at room temperature with a chicory salad and sprinkle with remaining mint leaves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Trim zucchini and cut in half lengthwise.  Using a spoon or a melon baller, remove a canal down center of each zucchini half, leaving 1/4-inch all around and the ends closed.  Roughly chop the excess zucchini flesh and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, heat olive oil until just smoking.  Add onion and garlic and cook over medium-high heat until softened, about 6 to 7 minutes.  Add zucchini pieces and crumbled lamb and cook until lamb is cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Drain fat from lamb mixture and place in a large mixing bowl.  Add eggs, half of the mint leaves and the Basic Tomato Sauce and mix well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season both the mixture and the zucchini boats with salt and pepper.  Stuff the lamb mixture into zucchini boats and pile high.  Place in an oven-proof baking dish just large enough to hold the 8 pieces and sprinkle with bread crumbs.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until crisp on top and remove.  Serve warm or at room temperature with a chicory salad and sprinkle with remaining mint leaves.
