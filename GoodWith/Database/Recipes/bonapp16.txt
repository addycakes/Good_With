  2          teaspoons  rose water
                        = (available at Middle Eastern markets
                        and specialty foods stores)
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- melted
  3               cups  coarsely-chopped almonds
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon

Stir 1 1/3 cups sugar, 1 1/2 cups water, honey, cinnamon sticks, and orange peel in saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; bring to boil.  Remove from heat.  Mix in rose water.  Chill until cold.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Brush 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan with some of melted butter.

Comments:  "My grandmother was a reporter in New York before she got married and moved to Montana to start a new life on a ranch," writes Joyce Litz of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  "At the time she didnít know how to cook, and learning wasnít easy -- the place didnít even have running water.  Still, she appreciated good food, so she persevered and became a great cook.  Later my grandmother taught me ranch-style cooking, a lot of which involved getting simple but flavorful, hearty meals ready in a hurry."

Boost the payoff with a scoop of ice cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1              large  egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  ice water -- or more if needed
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
  1 1/2         pounds  Fuji apples - (abt 3 large) -- peeled, quartered,
                        cored, cut into 1/4"-thk slices
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  8             ounces  sharp cheddar cheese -- cut 8 wedges

For Crust:  Mix flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Cut in butter, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Whisk yolk, 1 tablespoon ice water, and vanilla extract in small bowl to blend.  Add egg mixture to processor; blend until dough clumps together, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Form dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic wrap; chill at least 1 hour.

Roll out dough on floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Trim dough overhang to 1 inch; fold dough overhang in and press onto sides of pan.  Pierce crust all over with fork.  Refrigerate crust for 1 hour.

For Filling:  Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Mix first 3 ingredients in bowl.  Arrange apple slices in concentric circles in crust, overlapping and fitting tightly together.  Sprinkle with sugar mixture.  Dot with butter.

Bake until apples are tender and beginning to brown and crust is golden, about 55 minutes.  Cool tart in pan on rack at least 45 minutes.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Serve tart slightly warm or at room temperature with cheese.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Fuji or McIntosh apples work best for this tart; other varieties may be too juicy.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  20                    uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary -- more or less
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Balsamic vinegar -- as needed
  10                    bacon slices -- halved crosswise
                        Crumbled Stilton cheese -- as needed
                        = (or other blue cheese)

Arrange shrimp on baking sheet.  Sprinkle with rosemary, ground black pepper, and several splashes of vinegar.  Wrap each in bacon, covering completely; secure with toothpick.  (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead.  Cover and chill on sheet.)

Preheat broiler.  Broil shrimp 4 to 5 inches from heat source until shrimp are cooked through and bacon is browned, watching carefully to prevent burning, about 5 minutes per side.  Remove toothpicks.  Transfer shrimp to platter.  Sprinkle hot shrimp with cheese and serve.

This recipe yields 20 shrimp.

Comments:  "The recipes here reflect my British roots, but not necessarily my family traditions," writes Mairi Morrison of London, England.  "Although my mother is from Scotland and my father is from Northern Ireland, I grew up in Los Angeles, where our weeknight meals were typically American: spaghetti, tacos, and burgers.  It wasnít until I moved to Europe that I became really interested in food.  Here in London my social life is centered around the table.  I really like this dish because it is typically British, and perfect for a rainy winter evening in London."

Since these hors díoeuvres can be assembled ahead, theyíre good for a cocktail party.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ORANGE CURD ===
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/3           cup  fresh blood orange juice
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
  6              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  grated blood orange peel
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 8 pieces,
                        and at room temperature
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 8 pieces
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  1              large  egg yolk
  8                     blood oranges
                        Orange Caramel Sauce -- (see recipe)

For Orange Curd:  Whisk sugar, orange juice, lemon juice, eggs, egg yolks, and orange peel in medium metal bowl to blend.  Add butter; set bowl over saucepan of simmering water and whisk constantly until curd thickens and instant-read thermometer inserted into curd registers 175 degrees, about 12 minutes (do not boil).  Remove bowl from over water.  Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of curd; chill at least 1 day and up to 3 days.

For Crust:  Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Add butter and cut in, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add cream and egg yolk and process until dough clumps together.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.

Roll out dough on floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer to 10-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Fold dough overhang in and press onto pan sides, forming double-thick sides.  Pierce crust all over with fork; freeze 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake crust until cooked through, about 30 minutes.  Cool crust completely in pan on rack.  Spread curd evenly in cooled crust.  (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.)

Cut peel and white pith from oranges.  Using small sharp knife, cut between membranes to release orange segments.  Transfer segments to paper towels and pat dry.  Arrange orange segments in concentric circles atop orange curd.  Chill tart up to 1 hour.

Remove pan sides.  Cut tart into wedges.  Drizzle lightly with Orange Caramel Sauce and serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  If you canít find blood oranges in your supermarket, you can substitute regular navel oranges in both the tart and the Orange Caramel Sauce.

I&apos;d love to make one of their salads -- it has dried cherries, bacon, and a blue-cheese vinaigrette.&quot;

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CUSTARD ===
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1                cup  whole milk
  1         tablespoon  loose English Breakfast tea
                        = (or Jasmine tea)
  1                     cinnamon stick
  8              whole  cardamom pods
  6                     whole cloves
  3                     rounds peeled fresh ginger, 1/4"-thk
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4      teaspoon  grated orange peel
                        === TOPPING ===
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
  2          teaspoons  sugar

For Custard:  Combine first 7 ingredients in medium saucepan.  Bring to boil.  Remove from heat; cover and let steep 15 minutes to develop flavor.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Place six 3/4-cup custard cups or ramekins in 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan.

Pour cream mixture through fine strainer into medium bowl.  Discard solids in strainer.   Whisk egg yolks, brown sugar, and orange peel in 4-cup measuring cup to blend well.  Gradually whisk in cream mixture.  Pour custard into custard cups, dividing equally (cups will not be full).  Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of custard cups.  Cover baking pan with foil.  Pierce foil in several places with skewer to allow steam to escape.

Bake custards until softly set (centers will move slightly when cups are shaken gently), about 30 minutes.  Remove custards from water.  Cool on rack.  Chill until cold, about 4 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; keep chilled.)

For Topping:  Beat whipping cream and sugar in medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Place dollop of whipped cream atop each pot de crËme and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  These creamy custards feature the flavors of chai, a spiced tea thatís enhanced with cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and ginger.

Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Thanksgiving


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1                cup  whole peeled roasted chestnuts -- (from 7.4-oz jar)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  3               cups  whole milk
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  pasta flour (golden semolina flour)
                        = (available at specialty foods stores,
                        Italian markets, and some supermarkets)
  1 1/4           cups  coarsely-grated Fontina cheese - (packed) -- (abt 5 oz)
  5              large  eggs -- separated

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 11- by 7-inch glass baking dish.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add chestnuts and thyme.  SautÈ until heated through, breaking chestnuts into 1/2-inch pieces with back of spoon, about 4 minutes.

Bring milk just to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add salt, then gradually whisk in pasta flour.  Reduce heat to medium.  Cook until mixture is very thick, stirring constantly, about 3 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Add remaining 6 tablespoons butter, then 1 cup cheese, whisking until cheese melts.  Whisk in egg yolks 1 at a time; stir in chestnuts.  Beat egg whites in large bowl until stiff but not dry.  Fold whites into warm flour mixture in 2 additions.

Transfer to prepared dish; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese.  Bake spoon bread until puffed and beginning to brown, about 35 minutes.  Let cool 5 minutes; serve warm.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Whole roasted chestnuts (now conveniently packed ready-to-use in jars) and creamy Fontina cheese enrich this take on a classic southern bread.

                Thanksgiving

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  unsweetened
                        Cocoa powder -- as needed
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2              large  egg yolks
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  light corn syrup
     3/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
  3              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  miniature semisweet chocolate chips -- (6 oz)
     3/4           cup  shredded unsweetened coconut -- plus
  3        tablespoons  shredded unsweetened coconut
  1 1/2           cups  pecan halves - (abt 7 oz) -- toasted

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Whisk flour, cocoa, sugar, and salt in large bowl to blend.  Add butter; rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Whisk yolks in small bowl to blend; add to flour mixture.  Stir until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball; press over bottom and up sides of 11-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Bake crust until set, about 15 minutes.  Cool while preparing filling.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

For Filling:  Blend corn syrup, sugar, and butter in medium bowl.  Whisk in eggs, vanilla, and salt.  Stir in 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 3/4 cup coconut, and pecans.  Pour filling into prepared crust.

Bake tart until filling is set and golden brown on top, about 40 minutes.  Place tart on rack.  Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips evenly around edge of warm tart.  Let stand just until chips soften, about 5 minutes.  Using small spatula, spread chocolate to form 1-inch border around edge of tart.  Sprinkle chocolate border with remaining 3 tablespoons coconut.  Cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover loosely with foil; let stand at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 14 to 16 servings.

Comments:  Pecan pie dresses up for the holiday.  Chocoholics, take note: In addition to the bits of chocolate in the filling, there's cocoa powder in the delicious crust.

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Whisk flour, cocoa, sugar, and salt in large bowl to blend.  Add butter; rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Whisk yolks in small bowl to blend; add to flour mixture.  Stir until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball; press over bottom and up sides of 11-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Bake crust until set, about 15 minutes.  Cool while preparing filling.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Filling:  Blend corn syrup, sugar, and butter in medium bowl.  Whisk in eggs, vanilla, and salt.  Stir in 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 3/4 cup coconut, and pecans.  Pour filling into prepared crust.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake tart until filling is set and golden brown on top, about 40 minutes.  Place tart on rack.  Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips evenly around edge of warm tart.  Let stand just until chips soften, about 5 minutes.  Using small spatula, spread chocolate to form 1-inch border around edge of tart.  Sprinkle chocolate border with remaining 3 tablespoons coconut.  Cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover loosely with foil; let stand at room temperature.)

<DirT>
This recipe yields 14 to 16 servings.

Comments:  Pecan pie dresses up for the holiday.  Chocoholics, take note: In addition to the bits of chocolate in the filling, there&apos;s cocoa powder in the delicious crust.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
                        = (preferably Dutch-process)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
     3/4      teaspoon  peppermint extract
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  sugar
  1              large  egg
  6             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)

Whisk flour, cocoa powder, and salt in medium bowl to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until smooth.  Beat in peppermint extract and vanilla extract.  Beat in sugar in 3 additions.  Add egg and beat until blended.  Add dry ingredients and beat just until blended (dough will be sticky).

Divide dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap.  Using plastic wrap as aid, form dough on each into 2-inch-diameter log.  Wrap with plastic and refrigerate dough until well chilled, at least 2 hours.  (Dough can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

Position 1 rack in center and 1 rack in top third of oven; preheat to 350 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

Unwrap cookie dough logs; roll briefly on work surface to form smooth round logs.  Cut logs crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick rounds.  Place rounds on prepared baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart.  Bake cookies until tops and edges are dry to touch, about 15 minutes.  Transfer baking sheets with cookies to racks; cool completely.

Stir chocolate in top of double boiler set over simmering water until melted and smooth.  Remove from over water.  Cool melted chocolate until slightly thickened but still pourable, about 10 minutes.

Dip fork into melted chocolate, then wave fork back and forth over cookies, drizzling melted chocolate thickly over cookies in zigzag pattern.  Refrigerate cookies on baking sheets until chocolate is set, about 10 minutes.  (Cookies can be made 1 week ahead.  Refrigerate in airtight container between sheets of parchment paper or waxed paper.)

This recipe yields about 3 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  Girl Scout Thin Mints from your kitchen: If you love those cookies, youíll love these.  Make an extra batch to give as gifts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STARS ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray -- as needed
     1/3           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
                        === CARAMEL SYRUP ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  water
     1/2           cup  hot water
                        === CAKE ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  whole milk
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  4              large  eggs
  1 3/4           cups  sugar
  2          teaspoons  grated orange peel
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FROSTING ===
  2               cups  chilled whipping cream
  1                cup  chilled sour cream
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  2          teaspoons  grated orange peel

For Stars:  Spray inside of 4 star-shaped cookie cutters with nonstick spray.  Oil baking sheet; place cutters on sheet.

Combine sugar and 2 tablespoons water in heavy small saucepan over low heat.  Stir until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; boil until syrup turns deep amber, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 4 minutes.  Immediately pour thin layer of hot syrup inside each cookie cutter.  Cool stars completely.  Push stars out of cutters; wrap in foil.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Store at room temperature.)

For Syrup:  Stir sugar and 1/3 cup water in heavy small saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber color, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 7 minutes.  Add 1/2 cup hot water (mixture will bubble up).  Stir over low heat until hard bits dissolve.  Cool caramel syrup.

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line pans with waxed paper; butter paper.  Sift first 4 ingredients into small bowl.  Stir milk and butter in small saucepan over low heat just until butter melts; set aside.

Using electric mixer, beat eggs and sugar in large bowl until thick enough for batter to fall in heavy ribbon when beaters are lifted, about 5 minutes.  Beat in orange peel and vanilla.  Add flour mixture; beat just until blended.  Add warm milk mixture; beat just until blended.  Divide batter between prepared pans.

Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean and cakes begin to pull away from sides of pans, about 24 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 20 minutes.  Cut around pan sides and turn cakes out onto racks; peel off paper.  Turn cakes right-side up.  Using toothpick, poke holes in tops of cakes.  Brush half of caramel syrup over each cake.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Wrap cakes and let stand at room temperature.)

For Frosting:  Combine all ingredients in large bowl; beat until firm peaks form.

Place 1 cake layer on platter.  Spread 1 1/2 cups frosting over.  Top with second layer.  Spread frosting over top and sides.  Chill at least 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; keep chilled.)

Stand stars upright on cake.  Serve cake cold or let stand up to 1 hour at room temperature before serving.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Many Mexican desserts are topped with cajeta, a thick caramel sauce.  Two caramel elements make this cake especially delicious: a syrup that's drizzled over each layer and caramelized sugar stars on top.  Use a variety of star-shaped cookie cutters to make the stars.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GLAZE ===
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
     1/2           cup  honey
  3        tablespoons  grated orange peel - (packed)
  3        tablespoons  grated lime peel - (packed) -- from about 12 limes
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  4          teaspoons  chopped canned chipotle chilies -- see * Note
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === TURKEY ===
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  4 1/2           cups  chopped onions
  1                     turkey - (22 to 24 lbs) -- neck, gizzard,
                        and heart reserved
  2               cups  chopped peeled carrots
  2               cups  chopped celery with leaves
  1 1/2           cups  chopped plum tomatoes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  9               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth -- more or less
                        === GRAVY ===
  1                cup  canned low-salt chicken broth -- more or less
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

For Glaze:  Melt butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat.  Remove from heat.  Stir in next 7 ingredients.  Freeze until mixture begins to firm up but is still spreadable, about 30 minutes.  Set aside 1/2 cup citrus glaze for gravy.

For Turkey:  Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and reserved turkey parts and sautÈ until onions are very deep brown, about 22 minutes.  Add carrots, celery, and tomatoes to skillet and toss to blend.  (Glaze and vegetable mixture can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and chill.  Cover turkey and chill.)

Set rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Place small rack in center of large roasting pan.  Sprinkle vegetable mixture with turkey parts around rack.  Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry.  Place turkey on rack in roasting pan.  Starting at neck end, carefully slide hand between skin and breast meat to loosen skin.  Rub 1/2 cup citrus glaze over breast meat under skin.

If stuffing turkey, spoon stuffing loosely into neck and main cavities.  Tuck wing tips under turkey; tie legs together loosely to hold shape.  Brush 1/3 cup glaze over top and sides of turkey (not bottom); reserve any remaining glaze.  Sprinkle turkey generously with salt and pepper.  Cover turkey (not pan) loosely with foil.  Roast 30 minutes.

Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees; add 1 cup broth to pan.  Press foil snugly around turkey (not pan).  Roast 1 hour 15 minutes.  Add 1 cup broth to pan.  Roast turkey until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, adding 1 cup broth every 30 minutes, lifting foil to baste with pan juices and removing foil during last 15 minutes to brown turkey, about 3 hours 30 minutes longer if unstuffed or 4 hours 15 minutes if stuffed.  Transfer turkey to platter.  Tent with foil; let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature of turkey will increase by 5 to 10 degrees).  Reserve pan juices.

For Gravy:  Strain pan juices into 8-cup measuring cup, pressing on solids to extract some pulp and as much liquid as possible; discard solids in strainer.  Spoon fat from top of juices; discard fat.  Add enough chicken broth to pan juices in cup to measure 6 cups.

Stir reserved 1/2 cup citrus glaze in heavy large saucepan over medium heat until melted.  Gradually add flour; whisk 1 minute.  Gradually whisk in pan juices.  Bring to boil, whisking until smooth.  Reduce heat to medium; boil until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.  Season gravy with salt and pepper.  Brush any remaining glaze over turkey.  Serve turkey with gravy.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  Traditional flavors (honey and orange) and contemporary ones (cumin and chilies) come together in the glaze, which also gives the gravy some heat and zip.

For Glaze:  Melt butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat.  Remove from heat.  Stir in next 7 ingredients.  Freeze until mixture begins to firm up but is still spreadable, about 30 minutes.  Set aside 1/2 cup citrus glaze for gravy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Turkey:  Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and reserved turkey parts and sautÈ until onions are very deep brown, about 22 minutes.  Add carrots, celery, and tomatoes to skillet and toss to blend.  (Glaze and vegetable mixture can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and chill.  Cover turkey and chill.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Set rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Place small rack in center of large roasting pan.  Sprinkle vegetable mixture with turkey parts around rack.  Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry.  Place turkey on rack in roasting pan.  Starting at neck end, carefully slide hand between skin and breast meat to loosen skin.  Rub 1/2 cup citrus glaze over breast meat under skin.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If stuffing turkey, spoon stuffing loosely into neck and main cavities.  Tuck wing tips under turkey; tie legs together loosely to hold shape.  Brush 1/3 cup glaze over top and sides of turkey (not bottom); reserve any remaining glaze.  Sprinkle turkey generously with salt and pepper.  Cover turkey (not pan) loosely with foil.  Roast 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees; add 1 cup broth to pan.  Press foil snugly around turkey (not pan).  Roast 1 hour 15 minutes.  Add 1 cup broth to pan.  Roast turkey until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, adding 1 cup broth every 30 minutes, lifting foil to baste with pan juices and removing foil during last 15 minutes to brown turkey, about 3 hours 30 minutes longer if unstuffed or 4 hours 15 minutes if stuffed.  Transfer turkey to platter.  Tent with foil; let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature of turkey will increase by 5 to 10 degrees).  Reserve pan juices.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Gravy:  Strain pan juices into 8-cup measuring cup, pressing on solids to extract some pulp and as much liquid as possible; discard solids in strainer.  Spoon fat from top of juices; discard fat.  Add enough chicken broth to pan juices in cup to measure 6 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  10       tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- cut 1/2" pieces
     1/2           cup  chilled solid vegetable shortening -- cut 1/2" pieces
  4        tablespoons  ice water -- more or less
                        === FILLING ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  1 3/4         pounds  sweet apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced - (abt 5 1/2 cups)
                        = (such as Spartan or Golden Delicious)
  1 3/4         pounds  tart apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced - (abt 5 1/2 cups)
                        = (such as Granny Smith or Pippin)
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon -- plus
                        A large pinch of ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- diced
  1         tablespoon  whole milk

For Crust:  Whisk flour and salt in large bowl to blend.  Add butter and shortening and rub in with fingertips until very coarse meal forms.  Sprinkle with 3 tablespoons water; toss until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if mixture is dry.  Gather dough into ball; divide in half.  Flatten into disks.  Wrap in plastic; chill at least 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Soften slightly at room temperature before using.)

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Spray 9-inch-diameter deep-dish glass pie dish with nonstick spray.  Stir all apples, 3/4 cup sugar, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and vanilla in large bowl to blend.  Let stand until juices form, about 15 minutes.  Mix in flour.

Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round.  Place dough in prepared pie dish.  Spoon in filling; dot with butter.  Roll out second dough disk to 13-inch round.  Using small bottle cap, cut out ten 1/2-inch-diameter circles from dough for decoration; discard circles.  Drape dough over filling.  Seal top and bottom crust edges together; trim to 1/2-inch overhang.  Fold overhang under; crimp decoratively.  Brush pie with milk.  Combine remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and large pinch of cinnamon in small bowl; sprinkle over pie.

Transfer pie to baking sheet; place in oven.  Immediately reduce temperature to 375 degrees.  Bake pie until crust is golden brown, apples are tender and filling is bubbling thickly, covering edge with foil if browning too quickly, about 2 hours.  Cool 30 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover loosely; store at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments;  Tart apples and sweet ones come together in this all-American favorite.

  1                cup  canned low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  4               cups  coarse fresh breadcrumbs
                        = (made from crustless French bread)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cook bacon in heavy large ovenproof pot over medium-high heat until brown and crisp, about 4 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to bowl.  Add sausages to drippings in pot; sautÈ until brown, about 15 minutes.  Transfer to bowl with bacon.

Pour off all but 1/4 cup drippings from pot.  Add onions and garlic to pot and sautÈ until beginning to soften, about 10 minutes.  Stir in rosemary, thyme, and crushed red pepper.  Add brandy and simmer until almost evaporated, about 3 minutes.  Stir in canned beans, tomatoes with juices, lima beans, 1 cup broth, tomato paste, and allspice.

Return sausages and bacon to pot.  Season cassoulet with salt and pepper.  Bring to boil.  Cover pot and transfer to preheated oven; bake 30 minutes.  (Can be made up to 2 days ahead.  Uncover; cool 1 hour.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold; cover and keep refrigerated.  Before continuing, cover and rewarm in 350 degrees oven 40 minutes, adding more broth if dry.)

Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees.  Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add breadcrumbs and sautÈ until light golden, about 4 minutes.  Transfer to small bowl.  Mix in Parmesan cheese; season with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle over warm cassoulet.  Bake until breadcrumb topping is deep golden, about 20 minutes.  Sprinkle cassoulet with parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Make this at least one day and up to two days ahead for best flavor.  This is a much simplified version of the classic smoked meat and bean cassoulet.

Comments:  "My grandmother was a reporter in New York before she got married and moved to Montana to start a new life on a ranch," writes Joyce Litz of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  "At the time she didnít know how to cook, and learning wasnít easy -- the place didnít even have running water.  Still, she appreciated good food, so she persevered and became a great cook.  Later my grandmother taught me ranch-style cooking, a lot of which involved getting simple but flavorful, hearty meals ready in a hurry."

Serve with diced cucumber mixed into yogurt.

Comments:  &quot;My grandmother was a reporter in New York before she got married and moved to Montana to start a new life on a ranch,&quot; writes Joyce Litz of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  &quot;At the time she didnít know how to cook, and learning wasnít easy -- the place didnít even have running water.  Still, she appreciated good food, so she persevered and became a great cook.  Later my grandmother taught me ranch-style cooking, a lot of which involved getting simple but flavorful, hearty meals ready in a hurry.&quot;

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGHNUTS ===
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  ground ginger
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped crystallized ginger -- (abt 4 oz)
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  3              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- melted, cooled
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  2          teaspoons  ground ginger
  3               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
  3               cups  solid vegetable shortening -- for frying

For Doughnuts:  Whisk first 4 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Stir in crystallized ginger and lemon peel.

Whisk sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract in large bowl to blend well.  Stir in cream and melted butter.  Add dry ingredients and stir to blend well (dough will be sticky).  Cover bowl with plastic wrap; chill at least 1 hour.  (Dough can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

For Topping:  Mix sugar and ground ginger in medium bowl to blend.

Line large baking sheet with plastic wrap.  Roll out dough on generously floured surface to 3/4-inch thickness.  Using floured 2 1/4-inch cookie cutter, cut out dough rounds.  Using floured 1 1/4-inch cookie cutter, cut out hole in center of each large dough round, forming doughnuts.  Gather dough scraps and reroll on floured surface.  Repeat process, cutting out more doughnuts until all dough is used up.  Place doughnuts on prepared baking sheet.

Line another large baking sheet with several layers of paper towels.  Combine vegetable oil and shortening in heavy large pot.  Attach deep-fry thermometer inside pot.  Heat oil mixture over medium heat until thermometer registers 350 degrees.  Adjust heat as necessary to maintain temperature.

Using slotted spoon, carefully lower 4 doughnuts into oil.  Cook until bottoms of doughnuts are deep golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Turn doughnuts over and cook until bottoms are brown, about 2 minutes longer.  Using slotted spoon, transfer doughnuts to paper-towel-lined baking sheet to drain.  Cool slightly.

While doughnuts are still warm, turn to coat in sugar topping.  Repeat process with remaining doughnuts.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cool completely.  Wrap in plastic wrap and store at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 2 dozen.

Comments:  These are great after dinner with coffee or as an afternoon pick-me-up with tea.  They are best served freshly made, but they can also be prepared one day ahead and stored at room temperature in plastic wrap.

                        === TOPPING ===
  1            package  mascarpone cheese - (8 oz)
                        = (available at Italian markets and many
                        supermarkets)
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice

  2          teaspoons  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped crystallized ginger
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  mild-flavored (light) molasses
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1              large  egg
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon peel
     1/2           cup  boiling water
                        Powdered sugar

For Topping:  Whisk mascarpone cheese, honey, and lemon juice in small bowl to blend.  Cover; chill until ready to serve.  (Can be made 1 day ahead; keep chilled.)

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour 8-inch square metal baking pan.  Whisk first 6 ingredients in medium bowl to blend well; whisk in crystallized ginger.  Whisk oil, molasses, and brown sugar in large bowl to blend; whisk in egg and lemon peel.  Gradually whisk in dry ingredients, then boiling water.  Transfer batter to prepared pan.

Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool cake 15 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool completely; cover and store at room temperature.)

Cut cake into squares; sift powdered sugar over.  Serve warm or at room temperature with topping.

This recipe yields 9 servings.

Comments:  Mascarpone cheese, with its slightly tart flavor, gets a sweet boost from honey.   If you can't find mascarpone, top this with honey-sweetened sour cream or crËme fraÓche.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bag fresh cranberries -- (12 ounce)
  16                    kumquats -- stemmed, rinsed,
                        and patted dry
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  minced crystallized ginger

Using on/off turns, coarsely chop cranberries in processor.  Transfer cranberries to medium bowl.  Mince half of kumquats, removing any seeds.  Thinly slice remaining kumquats, removing any seeds.

Mix all kumquats, sugar, and ginger into chopped cranberries (as mixture sits, sugar will dissolve).  Cover relish and refrigerate at least 4 hours.  (Cranberry relish can be prepared 1 week ahead.  Cover tightly and keep refrigerated.)

Comments:  Kumquats lend their bright citrus snap to a no-cooking-required relish.

  10                    red grapefruit
     3/4           cup  dry red wine
                        = (such as Zinfandel or
                        Cabernet Sauvignon)
     3/4           cup  sugar

Cut peel and white pith from 6 grapefruit.  Working over bowl, cut between membranes to release segments.  Cover and chill segments at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day.

Cut remaining 4 grapefruit in half.  Using juicer, juice grapefruit.  Pour 3/4 cup juice into heavy medium saucepan.  (Reserve any remaining juice for another use.)  Using spoon, scoop out membranes from grapefruit halves and discard, reserving grapefruit cups.

Add wine and sugar to juice in saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Simmer until reduced by half, about 10 minutes.  Cool wine syrup to room temperature.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover grapefruit halves and wine syrup separately and refrigerate.  Bring wine syrup to room temperature before using.)

Arrange grapefruit cups on large platter.  Divide segments among cups.  Drizzle each grapefruit cup with wine syrup and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Here's an elegant and refreshing dish that features a wine syrup drizzled over grapefruit segments (skip the syrup on the kids' portions) and served in hollowed-out halves.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  sea scallops
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1 1/3           cups  chopped fresh chives
     3/4           cup  crËme fraÓche or sour cream
     1/2           cup  minced fresh tarragon -- plus
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh tarragon
  5        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1 1/3           cups  diced peeled seeded English
                        hothouse cucumber
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  thinly-sliced smoked salmon
     3/4           cup  olive oil
     1/3           cup  tarragon vinegar
  2            bunches  watercress -- thick stems trimmed
  2              large  Belgian endive heads -- trimmed, and
                        leaves separated

Combine scallops and wine in large skillet.  Cover and simmer over medium heat until scallops are just opaque in center, about 5 minutes.  Drain.  Chill scallops until cold, about 2 hours.  Cut scallops into 1/2-inch pieces.

Line twelve 3/4-cup soufflÈ dishes with plastic wrap, extending over sides by 3 inches.  Whisk 1 cup fresh chives, crËme fraÓche, 1/2 cup tarragon, and 3 tablespoons mustard in large bowl to blend.  Gently stir in scallops and cucumber.  Season with salt and pepper.

Cut 12 rounds from salmon slices to fit bottom of soufflÈ dishes; place 1 round in each dish.  Top each with 1/4 cup scallop mixture.  Top each with another layer of salmon, trimming to fit.  Divide remaining scallop mixture among dishes (about 1/4 cup for each).  Top each with a third layer of salmon, trimming to fit.  Fold plastic wrap overhang over terrines to enclose completely.  Chill at least 4 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.)

Whisk oil, vinegar and 1/3 cup chives, 3 tablespoons tarragon, and 2 tablespoons mustard in medium bowl to blend.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Unfold plastic wrap atop each terrine.  Invert 1 terrine onto each of 12 plates.  Peel off plastic wrap from each terrine.  Surround each terrine with watercress sprigs and endive leaves.  Drizzle greens and terrines with vinaigrette and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  These can be made one day ahead, then drizzled with the vinaigrette just before serving.

Line twelve 3/4-cup soufflÈ dishes with plastic wrap, extending over sides by 3 inches.  Whisk 1 cup fresh chives, crËme fraÓche, 1/2 cup tarragon, and 3 tablespoons mustard in large bowl to blend.  Gently stir in scallops and cucumber.  Season with salt and pepper.

Cut 12 rounds from salmon slices to fit bottom of soufflÈ dishes; place 1 round in each dish.  Top each with 1/4 cup scallop mixture.  Top each with another layer of salmon, trimming to fit.  Divide remaining scallop mixture among dishes (about 1/4 cup for each).  Top each with a third layer of salmon, trimming to fit.  Fold plastic wrap overhang over terrines to enclose completely.  Chill at least 4 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk oil, vinegar and 1/3 cup chives, 3 tablespoons tarragon, and 2 tablespoons mustard in medium bowl to blend.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Unfold plastic wrap atop each terrine.  Invert 1 terrine onto each of 12 plates.  Peel off plastic wrap from each terrine.  Surround each terrine with watercress sprigs and endive leaves.  Drizzle greens and terrines with vinaigrette and serve.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 12 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  These can be made one day ahead, then drizzled with the vinaigrette just before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2         pounds  russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  whole milk
     3/4           cup  chopped fresh chives - (abt 3 bunches)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chilled butter -- cut small pieces

Butter 6- to 8-cup ovenproof dish.  Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 12 minutes.  Drain potatoes; return to same pot.

Add cream cheese and mash well.  Mix in sour cream and milk, then chives.  Season potatoes with salt and pepper.  Spoon potatoes into prepared dish; dot with chilled butter.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead; let stand at room temperature.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake potatoes until heated through and beginning to brown on top, about 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "I spend as much time as I can cooking," writes Brigette Lyons of Allendale, New Jersey, "and I'm equally comfortable feeding two or two hundred.  I thoroughly enjoy giving sit-down meals, including an annual Christmas luncheon I do for about twenty guests.  I just like to cook, period.  Cooking for two hundred may be different from making weeknight dinners for myself and my husband, John, but organization is the key to both.  I try to keep things on hand that are simple and easy to prepare."

These rich and creamy mashed potatoes (thanks to sour cream and cream cheese) can be prepared ahead of time.

  36                    pecan halves

Pierce each yam all over with fork.  Working in 2 batches, cook yams in microwave 15 minutes.  Turn yams over; cook until tender, about 12 minutes longer.  Cut yams in half; scoop pulp into bowl.  Add 3/4 cup marshmallow creme, butter, and syrup; mash until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  Whisk in eggs.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut thin slice from top and bottom of each orange to make flat surfaces.  Cut oranges in half.  Scoop out pulp; reserve for another use.  Place orange cups on 2 baking sheets.  Divide yam mixture equally among cups.  Top each with dollop of marshmallow creme and 2 pecan halves.  Bake until beginning to brown, about 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 18 servings.

Comments;  Hollowed-out orange halves are filled with mashed yams and topped with marshmallow creme and pecans.

Comments:  Thanksgiving timing tip: If you have only one oven, you can prepare this dish ahead and serve it at room temperature, leaving plenty of room in the oven for the turkey.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine) -- see * Note
     3/4           cup  white miso (fermented soybean paste) -- see * Note
     1/2           cup  sake
     1/4           cup  sugar
  6                     sea bass fillets, 1"-thk - (5 to 6 oz ea)
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  chopped shallots
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
  1                cup  whipping cream
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Mirin and miso are available at Japanese markets and in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets.

Whisk mirin, white miso, sake, and sugar in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish to combine.  Add sea bass; turn to coat.  Cover fish and refrigerate 2 hours.

Boil white wine, chopped shallots, chopped garlic, bay leaf, and black peppercorns in heavy large saucepan until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 7 minutes.  Add whipping cream and boil until reduced to 1 cup, about 6 minutes.

Strain into medium saucepan, pressing on solids.  Place over low heat.  Add unsalted butter 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking until melted before adding more.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in fresh lemon juice.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover to keep warm.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Oil rimmed baking sheet.  Remove fish from marinade; transfer to prepared sheet.  Bake until almost opaque in center, about 10 minutes.

Preheat broiler.  Broil fish until well-browned on top and opaque in center, watching closely to avoid burning, about 3 minutes.  Transfer fish to plates.  Spoon sauce around and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "On a recent visit to Las Vegas, my father and I ate at Malibu Chan's," writes Stephanie Flanders of Simi Valley, California.  "I had the sea bass, and I'm already craving it again.  I'm hoping to add it to my recipe collection."

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  tangerines
     1/2           cup  halved pitted Kalamata olives
                        = (or other brine-cured black olives)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1               head  butter lettuce -- torn 1 1/2" pieces
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh parsley

Using small sharp knife, cut peel and white pith from tangerines.  Working over medium bowl, cut between membranes to release segments.  Add olives to bowl.

Whisk oil and next 4 ingredients in another medium bowl to blend.  Add to tangerine mixture; toss to coat.  Season tangerine mixture with salt and pepper.

Divide lettuce among 4 plates.  Top lettuce with tangerine mixture.  Sprinkle salads with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Pairing citrus fruit with olives is a time-honored Moroccan tradition.  While most versions of this salad call for oranges, tangerines make a sweet substitute.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
  1                cup  chopped fresh fennel bulb
  2                     shallots -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  fennel seeds
  5 1/2           cups  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  3             pounds  mussels -- scrubbed, debearded

Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add chopped fennel, shallots, garlic and fennel seeds.  SautÈ until fennel is tender, about 5 minutes.

Add wine and cream and boil until liquid thickens, about 10 minutes.  Add mussels.  Cover and cook until mussels open, about 5 minutes.

Divide mussels among 6 shallow bowls (discard any mussels that do not open).  Ladle broth over and serve.

This recipe yields 6 first-course servings.

Comments:  "My profession as a real estate agent requires a lot of my time," writes Edi Meadows Morrissette of Westin, Florida, "so it helps that I am lightning-fast in the kitchen.  I cook every day, and on the weekends I sometimes make three meals a day.  I accomplish that by following my main cooking principles: (1) do a lot of prep work, and (2) keep the kitchen well stocked.  For example, at holiday time I might chop onions in advance or bake bread the day before company arrives.  And since I converted the bedroom next to my kitchen into a pantry for extra storage, I know I'll always have the right ingredients at my fingertips."

Use crusty French bread or the "Roasted Garlic Cheese Toasts" (see recipe) to soak up the fennel-flavored juices.

  5                     navel oranges
  5                     cardamom pods
  3               cups  water

Transfer cardamom and reserved orange peel strip to heavy medium saucepan.  Add 3 cups water, sugar, lemon peel, and cinnamon stick; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to low; simmer until mixture is reduced to 1 cup, about 50 minutes.  Cool syrup 10 minutes.  Strain, discarding solids in strainer.

Pour warm syrup over oranges and chill at least 6 hours or overnight.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Serve the oranges alone or alongside a wedge of angel food cake or pound cake.

Comments:  "When our travel plans changed and my husband and I found ourselves in Tampa overnight, we got a hotel room and then went searching for a restaurant," writes Lee Menconi-Steiger of San Pablo, California.  "Our concierge recommended SideBern's for dinner -- and it was outstanding.  We tried dozens of delicious items from their dim sum menu, but the dish I remember best is the Pacific Rim Caesar salad."

Top this salad with seared tuna or scallops to make it into a main course for four.

Comments:  &quot;When our travel plans changed and my husband and I found ourselves in Tampa overnight, we got a hotel room and then went searching for a restaurant,&quot; writes Lee Menconi-Steiger of San Pablo, California.  &quot;Our concierge recommended SideBern&apos;s for dinner -- and it was outstanding.  We tried dozens of delicious items from their dim sum menu, but the dish I remember best is the Pacific Rim Caesar salad.&quot;

<DirT>
Top this salad with seared tuna or scallops to make it into a main course for four.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  8                     uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined,

  4                     shallots -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  6             ounces  fresh crabmeat
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12              cups  water
     1/2      teaspoon  saffron threads -- crumbled
  12            ounces  angel hair pasta

Mix 1/2 cup stock and cornstarch in small bowl to blend.

Heat oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shrimp, shallots, and garlic; sautÈ 1 minute.  Stir in crabmeat.  Add wine and simmer until almost evaporated, about 2 minutes.

Add 1 1/4 cups stock and bring to boil.  Stir cornstarch mixture to blend; mix into sauce.  Bring to boil, stirring frequently.

Reduce heat and simmer until sauce thickens, about 1 minute.  Add cream and curry powder; simmer until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover to keep warm.

This recipe yields 6 first-course or 4 main-course servings.

Comments:  "Athens, Georgia, has a great restaurant called The Basil Press," writes Linda Buchman of Hilton Head, South Carolina.  "During my last visit there, chef Andrew Urell prepared an angel hair pasta with curried crab and shrimp.  I'd love to try making it at home."

At the restaurant, this is served as a side dish for grilled salmon.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped stemmed dried
                        Calimyrna figs - (abt 5 oz)
  2        tablespoons  brandy
  2        tablespoons  water
  1                cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  light corn syrup
  3              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted, cooled
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  pecan halves -- toasted
                        Flaky Pie Crust Dough -- (see recipe)
                        === CREAM ===
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  brandy

For Filling:  Stir figs, brandy, and water in heavy small saucepan over low heat until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes; cool.  Mix brown sugar, corn syrup, and next 4 ingredients in medium bowl.  Stir in pecans, then fig mixture.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter deep-dish glass pie dish.  Fold edge of dough over, forming double edge, and crimp decoratively, pressing to top edge of dish.  Pierce all over with fork.  Freeze crust 15 minutes.

Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake until sides are set, about 12 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Bake until crust is pale golden, pressing with back of fork if crust bubbles, about 10 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees.

Spoon filling into warm crust.  Bake until filling is puffed at edges and set in center, about 40 minutes.  Let stand until cool, at least 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

For Cream:  Beat cream, sugar, and brandy in medium bowl.  Whisk until peaks form.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Cover; chill.)  Serve pie with cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Dried figs and brandy add a new dimension to classic pecan pie.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  plain couscous
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/2         large  banana -- chopped - (1/2 cup)
  1         tablespoon  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2           cups  chilled whipping cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  chilled whipping cream
  5        tablespoons  sweetened cream of coconut
                        = (such as Coco LÛpez)
  1         tablespoon  triple sec

  1 1/2           cups  diced peeled fresh pineapple

Bring 3/4 cup water to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat.  Stir in couscous.  Remove from heat.  Cover and let stand until water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.  Fluff with fork.

Melt butter in small nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add banana and sugar and sautÈ until banana is soft, about 1 minute.  Cool.

Using electric mixer, beat cream in large bowl until soft peaks form.  Fold in cream of coconut and triple sec.  Reserve 6 tablespoons whipped cream mixture for topping.  Fold candied pineapple, couscous, and banana into remaining whipped cream mixture in large bowl.  Divide mixture among 6 parfait glasses or dessert bowls.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.

Comments:  Couscous is a staple of the Moroccan table.  This dessert version is similar to rice pudding.  Cream of coconut, available in the liquor section of most supermarkets, adds extra flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
     3/4           cup  warm water -- (105 to 115 deg)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dry yeast - (from 1 envelope)
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- more or less
                        === SEASONED OIL ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
                        === TOPPING ===
  1              bunch  Swiss chard - (abt 10 oz) -- white ribs cut away
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Yellow cornmeal -- as needed
  8             ounces  whole-milk mozzarella cheese -- coarsely grated
  4             ounces  soft fresh goat cheese -- crumbled

For Crust:  Pour 3/4 cup water into large bowl.  Sprinkle yeast over; stir to blend.  Let stand 10 minutes to dissolve yeast.  Add oil and salt, then 1 1/2 cups flour.  Stir until well blended (dough will be sticky).  Turn dough out onto generously floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding just enough flour to prevent dough from sticking, about 5 minutes (dough will be soft).

Shape dough into ball; place in large oiled bowl and turn to coat.  Cover bowl with kitchen towel.  Let dough rise at cool room temperature until almost doubled, about 2 hours.  Punch dough down; form into ball.  Return to bowl; cover with towel and let rise until doubled, about 3 hours.

Meanwhile, prepare Seasoned Oil:  Mix oil, garlic, and red pepper in small bowl.  Let stand 1 hour.

For Topping:  Cook chard in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 2 minutes.  Drain.  Rinse under cold water; drain.  Squeeze dry, then coarsely chop.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in small skillet over medium heat.  Add garlic and stir 30 seconds.  Add chard and stir 1 minute.  Season to taste with salt.

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Punch down dough.  Form into ball; place on floured work surface.  Cover with kitchen towel; let rest 30 minutes.

Sprinkle rimless baking sheet with cornmeal.  Roll out dough on floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer to baking sheet.  Sprinkle mozzarella over dough, leaving 1-inch border.  Scatter chard over mozzarella.  Top with goat cheese.  Brush crust edge with some of seasoned oil.  Set aside 2 teaspoons seasoned oil; drizzle remaining oil over pizza.

Bake pizza until crust is brown, about 15 minutes.  Remove from oven; brush edge with seasoned oil and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Allow about 5 1/2 hours for the pizza dough to rise.  The small quantity of yeast and a long, slow rise give the crust its great flavor and texture.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Flaky Pie Crust Dough -- (see recipe)
  1                can  pure pumpkin - (15 oz)
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/4           cups  whipping cream
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1              Pinch  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Fold overhang under and crimp decoratively.  Pierce dough all over with fork.  Freeze 15 minutes.

Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake until sides are set, about 12 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Whisk pumpkin and 3/4 cup sugar in large bowl to blend.  Whisk in eggs, then cream, spices, and salt.  Pour filling into warm crust.  Bake pie until filling is set in center, about 50 minutes.  Transfer pie to rack; cool 30 minutes.  Chill until cold, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.

Preheat broiler.  Sprinkle pie evenly with 2 tablespoons sugar.  Broil until sugar melts and begins to caramelize, turning pie for even browning, about 1 minute.  Let pie stand until topping hardens, about 20 minutes.  Sprinkle pie again with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.  Broil again until sugar browns, about 1 minute.

Refrigerate pie until topping hardens, about 30 minutes.  Serve or keep refrigerated no more than 2 hours longer.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  With its crisp sugary topping, this creamy dessert combines the best of two worlds: pumpkin pie and crËme br˚lÈe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16            ounces  sliced sourdough bread with crusts -- cut 1/2" pieces,
                        - (abt 14 cups)
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  1              pound  onions -- cut 3/4" pieces
  4             medium  parsnips - (abt 15 oz) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  2              large  red bell peppers -- cut 3/4" pieces
  1              pound  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, and
                        caps cut into 1" pieces
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  10       tablespoons  butter -- melted
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2 1/2           jars  whole roasted chestnuts - (7.4 oz ea) -- quartered,
                        - (abt 4 cups)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  2              large  eggs
                        Canned low-salt chicken broth

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place bread in large roasting pan.  Bake until golden, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Transfer bread to very large bowl; cool.  Maintain oven temperature.

Spray 2 large rimmed baking sheets with nonstick spray.  Combine onions, parsnips, peppers, mushrooms, rosemary, and 4 tablespoons butter in large bowl; toss to coat.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.  Divide vegetable mixture between prepared baking sheets.  Roast until vegetables are tender and beginning to brown, stirring every 10 minutes, about 35 minutes total.

Add roasted vegetables to bowl with bread.  Add chestnuts, parsley, and remaining 6 tablespoons melted butter; stir to blend.  Season stuffing to taste with salt and pepper.  Mix eggs into stuffing.

To bake stuffing in turkey:  Loosely fill neck and main cavities of turkey with stuffing.  Add enough broth to remaining stuffing to moisten slightly (1/4 to 3/4 cup, depending on amount of remaining stuffing).  Generously butter baking dish.  Spoon remaining stuffing into prepared dish.  Cover with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake stuffing in dish along side turkey until heated through, about 25 minutes.  Uncover stuffing.  Bake until top of stuffing is slightly crisp and golden, about 15 minutes longer.

To bake all of stuffing in baking dish:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Add enough extra broth to stuffing to moisten (3/4 cup to 1 1/4 cups).  Transfer stuffing to prepared dish.  Cover with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake until heated through, about 40 minutes.  Uncover and bake until top is slightly crisp and golden, about 20 minutes longer.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments;  Here's something good for vegetarians, too.  Just use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and bake in a dish.

Cover with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake stuffing in dish along side turkey until heated through, about 25 minutes.  Uncover stuffing.  Bake until top of stuffing is slightly crisp and golden, about 15 minutes longer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To bake all of stuffing in baking dish:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.

           Russian Walnut-Cherry Latkes With Cherry-Apple Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast                       Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  dried tart cherries
  1            package  farmer's cheese - (7.5 oz) -- drained
  2        tablespoons  cream cheese -- room temperature
  4              large  eggs -- separated
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  5        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped lightly-toasted walnuts
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- more or less
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- more or less
                        Cherry-Apple Sauce -- (see recipe)

Place cherries in small bowl with enough hot water to cover; soak until plumped, about 10 minutes.  Drain.  Set aside.

Blend both cheeses, egg yolks, and vanilla extract in processor just until smooth, about 30 seconds.  Add flour, sugar, and salt and mix in, using on/off turns, just until blended.  Transfer batter to large bowl.  Mix in reserved cherries and chopped walnuts.

Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl until stiff but not dry.  Gently fold whites into batter in 3 additions.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot but not smoking.  Working in batches, drop batter by heaping tablespoonfuls into skillet and spread to 2 1/2-inch rounds.  Cook until bottoms are golden, about 1 1/2 minutes per side.

Using slotted spatula, transfer latkes to plates.  Add more butter and oil as necessary and allow to get hot before adding more batter.  Serve immediately Cherry-Apple Sauce.

This recipe yields about 16 latkes.

Comments:  The sauce for these cheese-based latkes, which are great for breakfast, can be made two days ahead.  Be sure to serve the pancakes (enough for four people) as soon as they are made.

               Salad Of Fennel, Arugula, And Ricotta Salata

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  shallot -- minced (1/4 cup)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  10              cups  loosely packed arugula
  1             medium  fennel bulb -- trimmed, halved
                        lengthwise, cored, very thinly sliced
  3             ounces  ricotta salata or pecorino Romano -- shaved long strips
                        with vegetable peeler

Whisk shallot and lemon juice in small bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in oil.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Let stand 15 minutes to blend flavors.

Combine arugula and sliced fennel in large bowl.  Toss with enough dressing to coat salad.  Add shaved cheese; toss gently and serve.

Comments:  A young sheepís-milk cheese such as Italyís ricotta salata or pecorino Romano (which is easier to find) is best for this salad.  Other good choices include Italian Toscanello and Manchego from Spain, which are also made from sheepís milk.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  chopped shallots
  3        tablespoons  Sherry wine vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- plus
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     bag mixed baby greens - (4.5 oz)
  18                    sea scallops -- side muscles
                        trimmed, halved crosswise
  6             ounces  andouille sausage -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley

Whisk chopped shallots, Sherry wine vinegar, and Dijon mustard in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in 1/2 cup olive oil.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead.  Cover dressing and let stand at room temperature.  Rewhisk before using.)

Toss mixed baby greens in large bowl with enough dressing to coat.  Divide salad among 6 plates.

Heat 2 tablespoons of remaining olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper.  Add scallops to skillet in single layer.  Cook until scallops are just opaque in center and lightly browned and all juices have evaporated, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer scallops to plate.

Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet over high heat.  Add sausage and sautÈ until crisp, about 3 minutes.  Return scallops to skillet and stir just until heated through, about 30 seconds.

Sprinkle scallop and andouille sausage mixture around salads, dividing equally.  Drizzle scallop and andouille sausage mixture with some of remaining dressing.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 6 appetizer servings.

Comments:  Smoky andouille sausage is the perfect counterpoint to the delicate scallops.  Smoked pork-and-beef sausages, sold at specialty foods stores and supermarkets.  Kielbasa can be substituted.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- plus
  1         tablespoon  butter -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  whole milk -- or more if needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12                    sea scallops -- side muscles
                        trimmed
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallot
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon -- plus
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh tarragon

Place potatoes in large pot.  Cover with cold water.  Add 1 teaspoon salt and bring to boil over high heat.  Boil until potatoes are tender when pierced with skewer, about 8 minutes.  Drain.  Return to pot.

Using potato masher, mash potatoes.  Mash in 1/4 cup butter.  Stir in 2/3 cup milk.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 hour ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.  Before serving, stir over medium heat until heated through, adding more milk by tablespoonfuls if dry.)

Place wine and shallots in small saucepan.  Simmer over medium heat until reduced to glaze, about 3 minutes.  Stir in cream; simmer 1 minute.  Gradually whisk in remaining 1/4 cup butter.  Stir in reserved pan juices.  Stir in 1 1/2 tablespoons tarragon.  Season tarragon sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Stir remaining 1/4 cup tarragon into warm mashed potatoes.  Divide potatoes among 4 shallow bowls.  Place scallops atop mashed potatoes.  Drizzle with tarragon sauce and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Tarragon adds its distinctive anise-like flavor to this terrific main course.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     red bell peppers -- quartered
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced

  3               cups  whole milk
  2               cups  water
  1                     bay leaf
  1                cup  polenta (coarse cornmeal)
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  6                     sea bass fillets - (6 oz ea)
  6        tablespoons  tapenade

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Toss peppers, 2 tablespoons oil, garlic, and 3 teaspoons thyme in 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan.

Meanwhile, preheat broiler.  Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper.  Add to skillet; cook until opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side.  Remove from heat.  Spread 1 tablespoon tapenade over each fillet.  Broil red peppers in pan until heated through, about 2 minutes.

Spoon polenta onto 6 plates.  Top with fish and red peppers.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Maison Novelli offers this great entrÈe.  You can find polenta and tapenade at Italian markets and some supermarkets.

         Short Ribs Provencale With Creme Fraiche Mashed Potatoes

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- or more if needed
  6             pounds  meaty beef short ribs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  1             medium  carrot -- finely chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- finely chopped
  12             whole  garlic cloves -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  dried herbes de Provence, see * Note
  2               cups  red Zinfandel
  2 1/2           cups  canned beef broth
  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2           cup  water -- more or less
  24                    baby carrots -- peeled
     1/2           cup  NiÁois olives -- pitted
                        = (available at specialty foods stores,
                        Italian markets, and some supermarkets)
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
                        CrËme FraÓche Mashed Potatoes -- (see recipe)

* Note:  A dried herb mixture available at specialty foods stores and in the spice section of some markets.  A mix of dried thyme, basil, savory, and fennel seeds can be substituted.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large ovenproof pot over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle ribs with salt and pepper.  Working in batches, add ribs to pot and brown well, turning often, about 8 minutes per batch.  Using tongs, transfer ribs to large bowl.

Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings from pot or add oil as necessary to measure 2 tablespoons.  Add onion, chopped carrot, and celery and cook over medium-low heat until vegetables are soft, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic, flour, and herbes de Provence; stir 1 minute.  Add wine and 2 cups broth; bring to boil over high heat, scraping up browned bits.  Add tomatoes with juices and bay leaf.  Return ribs and any accumulated juices to pot.  If necessary, add enough water to pot to barely cover ribs.  Bring to boil.

Cover pot tightly and transfer to oven.  Bake until ribs are very tender, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours 15 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly, then refrigerate uncovered until cold.  Cover and keep refrigerated.  Bring to simmer before continuing.)

Add remaining 1/2 cup broth, peeled baby carrots, and NiÁois olives to pot; press carrots gently to submerge.  Cover, return to oven and continue cooking at 350 degrees until carrots are tender, about 15 minutes.

Discard bay leaf.  Transfer short ribs and carrots to platter.  Tent with foil to keep warm.  If necessary, boil sauce to thicken slightly.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour sauce over short ribs.  Sprinkle with parsley.  Serve with CrËme FraÓche Mashed Potatoes

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This sensational dish is best when made with meaty short ribs that are three to four inches long.  Serve with a simple green salad and glasses of good Zinfandel.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large ovenproof pot over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle ribs with salt and pepper.  Working in batches, add ribs to pot and brown well, turning often, about 8 minutes per batch.  Using tongs, transfer ribs to large bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings from pot or add oil as necessary to measure 2 tablespoons.  Add onion, chopped carrot, and celery and cook over medium-low heat until vegetables are soft, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic, flour, and herbes de Provence; stir 1 minute.  Add wine and 2 cups broth; bring to boil over high heat, scraping up browned bits.  Add tomatoes with juices and bay leaf.  Return ribs and any accumulated juices to pot.  If necessary, add enough water to pot to barely cover ribs.  Bring to boil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cover pot tightly and transfer to oven.  Bake until ribs are very tender, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours 15 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly, then refrigerate uncovered until cold.  Cover and keep refrigerated.  Bring to simmer before continuing.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add remaining 1/2 cup broth, peeled baby carrots, and NiÁois olives to pot; press carrots gently to submerge.  Cover, return to oven and continue cooking at 350 degrees until carrots are tender, about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Discard bay leaf.  Transfer short ribs and carrots to platter.  Tent with foil to keep warm.  If necessary, boil sauce to thicken slightly.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour sauce over short ribs.  Sprinkle with parsley.  Serve with CrËme FraÓche Mashed Potatoes
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This sensational dish is best when made with meaty short ribs that are three to four inches long.  Serve with a simple green salad and glasses of good Zinfandel.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cups  chopped green onions
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  sweet paprika
  12            ounces  uncooked medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        and coarsely chopped
  1              ounce  bean thread noodles -- soaked in hot water
                        for 20 minutes, drained, minced
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  9                     sheets frozen phyllo pastry, 17" by 13" -- thawed
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- melted
  6          teaspoons  plain dried breadcrumbs
  6                     fresh chives
                        Tomato Chermoula Sauce -- (see recipe)

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add green onions, garlic, cumin, and paprika and sautÈ until onions begin to soften, about 3 minutes.  Add shrimp and sautÈ until cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in minced bean threads, cilantro, parsley, and lemon juice.  Season filling with salt and pepper.  Set aside.

Lightly butter large baking sheet.  Stack phyllo sheets on work surface.  Cut sheets in half crosswise to form eighteen 13- by 8 1/2-inch rectangles.  Stack all rectangles.  Using 8-inch-diameter plate as guide, trace circle atop phyllo stack.  Cut all phyllo sheets, forming eighteen 8-inch-diameter rounds.  Cover rounds with damp paper towel to prevent drying.

Place 1 phyllo round on work surface; brush with melted butter.  Top with second phyllo round; brush with melted butter.  Top with third phyllo round; brush with melted butter.  Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon breadcrumbs.  Place 1/6 of filling in center of phyllo.  Enclose filling by gathering phyllo and carefully twisting top to form purse.

Transfer phyllo purse to prepared baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining phyllo rounds, melted butter, breadcrumbs, and filling, forming 6 phyllo purses total.  Brush phyllo purses with butter.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake phyllo purses until golden and heated through, about 12 minutes.  Carefully tie 1 chive around twisted section of each phyllo purse, forming knot.  Transfer 1 phyllo purse to each of 6 plates.  Spoon some Tomato Chermoula Sauce around each phyllo purse and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Chinese bean thread noodles (also called cellophane noodles) are often used in Moroccan dishes, like this starter.  Their use stems from the influence of a small Vietnamese community in North Africa.  Bean thread noodles are sold at Asian markets and in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets.

Comments:  "My grandmother was a reporter in New York before she got married and moved to Montana to start a new life on a ranch," writes Joyce Litz of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  "At the time she didnít know how to cook, and learning wasnít easy -- the place didnít even have running water.  Still, she appreciated good food, so she persevered and became a great cook.  Later my grandmother taught me ranch-style cooking, a lot of which involved getting simple but flavorful, hearty meals ready in a hurry."

Comments:  &quot;My grandmother was a reporter in New York before she got married and moved to Montana to start a new life on a ranch,&quot; writes Joyce Litz of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  &quot;At the time she didnít know how to cook, and learning wasnít easy -- the place didnít even have running water.  Still, she appreciated good food, so she persevered and became a great cook.  Later my grandmother taught me ranch-style cooking, a lot of which involved getting simple but flavorful, hearty meals ready in a hurry.&quot;

                   Skillet Poached Eggs With Prosciutto

Recipe By     :Chef Mark Peel, Campanile, Los Angeles, CA
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  finely-chopped green onion tops
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  minced fresh Italian parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse salt
  4             slices  country-style sourdough bread, 1/2"-thk
                        = (each about 4" by 6")
  3             ounces  arugula leaves - (abt 4 cups)
  8                     thin slices prosciutto - (abt 4 oz)
  8              large  eggs
                        Fresh Italian parsley sprigs -- for garnish

Finely chop the green onion tops by first cutting them lengthwise into long, thin strips.  Combine chopped green onion tops, extra-virgin olive oil, minced Italian parsley, and salt in small bowl; whisk to blend.  (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Lightly toast 4 sourdough bread slices.  Spread each with 1 tablespoon green onion oil.  Arrange 1/4 of arugula on each bread slice.  Top each with 2 slices prosciutto.  Transfer 1 prepared bread slice to each of 4 plates.

Divide remaining green onion oil equally among four 1 1/4-cup custard cups or ramekins.  Using pastry brush, spread green onion oil over inside of each cup to coat (most of mixture will fall back to bottom of cup).  This will keep the eggs from sticking, making them easier to unmold later.  Break open 2 eggs into each prepared cup.

Place cups in large skillet.  Pour enough water into skillet to reach halfway up sides of cups.  Set skillet over medium-high heat and bring water to simmer.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover skillet and gently cook eggs until whites are just firm to touch and yolks are set to desired consistency, about 6 minutes.

Using spatula and oven mitt or hand towel as aids, lift cups with eggs from water.  Cut around eggs to loosen.  Turn 2 eggs out onto each prepared bread slice.  Garnish with Italian parsley sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The green onion oil that is brushed on the custard cups becomes a topping once the eggs are turned out.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  fresh tangerine juice
                        = (or orange juice)
     1/4           cup  walnut oil

  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  raspberry vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5                     tangerines or 3 oranges
  3              heads  Belgian endive -- trimmed, and
                        thinly sliced crosswise
  3               cups  bite-size pieces frisÈe lettuce

  1              bunch  watercress -- thick stems trimmed
  4             ounces  smoked duck breast -- cut thin strips
                        = (or smoked turkey breast)
     1/2                red onion -- thinly sliced

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PECAN BRITTLE ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
     1/8      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     3/4           cup  pecan halves -- toasted, and
                        coarsely chopped
                        === CAKE ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  1                     box yellow cake mix - (18.25 oz)
  4              large  eggs
  1                cup  sour cream
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  2             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- coarsely grated
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
                        === FROSTING ===
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  3        tablespoons  water
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  6               cups  powdered sugar -- more or less
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature

For Pecan Brittle:  Spray baking sheet with nonstick spray.

Combine sugar, 1/4 cup water, and cream of tartar in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush, about 9 minutes.  Add chopped pecans and swirl to blend.

Pour out onto prepared baking sheet; spread evenly.  Cool brittle completely.  Cut 3 large pieces of brittle (each about 1 1/2 inches).  Cut remaining brittle into 1/3-inch pieces.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides with nonstick spray.  Line bottom of pans with waxed paper.

Combine cake mix, eggs, sour cream, oil, vanilla extract, and almond extract in large bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat mixture until well blended, about 3 minutes; fold in grated bittersweet chocolate.  Divide batter equally between prepared pans.

Bake cakes until brown on top and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Cut around cakes to loosen; turn out onto racks.  Peel off paper and cool cakes completely.

For Frosting:  Combine 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3 tablespoons water in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; boil until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.  Remove from heat; cool 5 minutes.  Mix in cream.

Beat 3 cups powdered sugar and butter in large bowl until well blended.  Beat in brown sugar mixture.  Beat in enough remaining powdered sugar to form frosting that is thick enough to spread.

Place 1 cake layer, flat-side up, on platter.  Spread with 1 cup frosting.  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup small brittle pieces; press into frosting.  Top with second cake layer, flat-side down.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake.  Stand large brittle pieces in center of cake.  Arrange smaller brittle pieces in 1-inch-wide border around top edge of cake.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome and refrigerate.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.)

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Make a cake the easy way: Spruce up a mix with sour cream, chocolate, brown sugar frosting and a crunchy pecan brittle.

For Pecan Brittle:  Spray baking sheet with nonstick spray.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine sugar, 1/4 cup water, and cream of tartar in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush, about 9 minutes.  Add chopped pecans and swirl to blend.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour out onto prepared baking sheet; spread evenly.  Cool brittle completely.  Cut 3 large pieces of brittle (each about 1 1/2 inches).  Cut remaining brittle into 1/3-inch pieces.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides with nonstick spray.  Line bottom of pans with waxed paper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine cake mix, eggs, sour cream, oil, vanilla extract, and almond extract in large bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat mixture until well blended, about 3 minutes; fold in grated bittersweet chocolate.  Divide batter equally between prepared pans.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake cakes until brown on top and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Cut around cakes to loosen; turn out onto racks.  Peel off paper and cool cakes completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Frosting:  Combine 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3 tablespoons water in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; boil until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.  Remove from heat; cool 5 minutes.  Mix in cream.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat 3 cups powdered sugar and butter in large bowl until well blended.  Beat in brown sugar mixture.  Beat in enough remaining powdered sugar to form frosting that is thick enough to spread.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 1 cake layer, flat-side up, on platter.  Spread with 1 cup frosting.  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup small brittle pieces; press into frosting.  Top with second cake layer, flat-side down.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake.  Stand large brittle pieces in center of cake.  Arrange smaller brittle pieces in 1-inch-wide border around top edge of cake.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome and refrigerate.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Make a cake the easy way: Spruce up a mix with sour cream, chocolate, brown sugar frosting and a crunchy pecan brittle.

Comments:  "I have a 'stragglers Thanksgiving' -- that's what I call it -- at my house every year," writes Frances Teasley of North Hollywood, California.  "I know a lot of people who, like me, don't have any family nearby.  Thirteen years ago I started inviting a few people for dinner.  And that small holiday gathering has become a big tradition among my friends.  For weekday meals, I look for shortcuts and do-aheads.  But for holiday meals, I like to do everything the same day because I love the smell of cooking that fills the house."

     1/4           cup  chilled butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut into pieces
                        === SWEET-POTATO PUREE ===
  4             pounds  red-skinned sweet potatoes (yams)
     1/3           cup  fresh orange juice
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick) -- room temperature
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated orange peel
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For Streusel:  Place all ingredients in processor in order listed.  Using on/off turns, blend until small moist clumps form.  Transfer to bowl.  Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

For Sweet-Potato Puree:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Pierce potatoes in several places with fork.  Place directly on oven rack and bake until very tender, about 1 hour.  Transfer to rack and cool.

Peel potatoes; place flesh in large bowl and mash.  Mix in orange juice, sugar, butter, and orange peel.  Season with salt and pepper.  Butter 13- by 9-inch oval gratin dish.  Spread puree in dish; smooth top.  (Puree can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Scatter streusel over potatoes.  Bake until puree is hot and streusel is crisp, about 40 minutes.  Cool 5 minutes, then serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The crunchy crumb topping contrasts nicely with the orange-scented sweet-potato puree.  Sweet paprika adds a touch of heat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2             pounds  tan-skinned sweet potatoes - (abt 3 med)
  3               cups  cake flour
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  4              large  eggs
     2/3           cup  chopped walnuts -- plus
     1/4           cup  chopped walnuts -- toasted
     2/3           cup  dried cranberries -- plus
     1/4           cup  dried cranberries
                        === FROSTING ===
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  7 3/4           cups  powdered sugar -- sifted
  2        tablespoons  frozen orange juice concentrate -- thawed
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  sliced candied orange peel
  3        tablespoons  sugar

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Pierce potatoes with fork; place on small baking sheet.  Roast potatoes until soft, about 1 hour.  Cool, peel, and mash potatoes.  Measure 2 cups mashed potatoes; cool to lukewarm (reserve any remaining potatoes for another use).  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Butter and flour two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides; line pans with parchment.

Sift flour and next 6 ingredients into medium bowl.  Combine oil, 1 cup sugar, and brown sugar in large bowl; whisk until smooth.  Whisk in eggs 1 at a time, then mashed sweet potatoes.  Whisk in flour mixture in 3 additions.  Stir in 2/3 cup walnuts and 2/3 cup cranberries.

Divide batter between prepared pans.  Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool cakes completely in pans on racks.

For Frosting:  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in powdered sugar, scraping down bowl often.  Beat in orange juice concentrate and vanilla.

Cut around pan sides; turn out cakes.  Peel off parchment.  Place 1 cake layer, flat-side up, on platter.  Spread 3/4 cup frosting over.  Top with second cake layer, flat-side down.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake.

Combine orange peel, 3 tablespoons sugar, remaining 1/4 cup walnuts, and 1/4 cup cranberries in small bowl.  Stir to coat with sugar.  Transfer to sieve; sift off excess sugar.  Sprinkle fruit and nut mixture decoratively atop cake.  Chill until frosting sets, at least 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome; keep chilled.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.)

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Sweet potatoes make this moist; cranberries and walnuts add texture and color.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  tan-skinned sweet potatoes - (abt 3 med)
     3/4           cup  chopped green onions
  2              large  eggs
  1 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- or more if needed
  1                cup  sour cream
  1              ounce  black caviar
                        Fresh chives -- cut into 1" pieces

Cook sweet potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm, about 15 minutes.  Drain and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead; keep refrigerated.)

Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Peel potatoes and coarsely grate into large bowl.  Stir in green onions.  Whisk eggs, flour, salt, and pepper in small bowl.  Gently mix into potato mixture.  Form mixture into 48 walnut-size balls; transfer to prepared baking sheet.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Place 8 potato balls in skillet, pressing each gently with spatula to flatten to 1 1/2-inch diameter.  Cook until pancakes are rich golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer to paper towels to drain.

Repeat with remaining potato balls, adding more oil to skillet if necessary.  Transfer pancakes to platter.  Top each with 1 teaspoon sour cream and scant 1/4 teaspoon caviar.  Garnish with chives.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 48 pancakes.

Comments:  You can form the sweet-potato pancakes up to six hours ahead, leaving only a quick frying before serving.

                Thanksgiving                    Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  2        tablespoons  dry white vermouth -- plus
     2/3           cup  dry white vermouth
  1 1/2    tablespoons  dried tarragon
  4                     garlic cloves -- mashed, chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     turkey - (12 to 14 lbs) -- neck, gizzard,
                        and heart reserved
  2               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch

Mix 5 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons vermouth, 1 tablespoon tarragon, and garlic in medium saucepan.  Bring to simmer over medium-low heat, stirring until butter melts.  Simmer for 1 minute.  Season mixture with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.  Before using, stir over low heat until butter melts.)

Set rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry.  Place turkey on rack in large roasting pan.  Place reserved turkey parts in roasting pan.  Sprinkle turkey inside and out with salt and pepper.  Tuck wing tips under turkey; tie legs together.  Cover turkey breast tightly with foil.  Roast 2 hours, lifting foil and brushing entire turkey with some of butter mixture every 30 minutes.

Remove foil.  Brush turkey with any remaining butter mixture.  Reduce heat to 325 degrees.  Continue roasting turkey until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, about 30 minutes longer.  Transfer turkey to platter.  Tent loosely with foil; let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature of turkey will increase by 5 to 10 degrees).  Reserve pan juices for gravy.

Remove turkey parts from roasting pan and discard.  Pour pan juices into large measuring cup.  Spoon off fat.  Return pan juices to roasting pan.  Add 1 3/4 cups broth, remaining 1/2 tablespoon tarragon, and 3 tablespoons butter.  Position roasting pan directly over 2 burners set at medium-high heat.  Bring mixture to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Boil 5 minutes.

Transfer mixture to heavy medium saucepan.  Add remaining 2/3 cup vermouth.  Whisk remaining 1/4 cup broth and cornstarch in small bowl until smooth.  Add to gravy mixture.  Bring to boil, whisking constantly.  Boil until gravy coats back of spoon thinly, about 8 minutes.  Season gravy with salt and pepper.  Serve turkey with gravy.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Such flavor from only a few ingredients -- the tarragon and vermouth play off each other beautifully.  Red or white wine will work with this meal; depending on your preference, serve a dry SÈmillon or a fruity Pinot Noir.

Mix 5 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons vermouth, 1 tablespoon tarragon, and garlic in medium saucepan.  Bring to simmer over medium-low heat, stirring until butter melts.  Simmer for 1 minute.  Season mixture with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.  Before using, stir over low heat until butter melts.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Set rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry.  Place turkey on rack in large roasting pan.  Place reserved turkey parts in roasting pan.  Sprinkle turkey inside and out with salt and pepper.  Tuck wing tips under turkey; tie legs together.  Cover turkey breast tightly with foil.  Roast 2 hours, lifting foil and brushing entire turkey with some of butter mixture every 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove foil.  Brush turkey with any remaining butter mixture.  Reduce heat to 325 degrees.  Continue roasting turkey until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, about 30 minutes longer.  Transfer turkey to platter.  Tent loosely with foil; let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature of turkey will increase by 5 to 10 degrees).  Reserve pan juices for gravy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove turkey parts from roasting pan and discard.  Pour pan juices into large measuring cup.  Spoon off fat.  Return pan juices to roasting pan.  Add 1 3/4 cups broth, remaining 1/2 tablespoon tarragon, and 3 tablespoons butter.  Position roasting pan directly over 2 burners set at medium-high heat.  Bring mixture to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Boil 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer mixture to heavy medium saucepan.  Add remaining 2/3 cup vermouth.  Whisk remaining 1/4 cup broth and cornstarch in small bowl until smooth.  Add to gravy mixture.  Bring to boil, whisking constantly.  Boil until gravy coats back of spoon thinly, about 8 minutes.  Season gravy with salt and pepper.  Serve turkey with gravy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Such flavor from only a few ingredients -- the tarragon and vermouth play off each other beautifully.  Red or white wine will work with this meal; depending on your preference, serve a dry SÈmillon or a fruity Pinot Noir.

Comments:  "I spend as much time as I can cooking," writes Brigette Lyons of Allendale, New Jersey, "and I'm equally comfortable feeding two or two hundred.  I thoroughly enjoy giving sit-down meals, including an annual Christmas luncheon I do for about twenty guests.  I just like to cook, period.  Cooking for two hundred may be different from making weeknight dinners for myself and my husband, John, but organization is the key to both.  I try to keep things on hand that are simple and easy to prepare."

Brigette prepares this dish for her annual Christmas luncheon.  It's ideal for entertaining because it can be assembled ahead and baked just before serving.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vegetable oil
  8                     russet potatoes - (6 oz ea) -- scrubbed
  5 1/2         ounces  soft fresh goat cheese -- crumbled
                        = (such as Montrachet)
     3/4           cup  half-and-half
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives

Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 375 degrees.  Rub oil over potatoes.  Pierce in several spots with fork.  Place directly on oven rack; bake until very tender, about 45 minutes.  Transfer to rack; cool 10 minutes.

Using oven mitts, grasp 1 potato in hand.  Using serrated knife, cut off top 1/4 of potato.  Using spoon, scoop out potato, leaving 1/2-inch-thick shell; transfer potato flesh to large bowl.  Repeat with remaining potatoes.  Mash potatoes until smooth.  Mix in cheese, then half-and-half, butter, and chives.  Season with salt and pepper.

Spoon about 3/4 of potato mixture into shells, dividing evenly.  Transfer remaining potato filling to pastry bag fitted with large star tip.  Pipe filling atop potatoes.  Place potatoes on baking sheet.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate.)

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Bake potatoes until filling is heated through and tops brown, about 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Piping the filling into the potato shells with a pastry bag makes an attractive presentation.  You can also just spoon in the filling and crosshatch the top with the tines of a fork.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  white-skinned potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" pieces
  1 1/2         pounds  red-skinned sweet potatoes (yams) -- peeled, and

Start this recipe a day ahead so that there's time for the beans to soak overnight.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             medium  leeks, white and pale green parts only -- sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  10              cups  canned low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
  2             pounds  celery root (celeriac) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  1 1/2         pounds  turnips -- peeled, each

  1              pound  parsnips -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" pieces
     1/2           cup  whipping cream

Mix 6 tablespoons butter and thyme in small bowl to blend well.  Season thyme butter to taste with salt and pepper.

Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add leeks and garlic and sautÈ until leeks are tender but not brown, about 10 minutes.  Add 10 cups broth, celery root, turnips, and parsnips; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium, cover and simmer until vegetables are very tender, about 50 minutes.  Cool slightly.

Working in batches, puree soup in blender until smooth.  Return soup to pot.  Stir in cream.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Thyme butter and soup can be made 1 day ahead.  Wrap butter in plastic wrap.  Cool soup slightly.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled.  Rewarm soup over medium heat, adding more broth, if desired, to thin.)

Ladle soup into 12 bowls.  Top each with small piece of thyme butter; swirl into soup and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Pair this with a crisp French Chablis, the Chardonnay-based white from Burgundy.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  dry red wine
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  1                     strip lemon peel, 3" by 3/4" -- (yellow part only)
  1                     whole clove
  2             medium  firm but ripe pears -- peeled, stems
                        left attached, halved lengthwise, cored
  1         tablespoon  crËme de cassis -- (optional)
                        = (black-currant-flavored liqueur)
  8             ounces  triple-crËme cheese -- cut into 4 wedges
                        = (such as Explorateur, Saint AndrÈ,
                        boursault or Brillat-Savarin)

Combine wine, sugar, orange juice, lemon peel, and clove in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to simmer over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Add pear halves to saucepan.  Cut out round of parchment paper same size as saucepan.  Place parchment round atop pears, pushing edges of parchment into liquid to prevent edges from curling up.  Reduce heat and barely simmer until pears are tender when pierced with knife, about 12 minutes.

Using slotted spoon, transfer pears to bowl.  Boil liquid in saucepan until slightly syrupy and reduced to 3/4 cup, about 14 minutes.  Cool syrup to room temperature; stir in crËme de cassis, if desired.  Pour syrup over pears.  Cover and chill at least 12 hours, turning pears occasionally.

Thinly slice pear halves lengthwise almost to stem end, leaving stems attached.  Spoon generous 1 tablespoon pear syrup onto each of 4 plates.  Top each with 1 pear half, pressing gently to fan.  Serve with cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Hereís a fresh take on the classic combination of fruit and cheese.  Placing parchment on top of the pears as they are poaching helps keep them moist and submerged in the poaching liquid.
