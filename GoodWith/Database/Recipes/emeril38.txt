Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- plus
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2           cups  light brown sugar - (packed)
  2              large  eggs
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  sour cream
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2               cups  chopped peeled cored apples
                        === CRUMBLE TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
                        === BROWN SUGAR GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  water

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a 13- by 9-inch glass baking dish with 2 teaspoons of the butter.

In a large bowl, cream together the remaining stick of butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating after the addition of each.  In a separate bowl or on a piece of parchment, sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.  Add to the wet ingredients, alternating with the sour cream and vanilla.  Fold in the apples.  Pour into the prepared baking dish, spreading out to the edges.

To make the topping, in a bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cinnamon, and butter, and mix until it resembles coarse crumbs.  Sprinkle the topping over the cake and bake until golden brown and set, 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack for at least 10 minutes.

To make the glaze, in a bowl, combine the sugar, vanilla, and water and mix until smooth.  Drizzle the cake with the glaze and let harden slightly.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  sweet potatoes
                        Hand Pie Dough -- (listed below)
  1              large  egg yolk
     1/4           cup  cane syrup
  2        tablespoons  Bourbon whiskey
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  1              pinch  salt
  3        tablespoons  melted butter
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting
                        Vanilla ice cream -- as accompaniment
                        === HAND PIE DOUGH ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  solid vegetable shortening -- plus
  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
     1/4           cup  butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  ice water - (to 4)
                        === ORANGE GINGER SAUCE ===
  1                cup  orange marmalade
  2        tablespoons  ginger conserve
     1/4           cup  rum
  2        tablespoons  julienne crystallized ginger

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Place the potatoes on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake until tender, 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Remove the potatoes from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.

Lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured surface.  Roll out into a rectangle, about 24 by 8-inches and 1/8-inch thick.  Using a round 4-inch cutter or a plate as a template and a small, sharp knife, cut 12 (4-inch) rounds.

Peel the potatoes and place the flesh in a large bowl.  Add the egg yolk, cane syrup, bourbon, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.  Mix until well blended and creamy.  Divide the filling among the centers of the pastry rounds, about 1/4 cup on each.  Bring 1/2 of the pastry round over the other, and press down lightly with your fingertips to enclose the filling and expel any air.  Using the tines of a fork, crimp the edges of the pastry to seal completely.  Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  With a pastry brush, lightly brush the tops of each pie with melted butter.

Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is warmed through, 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and dust lightly with the confectioners' sugar.  Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and drizzle with Orange Ginger sauce.

For the Hand Pie Dough:  Into a mixing bowl, sift the flour, salt, and sugar.  Add the shortening and butter and work it in with your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and work it in with your hands to form a smooth dough.  Form into a disk.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.  Use as directed above.  (Makes dough for 12 (4-inch) pies)

For the Orange Ginger Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in a saucepan.  Heat over low heat and cook until the mixture comes to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and serve warm.

This recipe yields 1 dozen.

        Blue Cheese Polenta Cakes With Arugula, Caramelized Onions

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped onions
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3                     turns freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  milk
     3/4           cup  instant polenta
     1/2           cup  crumbled blue cheese
                        Instant flour -- for dredging polenta
                        Caramelized onions -- (listed below)
  1              bunch  arugula -- stems removed,
                        well rinsed and spun dry
     1/2           cup  chopped toasted walnuts
                        === CARAMELIZED ONIONS ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              pound  yellow onions -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Grease a 9-inch square baking pan with 1 teaspoon of the oil.  Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large pot over high heat.  When the oil is hot, add the onions, garlic, and basil and saute for 30 seconds.  Add the salt and pepper and saute for another 30 seconds.  Stir in the milk and bring to a boil.  Whisk in the polenta slowly, a little at a time, until the mixture has the consistency of a thick roux.  When the mixture is thick, add the blue cheese and stir until it is melted and incorporated.  Remove from the heat, and working quickly, spoon the mixture into the greased pan, spreading it and packing it down before it sets.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Remove the polenta from the pan and cut evenly into 1 1/2-inch squares.  Dredge the polenta squares in the flour.  Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over high heat.  When the oil is hot, add the polenta squares and fry until golden brown, about 45 seconds to 1 minute on each side.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Arrange arugula leaves on each square and top with the caramelized onions and nuts.

Serve immediately.

For the Caramelized Onions:  In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and reduce the heat to medium-low.  Cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and caramelized, about 45 minutes.  Add the thyme, salt, and pepper, and stir well to combine.  Cook for 1 minute.

This recipe yields 36 small squares.

Comments:  If preferred, instead cut the polenta into larger squares for appetizer portions or as a main course accompaniment.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2                     chickens - (3 1/2 lbs es) -- cut 8 pieces each,
                        skin removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  onion -- sliced
  15                    garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1                can  Italian plum tomatoes - (28 oz) -- with their liquid,
                        lightly crushed
  1                cup  rich chicken stock
  8             ounces  green olives, preferably Cerignola
                        = (or substitute Spanish)
                        === POLENTA ===
  6               cups  water
  2               cups  polenta
  3        tablespoons  fresh chopped thyme
  4             ounces  goat cheese log
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large, heavy Dutch oven or deep skillet, heat the oil over high heat until very hot but not smoking.  Season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper and brown on both sides in the olive oil, about 4 to 5 minutes per side.  Remove the chicken to a bowl or platter and set aside.

Add the onion, garlic, bell pepper, and crushed red pepper to the drippings in the skillet and saute until the vegetables are tender and beginning to caramelize around the edges, about 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add the wine and cook until the liquid is almost evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes.  Dust the vegetables in the skillet with the flour, mix well and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and chicken stock and cook until the mixture is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.  Return the chicken pieces to the Dutch oven and add the olives.

When mixture returns to a boil, cover the Dutch oven and reduce the heat so that the mixture just simmers.  Cook 30 to 45 minutes, or until the chicken is very tender.  While the chicken is cooking, make the polenta.

Polenta:  Heat the water to boiling in a large saucepan.  Add the polenta in a stream, while whisking.  Cook, stirring constantly until the polenta is thick and smooth, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Stir in thyme, cheese, and butter and season with salt and pepper.

Gently transfer the chicken to an ovenproof bowl or platter and cover to keep warm.  If the sauce seems thin, increase the heat and reduce the sauce to the appropriate thickness.  Taste, adjust seasoning if necessary, and serve the sauce ladled over the chicken.

Spoon the polenta onto a platter and top with the chicken and sauce.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Green olives from Cerignola, typically labeled Cerignola Olives, are beautiful green olives with a subtle, fresh olive flavor, about twice the size of most olives.  They were the inspiration for this dish, but good results can be achieved by using the more commonly available Spanish.

Add the yellow onions to the fat in the pan and cook, stirring, until very soft, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the apples and cook, stirring, until starting to soften, about 2 minutes.  Add the bay leaf, peppercorns, and juniper berries and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the sauerkraut and reserved beer cooking liquid (without the onions), sugar, salt and pepper, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered until tender and aromatic, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours.

Preheat the grill.  Grill the sausages until cooked through, about 5 minutes, turning to cook evenly on all sides.  Remove and place on a platter.

Remove the sauerkraut from the heat and discard the bay leaf.  Stir in the cooked bacon and adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Arrange the sauerkraut on the platter with the sausages and serve, if desired, with rolls and mustard.  Serve with cold beer.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  firm-ripe peaches -- cut in half and
                        stones removed
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2          teaspoons  Bourbon whiskey
  1           teaspoon  powdered sugar
     1/2           cup  lightly-toasted coarsely-chopped pecans

Preheat the broiler.  Line a broiler pan with aluminum foil.  Arrange the peaches, cut-sides up and sprinkle with the brown sugar.  Broil until golden brown and the sugar is bubbly and starting to caramelize watching carefully to prevent burning and turning the pan as necessary, 3 to 5 minutes.

Transfer the peaches to plates and top with a dollop of cream.  Sprinkle with the nuts and serve.

                        Hot red pepper sauce
                        Worcestershire Sauce
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
  1              quart  vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Essence -- to taste
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        === ISLAND HOT SAUCE ===
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     carrots -- chopped
  3                     Scotch bonnet peppers -- halved, and
                        seeds and stems removed
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
                        Water -- to cover
  2        tablespoons  sherry vinegar -- add more or
                        less, to taste
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

In a saute pan, add canola oil and heat.  Add the conch, onion, and garlic and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.

Make the batter by combining the eggs, milk, baking powder, and salt.  Add the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, beating and incorporating until all is used and the batter is smooth.  Season with hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce.  Stir in the parsley and the cooled conch mixture.

Heat the oil to 360 degrees.  Drop the batter, a heaping tablespoon at a time, into the oil.  When the fritters pop to the surface, roll them around in the oil to brown them evenly.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season immediately with Essence.  Serve with Island Hot Sauce.

For the Island Hot Sauce:  Sweat the onion, carrots and peppers in vegetable oil until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.  Cover with water and add vinegar.  Simmer until the carrots are very tender.  Puree in a blender and season, to taste, with vinegar, and salt.  Thin, as necessary, with more water.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     untreated cedar shingles
                        = (abt 5 1/2" by 10" each)
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  4                     salmon fillets - (8 oz ea)
  2          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        === GARLIC SPINACH ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- very thinly sliced
  2             pounds  fresh spinach -- stems removed,
                        well rinsed, water clinging to leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === WASHINGTON STATE MERLOT REDUCTION ===
  1             bottle  Washington State Merlot wine - (750 ml)
                        = (or other dry red wine)
  1              small  onion -- quartered
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
  2                     carrots -- peeled, chopped
  1                     bay leaf
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare a grill and light the fire.  Rub 1 side of each shingle with 1/2 teaspoon of oil.

Season the fish on both sides with Essence.  Place a fillet on each oiled shingle.  Place the shingles in the center of a hot barbecue grill.  Close the lid and cook for about 10 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily with a fork.  Remove the shingles from the grill using a long-handled spatula.  If the shingles catch fire, sprinkle with a little water.

Put the shingles in the center of large plates.  Spoon the garlic spinach on the side, and drizzle the fish with the wine reduction sauce.

For the Garlic Spinach:  In a large saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, and cook, stirring, until fragrant and starting to color, about 45 seconds. Add the spinach and any water clinging to the leaves and cook, stirring until wilted, about 3 minutes, adding more water 1 tablespoon at a time as needed to keep wet and make wilt. Once wilted, cook until any water is gone. Add the salt and pepper and stir to incorporate. Remove from the heat and add the lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil. Adjust seasoning, to taste, and serve hot or warm.

For the Washington State Merlot Wine Reduction sauce:  In a medium saucepan, combine the wine, onions, celery, carrots and bay leaf.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the liquid reduces by half, about 30 to 40 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain.  Return to the pan, over medium heat.  Whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time, until the butter is incorporated, being careful not to let the sauce break.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Cover to keep warm until ready to serve, whisking occasionally.  (Makes about 2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

       Cheese And Beer Soup With Garlic Croutons, Kielbasa Sausage

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             pieces  kielbasa sausage
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  chopped yellow onions
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     bay leaves
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
  6        tablespoons  flour
  6               cups  chicken stock
  2               cups  lager beer
  4             sprigs  thyme
  2               cups  cubed Gruyere cheese -- plus
                        Finely grated Gruyere cheese -- for garnish
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh flat-leaf parsley -- for garnish
  8                     hot dog buns
                        === GARLIC CROUTONS ===
  8        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2               cups  diced (1/2") day-old French bread -- (crusts removed)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Saute the kielbasa until golden brown on all sides in a large, hot soup pot, about 4 minutes per side.  The sausage will not be cooked through, It will finish cooking in the soup.  Remove from the pan and set aside.

In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, salt, pepper and bay leaves, and cook, stirring, until the onions are slightly caramelized, 12 to 15 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Sprinkle the flour over the onions and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes.  Gradually whisk in the stock and beer.  Add the thyme and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.

During the last 15 minutes of cooking, add the kielbasa and cook until sausages are cooked through.  Remove the cooked sausages from the soup.  Add the cheese 1/3 cup at a time, stirring until nearly all melted and smooth after each addition.  Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Ladle into 1 or more thermoses.

Place sausages in each thermos.  The hot soup will keep the sausage warm until you are ready to eat it.  Pack a roll for the sausage as well.  When it's time to eat the soup, remove the kielbasa and place it on the roll - soup and a sandwich on the go!  Garnish with parsley, garlic croutons, and finely grated cheese.

For the Garlic Croutons:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a medium ovenproof skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the chopped garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the bread cubes and salt and toss to combine.  Transfer to the oven and bake, stirring occasionally, until the croutons are golden and crisp, about 10 minutes.

Remove from the oven and serve with the Cheese and Beer Soup.  (Makes 2 cups)

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Chicago-Style Deep Dish Pizza Dough -- (listed below)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh garlic
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh basil
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  fennel seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1                can  plum tomatoes - (28 oz) -- coarsely crushed
  1         tablespoon  dry red wine
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  mozzarella cheese -- sliced
  8             ounces  pepperoni -- thinly sliced
  8             ounces  mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and thinly sliced
  1                     green bell pepper -- cored, and
                        cut into thin rings
  1                     yellow onion -- cut thin rings
  1                cup  thinly-sliced black olives
  1              pound  crumbled hot Italian sausage
  1                cup  grated Parmesan
                        == CHICAGO-STYLE DEEP DISH PIZZA DOUGH ==
  1 1/2           cups  warm water -- (about 110 degrees)
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  semolina flour
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil -- to grease bowl
  1           teaspoon  salt

While the dough is rising, make the tomato sauce.  In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the herbs, seeds, salt, and black and red peppers, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the tomatoes, wine and sugar, and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 20 to 30 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool completely before using.

Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.

Oil 2 seasoned 12-inch round deep-dish pizza pans with the extra-virgin olive oil.  Press 1 piece of dough into each pan, pressing to the edge and stretching about 1 1/2 inches up the sides.  Let rest for 5 minutes.

Layer the mozzarella cheese all over the bottom of the pies.  Top each with half of the pepperoni, mushrooms, bell pepper rings, onions, black olives and sausage.  Ladle the sauce evenly over each pizza and top with Parmesan.

Bake until the top is golden and the cheese is bubbly and the crust is golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven, slice and serve hot.

For the Chicago-Style Deep Dish Pizza Dough:  In a large bowl, combine the water, yeast, and sugar and stir to combine.  Let sit until the mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.

Add 1 1/2 cups of the flour, the semolina, 1/2 cup of the oil, and the salt, mixing by hand until it is all incorporated and the mixture is smooth.  Continue adding the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, working the dough after each addition, until all the flour is incorporated but the dough is still slightly sticky.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth but still slightly tacky, 3 to 5 minutes.  Oil a large mixing bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons oil.

Place the dough in the bowl and turn to oil all sides.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set in a warm, draft-free place until nearly doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Divide into 2 equal portions and use as directed.

This recipe yields 2 (12-inch) deep dish pizzas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- cut into pieces

Place the butter in a heavy saucepan and melt slowly over low heat.  Remove the pan from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes.

Skim the foam from the top, and slowly pour into a container, discarding the milky solids in the bottom of pan.

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 cups.

Comments:  What makes clarified butter so great is its higher smoke point.  This means you can cook meats and fish at a higher temperature than you can with regular butter, making it ideal for pan-frying.  By clarifying the butter during a slow cooking process, you're able to strain out the milk solids that burn quickly as well as the water and salt.  You'll lose about 1/4 of your original butter amount during the process, and the clarified butter will keep, tightly covered in the refrigerator for about 1 month.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened, plus
  2        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter
  4              large  eggs
  3               cups  unsweetened coconut milk
  1                cup  Coco Lopez
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  dark rum
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  fresh grated ginger
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh ground nutmeg
  6               cups  cubed (1/2") day-old bread
  1 1/2           cups  small-diced mango
                        === FRIED COCONUT STRIPS ===
                        Canola or vegetable oil -- for frying
  1                cup  coconut ribbons -- see instructions
  1         tablespoon  powdered sugar
                        === TO OPEN AND PEEL THE COCONUT ===
  1                     ripe coconut -- see directions
                        ===CARAMEL RUM SAUCE ===
  3               cups  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  dark rum
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
  1                cup  coarsely-grated fresh coconut -- for cleaning
                        coconut and grating, or making into
                        ribbons, see directions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter a 10- by 14-inch baking dish with the softened butter.  Whisk the eggs in a large bowl.  Add the coconut milk, Coco Lopez, brown sugar, rum, 2 tablespoons melted butter, vanilla, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and whisk well to combine.  Add the bread and mango, and stir well.  Pour into the prepared dish.  Bake until firm when pressed in the center, about 1 hour.  Cool on a wire rack until just warm, about 20 minutes.  Serve warm, sprinkled with the fried coconut strips and drizzled with the caramel rum sauce.

For the Caramel Rum Sauce:  In a medium non-stick saucepan, combine 2 3/4 cups of the cream with the rum and sugar.  Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Remove from the heat.  In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the remaining 1/4 cup cream.  Add to the warm rum mixture and return to medium heat.  Simmer, stirring, until the mixture thickens, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and serve warm with the bread pudding.  (Makes about 3 cups)

For the Fried Coconut Strips:  Fill a 6-quart pot halfway with oil and heat to 360 degrees.

In 2 batches, add the coconut to the oil and cook, turning with a slotted spoon, until golden brown, about 1 minute.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Sprinkle with the powdered sugar while still warm, and sprinkle over the bread pudding.  (Makes 1 cup)

To Open And Peel The Coconut:  Place the coconut flat on a work surface covered with a kitchen towel.  Using a hammer or large meat mallet, drive a large nail or metal skewer into 1 of the eyes.  Drain the liquid into a container and reserve for another use.

Place carefully whack the center of the coconut with a meat mallet or the blunt back of a large, heavy cleaver several times until it cracks open cleanly into 2 halves.

Wrap the coconut in the towel and whack it several times with a hammer to break into pieces.  Using a short, heavy knife, carefully pry the meat away from the shell.  (If necessary, loosen the meat from the shell by heating the coconut for 15 to 20 minutes in a 400 degree oven.)

Trim any remaining brown skin from the meat with a small, sharp knife.

To grate the coconut, use the large side of a heavy grater.  To make coconut ribbons, use a vegetable peeler.  Wrap in plastic wrap until ready to use.  (Makes 2 cups)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  buttermilk
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter
  1                cup  chopped Smithfield ham
                        = (or other cured ham)
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  6                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  grated white cheddar cheese
                        Chopped parsley
                        Chopped chives
                        Unsalted butter -- as accompaniment
                        Cane syrup -- as accompaniment

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, Essence, and salt.  In a medium bowl, beat the buttermilk, egg, and melted butter.  Add to the dry ingredients and mix just until blended, being careful not to overmix.  Fold in the ham.

Preheat a large, heavy skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.  Lightly grease with enough vegetable oil to leave a film on the bottom, about 1 tablespoon.  Working in batches, ladle the batter into the pan 1/4 cup at a time, being careful not to overcrowd.  Cook until the pancakes are golden brown underneath and bubbles form on the surface, about 2 minutes.  Turn and cook until golden brown on the second side, 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer to a platter and place in the oven to keep warm.  Add more oil to the pan as needed and repeat with the remaining batter.

In a nonstick saute pan, add vegetable oil to coat the bottom.  Carefully crack each egg into a small bowl and then pour into the skillet and cook to desired doneness.

Place the pancakes on a plate.  Top with fried eggs, cheese, parsley, and chives.  Or, serve the pancakes warm with butter and cane syrup, as desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CORN RELISH ===
  4          teaspoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  corn kernels
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/4           cup  chopped red onions
     1/2           cup  chopped seeded tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  4          teaspoons  minced fresh cilantro
  1                     firm-ripe avocado -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into small dice
                        === SCALLOPS ===
  24                    sea scallops - (abt 1 lb) -- tough side mussels
                        removed and patted dry
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  water
  6          teaspoons  Essence -- more for dusting
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1                cup  masa harina
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
                        Chopped fresh herbs -- for garnish

For the Corn Relish:  In a medium skillet, heat 1 teaspoon of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the corn and cook, stirring until starting to caramelize, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, 1/8 teaspoon of the pepper, the cumin, and coriander, and cook, stirring, until fragrant and the corn is caramelized, about 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

In a bowl, combine the corn and the remaining ingredients.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, and let rest for 1 hour before serving.

For the Scallops:  Lightly season both sides of the scallops with salt and pepper.  In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the water and 2 teaspoons of the Essence.  In another bowl, combine the masa harina, flour and the remaining 4 teaspoons of Essence.  One at a time, dip the scallops in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off, then dredge in the masa mixture to coat evenly.

In a medium saucepan, heat enough oil to come 2 inches up the side of the pan over medium-high heat to 365 degrees.  Add the scallops in batches and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to paper towels to drain and lightly season with Essence.  Divide the corn relish among 4 plates and arrange 6 scallops on top.  Garnish with the chopped herbs and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     country ham slices, 1/4" thick
  1                     shallot -- chopped
     1/4           cup  Grand Marnier
  2        tablespoons  mustard
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped chives -- to taste
                        === TRADITIONAL SOUTHERN BISCUITS ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cold
     1/2           cup  solid vegetable shortening -- cold
  1                cup  milk

Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the ham slices and sear on both sides until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.  Remove the ham from the skillet and set aside.

To the pan drippings, add the shallots and cook until softened.  Deglaze with Grand Marnier and cook until almost dry.  Add the mustard and stir until well combined.  Add the chicken stock and cook until slightly reduced.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and finish with chopped chives.

Split the biscuits.  Place a piece of ham on the bottom half of the biscuits.  Drizzle with sauce and top with the remaining biscuit half.

For the Traditional Southern Biscuits:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt.  Mix well.  Add 1 tablespoon of the cold butter and the cold shortening and work it into the dry ingredients, using your hands, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Stir in the milk.  The dough will be sticky.

Dust your work surface with some flour.  Turn the dough onto the floured surface.  Gently fold each side toward the center.  Pick up the dough and dust the work surface with additional flour.  Return the dough to the floured surface and fold each side towards the center again.  Turn the dough over and press it out to 1-inch thickness.  Cut the biscuits, straight down, do not twist the cutter, with a 2 1/4-inch round cookie cutter.

Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter and add to a 10-inch round cake pan.  Place the biscuits in the pan, turning once (to coat both sides with butter), about 1/4-inch apart.  Let the biscuits rest for 15 minutes before baking.  Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     lobsters - (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 lbs ea)
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- plus
  1              stick  melted unsalted butter -- for stuffing
     1/4           cup  chopped shallots
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped celery
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped red bell peppers
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped yellow bell peppers
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2               cups  butter cracker crumbs
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley
  2          teaspoons  minced tarragon
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Watercress -- for garnish
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Fill a large stockpot 3/4 full with salted water and bring to a boil.  Plunge the lobsters headfirst into the boiling water and cook, covered, until firm and almost cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes.  Drain and transfer with tongs to a large bowl filled with ice water.  Drain well.  When the lobsters are cool enough to handle, place flat on their backs.  With heavy scissors, cut each lobster down the middle from head to tail, being careful not to cut through the hard shell.  Press the lobster open so it will lie flat.

Lift out the pink coral (roe), if any, and green tomalley (liver).  Discard stomach sac or "lady" from back of head, black vein running from head to tail, and spongy gray tissue.  Remove the meat from the tail and leave the claws intact.  Coarsely chop the meat and set aside.  Place the shells on a large baking sheet.

In a skillet, melt the 1 tablespoon of butter over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots, celery, and bell peppers and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the chopped lobster meat and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

In a large bowl, combine the chopped lobster meat, reserved tomalley and roe (if desired), sauteed vegetables, cracker crumbs, parsley, tarragon, lemon juice, Essence, and salt.  Stir, and add enough melted butter to make a paste-like consistency.  Fill the cavity of each lobster with the mixture and place on a baking sheet.

Bake until the mixture is heated through, about 15 minutes.  Increase the heat to broil and broil until golden brown and the cracker crumbs crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Line 4 plates with watercress.  Place 1 lobster on each plate and garnish with lemon wedges.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     duck breasts
  1         tablespoon  Hawaiian salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8             ounces  fresh or dried Chinese egg noodles
  3        tablespoons  chopped green onions
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  julienned bok choy
     1/2           cup  julienned carrots
     1/2           cup  brewed Hawaiian coffee
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  oyster sauce
     1/2           cup  chopped macadamia nuts
     1/2           cup  mung bean sprouts

Season the duck breasts with Hawaiian salt and pepper.  Score the fat of the skin in a criss-cross pattern.  Heat a large saute pan over high heat.  Add the seasoned duck breast, skin-side down, and cook until the fat is golden brown and a lot of the fat is rendered.  Turn over and cook until the meat is medium-rare.  Remove the duck from the pan.  Reserve 3 tablespoons of the duck fat.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the noodles and cook until just al dente.  Drain and rinse under cold running water.  Drain well.

Heat a wok over high heat.  When hot, add 2 tablespoons of the duck fat and swirl to coat the sides and bottom of the wok.  Add the green onions, ginger and garlic and stir-fry until aromatic, 30 seconds.  Add the bok choy and carrots and stir-fry until tender, 1 to 2 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with the coffee and add the soy sauce and oyster sauce.  Add the noodles and macadamia nuts and toss well.  Place the noodles in a large platter or bowl.  Slice the duck breasts on the bias into thin slices.  Fan the duck over the noodles.  Garnish with mung bean sprouts.

Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried navy, green flageolet or
                        lima beans -- picked over, rinsed
     1/4           cup  confectioners' sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2 1/2         pounds  boneless leg of lamb -- cut 1 1/2" pieces
                        = (shoulder may also be used)
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped onions
  1                cup  red wine
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled, smashed
  2                     bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped thyme
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  Cayenne pepper
  2              large  baking potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/8" pieces
     2/3           cup  tomato puree
                        = (or 1 cup diced peeled seeded tomato)

In a medium saucepan combine the beans and 2 quarts of water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes.  Cover, remove from the heat and let stand for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Drain and discard the soaking liquid.  Return the beans to the pan and add enough water to cover by 2 inches.  Return to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes, or until beans are al dente.  Strain and reserve bean cooking liquid.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and position the oven rack in the lower 1/3 of the oven.

In a resealable plastic bag, combine the confectioners' sugar, salt and black pepper, to taste.  Add the lamb cubes and shake to coat.  In a large, ovenproof Dutch oven over high heat, heat the vegetable oil until hot.  Add the butter and, working in batches, brown the lamb cubes and onions until well browned on all sides, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Be careful not to burn the sugar.  (If the sugar begins to burn on the bottom of the pan before you're finished, add a bit of water and scrape the pan bottom to remove the browned bits, adding more oil and butter as necessary for subsequent batches.)

When the lamb and onions are all browned, add the red wine, reserved beans, garlic, bay leaves, parsley, thyme, paprika, cayenne pepper, baking potatoes and tomato puree and enough of the reserved bean cooking liquid just to cover.  Cover and bake for 1 1/2 hours, or until the lamb and beans are tender.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

            Emeril's Winter Salad With Homemade Herbed Cheese

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HOMEMADE HERBED CHEESE ===
  1              quart  whole milk
  1                cup  buttermilk
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped sage
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === SALAD AND VINAIGRETTE ===
  2             medium  beets -- scrubbed, trimmed
  3        tablespoons  whole-grain mustard
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     3/4           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped shallots
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh sage
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  julienned Belgian endive
  1                cup  julienned fennel
  1                     pear -- cored, and
                        thinly sliced
     3/4           cup  coarsely-chopped lightly-toasted walnuts

For the Cheese:  In a medium pot, combine the milk, buttermilk and lemon juice in a medium pot and bring to 112 degrees over low heat.  Cook without simmering until the liquid separates into solid curds and whey, 45 to 50 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer the solids to a fine mesh strainer or colander lined with cheesecloth. Bring up the 4 corners of the cheesecloth and tie them together.  Gently twist to extract as much liquid as possible.  Place over a bowl and let drain in the refrigerator until thick and the liquid has drained away, about 30 minutes.  Twist again to extract as much water as possible.  Remove the cheese from the cheesecloth, wrap, and place in a bowl.  Add the sage and season with salt and white pepper, mixing to combine.

For the Salad:  Place the beets in a saucepan and cover with water by 1-inch.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain and shock the beets in ice water.  Remove the skins and stem ends.  Julienne and reserve for the salad.

For the Vinaigrette:  In a bowl, whisk together the mustard and lemon juice.  Slowly add the oil, whisking until emulsified.  Whisk in the shallots, rosemary, and sage, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

In a large bowl, toss the beets, endive, fennel, pear and walnuts with the vinaigrette to lightly coat.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

Divide the salads among 4 plates and top each serving with 1/4 cup of the ricotta, sprinkling it on and around the salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the Cheese:  In a medium pot, combine the milk, buttermilk and lemon juice in a medium pot and bring to 112 degrees over low heat.  Cook without simmering until the liquid separates into solid curds and whey, 45 to 50 minutes.  Remove from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a slotted spoon, transfer the solids to a fine mesh strainer or colander lined with cheesecloth. Bring up the 4 corners of the cheesecloth and tie them together.  Gently twist to extract as much liquid as possible.  Place over a bowl and let drain in the refrigerator until thick and the liquid has drained away, about 30 minutes.  Twist again to extract as much water as possible.  Remove the cheese from the cheesecloth, wrap, and place in a bowl.  Add the sage and season with salt and white pepper, mixing to combine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Salad:  Place the beets in a saucepan and cover with water by 1-inch.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain and shock the beets in ice water.  Remove the skins and stem ends.  Julienne and reserve for the salad.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Vinaigrette:  In a bowl, whisk together the mustard and lemon juice.  Slowly add the oil, whisking until emulsified.  Whisk in the shallots, rosemary, and sage, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, toss the beets, endive, fennel, pear and walnuts with the vinaigrette to lightly coat.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the salads among 4 plates and top each serving with 1/4 cup of the ricotta, sprinkling it on and around the salad.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Biscotti Crust -- (listed below)
  1              pound  cream cheese -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
  3               cups  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  finely-ground toasted hazelnuts
  2        tablespoons  Frangelico
                        = (or other nut-flavored liqueur)
  2        tablespoons  unsweetened espresso concentrate
                        === BISCOTTI CRUST ===
  6                     hazelnut biscotti cookies
  2          teaspoons  finely-ground toasted hazelnuts
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/3           cup  dried fine bread crumbs
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === CLEAR ORANGE CARAMEL SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     3/4           cup  fresh orange juice

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Spray 8 (10-ounce) disposable paper coffee cups with vegetable cooking spray.  Divide the biscotti crust (about 3 1/2 tablespoons for each) among the prepared cups.  Press down to make a thick bottom crust.  Place on a baking sheet and bake until set, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool before filling with the cheesecake batter.

Lower the oven temperature to 225 degrees.

In a large bowl fitted with an electric mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese on high speed until smooth.  Combine 3/4 cup of the sugar and cornstarch in a bowl.  Add to the cream cheese and beat until smooth.

Beat the eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla together in a small mixing bowl.  Add to the cream cheese mixture in 4 additions, scraping down the sides of the bowl between each addition.  Add 1 cup of the sour cream and beat to blend.  Pour half of the batter into another bowl.  To 1 bowl add the hazelnut paste and liqueur, and beat to blend.  To the remaining half, add the espresso and beat to blend.

To make the sour cream topping, whisk the remaining 2 cups of sour cream and 1/4 cup of sugar together in a medium bowl.  Set aside.

Pour 1/4 cup of the hazelnut mixture into each prepared cup, and top with 1/4 cup of the espresso mixture.  Bake until set, about 50 minutes.  Remove from the oven and top each cheesecake with 1/4 cup of the sour cream topping.  Return to the oven and bake for 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool for 30 minutes on a wire rack.  Refrigerate until completely cooled, at least 4 hours or overnight.

To serve, run a small sharp knife under hot running water.  Carefully run the knife around the inside edges of each cup to loosen the cheesecakes.  With kitchen shears, cut away the cups and place the cheesecakes, crust-side up, on dessert plates.  Spoon the orange-caramel sauce around each cheesecake and serve.

For the Biscotti Crust:  Process the biscotti in a food processor on high speed to make fine crumbs.

In a medium bowl, combine the cookie crumbs, hazelnuts, sugar, and bread crumbs.  Add the butter and blend with a fork.  Set aside until ready to fill the cups.

For the Clear Orange-Caramel Sauce:  In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, water, orange zest, and lemon juice.  Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves.  Once the sugar dissolves, stop stirring, and continue to cook until the mixture thickens and turns golden, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the orange juice (the mixture will bubble slightly).  Return to medium-high heat and stirring constantly, cook for 1 minute.

Remove from the heat and cool slightly.  Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean bowl and cool to room temperature before serving.  (Makes 1 3/4 cups)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      First Course

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  5          teaspoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  fine dry bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  3              large  egg yolks
  4             ounces  goat cheese
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh tarragon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4              large  egg whites
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
     1/2           cup  dried cherries
     1/2           cup  lightly-toasted pine nuts
                        === WILTED SPINACH ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  balsamic vinegar
  18            ounces  baby spinach -- tough stems
                        removed, well rinsed and spun dry
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly butter 6 (3/4 cup/6-ounce) ramekins with 4 teaspoons of the butter.  Combine the breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese and use to dust the bottoms and sides of each ramekin.  Set inside a roasting pan large enough to hold the cups without touching.  Lightly grease a baking sheet with 1 teaspoon of the butter and set aside.

In a medium saucepan, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.  Add the shallots and cook until soft and fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it thickens slightly and forms a light roux, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the milk, and bring to a boil.  Simmer, whisking, until thick, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Add the egg yolks 1 at a time, whisking after each addition.  Add the cheese, tarragon, salt, and pepper, and stir to incorporate.

In a large bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar until stiff peaks just form.  Stir 1/4 of the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture.  Gently fold the remaining egg whites into the yolks in 3 additions.  Divide among the prepared custard cups and fill the roasting pan with warm water to come half way up the sides of the ramekins.  Bake without opening the oven door until slightly puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack.  Let rest uncovered for 30 minutes.  Run a thin, sharp knife around the edges of the ramekins to release the souffles.  (Note: souffles can be covered at this point in plastic wrap and refrigerated overnight.)

Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees.  Bake the souffles until puffed and heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.  Remove from the oven.

Add the dried cherries and pine nuts to the spinach and stir to combine.  Divide the wilted spinach mixture among 6 salad plates.  Arrange 1 souffle on each plate and serve.

For the Wilted Spinach:  Heat butter in a wide 6-quart heavy pot over moderate heat until foam subsides, add garlic and balsamic vinegar and cook for 30 seconds.  Then cook spinach, stirring, until just wilted but still and bright green, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper.  Cover to keep warm until ready to serve.

                Fresh Baked Ham With Whisky And Cola Glaze

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ham                             Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             pounds  fresh ham (shank and leg of pork)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
                        Whole cloves -- as needed
  1                cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  whisky
  4               cups  cola drink
                        Wild Pecan Rice, Bacon, And Tasso Dressing -- (see recipe)

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

With a sharp knife, puncture and score the skin of the ham, making parallel 1/2-inch-deep incisions.  Turn the ham and score again to make a grid-like pattern.

In a small bowl combine the salt, Essence, pepper, and cayenne.  Rub evenly all over the ham.  Place the ham, fatty-side up, in a large roasting pan.  Place 1 clove where the lines intersect on the ham.  Rub the sugar evenly over the ham, pressing to pack.  Pour 2 cups of cola into the bottom of the roasting pan and bake for 1 hour.  In a container, combine the whisky and the remaining 2 cups of cola.

Baste the ham with the whiskey and cola and continue to bake, basting every 15 minutes with the whisky and coke mixture and pan juices, until the ham is cooked through, the skin is crisp and dark, and a meat thermometer registers 165 degrees, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.

Remove from the oven and let rest at least 20 minutes before carving.  To serve, slice the meat thinly across the grain and arrange on a platter.  Serve with Wild Pecan Rice, Bacon, and Tasso Dressing.

This recipe yields about 12 servings.

  1              whole  mackerel - (2 to 3 lbs) -- cleaned with head
                        and tail on, rinsed and patted dry
  4 1/2      teaspoons  Pimenta Moida
                        = (Portuguese red pepper paste)
  4 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1              large  yellow onion -- chopped
  1                cup  minced fresh parsley leaves
     1/2           cup  minced green onions
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  1                cup  turbinado sugar
                        = (or "Sugar in the Raw")
  3              large  eggs
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  ground ginger
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1                cup  molasses
  1                cup  Guinness
                        = (or other dark beer)
                        Spiced Creme Anglaise -- (listed below)
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting
                        === SPICED CREME ANGLAIS ===
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  orange zest
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  ground ginger
  3              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 13- by 9-inch cake pan and line with parchment paper.  Grease the parchment paper and set aside.

In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar.  Beat in the eggs 1 at a time.  In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, cloves, and nutmeg.  In a third bowl, combine the molasses and beer and stir to dissolve.  Add the dry ingredients and beer mixture alternately to the egg mixture, beating after the addition of each.

Pour into the prepared pan and bake until puffed and set, about 35 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan on a wire rack.  Spoon the Creme Anglaise onto the middle of 12 dessert plates.  Cut the gingerbread into 12 equal portions and place on plates.  Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and serve.

For the Spiced Creme Anglaise:  Combine the cream, the zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat.  Remove from the heat.

In a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar until pale and frothy, about 2 minutes.  Slowly drizzle in 1/2 cup of the hot cream, whisking constantly.  Return the mixture to warm milk and stirring constantly, cook over medium heat until thick, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and serve warm.  Or, to serve chilled, place in an ice bath to cool, then cover with plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to prevent a skin from forming.  Refrigerate until well chilled, about 2 hours.  (Makes 2 cups)

This recipe yields 12 servings.

In a bowl, combine the onions, oil, orange and lime juices, cilantro, garlic, salt, cumin, and cayenne.  Place the fish in a large, non-reactive baking dish.  Pour the marinade over the fish, cover and refrigerate for up to 1 hour.

Preheat a grill, and lightly oil the grill rack with vegetable oil.  Remove the fish from the marinade.  Place on the oiled grill and cook, skin-side up, until marked, 45 seconds to 1 minute.

Fluff with a fork and add the cilantro.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.  Serve hot.

For the Tropical Salsa:  Combine the mango, avocado, pineapple, onions, bell peppers, cilantro, lime juice, jalapeÒo, garlic, and salt in a bowl and gently fold to combine.  Adjust seasoning to taste.  Let sit for 30 minutes before serving for the flavors to blend.

Place the veal chops on 4 large plates and top each with a tablespoon of the herb cheese.  Arrange the asparagus next to the chops and spoon the bordelaise around the chops.  Serve immediately.

For the Wild Mushroom-Tomato Bordelaise:  Heat the oil in a Dutch oven, or large, heavy pot over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, carrots, and celery, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the mushrooms, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they give off their liquid, about 4 minutes.  Add the salt and pepper, and stir to mix well.  Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the wine, and cook, stirring to loosen any bits on the bottom of the pan.  Cook until the wine is reduced by half.  Add the veal stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced by half, about 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Cover and keep warm until ready to serve with the veal chops.  (Makes 2 1/3 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  Serrano ham -- thinly sliced
  8                     pork cutlets -- pounded thin into
                        rectangles
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
  3        tablespoons  minced parsley
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  water
  1                cup  fine dried bread crumbs
                        Olive oil -- for frying
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        Finely-grated Manchego cheese -- for garnish
                        === WHISKEY BUTTER SAUCE ===
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped shallots
  1                cup  whiskey
  1                cup  cold butter -- cut into pieces

Lay the ham on top of the pounded cutlets.  In a small bowl, combine the garlic and parsley.  In a shallow bowl, combine the eggs and water, beating to make an egg wash.  In another shallow bowl, combine the bread crumbs and Essence.  In a large saute pan, heat enough oil to come 1/2-inch up the sides of the pan.

Sprinkle the cutlets with the garlic-parsley mixture and roll each one up tightly.  Secure with a toothpick.  One at a time, dip the cutlets in the egg wash, then in the crumbs to coat.  Add in batches to the hot oil and cook, turning, until golden brown on all sides.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Lightly season with Essence and sprinkle with cheese.  Serve immediately with Whiskey Butter Sauce.

For the Whiskey Butter Sauce:  In a sauce pan, add garlic, shallots, and whiskey.  Carefully place over the flame and cook until reduced by 3/4.  Allow the flames to die down.  Remove the pan from the heat, and start whisking in the butter, piece by piece.  Return the pan to the heat every so often to heat the mixture slightly.  Continue until all of the butter is added and the mixture is emulsified.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

                        for garnish
  6             ounces  mesclun lettuce -- rinsed, spun dry
  1                     papaya -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely diced
                        Asian Vinaigrette -- (listed below)
     1/2           cup  julienned red bell pepper
     1/2           cup  julienned Maui onions
                        Chopped green onions -- garnish
                        === ASIAN VINAIGRETTE ===
  2        tablespoons  minced green onions
  1         tablespoon  rice wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  macadamia oil

To make the pesto, in a blender or food processor, combine the cilantro, mint, nuts, ginger, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and cayenne.  Process on high speed.  Scrape down the sides.

With the machine running, slowly add 1/4 cup of the canola oil in a steady stream to form a thick paste.  (If too tight, add slightly more oil, 2 teaspoons at a time with the machine running.)  Scrape down the sides and process again.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.  Place the fish in a large baking dish and smear both sides with the pesto.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.

In a large skillet, heat the sesame oil over medium-high heat.  Add the won ton strips and fry until crisp.  Remove and drain on paper towels.

Heat the remaining 1/4 cup canola oil in a large non-stick skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking.  (Or, if using 2 skillets, use 2 tablespoons per pan.)  Remove the fish from the refrigerator and pat the pesto sauce firmly onto both sides, adding more if necessary.  Add the fish fillets to the pan in batches to prevent overcrowding and cook until crusted on both sides and the fish is just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

In a large bowl, toss the greens with the papaya and Asian Vinaigrette to coat.  Place papaya and greens on each of 4 plates Arrange the bell peppers and onions in the center of each serving and drizzle with a small amount of the dressing.  Remove fillets from the pan and place 1 on each plate on top of the greens.  Garnish each portion with the fried won ton wrappers, chopped nuts, and green onions, and serve.

For the Asian Vinaigrette:  In a small bowl, combine the scallions, rice wine vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, sugar, pepper, and salt, and whisk to combine.  Slowly add the oil in a steady stream, whisking.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ANDOUILLE AND FAVA BEAN RELISH ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  8             ounces  chopped andouille sausage
     1/4           cup  chopped onions
  1                cup  fresh or frozen (and thawed) fava beans -- blanched in salted
                        water for 1 minute and peeled
     1/4           cup  chopped peeled seeded Italian plum
                        tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === TOMATO-FENNEL VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  fennel seed
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped peeled seeded plum tomatoes
     1/4           cup  white wine
  1           teaspoon  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  sherry wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  chopped oregano
  1           teaspoon  chopped chives
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === HERB-CRUSTED CATFISH ===
  4                     catfish fillets - (5 oz ea)
  2          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1                cup  chopped assorted soft fresh herbs
                        = (such as basil, mint, parsley, chervil,
                        cilantro, oregano, chives)
  2          teaspoons  olive oil

For the Andouille and Fava Bean Relish:  In a large skillet, heat the oil over high heat.  Add the andouille and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 2 minutes.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the fava beans, tomatoes, garlic, and cilantro, and saute, stirring and shaking the skillet occasionally, until the favas are tender, 2 to 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat and keep warm.

For the Tomato Fennel Vinaigrette:  In a medium skillet, heat the oil over high heat to smoking.  Add the garlic and the fennel seed and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 5 seconds.  Immediately add the tomatoes and wine, reduce the heat and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the tomato paste and stir until starting to brown.  Add the vinegar, herbs, salt and pepper and cook for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Season the fillets on both sides with the Essence.  Rub top side of each fillet with Dijon mustard, then pack the mustard-coated side with a generous amount of herbs.  Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.  Place the fish herb-side down in the pan and sear for 5 minutes.  Gently turn with a large, thin spatula and place the skillet in the oven.  Bake until the fish is cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Remove the catfish from the oven.

Spoon the andouille and fava bean relish into the middle of 4 large plates and arrange 1 catfish fillet on top.  Spoon the warm tomato fennel vinaigrette onto the fish and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  clarified butter
  1                     russet potato - (abt 8 oz) -- peeled
                        Assorted soft fresh herbs
                        = (as tarragon, parsley, chervil, dill)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === HERBED GOAT CHEESE ===
  1                     log goat cheese -- (4-ounce)
  2        tablespoons  sour cream
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
     1/4           cup  assorted soft fresh herbs
                        = (as tarragon, parsley, chervil, dill)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and brush with clarified butter.  Using a mandoline or other mechanical slicer, slice the potato as thinly as possible to make potato chips.

Working quickly to prevent discoloration, lay half on the prepared baking sheet.  Top each with an herb leaf or small cluster of herbs.  Lay another chip of the same size directly on top to seal the herb.  Brush with clarified butter and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.  Top with a second sheet of parchment paper and fit a second baking sheet of the same size on top to press.  Bake until the chips are crisp and golden, about 10 minutes.

Remove from the oven, uncover, and peel away the parchment paper.  Remove with a thin spatula and place on a plate.  Pipe a small amount of the herbed goat cheese next to the chips and garnish it with sprigs of fresh herbs.

For the Herbed Goat Cheese:  Place all ingredients in a food processor.  Pulse until mixture is well combined.  Place in a piping bag with a star tip.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

This recipe yields 25 to 30 chips.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  dried fava beans
  1         tablespoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     bay leaves -- torn into quarters
  1 1/2      teaspoons  crushed red pepper flakes
  2               cups  finely-chopped yellow onions
  1                cup  finely-chopped green bell peppers
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2               cans  tomato paste - (6 oz ea)

In a large heavy saucepan bring 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, and add the favas and 2 teaspoons of the salt.  Cover and simmer until the beans are tender, about 1 1/2 hours.  Drain in a colander and rinse under cold running water until cool enough to handle.

To peel the beans, gently pull open the dark end of the skin of each bean with the tip of a small sharp knife or with your fingernail, and peel back the skin.  Discard the skins.  Put the peeled beans in a bowl.

In a heavy large saucepan heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the bay leaves, crushed red pepper flakes, and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and heat for 1 minute, stirring occasionally.  Add the onions and bell peppers and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the parsley and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Stir in the tomato paste and 7 1/2 cups water.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 30 minutes.

Add the fava beans and continue simmering until the beans are tender, about 1 hour.  Serve immediately, or cool, cover, and refrigerate for up to 3 days.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  1         tablespoon  crushed red pepper
  2        tablespoons  ground cumin
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro leaves
     1/4           cup  sliced scallions
  1                     jalapeÒo -- seeded, diced fine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  julienne carrot - (abt 1 large carrot)
  5               cups  thinly sliced red and green cabbage
  1                cup  julienne red pepper - (abt 1 pepper)
  2               cups  diced pineapple - (abt 1 small pineapple)
     3/4           cup  toasted chopped macadamia nuts

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large bowl, combine the hoisin, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger and red pepper flakes.  Add the pork chops and turn to coat.  Remove the chops from the marinade.

Reserve the marinade and combine with the honey in a medium saucepan.  Bring the honey marinade mixture to a boil and cook at a low boil for at least 10 minutes.

For the Slaw:  Whisk together the vinegar, honey, and soy sauce.  Drizzle in the oils in a steady stream, whisking to emulsify.  Whisk in the crushed red pepper, cumin, cilantro, scallion, and jalapeÒo.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

In a large bowl, combine the carrot, cabbage, red pepper, pineapple, and nuts and mix well.  Add the dressing to the vegetables and mix well.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Place some slaw on a plate/platter.  Top with the chops and drizzle with some of the reduced marinade.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               pint  heavy cream -- very cold
  1              pinch  salt -- (optional)

Find a large jar with a tight-fitting lid that will hold the cream about half full.  Refrigerate the jar for at least 1 hour.  Pour the cream into the cold jar.  Tightly secure the lid and shake as hard as possible until chunks of butter start to form, 15 to 30 minutes.  Pour into a strainer set over a bowl.  The chunks in the strainer are butter, and the liquid in the bowl is buttermilk.

Pour the buttermilk into a clean container, cover, refrigerate, and reserve for another use.  Turn the butter into a clean bowl and cover with very cold water.  Pour into a strainer, discarding the liquid.  Continue rinsing the butter with very cold water until the water runs clear.  (The cloudy water is buttermilk which will make the butter turn sour.)  When the butter is clean, work with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to press out any remaining liquid.  Discard this liquid.  If desired, add salt to the butter.  (Salted butter will keep longer.)

Transfer the butter to a clean container for keeping, pressing with a wooden spoon or spatula to dispel any air bubbles.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

This recipe yields about 6 ounces.

Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  medium-size shrimp -- tails on, rinsed,
                        patted dry, and peeled
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  3        tablespoons  hot pepper oil
     1/4           cup  popcorn kernels
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)

Season the shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1 tablespoon of the pepper oil.  Layer the shrimp in a concentric circle in the bottom of a cold 10- to 12-inch saute pan, leaving about a 1-inch space between the shrimp and the rim of the pan.  Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons pepper oil in this space around the inside of the pan.  Sprinkle the popcorn kernels into the oil.  Cut a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil about 14 inches long.  Place the foil over the pan and press it down firmly over the shrimp, oil, and popcorn.  Crimp the foil securely around the edges of the skillet.  Place the pan over medium-high heat.

Cook until it begins to sizzle, about 2 minutes.  Carefully remove the shrimp and place in a large bowl.  Recover the pan and continue to cook for about 2 1/2 minutes more.  The corn should begin popping.  Start shaking the pan at 30-second intervals.  The popcorn will continue to pop for about another 2 minutes.  Turn off the heat.  Let sit for about 30 seconds and allow the corn to completely finish popping.

Very carefully remove the foil because of the steam.  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, and toss it with the remaining teaspoon salt and the Essence.

Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                        removed
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  chiffonade endive
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped red onions
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  chopped chives
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
                        Sea salt -- to taste

Cut the salmon into 4 equal portions.  Cover a cutting board with a large piece of plastic wrap and rub with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil.  Place a piece of salmon in the center and cover with a second piece of plastic.  Using a flat, smooth mallet or the bottom of a skillet, gently pound the salmon into a paper-thin sheet.  Transfer to a plate.  Repeat with the remaining salmon, adding more oil as necessary to prevent from sticking.

In a small bowl, combine the endive and red onions.  In another bowl, combine the extra virgin olive oil, parsley, chives, lemon juice and lemon zest, and whisk to blend.  Season with sea salt and black pepper.  Toss 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette with the endive and red onions.  Lightly season each piece of salmon with pepper and sea salt.

Place about 1/4 cup of the endive and red onion salad in the center of each piece of salmon.  Drizzle the remaining vinaigrette over the salmon, and serve well chilled.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  lamb shoulder -- cubed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     yellow onion -- peeled, chopped
  1                     leek -- well rinsed, chopped
  2                     carrots -- peeled and chopped
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2               cups  New Zealand Cabernet Sauvignon
                        = (or Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot blend)
  1                cup  lamb stock
                        = (or beef stock)
  2                     bay leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
                        === MASHED KUMARA ===
  3                     kumara - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" dice
                        = (substitute with sweet potatoes)
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  1         tablespoon  light brown sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-grated fresh ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Chopped fresh parsley leaves -- for garnish

Season the lamb with salt and pepper.  In a bowl, combine the flour with the Essence.  Dust the lamb with the seasoned flour, shaking to remove any excess.  In a large saute pan or Dutch oven, heat the oil and melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the meat in batches and cook, turning, until browned on all sides.  Remove with a slotted spoon.

To the fat in the pan, add the onions, leeks, and carrots, and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes.  Add the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.  Add the wine and stock.  Bring to a boil, stirring to deglaze the bottom of the pan.  Return the meat to the pot and add the bay leaves and thyme.  Lower the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally and skimming any fat that forms on the surface, until the meat is very tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

To make the Kumara:  In a medium saucepan, combine the kumara and salt and cover with water by 1 inch.  Bring to a boil and cook until fork tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain and return the kumara to the saucepan and over low heat, mash with a potato masher or heavy whisk.  Add the butter, sugar, ginger, and white pepper, and mash into the kumara.

Remove the lamb from the heat and discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Serve over the mashed kumara or sweet potatoes.  Garnish with chopped parsley and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  Asian seasoning
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut thin strips
     1/4           cup  cornstarch -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/3           cup  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dark brown sugar
  2          teaspoons  lemon zest
     1/4           cup  peanut oil
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped green onions
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  julienned green onions -- for garnish
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame seeds -- for garnish

In medium bowl, beat the egg lightly with the Asian seasoning.  Place 1/4 cup cornstarch in a shallow dish.  One at a time, dredge the chicken in the cornstarch and dip into the egg wash, shaking to remove any excess.  Dredge again in the cornstarch to lightly coat.

Place on a baking dish and let stand for 5 minutes.  Just before cooking, shake off any excess cornstarch.

In a bowl, make the sauce by combining the chicken stock, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, and lemon zest.  Set aside.

In a wok, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the chicken strips (making sure not to overcrowd the pan.)  Fry them for about 3 minutes, until crisp, turning once.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels.

In a small bowl, dissolve the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch in the tablespoon of water.  Pour nearly all the oil out of the wok.  Add the green onions, ginger, and garlic and stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Add the lemon sauce, stir to combine, and bring to a boil.

Add the cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring, until thick.  Return the chicken strips to the wok and stir-fry until warmed through and married with the sauce, 1 to 2 minutes.

Remove from the heat and divide among 4 plates.  Garnish with the julienned green onions and toasted sesame seeds and serve.

                        Lemon Rosemary Pound Cake

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  butter -- for the pan, plus
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2          teaspoons  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  sugar
  4              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon extract

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Butter an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2- by 2 1/2-inch loaf pan with 1 teaspoon butter.  Coat pan with 2 teaspoons of the flour, tapping out the excess.

Into a medium bowl or onto a piece of parchment paper, sift the remaining 2 cups flour, the baking powder, and salt.

In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar with an electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl, as needed.  With the machine on low speed, beat in the flour in 3 additions, alternating with 1 egg at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl, as needed.  Fold in the rosemary, zest, and lemon extract.

Spread evenly in the prepared pan.  Bake until the cake is golden brown and a cake tester or toothpick comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Cool on a wire cake rack for 10 minutes.  Turn the cake out onto the rack, turn right side up, and let cool for at least 30 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

              Meat-Stuffed Fried Yucca Root - {Carimanolas}

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  yucca root -- peeled, cubed
  3 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  5              large  eggs
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
  2              large  jalapeÒo peppers -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  chili powder
  8             ounces  ground beef
  4          teaspoons  tomato paste
  2          teaspoons  vinegar
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying
  6          teaspoons  Essence -- more for dusting
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1                cup  fine dry bread crumbs

In a large saucepan combine the yucca and 1 teaspoon of the salt, and enough water to cover.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, but not falling apart.  Drain and transfer to a large bowl.  Using a potato masher, mash with the butter.  Add 2 of the eggs one at a time, stirring well with a large wooden spoon after the addition of each until smooth.  Add 1/4 cup of the flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt, and stir well to incorporate into a somewhat stiff dough.  (If the dough is too soft, add slightly more flour 1 teaspoon at a time.)  Let sit until cool enough to handle.

In a large skillet or saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and peppers, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, cumin, thyme, and chili powder, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add ground beef and cook, stirring, until no longer pink.  Add the tomato paste, vinegar, sugar, remaining 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and the pepper.  Simmer, stirring until thick.  Remove from the heat and adjust seasoning to taste.  Let sit until cool enough to handle.

Roll the yucca mixture into balls, about 1/4 cup each.  Using a finger, press a deep hole into the center of each.  Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the filling into the center of each ball and gently work the yucca dough around it to completely enclose.

Heat the oil to 330 to 340 degrees.

In a bowl, make an egg wash by beating the remaining 3 eggs with 3 tablespoons of water.  In another bowl, combine the remaining cup of flour with 3 teaspoons of the Essence.  In a third bowl, place the bread crumbs and remaining 3 teaspoons of Essence.

One at a time, dip the "caraminolas" into the flour, then the eggs, then the bread crumbs to completely coat, shaking to remove any excess.  Add to the hot oil in batches and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Season lightly with Essence.

Serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 20 carimanolas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2                red onion -- sliced
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     Roma plum tomatoes - (abt 3/4 lb) -- cored, and
                        cut in half lengthwise
  2              large  lavosh flat breads
                        = (or large burrito-sized plain tortillas)
  8             ounces  thinly-sliced roasted medium-rare lamb
  2        tablespoons  julienned fresh basil
                        === ROASTED GARLIC AND EGGPLANT SPREAD ===
  1              large  eggplant -- stem end removed
                        and pierced all over
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1               head  garlic in skin -- top quarter cut away
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 1/4 cup)
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice - (to 2)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley leaves
                        === FETA SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt
     1/4           cup  finely-crumbled feta cheese
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  white wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Toss the onion slices with the oil and lightly season with salt and pepper.  Arrange in a layer on a baking sheet and roast until tender and starting to color, stirring as necessary, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and set aside.

Arrange the tomatoes, cut-sides up, on the baking sheet.  Season the cut sides lightly with salt and pepper.  Roast until they have released most of their liquid and are slightly caramelized around the edges, about 1 hour.  Remove the tomatoes from the oven and let cool slightly.  Cut the tomatoes into thin strips.

Wrap the lavosh breads in aluminum foil and place in the oven to warm and soften.  Remove from the oven.

Spread the roasted garlic and eggplant spread evenly on the lavosh breads, leaving a slight border along the edges.  Arrange the sliced lamb then the tomatoes and onions over the bread and drizzle with the feta sauce.  Sprinkle with the fresh basil.  Roll tightly as though making a cigar, pressing as you go to keep the filling in place.  Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes so it will be firm enough to slice.  Cut each lavosh either in half (like a burrito), or on the bias into 1-inch sections.  Serve additional feta sauce on the side for dipping, as desired.

For the Roasted Garlic and Eggplant Spread:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment or aluminum foil.

Place the eggplant on the baking sheet and rub all over with 1 teaspoon of the oil.  Rub 1 teaspoon of the oil onto the cut top of the garlic, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and place cut-side down on the baking sheet.  Bake until the eggplant is very soft and turns a purplish-brown color, turning occasionally, and the garlic cloves are soft and golden brown, about 45 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.

Squeeze each head of garlic into a bowl and discard the papery skins.  Cut the eggplant in half lengthwise.  Roughly chop the flesh and discard the skin.  In a blender or food processor, combine the eggplant flesh and garlic.  Add 2 tablespoons of the extra-virgin olive oil, 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, and parsley and process on high until smooth, adding more oil as desired for a smoother consistency and more lemon juice for flavor.  Set aside.

For the Feta Sauce:  In a blender, process the yogurt, feta, oil, and vinegar on high speed until smooth.  Season, to taste.  Set aside until ready to use.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

  4             ounces  roughly-chopped ham
  4             ounces  thinly-sliced salami
  8             ounces  fresh bocconcini -- sliced in half or
                        into thirds
                        = (or cubed fresh mozzarella)
  2        tablespoons  chopped pepperoncini
                        Red pepper flakes -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
                        === BASIC PIZZA DOUGH ===
  1                cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  1           envelope  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  3               cups  bleached all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === OLIVE SALAD ===
     1/2           cup  pitted brine-cured black olives -- sliced
                        = (such as Nicoise)
     1/2           cup  large (queen) pimiento-stuffed olives -- sliced
  2              large  garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped celery
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh oregano
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Place a baking stone on the lower rack of the oven and preheat to 475 degrees.  Remove the premade pizza dough from the bowl and briefly knead.  Shape into a 14-inch round.  Lightly dust a baker's peel with the cornmeal.  Transfer the dough to the peel.  (Alternatively, the dough can rest and then be cooked on a lightly oiled baking sheet.)

Spread most of the olive salad over the bottom of the dough.  Top with the provolone, onions, ham, salami, remaining olive salad, bocconcini or mozzarella, and pepperoncini.  Sprinkle, to taste, with the red pepper flakes and extra-virgin olive oil.

Transfer to the baking stone and cook until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing.  Serve hot.

For the Basic Pizza Dough:  In a large bowl, combine the water, yeast, and sugar and stir to combine.  Let sit until the mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.

Add 1 1/2 cups of the flour and the salt, mixing by hand until it is all incorporated and the mixture is smooth.  Continue adding the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, working the dough after each addition, until all the flour is incorporated but the dough is still slightly sticky.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth but still slightly tacky, 3 to 5 minutes.

Oil a large mixing bowl with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil.  Place the dough in the bowl and turn to oil all sides.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set in a warm, draft-free place until nearly doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Use as directed.

For the Olive Salad:  Combine olives, garlic, olive oil, shallots, celery, parsley, oregano, and black pepper, and mix well.

This recipe yields 1 (14-inch) pizza.

     3/4         ounce  bonito flavored soup base (dashi)
  2 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  1                cup  rice wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  3        tablespoons  fresh ginger
  12            ounces  pickled ginger
  1              pinch  salt
  1 1/2           cups  salad oil
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
                        Oil -- for deep-frying
  4                     egg roll wrappers (sometimes called menlo)
  6               cups  spring mix greens
     1/4           cup  chopped macadamia nuts

Score the top of the duck breast before marinating.

Marinade: Combine the soy sauce, garlic, ginger, 5-spice, brown sugar, chili flakes, basil, cilantro, and salt.  Add the duck to the marinade and coat well.

Heat a large saute pan over high heat.  Add the duck breasts and saute until golden brown on both sides and cooked to your desired temperature, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare.

Remove the duck from the pan and keep warm.  Deglaze the pan with coffee.  Add the reserved marinade and reduce to desired consistency.

In a mixing bowl, combine dashi with sugar and rice wine vinegar.  Transfer mixture to a blender and add garlic, fresh ginger, pickled ginger and pinch of salt.  Slowly add salad oil to the blender.  Refrigerate until needed.

Have fryer heated to 360 degrees.  Deep-fry the menlo until golden brown, about 30 seconds.  Remove from the oil to a paper towel lined plate.

On a platter, place deep-fried menlo topped with spring mix.  Slice duck breast and place on top of greens.  Serve with chilled pickled ginger vinaigrette.  Sprinkle with macadamia nuts.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  pecan pieces
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  Essence -- plus

     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2             pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut lengthwise into
                        strips
                        Chopped parsley -- for garnish
                        === HONEY MUSTARD DIPPING SAUCE ===

For the Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce:  In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients and stir well to combine.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.  Honey-Mustard Dipping Sauce will keep, refrigerated in a covered non-reactive container, for 2 weeks.  (Makes approximately 3/4 cup)

        Oven-Fried Potato And Sweet Potato Chips, Creamy Bacon Dip

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1             medium  Idaho potato - (6 to 8 oz)
  1             medium  sweet potato - (6 to 8 oz) -- peeled
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped rosemary
  1           teaspoon  very finely-grated lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  very finely-grated orange zest
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  ground ginger
                        === CREAMY OVEN-COOKED BACON DIP ===
  8             slices  bacon
  6             ounces  cream cheese
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh chives -- plus
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chives
  2        tablespoons  prepared horseradish
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Hot pepper sauce -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Using a pastry brush, lightly grease 2 large baking sheets with 1 teaspoon of oil each and set aside.

Using a mandoline slicer, or heavy, sharp knife, cut the potatoes and sweet potatoes as thinly as possible.  On 1 baking sheet, arrange the cut potatoes in 1 layer.  On the second sheet, arrange the cut sweet potatoes in 1 layer.  With a pastry brush, lightly coat the top side of both potatoes with the olive oil.  Bake until golden and crisp, rotating the pans halfway through the cooking time, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven.

While the potatoes are cooking, in a small bowl, combine the salt, rosemary, lemon zest, and black pepper.

In another bowl, combine the cinnamon, orange zest, sugar, nutmeg, and ginger.

Remove the potatoes from the oven and transfer to paper towels.  While still warm, sprinkle the potatoes with the lemon salt mixture, and the sweet potatoes with the cinnamon mixture.  Serve warm or at room temperature with the Creamy Oven Cooked Bacon Dip.

For the Creamy Oven-Cooked Bacon Dip:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Arrange the bacon in a layer on a broiler rack set over the broiler pan.  Bake until crisp and brown, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and drain on paper towels.  When cool enough to handle, crumble or chop into small pieces.

In a bowl, cream together the remaining ingredients.  Add the crumbled bacon and mix.  Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

Serve with the oven baked potato chips.

This recipe yields about 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Double Savory Pie Crust -- (listed below)
  4                     strips bacon -- chopped
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8                cayenne
  1              quart  oysters -- cut in half or
                        quarters if large, well drained and 3/4
                        cup liqueur reserved
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh parsley
                        === DOUBLE SAVORY PIE CRUST ===
  3 1/4           cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2             sticks  cold unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
     1/4           cup  solid vegetable shortening
  4        tablespoons  ice water - (to 5)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Divide the pie crust dough in half.  Roll out 1/2 on a lightly floured surface to measure 11-inches in diameter.  Transfer to a 9-inch pie pan and fit into the bottom.  Roll out the second crust to the same size and set aside until ready to assemble the pie.

In a large saute pan or cast-iron skillet, cook the bacon over medium high heat until browned and almost crisp, about 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon, reserving 1/4 cup of grease in the pan (add vegetable oil to equal 1/4 cup if more fat is needed).  Add the onions and celery and cook, stirring, until soft, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the green onions, garlic, Essence, salt, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.

Add the flour and cook, stirring, to make a light roux, about 3 minutes.  Gradually add the oyster liqueur, cream, and lemon juice, stirring constantly, and cook until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the oysters and cook, stirring, just until they start to curl, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and fold in the cooked bacon and parsley.  Let cool slightly.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.

Pour into the prepared pie crust and top with the remaining crust, crimping around the edges to seal.  Cut several decorative slits across the top for venting.  Bake until golden brown and the filling is bubbly, about 25 minutes.

Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.

For the Double Savory Pie Crust:  Combine the flour and salt in a bowl.  Using your fingers, work in the butter and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, working it in with your hands to make a smooth dough.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured surface.  For each crust, roll out the dough on the lightly floured surface about 1/8-inch thick.  Proceed as directed in the recipe.  (Makes 2 pie crusts)

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) pie.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  egg whites
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  vinegar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  powdered sugar
  3                     kiwi fruit -- peeled, sliced thin
     1/2          pint  fresh raspberries
                        Powdered sugar -- for decorating

Line a jelly roll pan with buttered parchment paper.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks start to form.  Gradually add the sugar, beating constantly, until stiff peaks start to form.  Fold in the cornstarch, vinegar, and vanilla and beat just until stiff peaks form.  Spread on the prepared pan into a round about 8-inches in diameter.  Bake for 5 minutes.  Turn off the oven and let the pavlova cool and set without opening the door, about 1 hour.

Remove from the oven and invert the meringue onto a work surface.  Peel the parchment from the bottom and place on a large cake plate or platter.

In a bowl, beat the cream until soft peaks start to form.  Add the sugar and beat until stiff peaks start to form.  Spread the whipped cream over the meringue and decoratively arrange the kiwis and raspberries over the top.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  parsnips -- peeled, chopped
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  light brown sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  ground allspice
  4                     ripe Anjou pears -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1" pieces
  2        tablespoons  nut-flavored liqueur
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

In a baking dish, combine the parsnips, 2 tablespoons of the butter, the brown sugar, cinnamon, and allspice and cover tightly with aluminum foil.  Bake until the parsnips are tender, about 45 minutes.  Remove from the oven and uncover.

In a large skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium heat.  Add the pears and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the liqueur and tilt the pan to ignite the contents.  (Alternately, remove from the heat, light with a match, and return to the heat.)  Cook while flaming for 2 minutes.  Transfer to a food processor.

In a skillet, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.  Cook, swirling the pan, until the butter is golden brown and has a nutty aroma.  Add the browned butter, baked parsnips and their cooking liquid to the food processor.  Puree on high speed for 30 seconds.  Add the sour cream, salt, and pepper and process until smooth.  Serve immediately or cover to keep warm until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 5 cups, 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2 1/2         pounds  yellow onions -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated black pepper
  5 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh thyme
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- thawed
                        = (half of one 17 1/4-oz package)
  10                    anchovy fillets packed in oil
     1/4           cup  pitted and halved Nicoise olives
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and lightly grease 1 large baking sheet.

In a large heavy skillet or saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and lower the heat.  Cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until cooked down to a thick puree and very lightly caramelized, 35 to 40 minutes.

Add the garlic, salt, pepper, and thyme, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  On a lightly floured surface roll out the pastry to a 16- by 12-inch rectangle.  Transfer to the greased baking sheet.  Wet the outer 1/4-inch edge with water and fold in to form a border.

Very lightly prick the bottom of the pastry with a fork.  Spread the onion filling evenly over the middle, being careful to leave the border uncovered.  Arrange the anchovy fillets in a criss-cross pattern over the onions and decoratively arrange the olives around the squares.

Bake until the bottom and edges are golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve warm, drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

In a large heavy skillet or saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and lower the heat.  Cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until cooked down to a thick puree and very lightly caramelized, 35 to 40 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the garlic, salt, pepper, and thyme, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  On a lightly floured surface roll out the pastry to a 16- by 12-inch rectangle.  Transfer to the greased baking sheet.  Wet the outer 1/4-inch edge with water and fold in to form a border.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Very lightly prick the bottom of the pastry with a fork.  Spread the onion filling evenly over the middle, being careful to leave the border uncovered.  Arrange the anchovy fillets in a criss-cross pattern over the onions and decoratively arrange the olives around the squares.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake until the bottom and edges are golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve warm, drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4                     center-cut 1 1/2"-thk pork chops
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  julienned yellow onions
  2              large  golden delicious apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
     1/4           cup  Calvados
                        = (or brandy)
  1 1/4           cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  quartered pitted prunes
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
                        === MASHED SWEET POTATOES ===
  4              large  sweet potatoes - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a large deep saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Season the chops on both sides with salt and pepper.  Add to the pan and cook until browned on both sides, about 4 minutes.  Transfer to a plate to rest.

To the fat in the pan, add the onions and cook, stirring, until beginning to color, about 5 minutes.  Add the apples, rosemary, and garlic, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the sugar and stir.  Add the Calvados and bring to a boil, stirring to deglaze the pan.  Add the stock and prunes and bring to a boil.  Return the chops and any accumulated juices to the pan, cover, and reduce the heat to medium-low.  Simmer until the pork and fruit are very tender and the pork reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees, about 30 minutes.

Remove the pork to a plate and cover to keep warm.  Add the cream to the pan and bring to a boil.  Cook, stirring occasionally until thickened, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and adjust seasoning, to taste.  Pour any accumulated juices from the meat into the pan.

To serve, place the sweet potatoes in the middle of 4 plates and top with the chops.  Spoon the sauce over the chops, garnish with parsley, and serve.

For the Mashed Sweet Potatoes:  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Place the potatoes on a roasting pan and roast until tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.  Peel the potatoes and place in a large mixing bowl.  Add the remaining ingredients and mash with a potato masher or heavy fork.  Cover to keep warm until ready to serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  unsalted butter
  1                     pork tenderloin - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1                     sheet prepared puff pastry -- defrosted
  1              large  egg
     1/4           cup  Creole mustard
                        = (or any whole-grain mustard)
                        === MUSHROOM DUXELLE ===
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  3             pounds  white button mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        stemmed and finely chopped
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     3/4           cup  white wine
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease the center with the butter.

Season the pork tenderloin on all sides with the Essence.  Heat the oil in a skillet or Dutch oven, large enough to hold the tenderloin, over medium-high heat.  Add the tenderloin and reduce the heat to medium.  Sear evenly on all sides and cook, turning frequently, until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 110 degrees, 16 to 18 minutes.  Remove from the pan and cool for about 10 minutes.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to a 12- by 18-inch rectangle.  To make an egg wash, beat the egg with 2 teaspoons of water in a small bowl.

Evenly coat the tenderloin on all sides with the mustard.  Pack the cooled Mushroom Duxelle mixture around the pork tenderloin.  Place the coated meat on the outer third of the pastry.  Brush a 1/2-inch border of egg wash on the pastry around the meat.  Gently pull the remaining pastry over the meat to completely enclose, and press gently to seal.  With a small knife cut away the excess pastry to make an even border and crimp the pastry edges with a fork dipped in flour.

Carefully transfer the tenderloin onto the prepared baking sheet.  Brush the pastry evenly with egg wash.  With a small knife make a decorative crosshatch pattern across the top.  Bake for 10 minutes, then turn.  Bake until golden brown and an instant read thermometer reaches 140 degrees, 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

For the Mushroom Duxelle:  In a large skillet or saute pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and garlic, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms, salt, and white pepper and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms begin to caramelize and all the liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes.  Add the wine, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar and Worcestershire and cook, stirring to deglaze the pan and until the liquid has all evaporated, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let rest while assembling the other ingredients.  (Makes 3 cups)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        gallon  vanilla ice cream
  1                cup  ruby port
                        === CARAMEL SAUCE ===
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        === CANDIED CASHEWS ===
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  2               cups  chopped cashews
  1              pinch  salt
                        Whipped cream -- for topping

Place 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream in 4 parfait glasses.  Pour a little port over each scoop.  Drizzle caramel over the port and top with some of the cashews.  Repeat with another layer ice cream, port, caramel, and cashews.  Top with whipped cream and a little more caramel.

For the Caramel Sauce:  In a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is a deep caramel color and has the consistency of a thin syrup, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in the cream, return the saucepan to the high heat, and boil the sauce until it regains the consistency of a thick syrup, about 2 minutes.  (Makes about 3/4 cup)

For the Candied Cashews:  In a medium skillet, combine the butter and brown sugar.  Cook, stirring, over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved.  Add the nuts and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until toasted and evenly coated, about 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Spread the coated nuts on the prepared baking sheet, stirring with a fork to keep from clumping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Basic Pizza Dough for 1 large crust -- (listed below)
  2          teaspoons  cornmeal
  2 1/4           cups  grated mozzarella cheese
  2              heads  Roasted Garlic -- (listed below)
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  ricotta cheese -- drained
  1            package  frozen spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed, squeezed dry
                        === BASIC PIZZA DOUGH ===
  1                cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  1           envelope  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  3               cups  bleached all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === ROASTED GARLIC ===
  2              heads  garlic
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place a baking stone on the lower rack of the oven and preheat to 475 degrees.

Remove the dough from the bowl and briefly knead.  Place on a lightly floured work surface and let rest for 10 minutes.  Shape into a 16-inch round.  Lightly dust a baker's peel with the cornmeal.  Transfer the dough to the peel.  (Alternately, the dough can rest and then be cooked on a lightly oiled baking sheet.)

Working 1 1/2 inches in from the outer edge, sprinkle 1 cup of the cheese in an even border around the crust.  Fold the outer 1-inch of crust over the cheese and press to seal.

Over a small bowl, squeeze each head of garlic gently with your fingers to expel the cloves.  Add the olive oil and stir with a rubber spatula to blend thoroughly.  Spread the mixture over the pizza crust.  Using a small scoop or tablespoon, spoon dollops of ricotta over the crust.  Spread the spinach evenly over the crust and top with the remaining 1 1/4 cups mozzarella cheese.  Transfer to the baking stone and cook until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing.  Serve hot.

For the Basic Pizza Dough:  In a large bowl, combine the water, yeast, and sugar and stir to combine.  Let sit until the mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.

Add 1 1/2 cups of the flour and the salt, mixing by hand until it is all incorporated and the mixture is smooth.  Continue adding the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, working the dough after each addition, until all the flour is incorporated but the dough is still slightly sticky.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth but still slightly tacky, 3 to 5 minutes.

Oil a large mixing bowl with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil.  Place the dough in the bowl and turn to oil all sides.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set in a warm, draft-free place until nearly doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Use as directed.

For the Roasted Garlic:  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Line a small baking dish with aluminum foil.

Cut the top quarter from each head of garlic and place, cut-side up, on the prepared dish.  Drizzle with oil and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Turn the garlic cut-side down, and roast until the cloves are soft and golden brown, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.  Squeeze the cloves into an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to be used.  (Each head yields about 1 1/2 tablespoons, 2 heads about 3 tablespoons)

This recipe yields 1 (16-inch) pizza.

  1                     box round whole-wheat crackers
                        = (Carr's recommended)
  2                     milk chocolate bars - (1.55 oz ea) -- broken into pieces
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped walnuts

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place paper cupcake holders in a muffin tin.  Line each paper cupcake holder with 1 cracker.  Top with a layer of chocolate pieces - the chocolate should lie flat.  Sprinkle the chocolate with chopped walnuts and coconut flakes.  Place another cracker on top.  Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until the chocolate is melted.

Remove from the oven and gently push the top cracker into the chocolate to make it stick securely.  Cover the top crackers with mini marshmallows and bake for another 7 to 8 minutes, or until the marshmallows have browned.  Remove from the oven and set aside for 15 minutes before removing from the wrappers.

This recipe yields 12 cakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  Idaho potato - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, cubed
  12            ounces  shredded prepared Salt Cod - (abt 2 cups) -- (listed below)
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped green onions
                        = (green and white parts)
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  4              large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  1                cup  bleached all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  Essence -- plus
  5          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  6        tablespoons  milk
  1 1/2           cups  fine dried bread crumbs
                        === SALT COD ===
  1              pound  salt cod -- cut into 4" pieces

Bring the potatoes and enough water, to cover, to a boil in a small saucepan.  Reduce the heat to medium-low.  Cook just until fork-tender, about 12 minutes.  Drain and transfer to a large bowl.  Let cool for about 10 minutes.  Mash the potatoes with a fork until fairly smooth.  Add the salt cod, green onions, parsley, 2 eggs, the salt, and cayenne, and mix until well blended.

In a large, heavy pot, heat enough vegetable oil to come halfway up the sides to 360 degrees.

In a small bowl, combine the flour and 1 tablespoon of the Essence.  In another bowl, whisk the remaining eggs, the milk, and 1 teaspoon Essence until combined.  In a third bowl, combine the bread crumbs with the remaining 4 teaspoons Essence.

Form the cod mixture into balls about 1/4 cup each.  Roll first to coat evenly in the flour.  Shake to remove any excess, dip in the egg wash, dredge in the seasoned bread crumbs, and place on a baking sheet.

In batches, deep-fry the fritters until golden, about 3 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fritters to a paper towelñlined baking sheet.

Season lightly with Essence and serve immediately.

For the Salt Cod:  Lay the cod in a single layer in a large glass or ceramic dish.  Add enough water to cover the fish by 1 inch.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6 hours.

Drain the fish in a colander and rinse under cold running water.  Place on a work surface covered with paper towels.  Press each piece of fish firmly with your hands to extract as much liquid as possible.  Pat the fish dry with paper towels and return to the dish.  Cover with fresh water, soaking and draining a total of 3 more times.  (Don't worry if you stretch the soaking times to 8 hours.)

Put the rinsed salt cod in an airtight container until ready to use.  It can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.  (Makes 1 pound)

This recipe yields 12 fritters.

  2                     venison rib chops - (8 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  fine diced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  crushed fresh huckleberries -- or thawed if frozen
                        = (elderberries, black currants,
                        lingonberries or blueberries can be
                        substituted)
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  chopped rosemary
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/4           cup  dry red wine
     1/4           cup  gin
  1                cup  demi-glace
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh sage
  1         tablespoon  cold butter
                        === SAUTEED BABY SPINACH ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced shallots
  10            ounces  baby spinach -- washed, slightly
                        damp
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARLIC MASHED YUKON GOLD POTATOES ===
  1              pound  Yukon gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" dice
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- roughly chopped
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Lightly season the venison chops on both sides with salt and black pepper.  In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  When the oil starts to smoke, add the chops and sear for 3 minutes.  Lower the heat to medium and turn the chops.  For medium-rare, cook the chops for 2 to 3 minutes on the second side.  Transfer the chops to a plate and let rest, covered loosely with foil.

Return the skillet to medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and garlic and cook, stirring for 1 minute.  Add the huckleberries, sugar and rosemary and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the balsamic vinegar and red wine and bring to a boil.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 1 minute.  Add the gin, being careful of flames, and stir to deglaze the pan.  (Alternately, remove the pan from the heat and ignite with a match.)  When the flames die out, add the demi-glace and sage, and stir well.

For the Spinach:  In a large skillet, melt the butter and warm the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and crushed red pepper, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the spinach in 2 batches and cook, turning, until wilted and the moisture has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove the spinach from the heat and adjust seasoning, to taste.

Return the chops to the pan and cook to warm the meat through, about 1 minute.  Add the cold butter, salt and cracked black pepper, to taste, and swirl to incorporate.  Remove from the heat.  To serve, place 1/2 of the potatoes and spinach on each of 2 large plates, and place 1 chop on top of the potatoes.  Pour the sauce over the chops and around the plates.  Serve immediately.

For the Garlic Mashed Yukon Gold Potatoes:  In a medium saucepan, combine the potatoes and enough salted water to cover by 1-inch.  Bring to a boil and cook until fork tender, about 12 minutes.

While the potatoes are cooking, in a medium skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until caramelized and golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the cream.  Return to medium-low heat to gently warm the cream.  Drain the potatoes in a colander.  Return to the pan over medium-high heat.  Cook, stirring with a heavy wooden spoon or whisk, to remove the excess moisture, about 1 minute.  Add the garlic cream and cook, stirring, until the potatoes are mashed and smooth, about 4 minutes.  Season the potatoes with the salt and white pepper.  Cover to keep warm until ready to serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STUFFING ===
     1/2           cup  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  4               cups  chopped fresh shiitake mushrooms
     1/2         pound  butter
  2               cups  panko flakes
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  chopped macadamia nuts
                        === PORK CHOPS ===
  4                     pork chops, 2" thick -- butterflied
                        Essence -- to taste
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
                        === SHIITAKE MUSHROOM CREAM SAUCE ===
  4        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2               cups  sliced shiitake mushrooms
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

1 head bok choy, cleaned, cored and sliced 1 red onion, peeled and thinly sliced into 1/2 circles

For the stuffing:  In a saucepan, saute garlic, onion, and shiitake mushrooms in butter.  Add panko flakes and mix well.  Season with thyme, salt and pepper.  Fold in macadamia nuts.  Set aside and cool before stuffing pork chops.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Season pork chops with Essence.  Massage pork chops with minced fresh garlic and stuff in pockets.  Stuff pork chops tightly with 1/2 cup of stuffing.  In an ovenproof saute pan, brown pork chops in a little olive oil until nicely browned on both sides.  Place the pan in the oven and roast until the chops are cooked through and an instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees, about 15 minutes.

Remove chops from the oven.  Place the chops on a platter and set aside.  Place the pan on the burner.  In the same pan used to brown pork chops, add 3 tablespoons of butter and olive oil and heat.  Add the garlic and shiitake mushrooms and saute until mushrooms are wilted, about 4 minutes.  Add heavy cream, soy sauce and season with salt and pepper, to taste.

In another saute pan, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter.  Add the bok choy and onions and toss until just wilted.  Season with salt and pepper.  Divide the mixture among 4 plates.  Top each mound with 1 pork chop.  Ladle sauce over chops and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- plus
                        vegetable oil for shallow frying
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped green onions
     1/2         pound  raw shrimp -- shelled, and
                        finely chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped water chestnuts
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  white sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  chili oil
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  water
  12                    won ton wrappers
                        Soy sauce -- as accompaniment
                        Hot mustard -- as accompaniment

Place a wok over medium heat.  Add 1 tablespoon oil and when hot, add the ginger and green onions, and stir-fry until aromatic, about 1 minute.  Add the shrimp and water chestnuts and cook for 1 minute.  Add the soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil and chili oil and stir to combine.  In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and water and add to the shrimp mixture, stirring.  (The mixture should thicken immediately.)  Transfer to a bowl or plate and let cool before assembling the won tons.

Keeping the won ton wrappers covered with a damp kitchen towel, place 1 won ton wrapper at a time on a work surface with 1 point toward you.  Spoon a rounded tablespoonful of filling in the center, just above the point.  Fold the corner over the filling and roll to tuck the point under.  (The won ton should look like a triangle).  Pinch the wrapper around the filling to completely enclose, pushing gently to expel any air bubbles.  Using both hands, pull the 2 side corners toward you below the filling.  Overlap the corners slightly, moisten with a dab of water, and pinch to seal.

Place the filled won tons on a baking sheet and cover with a damp cloth while preparing the remaining won tons.  (If desired won tons can be frozen on a baking sheet and once frozen, kept in a ziplock bag for up to 2 months.)

Fill a large pot or electric fryer halfway with vegetable oil and heat to 375 degrees.  Add the won tons in batches and fry until golden on both sides, about 2 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Serve hot with soy sauce and/or Chinese hot mustard.

This recipe yields 12 wontons, about 4 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  Idaho potatoes
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  flour
     1/2           cup  whole milk
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne
     1/2           cup  grated Gruyere cheese
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan
  2              large  eggs -- separated

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly grease a baking sheet.

Bake the potatoes until the flesh can be easily pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Let sit until cool enough to handle.  Cut each potato in half lengthwise and using a spoon, hollow out the center, leaving a shell about 1/8-inch thick.  Discard the potato flesh or reserve for another recipe.  Place the potato jackets, hollow-side up on the prepared baking sheet.  Place in the oven to keep warm while assembling the souffle base.

In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat.  Add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon to form a light roux, about 2 minutes.  Gradually add milk and whisk constantly until thick, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and add the salt, cayenne, and cheeses, and whisk to combine.  Let sit 2 minutes then add the egg yolks and whisk.

In a separate bowl, whip the 2 egg whites to slightly stiff peaks.  Fold into cheese mixture in 3 additions.

Using a pastry bag or small spoon, fill the potato skins with the souffle mixture.  Bake without opening the oven door for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees.  Continue baking until puffed and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken -- (3-pound) cut into
                        8 serving pieces and patted dry
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/4           cup  bacon fat or vegetable oil
  1              pound  smoked sausage -- sliced
  2               cups  thinly-sliced yellow onions
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  chopped green bell peppers
     1/2         pound  smoked ham -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  6               cups  chicken stock
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
                        Steamed white rice -- as accompaniment
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley

Lightly season the chicken with salt and pepper.  In a deep dish, season the flour with the Essence.  Dredge the chicken in the flour, shaking to remove any excess.

In a large Dutch oven, heat the bacon fat or oil over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and cook until evenly browned, about 5 minutes per side, adding more fat if needed.  Remove with tongs to a plate.

Add the sausage and cook, stirring, until browned, about 5 minutes.  Add the onions, celery, and bell peppers, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the ham and cook until the vegetables are soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.

Add the chicken stock and bay leaves, and bring to a boil, stirring to deglaze the pan.  Return the chicken to the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low.  Cover and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and is very tender, starting to fall from the bones, about 1 hour.

Remove from the heat and discard the bay leaves.  Stir in the green onions.  Divide the rice among dinner plates and top with the chicken and gravy.  Garnish with chopped parsley and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  1              pound  small or medium shrimp
                        === GARNISH ===
  2                     hard boiled eggs -- sliced lengthwise
                        into 6ths
                        Chopped green onions
                        Chopped fresh parsley

In a shallow dish, combine the flour and Essence.  Dredge the fish in the flour, shaking to remove any excess.  In a large saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the fish and cook until lightly browned on both sides.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Drain any remaining fat from the pan and wipe clean.

Melt the butter in the saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onion, paprika, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the potatoes and stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 12 minutes.  Add the cream and bring to a simmer.  Simmer until the potatoes are very soft and the sauce reduces and thickens, about 3 minutes.

Add the cheese and stir to incorporate.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.  Add the fish and the shrimp, and simmer until the shrimp are pink and the fish is warmed through, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Spoon the stew into large bowls.  Arrange the egg slices around the rim of the bowl, and garnish with the green onions and parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === BASIC RED SAUCE ===
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
     1/2                chopped yellow onion
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/8      teaspoon  ground black pepper
  16            ounces  canned whole peeled tomatoes -- broken into pieces,
                        and their juices
  16            ounces  canned tomato sauce
  4          teaspoons  tomato paste
     2/3           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a 2-quart casserole dish with 1 teaspoon of olive oil.

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil.  Add 1 teaspoon of the salt and the pasta shells, and cook until al dente, 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally with a long-handled spoon to prevent the shells from sticking together.  Drain and rinse under cold running water.  Drain.

In a medium skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onions and garlic and cook, stirring, until very soft, 6 to 7 minutes.  Add the ground veal and cook, stirring, until cooked and browned.  Add the squeezed spinach and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper.

In a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, eggs, Parmesan cheese, and 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese.  Add the spinach mixture, the extra-virgin olive oil, Essence, remaining teaspoon of salt, the basil, oregano, and pepper, and stir to combine thoroughly.  Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the spinach-ricotta filling into each cooked pasta shell.  Place the filled shells in the prepared dish.

Pour the Basic Red Sauce over the filled shells and top with the remaining 1 cup of mozzarella cheese.  Bake, uncovered, until bubbly, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

For the Basic Red Sauce:  In a medium pot, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the onions, garlic, salt, basil, oregano, and pepper, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, and sugar and stir well.  Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until thickened and fragrant, 25 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Remove from the heat and keep warm until ready to use.  (Makes 3 cups)

This recipe yields 18 to 20 stuffed shells.

In the bowl of a mixer, beat the egg whites on low speed until soft peaks form.  Add the sugar gradually with the mixer running and peak to stiff peaks.  Add the egg yolks 1 at a time, beating well after the addition of each.

Sift together the flour and baking powder and add to the egg mixture, alternating with the milk.  (Do this quickly so the batter does not lose volume.)  Add the vanilla. Bake until golden, 25 minutes.

To make the Cream Topping:  In a blender, combine the evaporated milk, condensed milk, and heavy cream and blend on high speed.

Remove the cake from the oven and while still warm, pour the cream mixture over it.  Let sit and cool to room temperature.  Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours or overnight.

To make the Icing:  Once the cake is completely chilled, in a saucepan combine the water and sugar.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and stir to dissolve the sugar.  Cook until the mixture reaches the soft ball stage, 235 to 240 degrees.  Remove from the heat.  In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites to soft peaks.  While beating, add the hot syrup in a stream.  Beat until all the syrup has been added, the mixture cools, and a glossy icing forms.

To Assemble:  Remove the cake from the refrigerator and spread the icing evenly across the top.  Arrange the mango and papaya slices over the top and serve.

This recipe yields 1 cake, about 10 servings.

  1 1/2           cups  shelled squash or pumpkin seeds
  4             medium  tomatillos - (abt 1 cup) -- husked, quartered
     1/2           cup  roughly chopped yellow onions
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, crushed

  5               cups  water
  1                cup  chopped onions
     3/4           cup  sliced leeks
     1/2           cup  chopped carrots
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  5                     thyme sprigs
  5                     parsley sprigs
  2                     bay leaves
  3               cups  dry white wine
  10                    peppercorns
  1              whole  line-caught Alaskan salmon - (4 to 5 lbs) -- scaled, gutted
                        === CREAMY RAVIGOTE ===
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1              large  egg yolk
  1              large  egg
  2               cups  vegetable oil
  2              large  hard-boiled eggs -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  minced red onions
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh tarragon
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  freshly-ground white pepper

In a large fish poacher, combine the water, onions, leeks, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme, parsley, bay leaves, and peppercorns.  Bring to a simmer and simmer for 15 minutes.  Add the wine and return to a simmer.  Add the salmon and cook gently for 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool in the poaching liquid.

Lift the salmon out of the poaching liquid and place on a platter.  Peel back the skin and remove.  Plate with fresh herbs and Creamy Ravigote.

For the Creamy Ravigote:  Combine the mustard, egg yolk, and whole egg in the bowl of a food processor, and process on high speed.  With the machine running, add the oil in a thin stream, until the mixture thickens.  Transfer to a bowl.  Using a spoon, force the egg through a coarse sieve into the bowl.  Fold in the remaining ingredients.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.
