  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     loaf French bread
  3                     garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  real butter -- melted
     1/3           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano
                        Paprika -- to taste

The secret to this wonderful tasting bread, is rubbing the outside of a loaf of bread with a piece of garlic that has been cut open lengthwise.

Split loaf, and spread over the melted butter.  Sprinkle on the remaining ingredients.  Finely chop the garlic cloves, and sprinkle those on top of the bread.  Bake at 350 degree for about 8 to 10 minutes, or until nice and golden brown.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     loaf Italian-style or French bread
  1              stick  butter -- softened
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4) -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
  3             slices  Fontina cheese -- thinly sliced,
                        and trimmed to fit bread slices
  3             slices  mozzarella cheese -- thinly sliced,
                        and trimmed to fit bread slices
  3             ounces  mushrooms -- sliced, and
                        sautÈed in butter
  3             slices  Roma tomato, 1/4" thick
  1 1/2    tablespoons  pesto sauce
                        = (use the classic Pesto containing basil
                        and pinenuts, available most grocery store
                        Drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pinch  julienned fresh basil

Bake loaf of Italian bread in oven until lightly browned.  Slice the bread into 1/2-inch slices and discard end pieces.  Cut larger middle slices into equal halves.

Mix softened butter with chopped garlic and garlic powder.  Spread garlic butter over six of the smaller pieces of bread.  Place fontina slices on 3 buttered slices of bread.  Place mozzarella on the three remaining pieces of buttered bread.

Place sautÈed mushrooms on top of the fontina cheese.  Top the mozzarella cheese with the tomato slices and Pesto.  Place all six slices on a baking pan and bake in a preheated 500 degree oven for 4 minutes, or until cheese has melted.

Remove from oven and top fontina-mushroom bruschette with a drizzle of olive oil.  Do not add olive oil to the tomato-pesto bruschette.  Sprinkle all bruschette with the thinly sliced basil leaves.

This recipe yields 6 slices.

Comments:  "Bruschette" (singular form is Bruschetta); is a grilled rustic Italian bread, embellished, with a variety of toppings.  In its simplest form, Bruschetta can consist of toasted bread, rubbed with fresh garlic and drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil.  Or it can be topped according to your own tastes and imagination, like these mouthwatering variations from Carrabba's.  Carrabba's Manager Charles Criswell graciously shares their tantalizing version of this simple, rustic antipasto, which includes some with sautÈed mushrooms paired with fontina cheese, as well as the ever-popular tomato-pesto-mozzarella combination.  The pesto can be made at home, but it is widely available now is our markets.

  10       tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  1 1/2           cups  finely-sliced sun-dried tomatoes
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Prepare the Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce:  Place butter, garlic, and onion in a large skillet over medium heat and sautÈ until garlic and onion are tender and transparent.  Add white wine and lemon juice.  Increase heat to medium-high and simmer to reduce by half.

Reduce heat to low.  Add cold butter one piece at a time.  Add sun-dried tomatoes, basil, salt, and pepper and stir to blend ingredients.  Set aside.

Prepare the Chicken:  Reduce charcoal briquettes to white-hot coals.  Brush chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill chicken over hot coals 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through.  Divide goat cheese evenly between chicken breasts, placing some on each breast for the last two minutes of cooking.

Place cooked chicken on serving platter and spoon Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce over chicken.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  ground pork
     1/2         pound  ground veal
     1/2         pound  ground beef
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped,
                        and sautÈed
     1/3           cup  dry bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  pure olive oil

Combine all the ingredients in a medium bowl, except olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Heat the oil in large sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.  Roll the mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls and fry until golden brown, but not cooked through completely.  Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  In general, most people use just ground beef in their spaghetti sauce.  Instead Bobby suggests the combination of three meats: ground pork, ground veal, ground beef -- the same meat combination used for meat loaf.  Veal and pork can make this dish a little more expensive, but whether it is a meat sauce or a sauce with meatballs, the added depth of flavor truly surpasses that of a singular ground beef sauce.

  2                     boxes Duncan Hines Fudge Brownie Mix -- (1 lb, 5.2 oz ea)
                        = (each using 2 eggs and milk instead
                        of water)
     1/2           cup  Kahl˙a (coffee-flavored liqueur)
  4               cups  chocolate mousse -- see * Note
  4               cups  whipped cream -- whipped
                        = (from 1 1/2 cups heavy cream)
  2             ounces  semi-sweet chocolate shavings

* Note:  Use your own recipe, or mix up two (4.2-oz) packages of Chocolate Mousse Mix.

Mix brownies according to instructions on box, using the two-egg recipe and substituting milk for the water.  Line two 13- by 9- by 2 1/2-inch glass or metal pans with either parchment paper or wax paper (the paper lining makes it much easier to remove the brownies from the pan.)  Grease bottoms with oil or spray with Pam.

Pour batter into pans, and bake -- either in a convection oven at 325 degrees for 20 minutes, or in a standard oven for about 24 to 26 minutes.  (The convection oven is preferred -- it makes a chewier brownie).  Bake until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the brownie comes out clean.  Important -- Do Not Overcook.

Remove from oven and allow to cool completely.  Loosen the sides with a knife, then remove the brownies in one piece from one of the pans.  Turn the brownies upside down and return to the pan.  Peel off paper, then brush the brownie with half of the Kahl˙a, starting from the outer edges and working toward the center.

Spread 2 cups of the chocolate mousse evenly over the brownie, then spread 2 cups whipped cream over the mousse.  Use a vegetable peeler to shave chocolate, then sprinkle top evenly with chocolate shavings.

Remove second brownie from the other pan, brush with remaining Kahl˙a, and place on top.  Repeat layers, first spreading the remaining chocolate mousse, then the remaining whipped cream.  (There are no chocolate shavings on top).  Refrigerate to store.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                      Chili's Grilled Baby Back Ribs

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     racks baby back ribs
                        === SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1                cup  white vinegar
     1/2           cup  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  yellow mustard
     2/3           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  liquid smoke hickory flavoring
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika

Make the barbecue sauce by combining all of the ingredients for the sauce in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  When it comes to a boil, reduce heat and simmer sauce, stirring often, for 45 to 60 minutes or until sauce is thick.

When you're ready to make the ribs, preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Brush sauce over the entire surface of each rack of ribs.  Wrap each rack tightly in aluminum foil and arrange the packets on a baking sheet with the seam of the foil facing up.  Bake for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until the meat on the ribs has pulled back from the cut ends of the bones by about 1/2 inch.  When the ribs are just about done, preheat your barbecue grill to medium heat.

Remove the ribs from the foil (careful not to burn yourself -- the liquid inside will be hot!) and grill them on the barbecue for 4 to 8 minutes per side or until the surface of the ribs is beginning to char.  Brush sauce on both sides of the ribs a few minutes before you remove them from the grill.  Just be sure not to brush on the sauce too soon or it could burn.

Serve the ribs with extra sauce on the side and lots of napkins.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     box Kellogg's Bran Flakes cereal - (1 oz)
                        = (the single-serving box)
  1         tablespoon  cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  2 1/2           cups  Bisquick
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  raisins
     1/3           cup  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  tonic water
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract

Empty the box of cereal into blender.  Dump in cinnamon and brown sugar and using HIGH speed, on/off, for about 3 seconds or till crumbled, but not powdered.  Empty into small bowl.  Stir in melted butter with fork till mixture is completely softened.  Set aside.

For Biscuit Dough:  Use a 2-quart mixing bowl.  Stir Bisquick together with sugar and raisins.  Put buttermilk, tonic water and vanilla into measuring cup, without stirring and pour into Bisquick mixture.  Use fork to mix until all of the liquid is absorbed.  Then knead in the bowl with hands, dipping into additional Bisquick, to make dough smooth and no longer sticky.

Break dough up into 4 or 5 portions in the bowl -- sprinkling the "flake" mixture over the dough and then working it into the dough with your hands till most of it is evenly distributed throughout.  You want to marbleize the dough more than just mix the flake mixture in.

Divide the dough into 12 equal parts and shape each into 1/2-inch thick patty, arranging close together in two Pam-sprayed 8-inch round cake pans.  Bake at 400 degrees for 20 to 24 minutes or until evenly golden.  Remove pan to wire rack and wipe tops with icing at once, using the following recipe.

Icing:  In a small bowl with an electric mixer on HIGH speed, beat 2 tablespoons melted butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 2 tablespoons sour cream, dash of salt, and 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar until smooth.  Place 1 tablespoon icing atop each biscuit right out of the oven.  Let the icing stand on the warm biscuits for 1/2 minute before spreading it.  The heat of the biscuit will soften the icing just enough so that you can swirl it around to coat the tops nicely.

This recipe yields 12 biscuits.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  baking potatoes
     1/4         pound  butter
  2                cup  diced yellow onion
     1/3           cup  flour
  5                cup  water
     1/4           cup  low-sodium chicken base
  1                cup  instant potato flakes
     3/4      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/2      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Prick washed potatoes and bake until a fork pierces to the center easily.  Remove potatoes from oven and allow to fully cool.  Remove skin and cut potatoes into 1/2-inch cubes.  Set aside.

Melt butter in a large saucepan.  Add onions and sautÈ over low heat for 10 minutes or until onions are translucent.  Don't allow onions to burn.  Add flour to onions and butter and cook 4 to 5 minutes, stirring well until flour is absorbed.

In a separate container, combine water, chicken base, potato flakes and seasonings.  Stir or whisk thoroughly to eliminate lumps.  Add slowly to onion mixture, stirring constantly so no lumps form.  Increase to medium heat and continue cooking until the soup begins to gently simmer.  Add milk and cream, stirring until smooth and lightly thickened.

Simmer for 15 minutes.  Do not boil.  Soup should just simmer lightly.  Add cubed baked potatoes and stir to combine.  Remove from heat and serve.  Top each serving with grated Cheddar cheese, sliced scallions and bacon pieces.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  No one does Baked Potato Soup like Houlians.  They use instant mashed potato flakes for a special flare.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  medium-large fresh shrimp -- cleaned, shelled,
                        and butterflied
  2                     eggs
     1/4           cup  water
     2/3           cup  corn starch
  1            package  premium flaked coconut - (7 oz)
                        = (small flake coconut if possible)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  flour

Mix eggs and water.  Set aside.  Place 1/3 cup of corn starch in bowl for dusting of shrimp.  Mix in separate bowl 1/3 cup (the remainder) of corn starch, coconut, sugar, salt, and flour, blend well.

Heat oil for deep frying.  Roll shrimp in corn starch, then in egg wash, then finally roll in coconut mixture.  Place shrimp in hot oil and deep fry until done.  Shrimp will float to the top when cooked.  Take care not to overcook shrimp.

Serve with "Joe's Crab Shack's Pineapple Dipping Sauce" (see recipe).

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  We have found the results to be slightly better when you process the coconut in a blender for a few seconds.  It will grate up the coconut just a bit more.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  powder sugar
  1                     egg beaten
     1/4      teaspoon  Butter Buds (powdered butter flavoring)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  2          teaspoons  almond extract
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 3/4           cups  flour
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped almonds

Measure flour, cream of tartar and baking soda and set aside.

Beat butter and both sugars together until fluffy.  Add beaten egg, vanilla, almond extract, butter buds, and salt.  Beat all ingredients until well blended.  Add flour, cream of tartar and baking soda mixture about a third at a time and beat until smooth.  Dough will come away from the mixing bowl and will look a little dry.  When cookie dough is blended stir in almonds, a spoon works much better.  Chill dough for 30 to 45 minutes.

Roll cookie dough into 1- to 1 1/4-inch balls and place on a ungreased cookie sheet.  Flatten balls until they are about 1/4-inch thick.  Bake the cookies in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for about 12 to 15 minutes until lightly golden.  Remove cookies from cookie sheet and place on paper towel to cool.

This recipe yields 48 cookies.

Comments:  We found that using the product Butter Buds to be a great way to add butter flavor into the cookies.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  whole jalapeÒo's - (26 oz) -- sliced in half by
                        length and seeds removed
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- softened
  2        tablespoons  chives (dehydrated)
  1         tablespoon  minced pimiento peppers
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise

When cream cheese reaches room temperature and is softened whip the cream cheese, add mayonnaise, chives, and pimientos.  Blend together until smooth and fluffy.  Fill jalapeÒos and enjoy.  Cover and store jalapeÒos in refrigerator.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Sometimes a restaurant offers something that is unique and tasty.  These peppers are so good, you won't be able to stop eating them.  We know that our test kitchen fell in love with these.  You may have to double this one.  They are so very much enjoyed you can't just eat one.  These would be a nice party buffet fill in or a side dish for a office luncheon.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     nine-inch pie crust -- baked, cooled
  2                     bananas -- sliced
     1/4           cup  soft cream cheese -- beaten
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  evaporated milk
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
  4                     egg yolks -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/8           cup  sliced almonds
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
                        === FRESH WHIPPED CREAM TOPPING ===
     3/4           cup  chilled whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
                        Chilled glass or metal mixing bowl

Mix in a 2-quart sauce pan, sugar, cornstarch, salt, evaporated milk and whole milk.  Cook over medium heat stirring constantly until mixture thickens and boils for 1 minute.  Remove from heat, slowly pour half of the hot mixture into eggs and stir until that mixture is completely incorporated.

Pour the egg mixture into the pot with the other half of pudding and continue to cook on medium heat until it reaches boiling stage again.  Add cream cheese and mix thoroughly. (Use a hand mixer, it will dissolve the cream cheese better and make the pudding lighter and creamier.)

Remove from heat and add vanilla and butter, keep using the hand mixer until all is blended.  Let pudding stand for 15 minutes but while still warm pour half of pudding in pie shell and layer with bananas then pour remainder of pudding on top.

When pie is completely cooled top with fresh whipped cream and garnish with sliced almonds.

Fresh Whipped Cream Topping:  Pour cream in to a glass or metal bowl and beat until soft peaks form gradually add powder sugar until all has been blended and then add vanilla slowly until it has also been blended.  Mixture should have stiff peaks.  The whipped cream may be put into a pastry bag and used for that added effect.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     plain pastry pie crusts - (8" dia ea)
                        = (store bought or make your own)
  1                     box chocolate pudding -- cooking or instant
  1                     box vanilla pudding -- cooking or instant
     1/4      teaspoon  rum extract -- or to taste
                        Whipped topping (like Cool Whip)
                        === OPTIONAL MERINGUE TOPPING ===
  4                     egg whites
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  8        tablespoons  sugar

Prepare chocolate and vanilla pudding according to directions in separate pans.  Add rum extract to vanilla pudding and stir in.  Pour half of chocolate pudding into each crust and spread evenly.  Pour half of vanilla pudding on top of each chocolate layer and spread evenly, being careful not to mix the layers.  Chill in fridge.

Once chilled, top with regular whipped topping (like Cool Whip).  For more of a restaurant effect put topping into a cake decorating bag with tip and pipe on.

If you would prefer a meringue topping, beat egg whites, vanilla, and cream of tartar until soft peaks form.  Gradually add sugar beating until stiff, glossy peaks form and sugar is dissolved.  Spread over hot filling, for that Marie Callenderís effect leave a smidge of filling visible around the edge.  Bake at 350 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes or until meringue is golden.  Chill in fridge.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     plain pastry pie shell - (8" dia)
                        = (store bought or make your own)
  1                     small box dark chocolate pudding
                        = (cooking kind -- not instant)
  1                cup  semi-sweet chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  fine coconut
     1/2           cup  chopped nuts (pecans or walnuts)
                        whipped topping (like Cool Whip)
                        === OPTIONAL MERINGUE TOPPING ===
  2                     egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  4        tablespoons  sugar

Take crust and cover bottom with chocolate chips, just enough for one layer to cover bottom.  Heat in oven or microwave to slightly warm and soften the chocolate chips.

Meanwhile, cook pudding according to directions on box and add coconut and nuts, stir well.  Pour while hot into pie crust.  Chill in refrigerator until set.  Once chilled, top with regular whipped topping (like Cool Whip).  For more of a restaurant effect put topping into a cake decorating bag with tip and pipe on.  Sprinkle top with a few chocolate chips, coconut, and nuts for a finishing touch.

Most people preferred the German Chocolate Pie with whipped cream, but if you would prefer a meringue topping, beat egg whites, vanilla, and cream of tartar until soft peaks form.  Gradually add sugar beating until stiff, glossy peaks form and sugar is dissolved.  Spread over hot filling, for that Marie Callenderís effect leave a smidge of filling visible around the edge, and don't forget to sprinkle the chips, coconut, and nuts on top.  Bake at 350 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes or until meringue is golden.  Chill in fridge.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     baked and cooled 9" pie shell
                        === BLUEBERRY APPLE FILLING ===
  1                can  blueberries in heavy syrup - (15 oz) -- drained, reserving
                        juice in one bowl, berries in another
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1                cup  pea-size-diced Delicious apple
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  water
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
                        === SOUR CREAM TOPPING ===
  1                cup  sour cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cream cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  Knox gelatin
  2        tablespoons  cold water

In a 2-quart saucepan combine diced apples with water, sugar, and salt at medium temperature until the apples are done but not mushy, about 10 minutes.

While apples are cooking mix cornstarch with 1/4 cup water and dissolve cornstarch.  When apples are done add lemon juice and berry juice, cook and stir until blended.  While stirring on medium heat add dissolved cornstarch slowly and stir constantly until thickened.  Add berries and cinnamon mix through.  Remove from heat and cool before placing into cooled prepared pie shell.  Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.

Sour Cream Topping:  Dissolve gelatin in 2 tablespoons water and set aside.  Mix the sour cream, sugar, cream cheese, dash of salt in a pan warm on low heat until sugar in dissolved and everything is mixed thoroughly, stir and watch that mixture does not burn or dry out.

When all is smooth and blended add vanilla and stir.  Then gradually add gelatin until mixture has a firm consistency of soft pudding, remove from heat.  Sour Cream topping may be smoothed over blueberries while luke warm and chill.  May be garnished with whipped cream.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This was the last and final pie recipe from our visit at Marie Callender's.  One thing we noticed right off was that the pie had apples in it.  It wasn't just blueberries.

If you are on a tight schedule you may use Blueberry Pie Filling but this will taste a much sweeter.

  1                cup  mashed ripe bananas

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Marinades


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Scottish ale
  2          teaspoons  brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  seasoned salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  MSG

Place your favorite cut of steak in a shallow pan and pour ale on steak and marinate for 1 hour in refregerator.  Remove steak from ale and mix dry ingredients together and rub steak on both sides.  Let marinate with dry ingredients for 1/2 hour.

Preheat a skillet or grill to medium high heat add vegatable spray or vegetable oil and braize to perfection.

These amounts will handle 1 1/2 pounds of beef nicely.

Comments:  Personal preference is to braze the steak in butter, not the vegetable oil.  We really liked the use of Ale, Not Beer, for the marinade.

  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- softened)
  1                can  sweetened condensed milk
     2/3           cup  cold water

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    jumbo shrimp - (16 to 20 count size)
  6                     uncooked bacon slices
  12            pieces  seeded red bell peppers - (2" by 2")
  12            pieces  seeded green bell peppers - (2" by 2")
  12            pieces  red onion wedges
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  paprika
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- softened to
                        room temperature
  2          teaspoons  granulated garlic
     1/2           cup  white wine
  12                    beef fajita meat slices - (1" by 4" ea)
  12                    chicken-breast fajita slices -- (1" by 4" ea)
  6                     pineapple cubes - (1 1/2" ea)
  2               cups  bottled Italian dressing
                        = (or your favorite marinade)

Rinse shrimp in strainer or colander.  Remove three-fourths of shell of each shrimp, leaving the last section and tail intact.  With small, sharp paring knife, cut shrimp along the vein underneath, but do not cut completely through.  Both veins should now be exposed.  Wash veins out of the shrimp.  Repeat for all shrimp.  Drain shrimp and refrigerate, covered.

With kitchen shears or sharp knife, cut bacon in half all at once; set aside with red peppers, green peppers and onion wedges.

Combine black pepper, cayenne and paprika; stir until well-blended; set aside.

Whip softened butter with garlic and wine until well-combined.  Set aside until needed.  Wrap 1/2 piece bacon around each shrimp body (not tail).

On each of 6 (12-inch) wooden or metal skewers, place, in order: 1 green pepper piece, 1 slice beef, red onion wedge, 1 chicken strip, 1 red bell pepper piece, 1 bacon-wrapped shrimp (skewer through main body), 1 pineapple cube, another bacon-wrapped shrimp, red bell pepper piece, chicken strip, red onion wedge, beef strip and green pepper piece.  Do not shove vegetables, meat and shrimp too close together, or they will cook evenly.

Refrigerate skewers while preparing a medium fire (or low flame on gas grill with the lid open).  A high flame will cause bacon grease to flare up and burn wooden skewers.  Keep a small cup of water at hand to sprinkle over fire if this happens.

Soak skewers of food in Italian dressing (or marinade) 2 to 3 minutes before starting to cook.  Place on grill, sprinkle with pepper-paprika mixture and baste with reserved butter mixture (about 1/2 cup total).  Slightly melt remaining butter and serve with mixed grill.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Rinse shrimp in strainer or colander.  Remove three-fourths of shell of each shrimp, leaving the last section and tail intact.  With small, sharp paring knife, cut shrimp along the vein underneath, but do not cut completely through.  Both veins should now be exposed.  Wash veins out of the shrimp.  Repeat for all shrimp.  Drain shrimp and refrigerate, covered.
</DirT>

With kitchen shears or sharp knife, cut bacon in half all at once; set aside with red peppers, green peppers and onion wedges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine black pepper, cayenne and paprika; stir until well-blended; set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whip softened butter with garlic and wine until well-combined.  Set aside until needed.  Wrap 1/2 piece bacon around each shrimp body (not tail).
</DirT>
<DirT>
On each of 6 (12-inch) wooden or metal skewers, place, in order: 1 green pepper piece, 1 slice beef, red onion wedge, 1 chicken strip, 1 red bell pepper piece, 1 bacon-wrapped shrimp (skewer through main body), 1 pineapple cube, another bacon-wrapped shrimp, red bell pepper piece, chicken strip, red onion wedge, beef strip and green pepper piece.  Do not shove vegetables, meat and shrimp too close together, or they will cook evenly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Refrigerate skewers while preparing a medium fire (or low flame on gas grill with the lid open).  A high flame will cause bacon grease to flare up and burn wooden skewers.  Keep a small cup of water at hand to sprinkle over fire if this happens.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Soak skewers of food in Italian dressing (or marinade) 2 to 3 minutes before starting to cook.  Place on grill, sprinkle with pepper-paprika mixture and baste with reserved butter mixture (about 1/2 cup total).  Slightly melt remaining butter and serve with mixed grill.

  1                     fresh jalapeÒo pepper -- stemmed, seeded

  1              pound  lean ground beef
     1/2           cup  finely-diced bell pepper
     1/3           cup  diced green onions
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  celery flakes
  1           teaspoon  Creole seasoning
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper
  4               cups  long-grain rice -- cooked, drained
     1/4           cup  water - (to 1/3)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In fry pan stir in ground beef, bell pepper and cook on medium-high heat until beef looses its pink color and bell pepper is soft.  Remove excess grease.

Turn temperature down to medium or medium-low.  Add remaining ingredients, stir and cook together until ground beef is completely cooked and liquid is gone about 25 to 35 minutes.  More Creole seasoning and red pepper may be added for that Cajun at Heart.  I like to use Tony Chacheres's.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Please use a good quality rice with this.  We did not like the results with Minute Rice, but Success Rice boil in the bag, did come out well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cans  red beans - (15 1/2 to 16 oz ea)
                        = (2 cans with liquid 1 can drained)
     1/2         pound  smoked ham hock - (to 3/4)
  1 1/4           cups  water
     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic salt
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
     1/4           cup  lard -- plus
  1         tablespoon  lard
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4               cups  premium long-grain rice - (to 5) -- cooked, drained

Pour 2 cans of beans in a 2-quart pan add smoked ham hock and water.  Simmer on medium heat for an hour until the meat starts to loosen from the bone.  Remove from heat and cool until the hock is cool enough so the meat may be removed from the bone.

Place the meat, beans and liquid in a food processor.  To the mixture add onion powder, garlic salt, red pepper, salt, and lard.  Process for only 4 seconds.  Beans should be chopped and liquid thick.

Now add the third can of beans that have been drained of their liquid.  Process just for a second or two; you want these beans to remain almost whole.

Pour bean mixture back into to pan and cook slowly on low heat stirring often until ready to serve.

Serve over a premium cooked and drained long grain rice.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                  Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay Biscuits II

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  Bisquick baking mix
  1                cup  finely-grated cheddar cheese
     3/4           cup  whole milk
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
     1/8      teaspoon  garlic powder
                        === FOR BRUSHING ON TOP ===
     1/4           cup  butter -- melted
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  dried parsley flakes
  1               dash  salt

Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.

Combine Bisquick with cheddar cheese, milk, 2 tablespoons of butter that has been melted in the microwave, and 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder in a medium bowl.  Mix until well-combined.  Drop approximately 1/4-cup portions of the dough onto an ungreased cookie sheet.

Combine 1/4 cup butter with 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, parsley flakes and salt.  Brush this mixture over the tops of each unbaked biscuit.  Bake for 14 to 16 minutes or until the tops of the biscuits begin to turn light brown.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 1 dozen biscuits.

Comments:  Order an entree from America's largest seafood restaurant chain and you'll get a basket of some of the planet's tastiest cheese biscuits served up on the side.  For many years this recipe has been the top requested clone recipe on the Internet; especially here on the Top Secret Recipes site.  Several versions are floating around, including one that was printed right on the Bisquick box.  If you've tried some of these other clones and found them to be a little "off" from the real thing, you should enjoy this easy-to-bake TSR version that'll fool even the biggest Red Lobster freaks.

                   Red Robin's Chillin' Mango Smoothie

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  canned mango slices -- with juice
     3/4         ounce  grenadine
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  1                cup  ice
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Orange wedge
                        Maraschino cherry

Combine all ingredients in a blender on high speed and mix until smooth.  Pour into a 12-ounce glass then add an orange slice and maraschino cherry speared on a toothpick.  Serve with a straw.

This recipe yields 1 drink.

Comments:  This drink is offered as a special limited-time-only summer refresher.  The chain uses a special mango mix made by Torani, the same company that makes those flavoring syrups often found in coffee shops.  But since this special ingredient can be hard to come by we'll substitute canned mango, which is usually found chilled in jars near the produce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method

     1/3           cup  frozen sweetened sliced strawberries -- thawed
     1/2                ripe banana
     1/3           cup  Langer's berry juice

     1/4           cup  Kernís peach nectar

     1/2           cup  vanilla ice cream

                        Orange wedge

Add all ingredients to a blender and blend on high speed until smooth.  Pour into a 16-ounce glass.  Add an orange wedge and a maraschino cherry speared on a toothpick.  Serve with a straw.

This recipe yields 1 drink.

Comments:  The strawberries used for this drink come in a small box in the freezer section.  These berries work great because when thawed they wind up swimming in juicy sweet syrup.  The restaurant adds to the drink a special blend of apple, raspberry and blackberry juices called "groovy mix," but we can still create an excellent clone by using a blend of apple and berry juices made by Langer's.  If you can't find that brand, use any berry juice blend you can get your hands on.

Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  ground beef
  1              large  plain white hamburger bun
                        Butter-flavored spray or melted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  Kraft Hickory BBQ Sauce
  1         tablespoon  chopped white onion
     1/3           cup  chopped lettuce

Shape the ground beef into a thin circle the same diameter as the bun.  Cover the patty with wax paper and freeze.

When you're ready to prepare the burger, preheat a large skillet over medium heat.  Spray some butter spray or spread a thin layer of melted butter on the faces of the top and bottom bun.  Lightly brown the faces of the bun in the skillet, then remove them and set them aside.

Grill the beef patty in the skillet, and lightly sprinkle it with salt and pepper.  Cook the beef for 3 to 4 minutes per side until done.

As the patty cooks, build the burger by first spreading the BBQ sauce over the face of the bottom bun.  Sprinkle the chopped onion over the sauce.  Arrange the lettuce on the sandwich next.

When the beef is ready, stack it on top of the other condiments, and top off the sandwich with the top bun.  If you'd like the sandwich hotter, microwave it on high for 10 to 15 seconds.

This recipe yields 1 sandwich.
