  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  almonds
  1         tablespoon  safflower oil - (to 2)
  4              large  celery stalks -- ends trimmed, and

     1/2           cup  raisins
     1/2           cup  sunflower seeds or sliced almonds

In a non-stick skillet, place the almonds, and cook over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes or until fragrant.  Transfer the almonds to a food processor or blender, add a little of the oil, and process to form a smooth paste.  Transfer the almond butter to a glass bowl.

Variation:  Fill the celery cavities instead with the White Bean And Roasted Vegetable Spread (see recipe) and top with shredded carrots.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  water -- divided
  1                cup  whole almonds
     1/4           cup  maple syrup
  3        tablespoons  agar-agar flakes
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/8      teaspoon  almond extract

In a saucepan, place 2 cups water, and bring to a boil.  Add the almonds, boil for 1 minute, remove the pan from the heat, and set aside for 5 minutes.  Drain and discard the water.  Using your fingers, squeeze the almonds out of their skins and discard the skins.

Transfer the almonds to a food processor and process for 1 to 2 minutes or until a fine meal.  While the machine is running, drizzle in the remaining 1 cup water, and process an additional 1 minute.  Line a colander or strainer with a double thickness of cheesecloth (or coffee filters) and pour the almond milk mixture through the cheesecloth to strain.

In a saucepan, combine the almond milk, maple syrup, agar-agar flakes, and salt, and bring to a boil while stirring with a whisk occasionally.  Reduce heat to low, simmer for 5 minutes while whisking occasionally, or until the agar-agar flakes are dissolved completely.

Whisk in the vanilla and almond extract, and transfer the mixture to a glass container.  Place a piece of waxed paper on top to prevent a skin from forming.  Chill until firm, or overnight.

When the mixture is firm, place in the food processor, and process for 1 to 2 minutes or until light and creamy.  Taste and add additional vanilla or almond extract, if desired.

Serve as a topping for fresh fruit, pies, cakes or other desserts.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  raw almonds
  1         tablespoon  nutritional yeast flakes
  1           teaspoon  lecithin granules
                        = (or 1 tbspn liquid lecithin)
     1/4      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  powdered kelp
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  safflower oil
  3        tablespoons  water
  4          teaspoons  apple cider vinegar
  4          teaspoons  lemon juice

Begin by blanching the almonds.  In a small saucepan, place 2 inches of water, and bring to a boil.  Add the almonds and cook for 1 minute to blanch them.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside for 3 minutes to cool.

Remove the almonds from the water, squeeze each almond between your thumb and forefinger to remove their skins, and set them aside for 5 minutes to dry and cool.

Place the almonds in a blender or food processor and process for 1 to 2 minutes to finely grind them.  Add the nutritional yeast, lecithin, onion powder, garlic powder, kelp, and salt, and process for 30 seconds to combine.

In a small measuring cup, combine the oil and water, and add the mixture to the blender in a slow stream while the machine is running.  Scrape down the sides of the container, add the vinegar and lemon juice, and continue to process the mixture an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until thickened.

Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and chill for 30 minutes or more before using, to allow the flavors to blend.  Use as a replacement for soy mayonnaise in recipes, also as a condiment or spread on sandwiches, a dip for raw veggies or chips, or a sauce for vegetables and grains.

This recipe yields 1 1/4 cups.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the almonds from the water, squeeze each almond between your thumb and forefinger to remove their skins, and set them aside for 5 minutes to dry and cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the almonds in a blender or food processor and process for 1 to 2 minutes to finely grind them.  Add the nutritional yeast, lecithin, onion powder, garlic powder, kelp, and salt, and process for 30 seconds to combine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small measuring cup, combine the oil and water, and add the mixture to the blender in a slow stream while the machine is running.  Scrape down the sides of the container, add the vinegar and lemon juice, and continue to process the mixture an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until thickened.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and chill for 30 minutes or more before using, to allow the flavors to blend.  Use as a replacement for soy mayonnaise in recipes, also as a condiment or spread on sandwiches, a dip for raw veggies or chips, or a sauce for vegetables and grains.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 1 1/4 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIE CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  sliced almonds
     3/4           cup  sunflower seeds
  2               cups  dates -- pitted
     1/2           cup  dried banana chips
                        = (available at grocery and health food
                        stores, or dehydrate banana slices)
     1/2      teaspoon  cardamom
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
                        === BERRY FILLING ===
  2 1/2           cups  blueberries
  1                cup  strawberries
     1/3           cup  dates -- pitted
     1/2      teaspoon  cardamom
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon

                        Sliced strawberries
                        Sliced almonds

Begin by preparing the pie crust.  In a food processor, place the almonds and sunflower seeds, and process for 2 to 3 minutes to form a fine meal.  Add the remaining pie crust ingredients, and process for 5 to 7 additional minutes or until the mixture comes together.

Transfer the mixture to a 9-inch pie pan.  Using your hands, press the mixture evenly over the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan.  Place in the refrigerator and allow to chill for 20 to 30 minutes or until firm.

Wipe out the food processor for use in preparing the filling.  Place all of the filling ingredients in the food processor and process for 1 to 2 minutes to form a smooth puree.  Pour the filling into the chilled pie crust.

Place the pie in the refrigerator and chill for 30 to 45 minutes or until filling is set and slightly firm.  Score the top of the pie into 8 pieces and decorate each piece of pie with a few fresh berries and sliced almonds.

This recipe yields one 9-inch pie or 8 pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  tart apples of choice -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced
     1/2           cup  apple juice -- divided
     1/4           cup  unbleached cane sugar
  4                     whole cloves
  2             pieces  lemon rind - (abt 2" ea)
  4               cups  graham cracker crumbs
     1/4           cup  safflower oil
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
                        Apple Sweetened Tofu Topping -- (see recipe)
  16                    pecan halves
  3        tablespoons  vegan chocolate -- finely chopped
                        Cinnamon -- for garnishing

Lightly grease an 8-inch springform pan and set aside.  In a saucepan, place the apples, 1/4 cups apple juice, sugar, cloves, and lemon rind, and cook over low heat for 20 to 25 minutes or until apples are tender.  Remove the cloves and lemon rind and discard.  Using a spoon or potato masher, roughly mash the apple mixture, and set aside.

In a large bowl, place the graham cracker crumbs, remaining 1/4 cups apple juice, oil, and cinnamon, and stir well to combine.  Place one-third of the crumb mixture in the bottom of the prepared springform pan and pack it down firmly with the back of a spoon.  Spread one-half of the apple mixture evenly over the crumb layer.  Spoon half of the remaining crumb mixture over the top of the apple mixture layer and press down again with the back of a spoon to pack it down.  Repeat the layering pattern with the remaining apple and crumb mixtures.  Cover the springform pan with plastic cling film and chill for 12 hours or overnight.

Remove the plastic cling film cover but leave the ring on the springform pan.  Spread the prepared Apple Sweetened Tofu Topping evenly over the top of the cake.  Return the springform pan to the refrigerator and chill an additional 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a non-stick skillet, place the pecans, and cook over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes or until fragrant and lightly toasted.  Remove the pecans from the pan and set aside to cool.

Remove the chilled cake from the refrigerator.  Pick out 8 of the best looking pecan halves and evenly place them on the topping around the edge of the gateau.  Roughly chop the remaining pecan halves.  Sprinkle the center of the gateau with the chopped chocolate and chopped pecans.

Carefully remove the ring of the springform pan and transfer the gateau to a platter.  Use a long knife warmed in hot water to cut the gateau into 8 slices with a pecan half centered in each slice.

This recipe yields one 8-inch gateau or 8 slices.

Lightly grease an 8-inch springform pan and set aside.  In a saucepan, place the apples, 1/4 cups apple juice, sugar, cloves, and lemon rind, and cook over low heat for 20 to 25 minutes or until apples are tender.  Remove the cloves and lemon rind and discard.  Using a spoon or potato masher, roughly mash the apple mixture, and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, place the graham cracker crumbs, remaining 1/4 cups apple juice, oil, and cinnamon, and stir well to combine.  Place one-third of the crumb mixture in the bottom of the prepared springform pan and pack it down firmly with the back of a spoon.  Spread one-half of the apple mixture evenly over the crumb layer.  Spoon half of the remaining crumb mixture over the top of the apple mixture layer and press down again with the back of a spoon to pack it down.  Repeat the layering pattern with the remaining apple and crumb mixtures.  Cover the springform pan with plastic cling film and chill for 12 hours or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the plastic cling film cover but leave the ring on the springform pan.  Spread the prepared Apple Sweetened Tofu Topping evenly over the top of the cake.  Return the springform pan to the refrigerator and chill an additional 30 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped dill
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
     1/4           cup  freshly-snipped chives
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated lemon zest
  6                     sheets phyllo dough -- thawed
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  6        tablespoons  sesame seeds -- toasted
  24                    asparagus spears -- tough ends trimmed

In a small bowl, place the chopped dill, parsley, chives, and lemon zest, toss well to combine, and set aside.

On a work surface, place one sheet of phyllo dough, and cover the remaining with a clean towel to keep them from drying out.  Brush the phyllo dough with a little olive oil, then sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the herb mixture and 1 tablespoon sesame seeds evenly over the entire surface.

Using a sharp knife or pastry wheel cutter, cut the sheet of phyllo dough vertically into 4 strips.  For each strip of phyllo, place the end of one asparagus spear at the bottom edge, then tightly roll at a slight diagonal to enclose the length of the spear of asparagus, and tuck in the end of the strip of phyllo at the tip of the asparagus.  Transfer the phyllo-wrapped spear to a large plate.

Repeat the rolling procedure for the remaining strips and then repeat the entire procedure for the remaining sheets of phyllo dough and asparagus spears.

When all of the phyllo cigars have been assembled, cover them with a clean towel and place them in the refrigerator to chill for one hour or more.

Transfer the phyllo cigars to a non-stick cookie sheet and bake them at 425 degrees for 18 to 20 minutes or until the phyllo dough is lightly browned and crisp.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  pecan halves -- divided
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  unbleached cane sugar
  1                cup  whole-wheat pastry flour
  1                cup  rolled oats
  2          teaspoons  cinnamon -- divided
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  safflower oil
     3/4           cup  maple syrup
     3/4           cup  soy milk
                        = (rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
     1/4           cup  arrowroot
  1                can  pumpkin puree - (16 oz)
  2        tablespoons  bourbon
                        = (or rum or apple juice)
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg

Lightly oil (or spray with oil) a 9-inch tart pan and set aside.

In a small bowl, place the pecan halves, drizzle the water over them, and toss lightly to evenly moisten them.  In another small bowl, stir together the sugar and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon.  Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar over the moistened pecans and toss lightly to evenly coat them with the mixture.

Place the pecans on a cookie sheet and bake at 325 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes or until lightly toasted and fragrant.  Pick out 16 perfect pecan halves, place them on a plate, and set aside to be used later as garnish for the tart.

Allow the remaining pecans to cool, and then transfer them to a food processor.  Add the whole wheat pastry flour, oats, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and salt, and pulse a few times until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Drizzle in the oil and 1/4 cups maple syrup, and pulse a few times just until mixture comes together.

Transfer the mixture to the prepared tart pan.  Using your fingers, press the mixture to cover the bottom and sides of the tart pan.  Place the tart pan on a cookie sheet and bake it at 375 degrees for 10 minutes.  Remove it from the oven and allow it to cool for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, wipe out the food processor so that it can be reused to prepare the filling.  In the food processor, place the soy milk and arrowroot, and blend for 1 minute to fully dissolve the arrowroot.  Add the remaining cinnamon, remaining maple syrup, and all of the remaining ingredients to the food processor, and blend for 1 to 2 minutes or until smooth and creamy.

Pour the filling into the prepared crust, return the cookie sheet to the oven, and bake an additional 35 to 40 minutes or until set.  While the tart is still warm, decorate the top with the 16 reserved pecan halves.  Allow the tart to cool on a rack for 30 minutes, then chill it for several hours before serving.

Cut the tart into 8 pieces with a warmed knife.  Excellent served with a frozen non-dairy ice cream or sorbet on the side.

This recipe yields one 9-inch tart or 8 pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  3             pounds  peaches -- peeled, pitted,
                        and sliced
     1/3           cup  maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  brandy
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === COBBLER TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
     1/4           cup  safflower oil
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
     3/4           cup  unbleached flour
     3/4           cup  whole-wheat pastry flour
     2/3           cup  unbleached cane sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  sliced almonds

Lightly oil (or spray with oil) a 9- by 13-inch baking dish and set aside.

In a large bowl, place all of the filling ingredients, and toss gently to combine.  Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan and cover the pan with a piece of aluminum foil.  Bake at 375 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes or until the peaches are tender.

While the peaches are baking, prepare the cobbler topping.  In a small bowl, stir together the soy milk, oil, vanilla, and almond extract, and set aside.  In a large bowl, place both types of flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt, and stir well to combine.  Drizzle the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir well to combine.  Fold the sliced almonds into the dough.

After the peaches have baked for 45 minutes, carefully remove the pan from the oven.  Remove the piece of aluminum foil and discard.  Increase the temperature of the oven to 400 degrees.  Drop 12 spoonfuls of the dough on to the top of the filling.  Using the back of the spoon, smooth the batter to cover the top of the filling.

Return the pan to the oven and bake an additional 15 minutes or until golden brown.  Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.  Non-dairy sorbet or other frozen desserts make an excellent accompaniment to the cobbler.

This recipe yields one 9- by 13-inch cobbler.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
     1/2           cup  unbleached flour
     1/2           cup  whole-wheat pastry flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy)
     1/3           cup  maple syrup
     1/4           cup  safflower oil
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/8      teaspoon  almond extract
                        === BUTTERCUP CREAM ===
  8               cups  cubed (1") peeled buttercup squash
                        = (or butternut, acorn, delicata,
                        pumpkin, etc. or combination of squashes)
  1 3/4           cups  apple juice -- divided
  1                     cinnamon stick
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  agar-agar flakes
  1         tablespoon  arrowroot
                        = (or kudzu or cornstarch)
     1/2           cup  maple syrup
     1/4           cup  tahini
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
                        === TOPPING ===
  2        tablespoons  cocoa or carob powder
  1           teaspoon  maple syrup
  1           teaspoon  safflower oil
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla
  1         tablespoon  soy milk - (to 2)
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)

Begin by preparing the cake base.  Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) a 9-inch springform pan and set aside.  In a small bowl, sift together both types of flour, baking powder, and salt, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, place the soy milk, maple syrup, oil, vanilla, and almond extract, and whisk well to combine.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, whisk until well blended, and pour the batter into the prepared springform pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.  Place the pan on a rack to cool, but do not remove the cake from the pan.

While the cake base is baking, start the buttercup cream.  In a large saucepan, place the squash cubes, 1 cup apple juice, cinnamon stick, cardamom, ginger, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt, and bring the mixture to a boil.  Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer the mixture for 25 to 30 minutes or until the squash is soft.  Remove the lid from the pan and continue to cook until all of the liquid is absorbed.  Remove the pan from the heat, remove the cinnamon stick and discard it, and allow the squash mixture to cool for 10 minutes.

In a small saucepan, place 1/2 cups apple juice and the agar-agar flakes, and let sit for 10 minutes to soften.  Place the pan over low heat (do not boil) and simmer for 10 minutes to completely dissolve the agar-agar flakes.

In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/4 cups apple juice and arrowroot, add it to the agar-agar mixture, and continue to simmer the mixture while whisking until the starchy-white color disappears.  Add the maple syrup, tahini, vanilla, and almond extract, and whisk well to combine.

Transfer the cooked squash mixture and the agar-agar mixture to a food processor, and process until very smooth and creamy.  Pour the buttercup cream into the springform pan, spreading it evenly to cover the cooled cake base, and set aside.

To prepare the topping:  In a small measuring cup with a spout, stir together the cocoa, maple syrup, oil, and vanilla to form a thick paste.  Slowly stir in the soy milk, adding 1 tablespoon at a time, just enough so that it drizzles off the edge of a spoon.

Drizzle the topping in 4 horizontal lines over the top of the buttercup cream.  Using a sharp knife or toothpick, pull through the buttercup cream and the lines of topping, in an up and down motion over the top of the cake, to create a marbleized effect or pattern.

Cover the top of the springform pan and chill the cake for several hours or overnight.  Remove the springform ring from the cake and transfer it to a large plate or platter.  Use a warmed knife to cut the cake into 12 pieces.

This recipe yields one 9-inch cake or 12 pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  diced onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  Roma tomatoes -- seeded, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/3           cup  cider vinegar
     1/4           cup  unbleached cane sugar
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne

In a stainless steel pan, saute the onion and garlic in olive oil for 3 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and saute an additional 5 minutes.  Add the remaining ingredients, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.  Remove the bay leaf and discard.

In a food processor or blender, puree ketchup until smooth.  Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.  If ketchup is a little thin, return it to the pan and cook an additional 5 to 10 minutes or until desired consistency.  Transfer to a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid.  Store in the refrigerator for up to a week.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

Variation:  This ketchup can also be made in larger quantities and canned.  Sterilize jars and lids by boiling them in a large pot of water for 15 minutes.  Using tongs, remove the jars and lids from the water.  Place a rack in the water and keep it hot.  Use a funnel and ladle to fill the jars with the warm ketchup, wipe clean the rims of the jars, and seal with their lids.

Place the jars on the rack in the pot, and add additional water to cover the jars by 1-inch.  Return the water to a boil and process for 15 minutes.  Using tongs, remove the jars from the water and allow to cool on a dry surface.  Label and date the jars.  Store in a cool, dark place, and in the refrigerator after opening.

               Chocolate And Peppermint Chip Frozen Fantasy

Recipe By     :Beverly Lynn Bennett

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Chocolate Mint Chip Cake -- (see recipe)
  1             recipe  Peppermint Chocolate Chip Frozen Dessert -- (see recipe)
  1             recipe  After Midnight Chocolate Glaze -- (see recipe)

Begin by placing the two layers of Chocolate Mint Chip Cake in the freezer, and freeze them for 2 hours.  Twenty minutes before the 2 hour cake freezing time elapses, remove the Peppermint Chocolate Chip Frozen Dessert from the freezer to allow it to soften slightly.

Place one layer of the frozen cake in the bottom of an 8-inch springform pan.  Carefully and evenly spread the softened Peppermint Chocolate Chip Frozen Dessert over the top of the layer of cake.  Place the remaining frozen cake layer on top of the frozen dessert and press down gently to sandwich the layers together.  Cover the cake and return it to the freezer for several hours or overnight to freeze completely.

If the After Midnight Chocolate Glaze was previously made, place it in a small saucepan, and warm it over low heat.  Remove the frozen cake from the freezer and remove the ring from the springform pan.  Transfer the frozen cake to a rack and place the rack over a cookie sheet.

Slowly drizzle half of the warmed glaze over the top of the cake, allowing it to run down the sides, covering it completely.  Allow it to set for 10 minutes and then drizzle the remaining glaze over the cake, covering it completely and evenly.  Allow the cake to set for 20 to 30 minutes or until no longer "tacky" to the touch (can also be refrigerated to speed up the process).

Using two long spatulas, carefully transfer the glazed cake to a platter for service.

Fill a deep glass or pitcher with warm water, and place a long knife to warm in the water.  Wipe the knife on a clean towel to remove the moisture and cut the cake in half.  Dip the knife back into the water, wipe it on the towel again, and continue this procedure while cutting the cake into 12 pieces.  If not serving all of the cake at once, cut only one half of it at a time.

To store the cake, place a few toothpicks in the top of the cake, leaving them to stick out of the cake by an inch or more.  Carefully, place plastic wrap over the toothpicks to make "a tent" over the top of the cake, and wrap it over the edge of the platter.  Repeat the wrapping technique until the cake is covered completely.  If you have a large airtight container that will hold the cake, place it in that as well.  Store the cake in the freezer.  Allow it to thaw for 15 to 20 minutes before cutting and serving.

This recipe yields one 8-inch cake or 12 pieces.

Comments:  You can also substitute an equal amount of another flavor of non-dairy "ice cream" (see recipe archive) or store bought non-dairy frozen dessert for the Peppermint Chocolate Chip Frozen Dessert in the recipe.

This recipe yields one 8-inch cake or 12 pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2               cups  whole-wheat pastry flour
     1/4           cup  unbleached cane sugar
                        = (or white sugar from sugar beets)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2           cup  safflower oil
                        === FILLING ===
  2           packages  Mori-Nu silken style tofu - (12.3 oz ea) -- extra firm
     1/2           cup  unbleached cane sugar
                        = (or white sugar from sugar beets)
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  coconut extract
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/2           cup  toasted coconut -- divided
     1/2           cup  vegan chocolate bar of choice -- roughly chopped
                        = (or vegan chocolate chips)
     1/3           cup  raw almonds -- roughly chopped

Begin by preparing the crust.  In a medium bowl, place the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder, and stir well to combine.  Using a pastry cutter or fork, cut the safflower oil into the dry ingredients to form a crumbly mixture.

Transfer the mixture to an 8-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  Using your hands, firmly press the crust mixture to cover the bottom and sides of the tart pan.  Place the tart pan on a non-stick cookie sheet and set aside.

To prepare the filling.  In a food processor or blender, place the tofu, sugar, vanilla, coconut and almond extract, and process for 2 minutes or until very smooth and creamy.  Place 3 tablespoons of the toasted coconut in a small bowl and set aside.  Add the remaining toasted coconut, chopped vegan chocolate bar, and almonds, and pulse 2 to 3 times to combine.  Pour the filling mixture into the reserved crust.

Bake the tart pan on the cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  Remove the cookie sheet from the oven, sprinkle the reserved toasted coconut over the top of the filling, and allow the tart to cool for 15 to 20 minutes, before removing the ring from the tart pan.

Allow the tart to cool completely before cutting it into 8 pieces.  Store any remaining tart in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields one 8-inch tart or 8 pieces.

                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  graham cracker crumbs
                        = (approximately one sleeve crushed)
  3        tablespoons  cocoa powder
  1         tablespoon  unbleached cane sugar
     1/2           cup  safflower oil

Begin by pressing the tofu.  In a large colander, place a natural unbleached coffee filter, place the two blocks of tofu in the coffee filter, cover the tofu blocks with another coffee filter, place a plate on the top of the coffee filter, and then a heavy can or weight on top of the plate.  Place the colander over a bowl, then place the entire set-up in the refrigerator, and leave to drain for several hours or overnight.

Melt the chocolate chips in the microwave or over a double boiler.  In a food processor or blender, combine the pressed tofu, melted chocolate chips, and remaining filling ingredients, and puree until smooth.

In a small bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, cocoa, and sugar, stirring until well mixed.  Drizzle in safflower oil, and using your fingers, mix until thoroughly combined.  Firmly press into the bottom of a greased 9-inch springform pan and set aside.

Pour filling over top of crust and bake at 325 degrees for 45 minutes.  Allow to cool, and chill, preferably overnight, or for several hours.  Garnish with fresh fruit or sliced almonds, if desired.

This recipe yields one 9-inch cheesecake, or 12 pieces.

Variation:  For a plain tofu cheesecake, substitute a filling made with the same amount of pressed tofu, 1 cup unbleached cane sugar, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1/4 cup safflower oil, 2 teaspoons vanilla, and a pinch of salt.  Bake as directed above.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  stale bread of choice -- cut 1" cubes
     1/3           cup  raisins
                        = (could use half golden raisins)
  2 1/2           cups  soy milk
                        = (rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
  1                cup  apple juice
     1/2           cup  maple syrup
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg

Lightly oil a 8- by 12-inch casserole dish.  Place the bread cubes in the casserole dish and scatter the raisins over the bread cubes.  In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining ingredients, and pour over the top of the bread cubes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  unbleached flour
     1/3           cup  unbleached cane sugar
  1         tablespoon  orange zest
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  Spectrum Spread non-hydrogenated margarine
  1 1/2           cups  tofu sour cream
                        = (or soy yogurt)
     1/3           cup  orange juice

                        other non-dairy milk of choice)
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
                        Safflower oil -- for oiling sheet

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) a non-stick cookie sheet and set aside.

In a large bowl, place the flour, sugar, orange zest, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, and stir well to combine.  Using a pastry blender, cut in the Spectrum Spread until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

In a small bowl, place the remaining ingredients, and stir well to combine.  Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir well to combine.

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface.  Using your hands, pat the dough to 3/4-inch thickness.  Using a 3-inch star-shaped cookie cutter (or any shape of choice), dip the cutter in a little flour, cut 12 stars out of the dough, redipping the cutter in flour as needed, and transfer them to the prepared cookie sheet.

Bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, reduce the heat to 350 degrees, and bake an additional 5 minutes or until lightly browned on the bottom.  Allow to cool slightly before serving.

This recipe yields 1 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  Ener-G Egg Replacer
     1/2           cup  unbleached cane sugar -- plus
                        additional for rolling out dough
     1/4           cup  cocoa powder
     3/4           cup  Spectrum Spread non-hydrogenated margarine -- divided
     1/4           cup  shredded coconut
     1/4           cup  walnuts or hazelnuts -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  vanilla -- divided
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  water or soy milk

In a small bowl, combine the 2 tablespoons water and egg replacer, and whisk vigorously for 1 minute or until very frothy (almost like beaten egg whites).  Add the sugar, cocoa powder, 1/4 cup Spectrum Spread, coconut, chopped nuts, and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Stir well to combine, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and salt.  Using a pastry blender or a fork, cut in the remaining Spectrum Spread into the flour mixture, and work it until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Drizzle the flour mixture with the remaining 3 tablespoons water and 1 teaspoon vanilla, and mix well to form a soft dough.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) two non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.

Sprinkle a work surface with a little sugar to prevent the dough from sticking.  Divide the dough in half and cover the remainder with a towel to prevent it from drying out, and set it aside.  Work with one half of the dough at a time.  On the sugared surface, roll out the dough to 1/16-inch thickness, and cut it into 2 1/2-inch squares.

To assemble each of the pastries:  Place 1 teaspoonful of the filling in the center of each square, fold each of the corners of the square up to the center, and gently press them together to partially seal in the filling.  Using a spatula, transfer the pastries to the prepared cookie sheets with the sealed seam-side up.

Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until set and lightly browned.  Allow the pastries to cool on the cookie sheets for several minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.

When completely cooled, transfer to an airtight container for storage, and place waxed paper between the layers of pastries.

This recipe yields 28 to 30 pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/2           cup  diced peeled potatoes
  1 1/2           cups  Veganized Powdered Sugar -- (see recipe)
  1 1/3           cups  shredded coconut
  3               cups  vegan chocolate chips
  3        tablespoons  safflower oil

In a small saucepan, place the water and diced potatoes, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.  Drain well, reserve the cooking liquid for use in soups or breads, and transfer the cooked potatoes to a medium-size bowl.

Using a potato masher, mash the potatoes to a very smooth consistency, and place in the refrigerator to cool.  When the potatoes are cool, measure out 1/3 cup, and set any extra mashed potatoes aside.

In a medium bowl, place the 1/3 cup mashed potatoes, Veganized Powdered Sugar, and coconut, and stir well to combine.  Cover and chill the mixture for 15 minutes.  Shape the chilled coconut mixture into 1-inch balls, place them on a plate, and chill an additional 45 to 50 minutes or until firm.

In a double boiler, place the chocolate chips and oil, place over low heat, and cook until the chips start to melt.  Stir the chocolate chips until smooth.  Reduce the heat to the lowest setting to keep the mixture from scorching.

Remove the chilled coconut candies from the refrigerator.  Place a small rack on top of a cookie sheet and set aside.

To coat the candies:  Place one coconut candy ball on a fork, hold the fork over the double boiler of melted chocolate, and using a spoon, drizzle the melted chocolate over the top to thoroughly coat the coconut ball.  Carefully transfer the chocolate covered candy to the prepared rack.  Repeat the chocolate coating procedure for the remaining coconut candy balls.

When all of the candy has been coated with the chocolate, place them in the refrigerator for 5 minutes to help set the chocolate.  The candies can be placed in an airtight container with waxed paper between the layers, and stored in the refrigerator or freezer.  Place the candies in small paper cups and allow them to come to room temperature before serving.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

  2 1/2           cups  cut corn
     2/3           cup  diced celery
     2/3           cup  diced onion
     2/3           cup  apple juice

  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     2/3           cup  diced seeded green pepper
     2/3           cup  diced seeded red pepper
     2/3           cup  diced seeded orange pepper

Sterilize four 8 ounces glass jars with their lids, by boiling them in a large pot of water for 15 minutes, and leave them in the hot water until ready to use.  Place a rack in the pot of water and keep hot.

Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine all of the ingredients, except the peppers, and bring to a boil.  Cook the corn mixture over medium heat for 5 minutes.  Add the peppers and cook an additional 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.

Using tongs, remove the sterilized jars and lids from the water.  Using a funnel and a ladle, transfer the corn relish to glass jars, filling within 1/4-inch of the top of the jar.  Wipe clean the rims of the jars, and seal the jars with their lids.

Return the pot of water to a boil.  Place the filled jars in boiling water, adding more water as needed to completely cover the jars by 1-inch.  Once water boils again, process for 10 minutes.  Use tongs to remove the jars from the water, and allow to cool on a dry surface.  Label and date the jars.  Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  warm water
  2         tablespoon  molasses
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  4               cups  whole wheat flour - (to 4 1/2)
     1/4           cup  cracked wheat
  2        tablespoons  wheat bran
  2        tablespoons  wheat germ
  1 1/2    tablespoons  flax seed
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  safflower oil -- plus
                        additional for oiling bowl
                        Soy milk -- for brushing tops
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
                        Cracked wheat -- for garnishing tops

In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the warm water, molasses, and yeast, stir well to dissolve the yeast, and set aside for 10 minutes or until foamy.

In a large bowl, place 4 cups whole-wheat flour, cracked wheat, wheat bran, wheat germ, flax seed, and salt, and stir well to combine.  Add the yeast mixture and safflower oil to the dry ingredients and stir well to form a smooth dough.

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes, adding the remaining 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour, as needed, to form a dough that is smooth and elastic.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil the mixing bowl, transfer the ball of dough to the bowl, and roll the dough around the inside of the bowl to thoroughly coat it with the oil.  Cover the bowl with a clean towel, place it in a warm place, and leave to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

After the dough has doubled in bulk, punch it down, and turn it out on to a floured work surface.  Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball.  Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) two 9-inch round cake pans.  Place 12 balls of dough in each round cake pan.  Cover each pan with a clean towel, place in a warm place, and leave to rise for an additional 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

Remove the towels from the pans.  Brush the tops of the rolls with soy milk and sprinkle with a little cracked wheat.  Bake the rolls at 450 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown and they sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.  Allow the rolls to cool a few minutes, before removing them from the pans.  Serve the rolls as a round, allowing guest to pull them apart.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BATTER ===
                        Safflower oil -- for oiling pan
  2               cups  unbleached flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  unbleached cane sugar
                        = (or white sugar from sugar beets)
     1/4           cup  vegan margarine
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  Ener-G Egg Replacer
  1         tablespoon  orange zest
     1/2           cup  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  2               cups  cranberries -- fresh or frozen
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  unbleached cane sugar
                        = (or white sugar from sugar beets)
     1/3           cup  unbleached flour
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4           cup  vegan margarine

Begin by preparing the batter.  Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or mist with oil) a 9-inch square pan, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt, and set aside.

In a large bowl, place the sugar, margarine, water, egg replacer, and orange zest, and stir well to combine.  Add the soy milk, vanilla, and almond extract, and stir well to combine.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until just blended.  Gently fold in the cranberries and then transfer the batter to the prepared pan.

To prepare the topping, in a small bowl, combine the sugar, flour, and cinnamon.  Using a fork, cut in the margarine to form a crumbly mixture, and then sprinkle the mixture over the top of the batter.

Bake at 375 degrees for 25 to 35 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields one 9-inch pan.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Spectrum Spread non-hydrogenated margarine -- divided
  4             ounces  tofu cream cheese
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached flour
     1/2           cup  pecans -- finely chopped
  1            package  fresh or frozen cranberries - (12 oz)
     1/2           cup  dark corn syrup
     1/3           cup  Sucanat
     1/4           cup  apple juice
     1/3           cup  unbleached cane sugar
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
  1                cup  pecan halves

In a small bowl, cream together 3/4 cups margarine and tofu cream cheese until light and fluffy.  Using your fingers, add the flour and chopped pecans, and thoroughly mix to form a soft dough.  Shape the dough into a ball, cover, and chill for 45 minutes.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) eight 4-inch tart pans and set aside.

When the dough has thoroughly chilled, transfer it to a work surface and knead it a bit with your hands to soften it up.  Divide it into 8 equal pieces and place one piece of dough in each of the prepared tart pans.

For each tart pan, place one piece of dough, and using your fingers, press the dough to cover the bottom and sides of the tart pan.  Repeat the procedure for the remaining tart pans.  Place the tart pans on two cookie sheets and chill them while preparing the filling.

In a saucepan, place the cranberries, dark corn syrup, Sucanat, apple juice, and remaining 1/4 cup Spectrum Spread, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes or until the skins of the cranberries begin to pop.

In a small bowl, stir together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt.  Add the cornstarch mixture to the saucepan, stir well to combine, and continue to simmer the mixture for 3 to 4 additional minutes or until thickened.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla and almond extract.

Remove the prepared tart shells from the refrigerator.  Pour approximately 1/4 cup of the cranberry filling into each of the tart shells and decoratively arrange the pecan halves on top of the filling.

Bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until the pecans and crust are lightly browned.  Allow the tartlets to cool in pans completely, loosen edges with a knife, and then carefully remove the tartlets from the pans.  Serve one tartlet per person.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached flour
     3/4           cup  unbleached cane sugar
  2        tablespoons  poppy seeds
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  3        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  Ener-G Egg Replacer
     1/3           cup  Spectrum Spread non-hydrogenated margarine
  1                cup  soy milk
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  1                cup  fresh or frozen cranberries -- roughly chopped
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) a 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan and set aside.

In a bowl, place the flour, sugar, poppy seeds, and baking powder, stir well to combine, and set aside.

In another bowl, place the water and egg replacer, and whisk vigorously for 1 minute or until very frothy (almost like beaten egg whites).  Add the Spectrum Spread and whisk until smooth.  Add the soy milk and vanilla, and whisk well to combine.

Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until just moistened.  Add the remaining ingredients and stir until just combined.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for 60 to 70 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.  Place the loaf pan on a rack to cool for 10 minutes, remove the loaf from the pan, and cool completely before slicing or storing.  Store wrapped in plastic wrap or aluminum foil.

This recipe yields one 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  walnuts
  4                     apples -- peeled, cored
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     2/3           cup  plain soy yogurt
  2        tablespoons  prepared horseradish - (to 3) -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a non-stick skillet, place the walnuts, and cook over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes or until lightly toasted and fragrant.  Remove from pan and set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, grate the apples into a bowl, drizzle them with the lemon juice, and toss well to prevent the apples from turning brown.

When the walnuts are cool, place them in a blender or food processor, and finely grind them.  Add the walnuts and remaining ingredients to the grated apple and stir well to combine.  Taste, season with a little salt and pepper, and add more horseradish if desired.

Transfer the dip to a glass bowl.  Serve with crackers, chips, sliced bread, or an assortment of raw vegetables.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     narrow loaf Italian bread
  2               cups  black olives -- pitted
     1/3           cup  freshly-chopped basil
     1/4           cup  shallot -- diced
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  capers
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar - (to 2) -- to taste
  4                     garlic cloves

Begin by slicing the loaf of bread into 1/2-inch thick slices and transfer the slices to a cookie sheet.  Bake at 400 degrees for 3 to 4 minutes or until lightly browned, flip the slices over, and bake an additional 3 to 4 minutes or until lightly browned on the other side.  Allow to cool slightly.

Place the remaining ingredients in a food processor and process to a chunky puree.  Transfer to a small bowl or crock and serve on a platter with the crostini.

To store extra olivada, transfer to an airtight container, pour a thin layer of olive oil over the top, cover tightly, and store in the refrigerator for a month or more.

This recipe yields 1/2 cups olivada or serves 6 to 8 people.

Variation:  For an easy hors'doeuvre suggestion, spread the crostini with the olivada, and then decorate the tops with thinly sliced strips of roasted red pepper (store bought or see recipe), black olive slices, and basil leaves or parsley sprigs.

                        other finely diced dried fruit
     3/4           cup  dates -- pitted, diced
     1/3           cup  hot water
     1/2           cup  frozen apple juice concentrate -- thawed
     1/2           cup  maple syrup
  2          teaspoons  cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  1           teaspoon  almond extract

In a non-stick, 9- by 13-inch pan, place the oats and bake at 325 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes to toast to a golden brown.  Transfer the oats to a large bowl, add the cereal and raisins, and toss well to combine.

In a blender or food processor, place the dates and water; allow to sit 5 minutes, and then process for 2 to 3 minutes or until smooth.

Transfer the pureed dates to a saucepan and add the apple juice concentrate, maple syrup, and cinnamon.  Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and almond extract.  Pour the date mixture over the oat mixture and toss well to combine.

Pour the mixture into the same pan used to toast the oats, and place a piece of waxed paper on top of the mixture.  Use a can on top of the waxed paper to roll out the mixture evenly, and compress it firmly.  Bake at 325 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes or until lightly browned.  It will seem soft but will harden as it cools.

Allow it to cool for 10 minutes, cut into 24 bars, and transfer to a rack to cool completely.  Wrap them individually in aluminum foil, waxed paper, or plastic cling film, or store in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 24 bars.

Variation:  Substitute a mixture of dried fruits, nuts, or vegan chocolate chips for the raisins in the recipe.

                Vegan                           Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  eggplant
     1/2           cup  sliced mushrooms
     1/3           cup  diced seeded green pepper
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
     1/3           cup  sliced green onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts
  2        tablespoons  sliced black olives

Using a fork, prick the skin of the eggplant in a few places.  Place the eggplant on a non-stick cookie sheet and bake at 425 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes or until soft and starting to collapse.  Remove the cookie sheet from the oven and set aside to cool.

In a non-stick skillet, saute the mushrooms and green peppers in the olive oil for 5 minutes.  Add the green onion and garlic, and saute an additional 3 to 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.  Allow vegetables to cool for 5 minutes.

Carefully remove the stem, and cut the eggplant in half lengthwise.  Using a spoon, scrape the soft flesh of the eggplant into a food processor or blender.  Discard the skin of the eggplant.  Add the sauteed vegetables, along with the lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and blend until smooth.  Taste and add additional lemon juice, salt, or pepper, if needed.  Transfer the mixture to a small bowl.

Place the pine nuts on a cookie sheet and bake at 325 degrees for 3 to 5 minutes or until lightly toasted and fragrant.  Decorate the top of the eggplant caviar with the sliced olives and sprinkle with the toasted pine nuts.  Serve with your choice of vegetables, crackers, bread slices, or pitas.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 to 2 cups.

Serving Suggestion:  To make a Mediterranean Appetizer Platter, prepare one recipe each of: Eggplant Caviar, Roasted Red Pepper Strips, Zesty Garlic Marinated Olives, and Cumin Crisps.  Place the Eggplant Caviar, Roasted Red Pepper Strips, and Zesty Garlic Marinated Olives in decorative glass bowls.  Place the bowls in crescent pattern on a platter and arrange the Cumin Crisps in the remaining space on the platter.  Serves 4 to 6 people as an appetizer or as part of a buffet.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds
  3                     garlic cloves
  1              piece  ginger - (abt 1" long) -- sliced 4 pieces
  2             pounds  fresh spinach -- long stems left
                        intact and triple washed
  3        tablespoons  tahini
  1         tablespoon  tamari
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  unbleached cane sugar

In a non-stick skillet, place the sesame seeds and cook over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until fragrant and lightly toasted.  Remove them from the pan and set aside.

Fill a large pot half full with water, and add the cloves of garlic and ginger.  Bring the mixture to a boil, and allow to boil for 5 minutes.

Fill a large bowl with cold water and 2 cups ice cubes, and set aside.  Blanch the spinach, in batches, in the flavored boiling water for 1 minute.  Immediately transfer the spinach to the bowl of ice water and allow it to cool.

Remove 1 clove of garlic and 1 slice of ginger from the boiling water, set them aside, and either discard the remaining water or use it for soups or to cook with vegetables or grains.

Drain the spinach well, divide it into 3 equal portions, and straighten out the leaves of spinach.  Using a sushi mat or a large piece of waxed paper, form each portion into a long log, and pull back on the mat to tightly pack the leaves.  Cut each log into 1 1/2-inch pieces.  Place the spinach bundles cut-side up on a platter and sprinkle them with the reserved toasted sesame seeds.

In a blender or food processor, place the reserved garlic and ginger, the remaining ingredients, and process until smooth.  Transfer the mixture to a small bowl.  Serve the dipping sauce alongside the emerald bundles.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  1            package  semi-sweet chocolate chips - (12 oz)
     1/4           cup  Spectrum Naturals Spread
                        = (or non-hydrogenated spreadable

In a bowl, stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

In a food processor or blender puree the bananas and continue to process for 2 minutes to make them light and fluffy.  Add pureed bananas and vanilla to the dry ingredients and stir well.  Add melted chocolate chip mixture and stir until batter is very smooth and then fold in chopped walnuts.

Grease the bottom only of a 13- by 9-inch pan, pour in batter, and bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes or until center is set.  Allow to cool completely before cutting in desired size pieces.

This recipe yields one 13- by 9-inch pan.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  unbleached flour
     1/4           cup  unbleached cane sugar
                        = (or white sugar from sugar beets)
  2        tablespoons  arrowroot
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1            package  dry active yeast - (1/4 oz)
     1/2           cup  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
     1/3           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  vegan margarine
  1         tablespoon  liquid lecithin
     1/3           cup  freshly-chopped basil
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
                        additional for pans and roll tops

In a large bowl, place the flour, sugar, arrowroot, salt, and yeast, and stir well to combine.

In a small saucepan, place the soy milk, water, and margarine, and cook the mixture over low heat until it reaches 120 degrees.  Add the soy milk mixture and lecithin to the dry ingredients and stir well to form dough into a ball.

Turn the dough out on to a floured work surface, and knead the dough for 5 to 7 minutes or until smooth and elastic.  Place the mixing bowl over the ball of dough to cover, and allow it to rest for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together the remaining ingredients and set aside.  Using a little olive oil, lightly oil (or mist with oil) two non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.

After the dough has rested, divide it in half and roll out each half to form a 9-inch circle.  Divide the herb mixture evenly between the two circles of dough and spread it to form a 2-inch wide ring around the outer edge of each circle of dough.  Cut each dough circle into 8 wedges.

To shape the crescents:  Starting at the outer edge, roll up each wedge of dough towards the point end, and press slightly on the point to seal edge.  Transfer the rolled up wedge, placing the sealed point end down, onto one of the prepared cookie sheets and curve the ends of the roll to form a "U" shape.  Repeat the rolling and shaping procedure for the remaining wedges of dough, placing 8 crescents on each prepared cookie sheet.

Lightly brush the tops of the crescents with a little olive oil, cover the cookie sheets, and place the shaped crescents in the refrigerator for 2 to 24 hours or until ready to bake.

When ready to bake, carefully uncover the crescents and allow them to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes prior to baking.  Bake the crescents at 400 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.

This recipe yields 16 rolls.

Transfer the rolled up wedge, placing the sealed point end down, onto one of the prepared cookie sheets and curve the ends of the roll to form a &quot;U&quot; shape.  Repeat the rolling and shaping procedure for the remaining wedges of dough, placing 8 crescents on each prepared cookie sheet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly brush the tops of the crescents with a little olive oil, cover the cookie sheets, and place the shaped crescents in the refrigerator for 2 to 24 hours or until ready to bake.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to bake, carefully uncover the crescents and allow them to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes prior to baking.  Bake the crescents at 400 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RUGELACH DOUGH ===
  3               cups  unbleached flour
     3/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  12            ounces  vegan cream cheese
     3/4           cup  Spectrum Spread non-hydrogenated margarine
  3        tablespoons  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
                        === FILLINGS ===
  1 1/3           cups  walnuts, pecans, or
                        other nuts of choice -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  dried apricots -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  dried cranberries or dried cherries -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  raisins -- finely chopped
  1                cup  Sucanat -- divided
  3          teaspoons  cinnamon -- divided
                        Veganized Powdered Sugar -- (see recipe)

Begin by preparing the rugelach dough.  In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cinnamon, and salt, and set aside.

In a food processor or upright mixer, combine the vegan cream cheese, Spectrum Spread, soy milk, and almond extract, and process for 1 to 2 minutes or until light and creamy.

Add the flour mixture, pulse a few times or until the dough comes together to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the container.

Divide the dough into thirds and wrap each in a piece of plastic cling film.  Place the dough into the refrigerator to chill for 4 hours.

While the dough is chilling, prepare the fillings.  Divide the chopped nuts evenly among 3 small bowls.  Place the chopped dried apricots in one bowl, the chopped dried cranberries in another, and the chopped raisins in the third.  Add 1/3 cups of Sucanat and 1 teaspoon cinnamon to each of the bowls.  Stir together the contents of each of the bowls and set them aside separately.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) 3 non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.  After the dough has chilled for 4 hours, begin by working with one portion of the dough at a time.

On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough to form a 12-inch circle.  Sprinkle the dough with all of the reserved dried apricot mixture and press down lightly on the filling to help it stick to the dough.  Using a pastry wheel, pizza cutter, or sharp knife, cut the dough circle into 16 wedges.

Beginning at the outer edge, roll up each wedge tightly toward the point, and transfer them to one of the prepared cookie sheets.  Make sure that the points of the wedges are tucked under and cover them with a clean towel or piece of plastic cling film.  Place the cookie sheet in the refrigerator to chill while you assemble the remaining rugelach.

Repeat the rolling out and filling procedure for the remaining portions of dough and filling.  Place each of the assembled rugelach on separate cookie sheets, cover, and chill them in the same manner as those with the apricot filling.

Bake two cookie sheets at a time at 350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown.  Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.  Repeat the baking procedure for the remaining cookie sheet of cookies.

When all of the cookies are cooled completely, dust them lightly with a little of the Veganized Powdered Sugar.  Store the cookies in an airtight container with waxed paper between the layers.

This recipe yields 48 assorted cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     eggplants -- washed
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
  2               cups  water
  1 1/4           cups  white wine vinegar -- divided
     1/2           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
     1/3           cup  freshly-chopped rosemary
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped thyme
     1/4           cup  thinly sliced garlic
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1                cup  olive oil

Begin by cutting the eggplants into 1/4-inch thick slices and cut each slice into 1/4-inch thick strips.  Place the eggplant strips in a colander and sprinkle with coarse salt.  Place a plate on top of the eggplant, place the colander in the sink, place a few heavy cans on top of the plate, and leave the eggplant to drain for 1 hour.

Using your hands, squeeze the eggplant to remove as much of the bitter juices as possible.  In a large pot, combine the eggplant, water, and 1 cup vinegar, and bring to a boil.  As soon as it boils, remove from heat, set aside, and allow the eggplant to cool in the liquid.

Using your hands, squeeze the eggplant to remove as much of the cooking liquid as possible.  Transfer the eggplant to a bowl.  Add the herbs, garlic, and pepper flakes, and toss gently.  Add the remaining vinegar and olive oil, and toss gently to combine.

Sterilize four 8-ounce jars and their lids by boiling them in a large pot of water for 15 minutes.  Using tongs, remove the jars and lids from the water and place on a dry surface.

Evenly divide the eggplant mixture among the four jars.  Pour extra olive oil on top to ensure that they are thoroughly immersed.  Wipe clean the rims of the jars and seal with their lids.  Label and date the jars.

Place the jars in the refrigerator and allow to marinate for several weeks before using.  Store in the refrigerator and add additional olive oil to the jar after each use as needed.  Serve as part of an antipasto platter, add to salads or sandwiches, or on bread.

This recipe yields four 8-ounce jars.

     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/3           cup  vegan margarine
     1/4           cup  maple syrup
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
                        Safflower oil -- for cookie sheets

In a blender or food processor, place the pecans, and pulse a few times to roughly chop.  Transfer 1/3 cup of the chopped pecans to a small bowl and set aside.

Add the oats to the remaining pecans in the blender and process for 30 to 60 seconds to finely grind them together.  Add the flour, maple sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon, pulse a few times to combine, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, place the margarine, maple syrup, vanilla, and almond extract, and stir the mixture until smooth.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir well to combine.  Add the reserved chopped pecans and fold gently to incorporate them.  Cover the bowl of dough, place it in the refrigerator, and chill the dough for 30 minutes or more.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or mist with oil) two non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.

Transfer the chilled dough to a lightly floured work surface.  Roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thickness and cut into 2-inch squares or diamonds or into desired shapes with small cookie cutters.  Using a fork, gently poke the surface of each cut cookie a few times.

Working in batches, carefully transfer the cut cookies to the prepared cookie sheets.  Bake at 325 degrees for 15 to 18 minutes or until lightly browned on the bottom.  Allow the shortbread to cool on the cookie sheets for 3 minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.

Repeat the baking procedure for the remaining cut cookies.  Store the cookies in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 4 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        recipe  Whole Wheat Calzone Dough -- (see recipe)
     3/4           cup  onion -- diced
     3/4           cup  diced seeded green peppers
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  sliced halved mushrooms
     1/2           cup  sliced lengthwise-quartered zucchini
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     3/4           cup  cooked chickpeas
     1/2           cup  tomato sauce
  1         tablespoon  nutritional yeast flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare the Whole Wheat Calzone Dough according to the recipe instructions through the rolling out procedures.  Cover the 4 rolled out calzones with a clean towel so that they won't dry out while preparing the filling.

In a non-stick skillet, saute the onion and green pepper in the olive oil for 2 minutes to soften.  Add the mushrooms, zucchini, and garlic, and saute the mixture an additional 3 minutes.  Add the remaining ingredients, season the mixture to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper, reduce the heat to low, and simmer the mixture for 2 minutes to blend the flavors.  Remove the skillet from the heat, set aside, and allow the mixture to cool slightly.

Divide the filling evenly among the rolled out calzones, placing it on one half of each circle of dough and leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge.  Brush a little water around the edge of each circle of dough.  Fold the dough over to enclose the filling, crimp the edges closed with your fingers, and then fold up the edges 1/2 inch to form a decorative border.

Transfer the filled calzones to a non-stick cookie sheet and bake at 450 degrees for 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Allow the calzones to cool for a few minutes before serving.  Can be served warm, cold, or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 calzones.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (at least 110
                        degrees)
  2               cups  unbleached flour
  2        tablespoons  Sucanat
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2        tablespoons  safflower oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  finely-diced zucchini
     1/3           cup  finely-diced seeded red chiles
     1/2           cup  cut corn
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
  1         tablespoon  mellow miso
  1         tablespoon  seasoned rice wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce)
                        Cabbage leaves -- for steaming

In a large bowl, stir together the yeast and warm water, and set aside until frothy about 10 minutes.  Add the flour, Sucanat, and 1 tablespoon olive oil, and stir well to combine.  If the dough seems a little dry, add an additional 1 to 2 tablespoon water, and form into a dough with your hands.

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes or until smooth and elastic.  Lightly grease the bowl used to mix the dough with the remaining olive oil.  Form the kneaded dough into a ball and roll the dough around in the greased bowl to oil all sides.  Cover the bowl with a damp towel, place in a warm place, and leave to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

While the dough is rising, prepare the filling.  In a wok or non-stick skillet, heat the safflower oil, and when hot add the garlic and saute for 1 minute.  Add the zucchini and red chiles and saute an additional 2 minutes.  Add the corn and green onions and saute an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until vegetables are tender.

In a small bowl, place the miso, rice wine vinegar, and tamari, and stir well to combine.  Add the miso mixture to the vegetables, stir well to combine, remove pan from the heat, and set aside to allow the filling to cool.

When the dumpling dough is doubled in bulk, punch down the dough, reform it into a ball, cover with a damp towel, and leave to rest for 15 minutes.  On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a 12-inch long log, cut the log in half, and cut each half of the log into 12 pieces, thus yielding 24 equal size pieces.

To form each of the dumplings, roll out each piece of dough into a 3-inch circle.  Place 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center of each circle of dough, gather up the edge of the dough to form a point, pinch the edges together, and give them a twist to seal.  Repeat the shaping procedure for the remaining dumplings.

Transfer the shaped dumplings to a cookie sheet, cover with a damp towel, place in a warm place, and leave them to rise for 15 minutes or until they are light and puffy.

Line the bottom of a steamer basket with a few cabbage leaves.  Place the dumplings on top of the cabbage leaves, leaving ample room between them.  Steam the dumplings, in batches, for 10 to 12 minutes or until the tops appear smooth.  Serve them warm.

This recipe yields 24 dumplings.

In a large bowl, stir together the yeast and warm water, and set aside until frothy about 10 minutes.  Add the flour, Sucanat, and 1 tablespoon olive oil, and stir well to combine.  If the dough seems a little dry, add an additional 1 to 2 tablespoon water, and form into a dough with your hands.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes or until smooth and elastic.  Lightly grease the bowl used to mix the dough with the remaining olive oil.  Form the kneaded dough into a ball and roll the dough around in the greased bowl to oil all sides.  Cover the bowl with a damp towel, place in a warm place, and leave to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the dough is rising, prepare the filling.  In a wok or non-stick skillet, heat the safflower oil, and when hot add the garlic and saute for 1 minute.  Add the zucchini and red chiles and saute an additional 2 minutes.  Add the corn and green onions and saute an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, place the miso, rice wine vinegar, and tamari, and stir well to combine.  Add the miso mixture to the vegetables, stir well to combine, remove pan from the heat, and set aside to allow the filling to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the dumpling dough is doubled in bulk, punch down the dough, reform it into a ball, cover with a damp towel, and leave to rest for 15 minutes.  On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a 12-inch long log, cut the log in half, and cut each half of the log into 12 pieces, thus yielding 24 equal size pieces.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To form each of the dumplings, roll out each piece of dough into a 3-inch circle.  Place 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center of each circle of dough, gather up the edge of the dough to form a point, pinch the edges together, and give them a twist to seal.  Repeat the shaping procedure for the remaining dumplings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the shaped dumplings to a cookie sheet, cover with a damp towel, place in a warm place, and leave them to rise for 15 minutes or until they are light and puffy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Line the bottom of a steamer basket with a few cabbage leaves.  Place the dumplings on top of the cabbage leaves, leaving ample room between them.  Steam the dumplings, in batches, for 10 to 12 minutes or until the tops appear smooth.  Serve them warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 24 dumplings.

     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  Ener-G Egg Replacer
  1                cup  unbleached cane sugar
                        = (or white sugar from sugar beets)
     2/3           cup  vegan margarine
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  peppermint extract
  2                     Tropical Source Mint Candy Crunch
                        Dairy Free Chocolate Bars - (85g ea) -- roughly chopped
     1/3           cup  vegan peppermint candies -- roughly chopped
                        = (or vegan candy canes)
                        Safflower oil -- for cookie sheets

In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, and salt, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the water and egg replacer for 1 minute or until very frothy.  Add the sugar, margarine, vanilla, and peppermint extract, and stir the mixture until smooth and creamy.

Add the dry ingredients and stir well to combine.  Add the chopped chocolate bars and peppermint candy and fold gently to incorporate them into the dough.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or mist with oil) two non-stick cookie sheets.  Working in batches, drop the cookie dough by rounded teaspoonfuls on to the prepared cookie sheets, spacing them 2 inches apart.

Bake the cookies at 375 degrees for 6 to 8 minutes for a soft-batch type of cookie (they will be just set but soft to the touch) or 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown around the edges for a crisp cookie.

Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheets for 3 minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.  Repeat the portioning and baking procedure for the remaining cookie dough.  Store the cookies in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 4 dozen.

  8             ounces  red pepper -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and cut in half lengthwise
  8             ounces  yellow pepper -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and cut in half lengthwise
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
  12             whole  black peppercorns
  8                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  4             sprigs  fresh basil
  4             sprigs  fresh marjoram or oregano
                        Olive oil -- as needed

Begin by cutting the peppers into 1-inch strips and pat dry the strips with a towel.  Place the pepper strips in a colander, sprinkle them with coarse salt, and place the colander over a bowl.  Allow the peppers to drain overnight.  Using a towel, wipe the salt from the peppers, and set aside.

Sterilize four 8-ounce jars and their lids by boiling them in a large pot of water for 15 minutes.  Using tongs, remove the jars and lids from the water, and set them on a dry surface.

In each jar, place 3 peppercorns, 2 garlic cloves, 1 sprig of basil, and 1 sprig of marjoram.  Evenly divide the pepper strips among the jars and completely cover with olive oil.  Wipe clean the rims of the jars and seal with their lids.  Label and date the jars.  Keep in a cool place or in the refrigerator for several months.

Serve a part of an antipasto platter, add to salads or sandwiches, and the oil can also be used to flavor dressings or drizzle on bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  cubed (1") peeled potatoes
                        Water -- as needed
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  unbleached sugar -- divided
     1/2           cup  soy milk
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  safflower oil -- plus
                        additional for oiling the bowl
  2          teaspoons  salt
  3               cups  unbleached flour - (to 3 1/2) -- plus
                        additional for dusting

In a saucepan, place the potatoes, cover with water, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender.  Reserve 1/4 cups cooking liquid and drain the potatoes.  Mash the potatoes until smooth with a potato masher and set aside.  Cool the reserved cooking liquid to 110 degrees.

In a food processor or mixer, place the reserved cooking liquid, yeast, and a pinch of sugar, and pulse a few times to combine.  Allow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes or until foamy.

In a small measuring cup, stir together the soy milk and lemon juice, and set aside for 10 minutes to thicken.  Add the remaining sugar, reserved mashed potatoes, thickened soy milk mixture, 2 tablespoon oil, and salt, and pulse a few times to combine.  While the machine is running, gradually add the flour and continue to mix until it forms a ball.

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead in additional flour to form a soft dough that is smooth and elastic, about 2 to 3 minutes.

Drizzle a little safflower oil into a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, roll the dough around in the bowl to evenly coat it with the oil, and cover with a towel.  Place the bowl in a warm place and allow the dough to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) two non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.

When dough has doubled, turn it out onto a floured work surface.  Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough into an 8-inch square and to 3/4-inch thickness.  Cut the dough into 2-inch wide strips, then cut each of the strips into 4 triangle shapes, thus yielding 16 pieces.

Place the triangles on the prepared cookie sheets and space them 1 1/2 inches apart.  Brush the tops of the rolls with the remaining oil.  Spray a piece of plastic wrap with a light mist of oil, cover the rolls with the oiled piece of plastic wrap, and leave to rise for 15 minutes.

Remove the piece of plastic wrap and discard.  Bake at 375 degrees for 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 16 rolls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  pecan halves
  2               cups  whole-wheat pastry flour - (to 2 1/2)
     3/4           cup  unbleached cane sugar -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  1 1/4      teaspoons  cinnamon -- divided
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  water or apple juice
     1/3           cup  safflower oil
  1                cup  pumpkin puree -- fresh or canned
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg

Place the pecans on a cookie sheet and bake at 325 degrees for 5 to 7 minutes or until lightly toasted and fragrant.  Allow the pecans to cool completely, then finely chop them, and set them aside.

In a bowl, sift together 2 cups flour, 1/4 cups sugar, baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and salt.  In a small measuring cup, whisk together the water and oil.  Using your fingers, mix the water-oil mixture into the flour mixture, adding additional flour as needed to form a soft ball of dough.  Cover and set aside for 10 minutes to allow the dough to rest.

In a small bowl, stir together the pumpkin puree, remaining 1/2 cups sugar, remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and nutmeg, and set aside.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) a non-stick cookie sheet and set aside.

Transfer the rested dough to a floured work surface, roll it out to 1/16-inch thickness, and cut the dough into 24 3-inch circles or squares.

To shape each pastry:  Place a rounded teaspoonful of the filling on one half of each circle (or square).  Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon reserved chopped pecans over the filling, fold the other half of the dough over the filling to enclose it, gently press the edges together with your fingers, and then go around the edges with a fork to seal them together.  Repeat the assembly procedure for the remaining circles of dough.

Using a spatula, transfer the filled pastries to the prepared cookie sheet.  Bake at 375 degrees for 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Allow the pastries to cool on the cookie sheet for several minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.  Store in an airtight container when completely cool.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PUMPKIN BAR BASE ===
  2        tablespoons  flaxseeds
     1/3           cup  water
  1                cup  soy milk
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
     1/2           cup  canned pumpkin puree
     1/4           cup  safflower oil
  1 1/2       teaspoon  vanilla
  1                cup  unbleached flour
     3/4           cup  whole-wheat pastry flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
     2/3           cup  dates -- pitted, diced
  1                cup  Sucanat
                        === FROSTING ===
  1 1/4           cups  Sucanat
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  maple syrup
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/3           cup  pecans -- toasted, chopped

Begin by preparing the pumpkin bar base:  In a blender or food processor, place the flaxseeds and grind to a fine powder.  Add the water and blend for 1 minute.  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and set aside for 10 minutes.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the soy milk and lemon juice, and set aside for 10 minutes to thicken.  Add the canned pumpkin, oil, and vanilla to the soy milk mixture, whisk well to combine, and set aside.

In another medium bowl, sift together both types of flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger, and nutmeg.  Add the chopped dates and toss gently to coat them with the flour mixture.

Using an electric hand mixer, beat the Sucanat into the reserved flaxseed mixture, and continue to beat over high speed for 3 to 5 minutes or until light and fluffy.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a plastic spatula, then fold in 1/2 of the dry ingredients, followed by all of the wet ingredients, and then the remaining dry ingredients, and stir until well combined and free of lumps.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) a 9- by 13-inch baking pan.  Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.  Place on a rack to cool completely.

While the pumpkin bar base is cooling, prepare the frosting:  In a blender or food processor, place the Sucanat and cornstarch, and blend for 1 minute.  Scrape down the sides and blend an additional 30 seconds.  Transfer this "powdered sugar" to a bowl.  Add the maple syrup and vanilla, and whisk well to form a smooth frosting.

Spread the frosting over the cooled pumpkin bars, sprinkle with the chopped pecans, and chill for 5 to 10 minutes to set the frosting.  Remove the pan from the refrigerator and cut the pan into 24 equal bars.  Store in an airtight container with waxed paper between the layers.

This recipe yields one 9- by 13-inch pan or 24 bars.

                        additional for tops of braids
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
     1/4           cup  safflower oil
  3        tablespoons  maple syrup
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  3               cups  whole-wheat flour
  1                cup  unbleached flour
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        Safflower oil -- as needed

Place the pecans on a cookie sheet and bake at 325 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes or until toasted and fragrant.  Allow the pecans to cool, roughly chop them, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, place the warm water and yeast, stir to dissolve the yeast and let sit for 10 minutes or until foamy.  Add the pumpkin puree, soy milk, oil, maple syrup, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and stir well to combine.

In a large bowl, stir together both types of flour, cornmeal, and salt.  Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, along with the reserved pecans, and using your hands, mix thoroughly to form a soft dough.

Transfer the dough to a lightly-floured work surface.  Knead for 8 to 10 minutes, adding additional flour as needed, to form a dough that is smooth and elastic.  Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil the mixing bowl, and roll the ball of dough around the inside of the bowl to thoroughly coat it with the oil.  Cover and place it in a warm place to rise for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in bulk.

Punch dough the dough and turn it out onto a floured work surface.  Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces.  Using your fingers, roll each piece into a long 1-inch-thick coil.

To assemble each of the braids:  Braid 3 of the coils together and pinch the ends together.  Sprinkle a non-stick cookie sheet with a little additional flour.  Transfer the braids to the floured cookie sheet, tucking the ends of the braids under slightly.  Cover and place them in a warm place to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

Remove the cover from the braids and brush the tops with a little soy milk.  Bake at 350 degrees for 40 to 50 minutes or until golden brown and the braids sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.  Transfer the braids to a rack to cool completely.

This recipe yields 2 braided loaves.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unbleached flour
  3        tablespoons  cocoa powder
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  Ener-G Egg Replacer
     3/4           cup  unbleached cane sugar
     1/4           cup  Spectrum Spread non-hydrogenated margarine
  1         tablespoon  brown rice syrup
  2          teaspoons  vanilla

In a small bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, place the water and egg replacer, and whisk vigorously for 1 minute or until very frothy (almost like beaten egg whites).  Add the sugar, Spectrum Spread, brown rice syrup, and vanilla, and beat until light and fluffy.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir well to combine.

Form the dough into a log 1 inch in diameter and 9 inches long, wrap the dough log in a piece of plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to chill overnight.  Or, place the dough in the freezer, and keep on hand for impromptu baking.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) two non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.  Cut the chilled dough into 1/4-inch thick slices and place them 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets.

Bake at 375 degrees for 10 minutes or until set and lightly browned on the bottom.  Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheets for several minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool.

Repeat the baking procedure for the remaining cookie dough.  When cookies have cooled completely, store them in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 3 dozen.

  2                     red peppers -- washed well

Place the whole peppers on a broiler pan.  Broil, turning often, until blackened on all sides, or blacken over an open flame.  Place the blackened peppers in a paper bag, close the bag, and set aside for 15 minutes or until cool enough to handle.

Peel the blackened skin off of the peppers, and discard the stems and seeds.  Cut the peppers in half and then cut them into 1/2-inch strips.

Serve as an appetizer, as part of an antipasto platter, on sandwiches, to flavor sauces and dressings, or in grains, side or main dishes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  shallot -- peeled
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped thyme
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  3        tablespoons  unbleached flour
  2 1/2           cups  vegetable stock
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry
  2        tablespoons  nutritional yeast flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

In a piece of aluminum foil, place the shallot and garlic cloves, sprinkle the fresh thyme over the top, and drizzle with a little olive oil.  Gather up the corners of the aluminum foil to enclose the shallot and garlic, and place the packet in a pie pan.

Bake at 375 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until the shallot is soft when gently squeezed.  Remove the pie pan from the oven and allow the contents of the foil packet to cool for 5 minutes.

Transfer the contents of the foil packet to a blender or food processor, sprinkle the flour over the top, and process for 1 minute.  Add the remaining ingredients and blend for an additional 1 to 2 minutes to thoroughly combine.

Transfer the mixture to a small saucepan.  Cook over medium heat while whisking constantly until the gravy thickens.  Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.  Serve on top of your favorite vegetables, mashed potatoes, biscuits, or main dishes.

This recipe yields 3 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  pine nuts
  3               cups  stemmed fresh parsley
  1 1/2           cups  stemmed fresh rosemary
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled
     2/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

In a non-stick skillet, toast the pine nuts until lightly browned and fragrant, and set aside to cool.

In a food processor or blender, combine the toasted pine nuts, parsley, rosemary, and garlic, and pulse a few times to finely chop all of the ingredients.  While the machine is running, drizzle in the olive oil, and continue to process until it forms a smooth puree.

Sterilize three 8-ounce jars and their lids by boiling them in a large pot of water for 15 minutes.  Using tongs, remove the jars and lids from the water, and set them on a dry surface.

Evenly divide the pistou among the three jars.  Pour a thin layer of additional olive oil over the top of the pistou to prevent the formation of mold.  Wipe clean the rims of the jars and seal with their lids.  Label and date the jars.  Store in the refrigerator or freezer for several months.

Pour a thin layer of olive oil over the top of the pistou after each use.  Use to flavor soups, pasta, grains, potatoes, salad dressings, or spread on bread.

This recipe yields three 8-ounces jars.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  warm water
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  1           teaspoon  unbleached cane sugar
                        = (or white sugar from sugar beets)
  3               cups  unbleached flour - (to 3 1/2)
  1           teaspoon  salt -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- divided
     1/4           cup  cornmeal -- divided
                        Olive oil -- for focaccia, and
                        for oiling bowl
  1                cup  thinly-sliced shallots
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced garlic
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped rosemary
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2        tablespoons  vegan soy parmesan cheese
                        = (or nutritional yeast flakes)

In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar.  Stir to dissolve the yeast and sugar, and set aside until bubbly, about 10 to 15 minutes.

In a large bowl, combine 3 cups flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and stir well to combine.  Add the yeast mixture and stir well to form a soft dough.  Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead, adding additional flour if needed, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.

Place a little olive oil in the large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, give it a twist, and turn the ball over to coat the other side.  Cover, place the bowl in a warm place, and leave to rise for 1 hour or until doubled.

Using a little olive oil, lightly oil a 15 1/2- by 10 1/2-inch pan, sprinkle with 3 tablespoons cornmeal, and set aside.

When the dough has doubled, punch it down and transfer it to a floured work surface.  Knead the dough a few times.  Sprinkle the work surface with the remaining cornmeal and roll the dough in it to coat the surface.

Transfer dough to the oiled pan, and stretch it, as needed, to fit the pan.  Using your fingertips, make "dimples" across the top of the dough.  Brush a little olive oil over the top of the dough, then sprinkle with the sliced shallots, garlic, chopped parsley and rosemary, remaining salt and black pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes.  Allow to rise uncovered for 45 minutes.

After the focaccia is well-risen, sprinkle the vegan soy parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast over the entire focaccia.  Bake at 425 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until slightly golden brown.  Transfer the focaccia to a rack to cool.  Serve warm or at room temperature, and cut as desired.

This recipe yields one 15 1/2- by 10 1/2-inch focaccia.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  water -- plus
  1         tablespoon  water -- divided
     1/4           cup  maple syrup -- divided
     3/4           cup  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
  2        tablespoons  safflower oil
  1 1/2           cups  rolled oats -- divided
  3               cups  unbleached flour - (to 3 1/2) -- divided
  1            package  rapid rise active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        Safflower oil -- as needed

In a small bowl, place 1 tablespoon water and 1 tablespoon maple syrup, stir well to combine, and set aside for glazing the pretzels.

In a small saucepan, combine the remaining water and soy milk, and warm to 120 degrees over low heat.  Remove the pan from the heat, add the remaining maple syrup and safflower oil, and stir well to combine.

Place 1/4 cups rolled oats in a small bowl and set aside for topping the pretzels.  In a large bowl, place the remaining rolled oats, 2 1/2 cups flour, yeast, and salt, and stir well to combine.  Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients, stir well, and add enough of the remaining 1 cup of flour as needed to make a soft dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl to form a ball.

Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface.  Knead for 5 minutes, adding additional flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Place the mixing bowl over the top of the dough to cover, and leave to rest for 15 minutes.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) two non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.

After the dough has rested, divide it into 24 equal pieces.  Using your hands, roll each piece of dough into a 12-inch long rope.  Transfer the rope of dough to the prepared cookie sheet.  To form it in to a "pretzel" shape, take each end between your thumb and forefinger, draw them up towards the center (sort of like making a circle), cross one end over the other, continue to pull the ends through until you reach the bottom of the circle, and slightly press on the ends to stick.

The dough can also be shaped into numbers, letters, or other shapes of choice.  Repeat the shaping procedure, as desired, for the remaining pieces of dough.  Cover the shaped pretzels with a clean towel and leave to rise for 15 minutes.

Brush the tops of each pretzel with some of the reserved maple syrup/water mixture and then sprinkle with the reserved rolled oats.  Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Allow to cool on the cookie sheets for 5 minutes and then transfer to a rack to cool completely.  Store in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

In a small bowl, place 1 tablespoon water and 1 tablespoon maple syrup, stir well to combine, and set aside for glazing the pretzels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small saucepan, combine the remaining water and soy milk, and warm to 120 degrees over low heat.  Remove the pan from the heat, add the remaining maple syrup and safflower oil, and stir well to combine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 1/4 cups rolled oats in a small bowl and set aside for topping the pretzels.  In a large bowl, place the remaining rolled oats, 2 1/2 cups flour, yeast, and salt, and stir well to combine.  Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients, stir well, and add enough of the remaining 1 cup of flour as needed to make a soft dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl to form a ball.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface.  Knead for 5 minutes, adding additional flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Place the mixing bowl over the top of the dough to cover, and leave to rest for 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) two non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
After the dough has rested, divide it into 24 equal pieces.  Using your hands, roll each piece of dough into a 12-inch long rope.  Transfer the rope of dough to the prepared cookie sheet.  To form it in to a &quot;pretzel&quot; shape, take each end between your thumb and forefinger, draw them up towards the center (sort of like making a circle), cross one end over the other, continue to pull the ends through until you reach the bottom of the circle, and slightly press on the ends to stick.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The dough can also be shaped into numbers, letters, or other shapes of choice.  Repeat the shaping procedure, as desired, for the remaining pieces of dough.  Cover the shaped pretzels with a clean towel and leave to rise for 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush the tops of each pretzel with some of the reserved maple syrup/water mixture and then sprinkle with the reserved rolled oats.  Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Allow to cool on the cookie sheets for 5 minutes and then transfer to a rack to cool completely.  Store in an airtight container.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  whole-wheat pastry flour
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  Ener-G Egg Replacer
     2/3           cup  unbleached cane sugar
     1/2           cup  Sucanat
     1/4           cup  safflower oil
     1/4           cup  soy nut butter
  2        tablespoons  brown rice syrup
  1         tablespoon  vanilla

In a bowl, sift together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and baking soda, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the water and egg replacer, and whisk vigorously for 1 to 2 minutes or until very frothy (almost like beaten egg whites).

Place 2 tablespoons unbleached cane sugar in a small bowl and set aside.  Add the remaining sugar, along with the remaining ingredients, to the egg replacer mixture, and stir well to blend thoroughly.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir well to combine.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) two non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.

Shape the dough into forty-eight 1-inch balls and roll them in the reserved sugar.  Transfer 12 balls to each of the prepared cookie sheets and space them at least 2 inches apart.  Using a small glass, slightly flatten each of the balls of dough.

Bake at 375 degrees for 6 to 7 minutes or until lightly browned on the bottom.  Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheets for several minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.

Repeat the shaping and baking procedure for the remaining balls of dough.  When the cookies have cooled completely, transfer them to an airtight container for storage.

This recipe yields 4 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16             large  button mushrooms -- washed well
                        = (or other mushrooms of choice)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  8             ounces  firm tofu -- frozen, and thawed
     1/4           cup  finely-diced onion
     1/4           cup  finely-diced celery
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/3           cup  breadcrumbs
  2        tablespoons  nutritional yeast flakes
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Lightly oil (or spray with vegetable oil) a large baking dish and set aside.

Remove the stems from the mushrooms, roughly dice the stems, and set aside.

In a non-stick skillet, place 1 tablespoon olive oil and the mushroom caps, and saute for 2 minutes per side.  Remove the mushroom caps from the skillet, transfer to a large plate, and set aside.

Using your fingers, crumble the thawed tofu into a small bowl and set aside.

In the same non-stick skillet, saute the reserved mushroom stems, onion, celery, and green onion in the remaining olive oil, for 5 minutes to soften.  Add the crumbled tofu, garlic, and thyme, and saute an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.

Remove the skillet from the heat, add the remaining ingredients, stir well to combine, and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

Fill the mushroom caps with warm filling, slightly mounding the tops, and place them in the prepared baking dish.  Bake at 350 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes or until the mushroom caps are heated through and slightly browned on top.  Transfer to a decorative platter for service and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 16 stuffed mushrooms or 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  unbleached cane sugar -- divided
                        = (or white sugar from sugar beets)
  1 1/4      teaspoons  cinnamon -- divided
     1/2           cup  Sucanat
                        = (or brown sugar from sugar beets)
     1/4           cup  apple sauce
     1/4           cup  safflower oil -- plus
                        additional for oiling cookie sheets
  1         tablespoon  molasses
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached flour
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  Ener-G Egg Replacer
  1 3/4      teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

In a small bowl, place 2 1/2 tablespoons unbleached cane sugar and 1/4 tablespoon cinnamon, stir well to combine, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, place the remaining unbleached cane sugar, Sucanat, apple sauce, safflower oil, molasses, and vanilla, and stir well to combine.

In a small bowl, sift together the remaining ingredients and remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir well to combine.  Cover and chill the dough for 1 hour.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or spray with a fine mist of oil) two non-stick cookie sheets.  Using your hands, roll the dough into 48 one-inch balls.

Working in batches, roll the balls in the cinnamon sugar mixture to thoroughly coat them on all sides, and place them on the non-stick cookie sheets.  Flatten the cookies slightly with the bottom of a glass, dipping it in the cinnamon sugar mixture to prevent sticking.

Bake at 375 degrees for 7 minutes, they will feel slightly soft when removed from the oven.  Allow the cookies to cool for 2 minutes on the cookie sheets and then transfer them to a rack to cool completely.

Repeat the rolling, flattening, and baking procedure for the remaining balls of dough.  Store the cookies in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 4 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry or quick rise yeast
  3        tablespoons  unbleached cane sugar
  1 1/4           cups  warm water
  8                     sun-dried tomatoes -- snipped into small
                        bits with scissors
  4               cups  unbleached flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  dried basil
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
  1 1/2      teaspoons  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  dried parsley
     1/2           cup  black olives -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Cornmeal -- as needed

In a small bowl, stir together yeast and sugar.  Pour warm water over the yeast and set aside for 10 minutes or until very foamy.

Meanwhile place sun-dried tomatoes in a small bowl, cover with hot water, and set aside to rehydrate for 10 minutes.

In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and herbs.  When the yeast mixture is foamy, add it, the rehydrated sun-dried tomatoes, and the remaining ingredients to the flour mixture.  Stir well with a spoon, and use your hands to form into a ball of dough.

Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Place a little olive oil in a bowl, give dough a twist in the bowl, turn over so the greased side is on top, cover, and leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled.

Punch dough down and knead for a minute on a floured surface.  Roll dough into a large rectangle.  Starting on the shorter side of the rectangle, roll dough up like a jelly roll cake, tuck in the ends, and pinch the seam to seal.

Sprinkle a little cornmeal on to a cookie sheet.  Place shaped loaf, seam-side down, on the cookie sheet, cover, and leave to rise in a warm place for 45 minutes or until doubled.

Using a sharp knife, carefully cut a few diagonal slashes over the top of the loaf.  Bake at 425 degrees for 25 yo 30 minutes or until golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.  Allow to cool before cutting.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to one month.  Use as an accompaniment on sandwiches or use in place of store bought mustard in your favorite recipes.

This recipe yields 1 1/3 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  Roma tomatoes -- stemmed, and
                        cut in half lengthwise
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  4             sprigs  fresh basil - (to 5)
  4             sprigs  fresh rosemary - (ea 2" long)
                        Olive oil -- as needed

To dry in a dehydrator, begin by placing the halved tomatoes cut-side up on the racks.  Stack the racks and leave to dry for 2 to 3 hours.  The tomatoes will feel dry and will darken in color.  They should not be brittle or crisp.

To oven-dry the tomatoes, begin by lining a large cookie sheet with aluminum foil, and place a rack on top of the foil.  Place the halved tomatoes cut-side up on the rack, making sure that they do not touch.  Place the cookie sheet in a 200 degree oven and leave to dry for 4 to 5 hours.  They should feel dry and will darken in color.

Sterilize four 8-ounce jars with their lids by boiling them in a large pot of water for 10 minutes.  Using tongs, remove the jars and lids from the water, and allow to cool on a dry surface.

Place 1 clove of garlic in the bottom of each jar.  Begin layering the dried tomatoes.  When half full, tuck in 3 to 4 basil leaves and 1 sprig of rosemary, and then continue layering dried tomatoes until almost reaching the top.  Pack down slightly with a spoon.  Pour olive oil over the top and make sure they are thoroughly immersed in the oil.

Wipe clean the rims of the jars and seal with their lids.  Label and date the jars.  Store in the refrigerator for up to several months.  The oil in the jars can be pureed with the dried tomatoes for making a pesto, or to flavor bread, pastas, or vegetables.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  walnuts -- divided
  1                cup  blanched almonds
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
  12                    sheets phyllo dough
     1/4           cup  light safflower oil
  1 1/4           cups  date sugar
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  lemon zest
  2        tablespoons  maple syrup
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract

Lightly grease a 9- by 13-inch pan and set aside.

Coarsely chop half of the walnuts and place them in a bowl.  Finely chop the remaining half of walnuts and the almonds.  Add the finely chopped nuts to the bowl along with the cinnamon and cloves, stir well to combine, and set aside.

Place the stacked sheets of phyllo dough flat on a cutting board, cut them in half lengthwise, stack the cut sheets on top of each other, remove 6 sheets from the stack, and cover the remaining with a towel to keep them from drying out.

Place 1 sheet of phyllo dough in the bottom of the greased pan and lightly brush it with a little of the oil.  Repeat the layering and oiling procedure for the remaining 5 sheets of phyllo dough.  Sprinkle one third of the reserved nut mixture evenly over the top of the stacked phyllo dough.  Repeat the layering and oiling procedure with 6 additional sheets of phyllo dough, sprinkle with another third of the nut mixture, and repeat this procedure ending with a phyllo layer.

Using a sharp knife, carefully make 4 evenly-spaced vertical cuts through the entire stack of phyllo, make 5 evenly-spaced lengthwise cuts, and then cut each piece in half diagonally.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, lower the heat to 300 degrees, and bake an additional 25 to 30 minutes or until evenly golden brown on top.

Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine the date sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and maple syrup, and cook over medium heat until thickened.  Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and almond extract.  Pour the syrup mixture over the baklava as soon as it comes out of the oven.  Let baklava cool before serving.  Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week or extras can be frozen.

This recipe yields 40 pieces.

Place 1 sheet of phyllo dough in the bottom of the greased pan and lightly brush it with a little of the oil.  Repeat the layering and oiling procedure for the remaining 5 sheets of phyllo dough.  Sprinkle one third of the reserved nut mixture evenly over the top of the stacked phyllo dough.  Repeat the layering and oiling procedure with 6 additional sheets of phyllo dough, sprinkle with another third of the nut mixture, and repeat this procedure ending with a phyllo layer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a sharp knife, carefully make 4 evenly-spaced vertical cuts through the entire stack of phyllo, make 5 evenly-spaced lengthwise cuts, and then cut each piece in half diagonally.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, lower the heat to 300 degrees, and bake an additional 25 to 30 minutes or until evenly golden brown on top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine the date sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and maple syrup, and cook over medium heat until thickened.  Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and almond extract.  Pour the syrup mixture over the baklava as soon as it comes out of the oven.  Let baklava cool before serving.  Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week or extras can be frozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
  1         tablespoon  maple syrup
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dry active yeast
  2               cups  unbleached flour
  1                cup  whole-wheat flour
  2        tablespoons  safflower oil
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  unbleached cane sugar
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
                        Safflower oil -- for frying
                        Veganized Powdered Sugar -- for dusting

In a small saucepan, place the soy milk, and bring to a simmer over low heat.  Remove the saucepan from the heat.  Add the maple syrup and yeast, stir well to combine, and set aside for 5 minutes to dissolve the yeast.

Add both types of flour, oil, vanilla, lemon zest, and salt, and stir well to form a smooth batter.  Cover the bowl with a towel, place it in a warm place, and set aside for 25 minutes to rise.  In a small bowl, place the sugar and cinnamon, stir well to combine, and set aside.

Meanwhile, in a large saucepan or wok, place enough safflower oil to fill to a depth of 1 to 2 inches and heat to 360 degrees.  Drop the batter by tablespoonfuls into the hot oil, a few at a time (do not overcrowd the pan as they will puff when cooking), and fry until golden brown.  Carefully flip the beignets over with a slotted spoon, continue to cook until golden brown on all sides, and then carefully remove them from the oil with the slotted spoon.

Drain the beignets on a clean, lint-free towel, or natural unbleached paper towels.  Roll the warm beignets in the reserved cinnamon-sugar mixture and transfer to a large platter.

Repeat the frying and rolling in the cinnamon-sugar mixture procedure for the remaining beignet batter.  Sprinkle the platter of beignets with a little Veganized Powdered Sugar before serving, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  unbleached flour
     2/3           cup  arrowroot
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached cane sugar -- divided
                        = (or white sugar from sugar beets)
  2          teaspoons  cinnamon
     1/2           cup  vegan margarine
     1/3           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  liquid lecithin
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
                        Water -- for sprinkling

In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, arrowroot, baking soda, and salt, and set aside.

In a small bowl, stir together 2 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon, and set aside.

In a large bowl, place the remaining sugar, margarine, water, liquid lecithin, and vanilla, and stir the mixture until smooth. Add half of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir to combine.  Using your hands, work in the remaining dry ingredients to form a smooth ball of dough.

Roll the dough into 1-inch balls and place them on a large plate.  Sprinkle a little water over the tops of the balls of dough and run your hand over them to lightly moisten with water.  Working in batches, shake off any excess water, and roll each ball in the reserved cinnamon-sugar mixture to thoroughly coat them on all sides.

Place the balls of dough on ungreased non-stick cookie sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart.  Bake at 350 degrees for 8 minutes.  Remove the cookie sheets from the oven.  Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheets for 2 minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.

Repeat the rolling in cinnamon-sugar and baking procedure for the remaining balls of dough.  Store the cookies in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 5 to 5 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  For a wheat-free and gluten-free version, substitute brown rice flour for the unbleached flour in the recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  walnuts
  2          teaspoons  flax seeds
     1/4           cup  water
  2               cups  unbleached flour
     1/4           cup  arrowroot
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  Sucanat
                        = (or brown sugar from sugar beets)
     1/2           cup  vegan margarine
  2        tablespoons  liquid lecithin
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
                        Raspberry or strawberry jelly or jam
                        = (or other flavor of choice)

In a blender or food processor, place the walnuts, and process for 30 to 60 seconds to finely grind them.  Transfer the ground walnuts to a small bowl and set aside.

In the same blender, place the flax seeds, and process for 1 minute to finely grind them to a powder.  Add the water, process for 1 additional minute, scrape down the sides of the blender, and set aside for 10 minutes to allow the mixture to thicken.

In a small bowl, stir together the flour, arrowroot, cinnamon, and salt, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, place the reserved flax seed mixture, Sucanat, margarine, liquid lecithin, vanilla, and almond extract, and stir well to combine.  Add half of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir to combine.  Using your hands, work in the remaining dry ingredients to form a soft ball of dough.

Roll the dough into 1-inch balls and roll each ball in the reserved ground walnuts to thoroughly coat it on all sides.  Working in batches, place the balls of dough on ungreased non-stick cookie sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart.  Using your thumb, gently press indentations into the center of each cookie.

Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  Remove the cookie sheets from the oven.  Using 1/2 teaspoon of raspberry jelly, fill the "thumbprints" of each cookie, return the cookie sheets to the oven, and bake an additional 2 minutes.  Remove the cookie sheets from the oven.  Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheets for 2 minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.

Repeat the "thumbprinting" and baking procedure for the remaining balls of dough.  Store the cookies in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 4 dozen.

Comments:  For a wheat-free and gluten-free version, substitute brown rice flour for the unbleached flour in the recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  brown rice syrup
     1/3           cup  safflower oil
  2        tablespoons  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  1 1/2           cups  barley or spelt flour
     1/2           cup  arrowroot
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === OPTIONAL TOPPINGS ===
                        Chopped dried fruits
                        Raisins
                        Chopped nuts

Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or non-stick baking liners and set aside.

In a small bowl, place the brown rice syrup, oil, vanilla, and almond extract, and whisk well to combine.

In a medium bowl, place the flour, arrowroot, baking powder, and salt, and stir well to combine.  Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until well blended.

Gather the dough into a ball and divide in half.  Work with one half of the dough at a time and cover the remainder to prevent it from drying out.

Sprinkle a large piece of waxed paper with a little additional flour, place the dough on the floured waxed paper, and place an additional piece of waxed paper on top.  Using a rolling pin, carefully roll out the dough to a 1/4-inch thickness.  Remove the top sheet of waxed paper and cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters.

Using a spatula, carefully transfer the cut-outs to the prepared cookie sheets.  The cookies can be left plain, or before baking, sprinkle with any of the suggested toppings on top of the cookies, and gently press with your fingers to help the toppings stick to the dough.

Bake at 350 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes or until lightly browned on the bottom and around the edges.  Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.

Repeat the rolling, topping, and baking procedure with the remaining cookie dough.  When all of the cookies are cooled completely, store them in an airtight container with waxed paper between the layers.

This recipe yields 24 to 30 cut out cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  brown rice flour
  1 1/2           cups  arrowroot -- plus
                        extra for rolling out cookies
  1 1/2           cups  amaranth flour
  2        tablespoons  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  2          teaspoons  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger

  1 1/2           cups  Sucanat
                        = (or brown sugar from sugar beets)
     1/2           cup  applesauce
     1/3           cup  safflower oil
     1/3           cup  molasses
  2        tablespoons  vanilla
                        Safflower oil -- for oiling sheets
                        === DECORATIONS ===
                        Dried currants
                        Dried cranberries
                        Sunflower seeds
                        Decorator's Frosting -- (see recipe)

In a small bowl, stir together the brown rice flour, arrowroot, amaranth flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, and cloves, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, place the remaining ingredients, and stir to combine.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir well to combine.  Cover the bowl, place it in the refrigerator, and chill the dough for 1 hour or more.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or mist with oil) two non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.

Sprinkle a little arrowroot over a work surface.  Divide the chilled dough into quarters, work with only one quarter of the dough at a time, and keep the remaining dough covered and chilled until needed.  Working in batches, roll out the quarter of dough to 1/4-inch thickness, and cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters.

Carefully transfer the cut cookies to the prepared cookie sheet.  Bake them at 350 degrees for 6 minutes (the cookies will feel slightly soft to the touch).  Allow them to cool on the cookie sheets for 3 minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.  Repeat the rolling and cutting-out procedure for the remaining cookie dough.  Store the cookies in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 dozen.

To make Gingerbread People:  Cut the dough using a person-shaped cookie cutter.  Carefully transfer the cut cookies to the prepared cookie sheets.  To decorate them: use two dried currants for eyes, pressing them slightly into the dough; squeeze one dried cranberry with your fingers to form it into a mouth, pressing it slightly into the dough; and then use 8 sunflower seeds to make the outline of a vest, or 10 sunflower seeds to make the outline of a dress, pressing them slightly into the dough.  Bake as directed above.  The dried currants, dried cranberries, and sunflower seeds can also be used to decorate other cut shapes of cookies.

To make Glazed Gingerbread Cookies:  Cut cookies as desired and bake as directed above.  Prepare the Decorator's Frosting and use it to decorate the completely cooled cookies, as desired.  Allow the frosting to set completely before transferring the cookies to an airtight container.

In a small bowl, stir together the brown rice flour, arrowroot, amaranth flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, and cloves, and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium bowl, place the remaining ingredients, and stir to combine.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir well to combine.  Cover the bowl, place it in the refrigerator, and chill the dough for 1 hour or more.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or mist with oil) two non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sprinkle a little arrowroot over a work surface.  Divide the chilled dough into quarters, work with only one quarter of the dough at a time, and keep the remaining dough covered and chilled until needed.  Working in batches, roll out the quarter of dough to 1/4-inch thickness, and cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Carefully transfer the cut cookies to the prepared cookie sheet.  Bake them at 350 degrees for 6 minutes (the cookies will feel slightly soft to the touch).  Allow them to cool on the cookie sheets for 3 minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.  Repeat the rolling and cutting-out procedure for the remaining cookie dough.  Store the cookies in an airtight container.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 3 to 4 dozen.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make Gingerbread People:  Cut the dough using a person-shaped cookie cutter.  Carefully transfer the cut cookies to the prepared cookie sheets.  To decorate them: use two dried currants for eyes, pressing them slightly into the dough; squeeze one dried cranberry with your fingers to form it into a mouth, pressing it slightly into the dough; and then use 8 sunflower seeds to make the outline of a vest, or 10 sunflower seeds to make the outline of a dress, pressing them slightly into the dough.  Bake as directed above.  The dried currants, dried cranberries, and sunflower seeds can also be used to decorate other cut shapes of cookies.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make Glazed Gingerbread Cookies:  Cut cookies as desired and bake as directed above.  Prepare the Decorator&apos;s Frosting and use it to decorate the completely cooled cookies, as desired.  Allow the frosting to set completely before transferring the cookies to an airtight container.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  wheat bran
     1/4           cup  maple syrup
                        = (or barley malt syrup)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/4           cup  boiling water
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  2           packages  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  cold water
  1         tablespoon  Ener-G Egg Replacer
  2               cups  unbleached flour - (to 2 1/2)
  1                cup  whole-wheat flour
                        Olive oil -- as needed

In a large bowl, stir together the wheat bran, maple syrup, oil, and salt.  Pour the 1/4 cups boiling water over the top, stir well, and set mixture aside to cool.

In a small measuring cup, combine the 1/2 cups warm water and yeast, stir well to dissolve the yeast, and set aside for 10 minutes or until foamy.

In a small bowl, combine the cold water and egg replacer, whisk vigorously for 1 minute or until very frothy (almost like beaten egg whites).

To the wheat bran mixture, add the yeast mixture, and egg replacer mixture, and stir well to combine.  Add the flour, mixing in just enough flour to form a stiff dough.

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for 8 to 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic.

Lightly oil the mixing bowl with a little olive oil, transfer the ball of dough to the bowl, and roll the dough around the inside of the bowl to thoroughly coat it with the oil.  Cover and place in a warm place to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

Punch down the dough and turn it out on to a floured work surface.  Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball.  These rolls can be baked in either two muffin pans or two 9-inch round cake pans.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) the pans of choice.  Place either 1 ball of dough in each muffin cup or place 12 balls of  dough in each round cake pan.  Brush the tops of the balls with a little olive oil.  Cover and place in a warm place to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

Remove the cover and bake the rolls at 375 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown.  Allow the rolls to cool a few minutes before removing them from the pans.  Serve the rolls warm.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

     1/2           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  safflower oil

Divide the rested dough into 12 equal pieces.  Roll each piece of dough to form a 6-inch circle and keep the circles of dough covered with a towel while you roll out the remaining dough.

Heat a non-stick griddle or skillet over medium heat.  Cook each chapati for 1 to 2 minutes per side or until puffed and lightly browned in spots.  Keep the cooked chapatis covered with a towel until serving.

Serve chapatis with dips, dal, stews, or curry dishes.

This recipe yields 12 chapatis.
