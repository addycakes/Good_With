                        and cut in half
  2             slices  proscuitto ham - (paper thin, and

  2             ounces  snow crab (body and leg meat)
  3             ounces  cream sherry
  2             ounces  chicken stock

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === JULIENNE VEGETABLES ===
     1/4         ounce  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

           A Touch Of Garlic's Fresh Mozzarella From Curd - ...

Recipe By     :Brian Nemeth
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  mozzarella curd
  1             gallon  boiling water -- with
  3        tablespoons  salt
     1/2        gallon  ice water

Wash hands thoroughly!  In a large bowl crumble mozzarella curd into a second bowl.  Slowly incorporate salted boiling water over curd gently folding into itself as it begins to melt.  When curd comes together in a single mass, soak hands in ice water to chill for about ten seconds.  When hands are cold, reach into salted hot water bath and lift curd from bowl.  Return hands to ice bath as needed as the cheese will be hot when handling.  Knead cheese for a few seconds until smooth.  Shape into desired size and shape.  Place in ice bath until chilled.

For same day use, wrap cheese in plastic wrap.  Cheese may also be stored in cold water in the refrigerator for later use.  Perishability will vary and vacuum sealing extends shelf life dramatically.

This recipe yields 2 to 3 pounds of high moisture fresh mozzarella cheese.

                    Applebee's Baked French Onion Soup

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  6             medium  white onions -- sliced
  8               cups  beef broth (Swanson is best)
  1                cup  water
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  5                     plain hamburger buns
  10            slices  provolone cheese
  10         teaspoons  shredded parmesan cheese

Add 3 tablespoons oil to a large soup pot or saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the sliced onions and sautÈ for 20 minutes until the onions begin to soften and start to become translucent.  You don't want them to brown.

Add the beef broth, water, salt, garlic powder and black pepper to the pan and bring mixture to a boil.  When soup begins to boil, reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes.

To make the croutons cut off the top half of each top of the hamburger bun so that the bread is the same thickness as the bottom half of each bun.  Throw the tops away.  Now you should have 10 round pieces of bread -- 5 bottom buns, and 5 top buns with the tops cut off.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Place the bread in the the oven directly on the rack and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until each piece is golden brown and crispy.  Set these croutons aside until you need them.

When the soup is done, spoon about 1 cup into an oven-safe bowl.  Float a crouton on top of the soup, then place a slice of provolone cheese on top of the crouton.  Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of shredded parmesan cheese over the provolone.

Place the bowl into your oven set to high broil.  Broil the soup for 5 to 6 minutes or until the cheese is melted and starting to brown (you may need to broil longer if you are making more than one bowl at a time).  Sprinkle an additional 1/2 teaspoon of shredded parmesan cheese over the top of the soup and serve.  Repeat process to prepare remaining servings.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

                      Baskin Robbins' Ice Cream Cake

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 20    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     box praline ice cream - (1/2 gallon)
  4               cups  vanilla ice cream - (2 pints)
  1                     container white frosting - (12 oz)
                        Colored frosting -- (optional)
                        === FOR THE CAKE ===
  1                     box white cake mix
  1 1/4           cups  water
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
  3                     egg whites

Make your cake following the directions on the box.  If you are making the white cake you will likely blend the cake mix with water, oil and 3 eggs.  Pour the batter into a greased 9- by 13-inch baking pan and bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes.  When cake is done, let it cool to room temperature.

When the cake has cooled, slice it in half and place each half on a wax-paper covered cookie sheet, or a platter or tray that will fit into your freezer.

Use a sharp serrated knife (a bread knife works great) to slice the ice cream through the middle, box and all, so that you have two 2-inch thick sheets of ice cream.  Peel the cardboard off the ice cream and lay a half upon each of cakes.  Slice the edges of the cake all the way around so that the cake is the same size as the ice cream on top.  Work quickly so that the ice cream doesn't melt.  When both cakes have been trimmed, place them into the freezer for an hour or two.

When you are ready to frost the cake, take the two pints (4 cups) of vanilla ice cream out of the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes to soften.  Stir the ice cream so that it is smooth, like frosting.  Use a frosting knife or spatula to coat each cake with about 2 cups of ice cream.  Cover the entire surface thoroughly so that you cannot see any of the cake.  Pop the cakes into the freezer for an hour or so to set up.

When the cakes have set, fill a pastry bag (with a fancy tip) with white frosting to decorate all around the top edge of the cake.  Also decorate around the bottom of the cake.  Use colored frosting and different tips to add inspired artistic flair and writing on the cake, as needed.  Cover the cakes and keep them in your freezer until party time.

When you are ready to serve the cakes, leave them out for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.  Cut the cakes with a sharp knife that has been held under hot water.

This recipe yields 2 cakes (approximately 10 servings each).

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast                       Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     small can Pillsbury Grands Buttermilk Bisc -- (5 biscuits)
                        Melted butter -- as needed
  5                     eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  10            ounces  ground breakfast sausage, such as Jimmy
                        Dean or 10 slices of bacon
  5             slices  American Cheese

Prepare biscuits following instructions on the can (350 degrees for 15 to 18 minutes).  When you remove the biscuits from the oven brush the top of each with melted butter.

Spray a skillet over medium heat with non-stick cooking spray.  Open both ends of a clean, small sliced pineapple can.  Spray the inside of the empty can with the non-stick spray, and then place the can in the pan to heat up.  Use more than one can if you'd like to speed up the cooking process.

Beat an egg, then pour it into the empty can mold, add a bit of salt and pepper, and cover with a saucepan lid.  Cook for a couple minutes, then scrape a knife around the edge of the egg to release it.  Remove the can then turn the egg over and cook it for another minute or two.  Repeat with the remaining eggs.

If using sausage, form 2-ounce portions of sausage into patties with the same diameter as the biscuits.  Cook the sausage in another hot skillet over medium heat until brown.  If using bacon, cook the bacon and drain on paper towels.

Slice a biscuit in half through the middle.  Build each sandwich by first stacking egg on the bottom half of the biscuit.  Next arrange sausage (or 2 slices of bacon) on the egg, then a slice of American cheese.  Top off each sandwich with the top biscuit half, then zap it in the microwave for 15 to 20 seconds to help melt the cheese.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

This recipe yields 5 sandwiches.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  Pillsbury Original Crescent Rolls - (8 oz)
  4                     eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8             ounces  ground breakfast sausage, such as Jimmy
                        Dean or 8 slices of bacon
  4             slices  American Cheese

Prepare the rolls by first unrolling the dough out of the can.  Separate the dough into four sections, each made up of two triangles.  Detach the triangles by tearing along the diagonal perforation, then reattach the dough along the outside parallel edges, pinching the dough together along the middle.  This will make making one bigger triangle.  Loosely roll the dough from the wide end, all the way up.  Now, bring the ends around so that they overlap and the roll is in the shape of a circle.  Press the ends together and place roll onto a baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining dough, then bake following the directions on the package (375 degrees for 11 to 13 minutes).

Spray a skillet over medium heat with non-stick cooking spray.  Open both ends of a clean, small sliced pineapple can.  Spray the inside of the empty can with the non-stick spray, and then place the can in the pan to heat up.  Use more than one can if you'd like to speed up the cooking process.

If using sausage, form 2-ounce portions of sausage into patties with the same diameter as the rolls.  Cook the sausage in another hot skillet over medium heat until brown.  If using bacon, cook the bacon and drain on paper towels.

Slice a roll in half through the middle.  Build each sandwich by first stacking egg on the bottom half of the roll.  Next arrange sausage (or 2 slices of bacon) on the egg, then a slice of American cheese.  Top off each sandwich with the top roll half, then zap it in the microwave for 15 to 20 seconds to help melt the cheese.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

This recipe yields 4 sandwiches.

To Make the Fried Tortilla Strips:  In a deep, heavy frying pan, heat several inches of vegetable oil to a temperature of 375 degrees.  Working in batches if necessary to prevent overcrowding, carefully add the tortilla strips to the hot oil, submerging them with a metal skimmer or slotted spoon.  Fry the tortilla strips until evenly golden, 1 to 2 minutes.  Carefully lift them out with the skimmer or slotted spoon and transfer them to paper towels to drain and cool.  Set aside, uncovered.

To Make the Garden Herb Ranch Dressing:  In a mixing bowl, use a fork to stir together the mustard and cold water, forming a paste.  Set aside for 10 minutes.  Add the remaining dressing ingredients to the bowl and, using a handheld electric mixer at low speed or a whisk, blend together just until smooth, taking care not to incorporate too much air into the dressing.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.

To Make the Grilled Garlic and BBQ Chicken:  Preheat a stovetop grill or the broiler.  In a mixing bowl, stir together the olive oil, garlic, soy sauce, and salt.  Turn the chicken breasts in this marinade and leave to marinate at room temperature for about 15 minutes.  Grill or broil the chicken breasts until cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes per side.  Chill thoroughly in the refrigerator.  Cut the chicken breasts into 3/4-inch cubes and, in a bowl, toss with the barbecue sauce to coat well.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.

To Make the Salad:  In a large mixing bowl, toss together the lettuces, basil, jicama, Monterey Jack cheese, beans, corn, cilantro, dressing, and half of the Fried Tortilla Strips.  Transfer the salads to chilled serving plates.   Surround each salad with diced tomatoes and the remaining Fried Tortilla Strips.  Top each salad with chunks of Grilled Garlic BBQ Chicken and drizzle the chicken with the barbecue sauce.  Garnish with the scallion.

This recipe yields 4 main-course or 8 appetizer servings.

Comments:  This salad rated overwhelmingly number one among our employees' personal favorites.  We love it, too, for so many reasons: the crunch of the jicama, corn chips, and lettuces; the explosions of different flavors with every bite; and the contrast of the sweet-and-spicy barbecue sauce with the cool ranch dressing.  You can find jicama, a big knobby-looking Mexican tuber with crisp, sweet flesh, in well-stocked markets; peel it thickly before cutting into strips.

       California Pizza Kitchen's Broccoli, Sun-Dried Tomato Fusill

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dry fusilli pasta
                        = (or 2 lbs fresh fusilli)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh garlic
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  12                    oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes -- drained, and
                        sliced into thin strips
  1              quart  bite-size broccoli florets -- blanched, drained
  1 1/4           cups  grated parmesan cheese -- 1/4 cup reserved
                        for garnish

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Cook pasta until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes for dry or 3 minutes for fresh.  Pasta may be cooked slightly ahead of time, rinsed and oiled and then "flashed" (reheated) in boiling water to coincide with the finishing of the sauce/topping.

Heat olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan over high heat.  Add salt and garlic; when the garlic just begins to brown, add thyme and sun-dried tomatoes.  Toss and add broccoli.  When broccoli is heated through, add drained pasta (if pan is not large enough to accommodate this large load, proceed quickly in a large mixing bowl, while ingredients are still quite hot).  Add 1 cup parmesan to the pan, sprinkling and tossing/stirring to mix.

Remove from heat; serve the pasta in warm bowls with a fresh dusting of parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Fresh diced tomatoes can be added along with the broccoli if so desired.

       California Pizza Kitchen's Dakota Smashed Pea And Barley Sou

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  split peas
  6               cups  water
  2               cans  chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz ea)
     1/3           cup  minced onion
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  dried parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1               dash  dried thyme
     1/2           cup  barley
  6               cups  water
  2             medium  carrots -- diced (abt 1 cup)
     1/2                celery stalk -- diced (1/4 cup)
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped green onion

Rinse and drain the split peas, then add them to a large pot with 6 cups of water, chicken broth, onion, garlic, lemon juice, salt, sugar, parsley, pepper, and thyme.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 75 minutes or until the peas are soft.

While the peas are cooking, combine the barley with 6 cups of water in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 75 minutes or until the barley is soft and most of the water has been absorbed.

When the split pea mixture has become a thick soup, use a handheld blender to puree the peas until the mixture is smooth.  You may also use a standard blender or food processor for this step, pureeing the soup in batches.  Alternately, if you like, you may skip this step, keeping the soup rather chunky.  It's still good this way, just not as smooth as the real thing.

Drain the barley mixture in a sieve or colander and add it to the split pea mixture.  Add the carrots and celery and continue to simmer the soup for 15 to 30 minutes or until the carrots are tender.  Stir occasionally.  Turn off the heat, cover the soup, and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.  Garnish each serving with a little chopped green onion.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === KUNG PAO SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock (preferable homemade)
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
     3/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  dry sherry
  3        tablespoons  red chili paste with garlic -- (available in jars
                        at specialty food stores or Asian markets)
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  Asian toasted sesame oil
                        === EGG WHITE-CORNSTARCH MIXTURE ===
  2                     egg whites
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === PASTA ===
  1              pound  dry spaghetti
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut 3/4" cubes
  20             whole  Chinese dried red chili peppers
  1                cup  unsalted roasted peanuts
     1/4           cup  minced garlic
  3               cups  coarsely-chopped scallions -- greens and whites
                        cut into 3/4" pieces

To Make the Kung Pao Sauce  In a medium saucepan, whisk together the chicken stock and cornstarch until the cornstarch has fully dissolved.  Stir in all the remaining sauce ingredients and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 15 to 20 minutes.  Set aside.

To Make the Egg White-Cornstarch Mixture:  In a mixing bowl, use a small whisk to stir together the egg whites, cornstarch, and salt until thoroughly blended; take care, however, not to beat them into a froth.  Set aside.

To Prepare the Pasta:  Being a large pot of salted water to a rapid boil.  Add the pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 9 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a large nonstick frying pan over high heat, heat the olive oil for about 1 minute.  Add the chicken pieces to the Egg White-Cornstarch Mixture and toss to coat them.  Taking great care to avoid splattering, add the coated chicken to the pan and cook like a solid pancake until the egg mixture sets; then, using a large spatula, carefully flip the chicken pieces over together and, with a wooden spoon, gently separate the pieces.

Carefully stir the Chinese peppers and roasted peanuts into the pan.  As soon as they darken in color, after no more than 1 minute, stir in the garlic and scallions.  Once the garlic begins to brown, after no more than 30 seconds, add the Kung Pao Sauce and toss and stir to coat the ingredients.

When the pasta is ready, drain it well and, in a large mixing or serving bowl, toss it thoroughly with the sauce.  Serve family-style or transfer to individual serving bowls, artfully arranging the chicken, vegetables, and peppers.

Variation with shrimp:  For the chicken, substitute 20 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  "Imagine eating Chinese food with American music playing in the background."  That's the clever way Adam Hoffman, a host at the CPK in Tarzana, California, describes Kung Pao Spaghetti to guests.  Adds his colleague Aric Mizrahi, a server there, "This is a perfect pasta for people who love spicy food."  Not suprisingly, this authentic Asian sauce with a Western pasta twist is selling off the charts at the CPK in Singapore.  If you're not familiar with it, let us caution you and your guests to avoid eating the whole dried chili peppers.

              California Pizza Kitchen's Pumpkin Cheesecake

Recipe By     :Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfield
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Cheesecake
                Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  graham cracker crumbs -- (about 22 sheets,
                        finely crushed with a rolling pin)
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === CHEESECAKE FILLING ===
  3           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea)
  1 1/2           cups  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2          teaspoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/8      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  1                cup  sour cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sour cream
  3              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/4           cups  canned pumpkin puree

To Make the Graham Cracker Crust:  Put the graham cracker crumbs in a food processor fitted with the steel blade and process until they have a uniformly fine texture.  Add the sugar and pulse to combine.  With the machine running, pour the melted butter through the feed tube and continue processing just until the mixture forms a soft mass.  Remove from the processor and firmly press the mixture into the base of a 9-inch springform pan, spreading it evenly.

To Make the Cheesecake:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the flat beater attachment, beat the cream cheese until soft, stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula.  Add the brown sugar and continue beating until thoroughly incorporated and creamy.

In a separate small bowl, stir together the flour, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, ginger, and nutmeg.  Add the flour mixture to the cream cheese mixture and beat until thoroughly combined, stopping occasionally to scrape down the bowl.  In the same way, beat in the sour cream and then, one at a time, the eggs, scraping down the bowl after each addition.  Add the vanilla and pumpkin and beat until thoroughly combined.

Pour the filling into the prepared springform pan and place on the center rack of the oven.  Bake for 1 hour.  Protecting your hands with oven mitts or pads, test for doneness by gently moving the pan to see if the center of the cheesecake has firmed up -- a sign of doneness -- or is still slightly fluid (alternatively, check the cheesecake's internal temperature with an instant-read thermometer, which should register 180 degrees).  The cheesecake may require up to 20 minutes more baking time.

When it is done, let it cool to room temperature and then refrigerate it overnight before removing the side of the pan.  Cut the cheesecake into wedges with a sharp knife.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Sweetly spiced with traditional pumpkin-pie seasonings, this luscious cheesecake appears as a special on our dessert menus a few weeks before Thanksgiving and stays until just before Christmas.  During that brief season, our guests go wild for it.  Try serving the cheesecake with  a dollop of whipped cream.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Dips/Spreads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  white or yellow onion in 1/8" dice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock (preferable homemade)
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  dehydrated chicken stock base or
                        crumbled bouillon cubes
  1 1/2    tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     3/4           cup  sour cream
  12            ounces  frozen spinach -- defrosted, drained,
                        wrung out by hand, and coarsely chopped
  6             ounces  canned artichoke bottoms -- drained, and
                        cut into 1/8" slices
  1                cup  finely-shredded Monterey Jack cheese
     3/4      teaspoon  Tobasco sauce
                        Blue and white corn tortilla chips, for se

In a large saucepan, warm the olive oil and butter together over medium heat.  When the butter has melted, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted, 3 to 4 minutes.  Stir in the garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes longer, stirring frequently and stopping before the onion and garlic brown.

Sprinkle the flour and continue cooking, stirring continuously, until the mixture turns a golden-blond color, 10 to 15 minutes.  Then, whisking continuously, slowly pour in the stock until it is smoothly incorporated.  When the mixture begins to simmer, stir in the cream.  Let it return to the simmer.  Remove from the heat, add the parmesan, chicken base or bouillon cubes, lemon juice, and sugar, and stir until thoroughly blended.

Add the sour cream, spinach, artichoke bottoms, Monterey Jack cheese and Tobasco sauce, and stir until the ingredients are thoroughly combined and the cheese has melted.  Transfer to a warmed serving bowl and serve immediately, accompanied by blue and white corn tortilla chips.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  A vast majority of CPK employees list this dip as their own and their customers' favorite appetizer.  If you like, try serving it with wedges of fresh-baked focaccia in place of the tortilla chips.

  1                cup  alfalfa sprouts - (loosely packed)
  4                     lettuce leaves
  4              large  tomato slices
  4             slices  Kraft Swiss Cheese Singles

Marinate the chicken in the teriyaki marinade in a shallow bowl for 30 minutes.  Preheat a clean barbecue to medium grilling heat.

Brown the faces of each bun in a frying pan on the stove.  Keep the pan hot.  Cook the bacon in the pan until crisp, then set aside.

Grill the chicken breasts 5 to 8 minutes per side, or until cooked through.

Spread about 1/2 tablespoon of mayonnaise on the face of each bun, top and bottom.  Divide the sprouts into 4 portions and mound on each bottom bun.  On the sprouts, stack a lettuce leaf, then a slice of tomato.

Place one chicken breast half on each of the sandwiches, atop the  tomato.  Next, stack a slice of Swiss cheese on the chicken, and then the 2  pieces of bacon, crossed over each other.  Top off the sandwich with the top bun.  Microwave for 15 seconds on high.

This recipe yields 4 sandwiches.

                         Carl's Jr. Famous Starô!

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  ground chuck
  1              large  sesame-seed bun
  1         tablespoon  KraftÆ mayonnaise -- divided
  1         tablespoon  HeinzÆ ketchup
     1/2    tablespoon  HeinzÆ hamburger relish (the red stuff)
  3                     VlasicÆ hamburger slices
  1                     tomato slice - (to 2)
  3                     white onion rings - (to 4)
  1                     handful chopped lettuce

Pre-Prepare your Condiments:  Mix 1 tablespoon ketchup with 1/2 tablespoon relish, set aside.  Chop the lettuce; you'll need a handful per burger.  Thinly slice the tomato and onion.  You'll need 1 to 2 tomato slices, and 3 to 4 rings of fresh onion.  (These amounts are for each Famous StarÆ)

Preparing the beef:  On waxed paper, hamburg into 5 inch round pattiy.  Freeze for at least an hour.  Keep any spares frozen until needed.  Obviously you'll do this in advance.

Preparing the bun(s):  When cooking time draws near, toast the faces of the bun (top and bottom) on a 375 degree electric griddle.  They should be an even tan color.

Cooking your Famous StarÆ:  Preheat either an outdoor gas barbecue, or an indoor electric one.  After it is pre-heated, place a still-frozen beef patty on the grill, pressing down firmly for 4 to 5 seconds (this will get you the grill marks).  Salt liberally.  Cook for 3 minutes (gas) or 5 to 6 minutes (electric).  Eyeball it -- if it looks ready to turn, turn it.

While the beef is cooking, dress your bun as follows.

Top Half:  Your pre-mixed special sauce (ketchup and relish);  1/2 tablespoon mayonnaise.

Bottom Half: 1/2 tablespoon mayonnaise;  3 pickle slices;  1 handful of chopped iceberg lettuce;  1 to 2 tomato slices;  3 to 4 fresh rings of onion.

Turn the beef patty over, press down firmly with a spatula for 3 to 4 seconds, and salt liberally.  (Don't be afraid to have a few  flames "kiss" the burger...they are charbroiled)

Place the cooked beef patty on the dressed bottom bun, add the top, and BAM -- a Carl's JrÆ Famous Starô!

This recipe yields 1 Carl's JrÆ Famous Starô!

Comments:  This classic hamburger is truly the signature burger on the menu at Carl's JrÆ, and has been since it's introduction in 1945.  THIS is a great, all-American hamburger!

Want to make a Carl's JrÆ All-Starô?  After placing the beef on the bottom bun, add a slice of real Amercian cheese on top of the patty, then 2 slices of cooked bacon before placing the top bun on (criss-cross the bacon in an X pattern).

Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
  1                cup  teriyaki marinade (Lawry's is best)
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  curry powder
  1              pinch  salt
  4                     whole-wheat hamburger buns
  4                     lettuce leaves
  1                can  mild green chili peppers - (4 oz) -- drained
  4             slices  American cheese

Marinate the chicken in the teriayki marinade in a shallow bowl for 30 minutes.

Preheat a clean barbecue to medium grilling heat.  Prepare the sauce in a small bowl by mixing the mayonnaise with the paprika, cayenne pepper, curry powder, and salt.

Grill the chicken for 5 to 8 minutes per side, or until done.

Brown the faces of each bun in a hot frying pan.  Spread a tablespoon of sauce on the faces of each bun, top and  bottom.  On each bottom bun place a lettuce leaf, then a green chili pepper.  You want the pepper to spread over most of the lettuce.  To do this, slice the pepper down the middle and spread it open so that it covers more territory.  When sliced open like this, some peppers are big enough for 2 sandwiches.  Some are much smaller and enough for only one sandwich.

Place one chicken breast half on each of the sandwiches, on top of  the chili pepper.  Place a slice of American cheese on the chicken.  Top it all off with the top bun.

This recipe yields 4 sandwiches.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Chicken
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     boneless chicken breast
     1/3           cup  sliced red bell pepper
     1/3           cup  sliced green bell pepper
     1/3           cup  sliced Spanish onion
  2              large  fat-free flour tortillas - (12" dia)
  1 1/3           cups  shredded Monterey Jack cheese
                        === MESQUITE MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  water
  1           teaspoon  mesquite-flavored liquid smoke
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === SPICY BBQ SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  Bull's-Eye Original BBQ Sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1               dash  chili powder

Prepare the marinade by combining the ingredients in a medium bowl.  Add chicken breast fillet to the bowl, cover, and chill for one hour.

When the chicken is finished marinating, preheat your grill to high temperature.  As grill is heating, prepare the spicy BBQ Sauce by mixing the ingredients in a small bowl.

Throw the chicken on the grill and cook it for 4 to 5 minutes per side or until it's done.  When the chicken is done cooking, chop it into bite-size pieces.

Spray a light coating of nonstick cooking spray on a medium skillet over medium heat.  SautÈ the sliced peppers and onion in the pan for 4 to 5 minutes or until the veggies start to brown.

Set a large skillet over medium-low heat.  Put one flour tortilla in the skillet and sprinkle 1/3 cup of cheese over half of the tortilla.  Spoon half of the vegetables over the cheese, followed by half of the chicken.

Spoon a generous portion of the spicy BBQ sauce over the chicken, followed by another 1/3 cup of cheese.  Fold the other side of the tortilla over the filling, and press down so that it stays in place.

By this time, the cheese on the bottom should be melted.  If not, wait another minute or so, then flip the quesadilla over and heat for another couple minutes or until all of the cheese has melted.

Slide the quesadilla onto a plate and slice it into 4 pieces.  Repeat for the second quesadilla and serve immediately with salsa on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings as an appetizer.

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 9     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  semi-sweet chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts
                        === COOKIE LAYER ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2           cup  butter (1 stick) -- softened
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  shredded coconut
                        === CRUST LAYER ===
  6        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  graham cracker crumbs
                        === CINNAMON BUTTER ===
     1/2           cup  butter (1 stick) -- softened
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  9             scoops  vanilla ice cream
                        Chocolate syrup
                        Caramel syrup
  6        tablespoons  chopped walnuts

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Combine the flour, baking soda and baking powder in a medium bowl.  In a separate large bowl, beat together the butter and sugar with an electric mixer.  Continue beating for about 30 seconds or until mixture turns lighter in color.  Add the egg, milk, and vanilla and beat until smooth.

Slowly mix the dry mixture into the wet mixture.  Beat until well-combined and then mix in the coconut flakes.  Set this cookie dough aside for now.

Melt 6 tablespoons of butter in a medium bowl in the microwave on high temperature for about 30 seconds.  Add the sugar and stir well for 30 seconds.  Add the graham cracker crumbs and stir.  Press this mixture into the bottom of a 9- by 9-inch baking dish or pan.  Sprinkle the cup of chocolate chips evenly over the graham cracker crust.

Press the cookie dough into the dish, covering the chocolate chips.  Use flour on your fingers to keep the soft dough from sticking.  Sprinkle the chopped walnuts over the dough.  Use your fingers to press the nuts into the dough.

Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until the edges of the "pie" become light brown.

Prepare the cinnamon butter by creaming together the butter, sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl with an electric mixer on high speed.

When you are ready to make your dessert, heat up a small skillet over medium heat.  When the skillet is hot, remove it from the heat then add about 1 tablespoon of the cinnamon butter to the pan.  It should quickly melt and sizzle.  Slice the "pie" into 9 pieces and place one into the hot skillet.  If the "pie" has cooled, you can reheat each slice by zapping it in the microwave for 30 to 40 seconds.

Place a scoop of ice cream on top of the "pie."  Drizzle chocolate and caramel syrup over the dessert and then sprinkle about 2 teaspoons of chopped walnuts over the top.  Repeat for the remaining ingredients and serve sizzling in the skillet.

This recipe yields 9 desserts.

Combine all the soup ingredients in a large saucepan or soup pot over high heat.  Be sure to mince the corn tortillas into small pieces with a sharp knife before adding them to the soup.  Bring soup to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the soup has thickened and tortilla pieces have mostly dissolved.

To serve soup ladle 1 1/2 cups into a bowl.  Sprinkle a heaping tablespoon of the grated cheddar/jack cheese blend over the top of the soup, and then a heaping tablespoon of crumbled corn tortilla chips over the cheese.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1            package  Duncan Hines devil's food cake mix
  1 1/3           cups  water
     1/2           cup  oil
  3              large  eggs
                        === FILLING ===
  2          teaspoons  hot water
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  marshmallow creme - (a 7-oz jar)
     1/2           cup  shortening
     1/3           cup  powdered sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
                        === FROSTING ===
  1                cup  powdered sugar
     1/4           cup  Hershey's chocolate syrup
  2        tablespoons  shortening
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
  1               dash  salt

Prepare the cake batter following the directions on the box.  If you use Duncan Hines brand, you will need 1 1/3 cups of water, 1/2 cup of oil and three eggs.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

To prepare the cake pans that will make cakes the size of Zingers, tear off 20 pieces of aluminum foil that are each about 8 inches wide.  Fold the foil in half and then in half once more so that you have a rectangular piece of foil.  Wrap this piece of foil around a small prescription medicine bottle.  Tuck in the ends and take the bottle out, leaving the foil open at the top.  This will form a little pan.  Flatten the bottom so that the mini pan stands up straight.  Place this into a baking pan and repeat with the remaining pieces of foil.  When you have arranged all of the foil pans in a baking pan, spray the inside of all the pans with non-stick cooking spray.

Fill each little pan about halfway with cake batter.  Bake cakes for 15 to 17 minutes or until a toothpick stuck in the center comes out clean.  Remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool completely.

To make the filling, combine the hot water with the salt in a small bowl and stir until the salt is dissolved.  Let this mixture cool.

Combine the marshmallow creme, shortening, powdered sugar, and vanilla in a medium bowl and mix well with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy.  Add the salt mixture to the bowl and mix.

To make the chocolate frosting, combine all the frosting ingredients in a medium bowl and mix well with an electric mixer until smooth.  To assemble your snack cakes first poke three holes with a toothpick or skewer in the top of a cake and swirl around inside the holes making little caverns for your filling.  Use a pastry bag with a small tip to squeeze some filling into each hole.  Careful not to overfill, or your cake will burst open.  Sure, it's exciting, but this mess won't make for a good clone.

Once the cake is filled, use a butter knife to spread frosting on top of the cake over the holes.  Drag a fork lengthwise over the frosting making groves, just like the real thing.

This recipe yields 20 snack cakes.

  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1                cup  butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
     3/4           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon juice
  2                     eggs
  3               cups  semi-sweet chocolate chips
  1 1/2           cups  chopped walnuts

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Grind oats in a food processor or blender until fine.  Combine the ground oats with the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a medium bowl.

Cream together the butter, sugars, vanilla, and lemon juice in another medium bowl with an electric mixer.  Add the eggs and mix until smooth.

Stir the dry mixture into the wet mixture and blend well.  Add the chocolate chips and nuts to the dough and mix by hand until ingredients are well-incorporated.

Spoon rounded 1/4-cup portions onto an ungreased cookie sheet.  Place the scoops about 2 inches apart.  You don't need to press the dough flat.  Bake for 16 to 18 minutes or until cookies are light brown and soft in the middle.

                      Hard Rock Cafe's Pig Sandwich

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pork                            Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     boneless pork loin roast - (3 to 4 lbs)
                        Vegetable oil
  4               cups  hickory smoking chips
  8                     Kaiser rolls
                        === MARINATED CABBAGE ===
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  4               cups  thinly-sliced cabbage
                        === SPICE RUB ===
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-cracked black pepper
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground sage
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
                        === SAUCE ===
  2               cans  tomato puree - (15 oz ea)
  1                cup  white vinegar
     3/4           cup  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  liquid smoke (hickory)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper

Make the marinated cabbage at least one day prior to building your sandwiches.  Like cole slaw, this garnish needs some time to develop in the fridge.  Combine the vinegar and sugar in a medium bowl.  Add the cabbage, stir, cover the bowl and store it in the refrigerator until you are ready to make the sandwiches.

Put the wood chips in a bowl and cover with water.  Let the wood soak for at least 1 hour.  Light the charcoal after it has been arranged around the inside edge of your grill.  You don't want coals directly under your pork.  When the coals are hot, drain the water from the wood chips and sprinkle the chips over the top of the coals.  You should now have smoke.

Combine the spices for the rub in a small bowl and mix well.  Rub some vegetable oil over the surface of the pork roast.  Sprinkle the spices over the entire surface of the roast.

Place the roast in the center of your grill and put the lid on.  Let the pork cook for 3 to 4 hours or until the internal temperature of the roast reaches 175 to 180 degrees.

As the pork cooks, make the sauce by combining the ingredients in a medium saucepan over medium/low heat.  Let the sauce simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, then cover and remove from heat.  Set this aside until your pork is ready.

When the pork is done, remove it from the grill and let it sit to cool for 15 to 20 minutes or until you can handle it.  Now you want to tear the meat along the grain, making bite-size strips of shredded pork.

Put the shredded pork into a large saucepan over medium heat.  Add 2 cups of the sauce to the pan and stir.  Keep the rest of the sauce for later to serve on the side.  Cook the pork for 15 minutes or until it is heated through.

Grill the faces of the rolls and stack about 1 cup of pork onto the bottom half of each roll.  Add a rounded tablespoon of marinated cabbage on top of the pork, add a tablespoon or so of extra sauce on top of that, then cap off each sandwich with the top half of the roll.

Serve with clones for the Hard Rock's cole slaw and baked beans on the side, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 sandwiches.

  1                cup  flour
  1              pound  chicken breast fillets
                        === HONEY MUSTARD DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  1 1/2      teaspoons  prepared mustard
  2          teaspoons  honey
  1              pinch  paprika
                        === APRICOT DIPPING SAUCE ===

Preheat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees.

Beat the egg in a medium bowl, add the 1 cup of milk and stir.  Pour the flour into another medium bowl.

Slice each chicken breast lengthwise into strips approximately 1/2-inch wide.  When the oil is hot, bread your chicken by first coating each strip with flour.  Dip the chicken into the egg/milk mixture and then back into the flour.  Dip each chicken strip back in the egg/milk mixture and then in the corn flake crumb mixture.  Be sure to coat each chicken piece thoroughly with the corn flake crumbs.

Fry 6 to 8 coated chicken strips at a time in the oil for 4 to 5 minutes or until the chicken is golden brown.  Drain and serve chicken with the dipping sauces on the side.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings as an appetizer.

Slice each chicken breast lengthwise into strips approximately 1/2-inch wide.  When the oil is hot, bread your chicken by first coating each strip with flour.  Dip the chicken into the egg/milk mixture and then back into the flour.  Dip each chicken strip back in the egg/milk mixture and then in the corn flake crumb mixture.  Be sure to coat each chicken piece thoroughly with the corn flake crumbs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fry 6 to 8 coated chicken strips at a time in the oil for 4 to 5 minutes or until the chicken is golden brown.  Drain and serve chicken with the dipping sauces on the side.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  20                    caramels -- unwrapped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  water
  2               cups  dry roasted peanuts
                        === CENTERS ===
     1/4           cup  whole milk
  5                     caramels -- unwrapped
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup
  1           teaspoon  peanut butter
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  powdered sugar

Combine all ingredients for the centers, except the powdered sugar, in a small saucepan over low heat.  Stir often as the caramel slowly melts.  When the mixture is smooth, add 3/4 cup of powdered sugar.  Stir.  Save the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar for later.

Use a candy thermometer to bring the mixture to exactly 230 degrees, stirring often, then turn off the heat.  When the temperature of the candy begins to drop, add the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar to the pan, then use a hand mixer on high speed to combine.  Keep mixing until the candy cools and thickens and can no longer be mixed.  That should take a minute or two.  Let the candy cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it can be touched.  Don't let it sit too long -- you want the candy to still be warm and pliable when you shape it.

Take a tablespoon-size portion and roll it between your palms or on a countertop until it forms a roll with the width of your index finger, and measuring about 4 1/2 inches long.  Repeat with the remaining center candy mixture and place the rolls on wax paper.  You should have 8 rolls.  Let the center rolls sit out for an hour or two to firm up.

Combine the 20 caramels with the 1 1/2 teaspoons of water in a small saucepan over low heat.   Stir often until the caramels melt completely, then turn off the heat.  If you work fast this caramel will stay warm while you make the candy bars.

Pour the peanuts onto a baking sheet or other flat surface.  Using a basting brush and working quickly, "paint" a coating of caramel onto one side of a center roll.  Quickly turn the center over, caramel-side-down, onto the peanuts and press gently so that the peanuts stick to the surface of the candy.  Paint more caramel onto the other side of the roll and press it down onto the peanuts.  The candy should have a solid layer of peanuts covering all sides.  If needed, brush additional caramel onto the roll, then turn it onto the peanuts to coat the roll completely.

Place the candy bar onto wax paper, and repeat with the remaining ingredients.  Eat when completely cool.

This recipe yields 8 candy bars.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/4           cup  Crystal Louisiana Hot Sauce
  1               dash  ground pepper
  1               dash  garlic powder
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  10                    chicken wing pieces
                        === ON THE SIDE ===
                        Bleu cheese dressing
                        Celery sticks

Heat oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees.  You want just enough oil to cover the wings entirely -- an inch or so deep at least.

Combine the butter, hot sauce, ground pepper, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat.  Heat until the butter is melted and the ingredients are well-blended.

Combine the flour, paprika, cayenne powder, and salt in a small bowl.  If the wings are frozen, be sure to defrost and dry them.  Put the wings in a large bowl and sprinkle the flour mixture over them, coating each wing evenly.  Put the wings in the refrigerator 60 to 90 minutes.  This will help the breading to stick to the wings when fried.

Put all the wings in the hot oil and fry 10 to 15 minutes or until some parts of the wings begin to turn dark brown.  Remove from the oil to a paper towel to drain.  Don't let them sit too long, because you want to serve them hot.

Quickly put the wings in a large bowl.  Add the hot sauce and stir, coating all of the wings evenly.

Serve with bleu cheese dressing and celery sticks on the side.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  flour
     3/4           cup  corn meal
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1 3/4           cups  fat-free milk
  2                     egg yolks -- slightly beaten
  10                    turkey hot dogs
  8               cups  vegetable oil - (to 10 cups)
  5                     pairs of chopsticks

Preheat oil in a deep pan or fryer to 375 degrees.

Combine the flour, corn meal, sugar, salt and baking soda in a large bowl.  Combine the milk and egg yolks to the dry ingredients and mix with an electric mixer on high speed until batter is smooth.

Dry off the hot dogs with a paper towel.  Jab the thin end of a single chopstick about halfway into the end of each hot dog.

When the oil is hot, tip the bowl of batter so that you can completely coat each hot dog.  Roll the hot dog in the batter until it is entirely covered with batter.  Hold the hot dog up by the stick and let some of the batter drip off.  Quickly submerge the hot dog in the oil and spin it slowly so that the coating cooks evenly.

After about 20 seconds you can use a lid to the deep fryer or pan to put weight on the stick, keeping the hot dog fully immersed in the oil.  You can cook a couple dogs at a time this way.  Cook for 5 to 6 minutes or until coating is dark brown.  Turn them once or twice as they cook.  Drain on paper towels while cooling, and repeat with remaining hot dogs.

This recipe yields 10 hot dogs.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     garnet yams
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
     1/2           cup  whipped butter

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake yams for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  When they are done, they will be very soft in the center, and you will see liquid from the potato oozing out and charring.  When the potato is sliced open, the inside of the skin will be charred black from the caramelizing sugar in the potato.  This is a perfectly cooked potato.

Combine the cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl.

To serve, slice a potato down the center.  Add two tablespoons of whipped butter, then sprinkle some cinnamon/sugar over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  sesame seed bun - (4 3/4" dia)
  5             ounces  ground beef
                        Seasoned salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  ketchup
  1         tablespoon  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  chopped onion
  3                     pickle slices (hamburger style)
     1/2           cup  chopped lettuce
  1              large  tomato slice
                        Non-stick cooking spray

Form the ground beef into a very large patty on wax paper.  Make it approximately 5 1/2 to 6 inches in diameter (the meat should shrink to the perfect size for the buns when cooked).  Freeze this patty for a couple hours before cooking.

Grill the faces of the hamburger bun in a hot skillet over medium heat.  Grill until the buns are golden brown.  Leave pan hot.

Grill the frozen patty in the pan for 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Sprinkle one side with seasoned salt and ground black pepper.

Prepare the rest of the burger by first spreading the 2 teaspoons of ketchup on the face of the top bun.  Follow the ketchup with the tablespoon of mayonnaise.  Stack the onion onto the top bun next, followed by the pickles and lettuce.  Add the tomato slice to the top of the stack.

When the beef patty is done cooking, use a spatula to arrange it on the bottom bun.  Turn the top of the burger over onto the bottom and serve.

This recipe yields 1 hamburger.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast                       Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8             ounces  deli-sliced ham - (2 to 3 slices
                        per sandwich)
  4                     plain bagels
  8             slices  Kraft Singles American cheese
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  creamy dill mustard

First prepare the sauce by combining the mayonnaise with the dill mustard in a small bowl.   Set this aside until you are ready to use it.

To prepare the eggs it's best to make one at a time in a small 6-inch skillet.  If you have more than one of these small pans, you can save a little time.

Beat an egg in a small bowl with a whisk until it is smooth, but not foamy.  Add a pinch of salt and pepper to the egg.  Heat a small 6-inch skillet over low heat.  Add 1/4 teaspoon of butter to the pan.  When the butter has melted add the egg to the pan.  Swirl the pan so that the egg spreads evenly.

As the egg begins to cook, use a spatula to pull in a couple of the edges so that raw egg flows from the top onto the hot pan.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then fold over one of the edges of the egg using a spoon or fork.  Fold it down about an inch.  Fold the opposite end over as well.  Then fold the remaining two edges over, creating a small rectangular or square mini-omelette.  Flip the little omelette over and turn off the heat.

Heat up the ham in a covered dish in the microwave for 1 minute.  This will make it hot, and keep it from drying.

Slice a bagel in half and place it with the faces up on a baking sheet.  Grill the faces of the bagel halves in your oven set on broil until golden brown.  You may also use a toaster oven for this step, but be sure to place the sliced bagel halves onto a small baking sheet or on aluminum foil.

When the bagels are toasted, spread about 1/2 tablespoon of the sauce onto the face of the top bagel half.  Place a slice of cheese onto the face of each bagel half.  Place the finished omelette onto the cheese on the bottom half of the sandwich.  Place the ham onto the egg.

Finish by flipping the top half of the sandwich over onto the bottom.  Heat for 15 seconds in microwave if needed to warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  minced green pepper
  2          teaspoons  minced white onion
  4                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  butter
                        Salt -- to taste

  4                     plain bagels
  4             slices  Kraft Singles American cheese
  4             slices  Kraft Singles Monterey Jack cheese
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  creamy dill mustard

First prepare the sauce by combining the mayonnaise with the dill mustard in a small bowl.  Set this aside until you are ready to use it.

To prepare the eggs it's best to make one at a time in a small 6-inch skillet.  If you have more than one of these small pans, you can save a little time.

First preheat pan over low heat.  Add 1/4 teaspoon of butter.  Add 1/2 teaspoon of minced green pepper along with 1/2 teaspoon minced white onion to the pan and sautÈ for a couple minutes, or until softened.

Beat an egg in a small bowl with a whisk until it is smooth, but not foamy.  Add a pinch of salt and pepper to the egg.  Add the egg to the pan with the vegetables.  Swirl the pan so that the egg spreads out.

As the egg begins to cook, use a spatula to pull in a couple of the edges so that raw egg flows around from the top onto the hot pan.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then fold over one of the edges of the egg using a spoon or fork.  Fold it down about an inch.  Fold the opposite end over as well.  Then fold the remaining two edges over, creating a small rectangular or square mini-omelet.  Flip the little omelets over and turn off the heat.

Press the sausage into four 2-ounce patties approximately the size of the bagel.  Cook the sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until brown.  Drain when done.

Slice a bagel in half and place it with the faces up on a baking sheet.  Grill the faces of the bagel halves in your oven set on broil until golden brown.  You may also use a toaster oven for this step, but be sure to place the sliced bagel halves onto a small baking sheet or on aluminum foil.

When the bagels are toasted, spread about 1/2 tablespoon of the sauce onto the face of the top bagel half.  Place a slice of American cheese onto the face of the top bagel half.  Place a slice of Monterey Jack cheese over the face of the bottom bagel half.  Place a sausage patty on the cheese on the bottom bagel half.  Place the finished omelet onto the sausage on the bottom half of the sandwich.

Finish by flipping the top half of the sandwich over onto the bottom.  Heat for 15 seconds in microwave if needed to warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

First prepare the sauce by combining the mayonnaise with the dill mustard in a small bowl.  Set this aside until you are ready to use it.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare the eggs it&apos;s best to make one at a time in a small 6-inch skillet.  If you have more than one of these small pans, you can save a little time.
</DirT>
<DirT>
First preheat pan over low heat.  Add 1/4 teaspoon of butter.  Add 1/2 teaspoon of minced green pepper along with 1/2 teaspoon minced white onion to the pan and sautÈ for a couple minutes, or until softened.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat an egg in a small bowl with a whisk until it is smooth, but not foamy.  Add a pinch of salt and pepper to the egg.  Add the egg to the pan with the vegetables.  Swirl the pan so that the egg spreads out.
</DirT>
<DirT>
As the egg begins to cook, use a spatula to pull in a couple of the edges so that raw egg flows around from the top onto the hot pan.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then fold over one of the edges of the egg using a spoon or fork.  Fold it down about an inch.  Fold the opposite end over as well.  Then fold the remaining two edges over, creating a small rectangular or square mini-omelet.  Flip the little omelets over and turn off the heat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  1              slice  white onion -- quartered
  1            package  Steak-Umm chopped steak - (14 oz) -- 7 steaks
  4                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     plain bagels
  8             slices  Kraft Singles American cheese
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  creamy dill mustard

First prepare the sauce by combining the mayonnaise with the dill mustard in a small bowl.  Set this aside until you are ready to use it.

Heat 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium heat.  Separate the onion slices and sautÈ in the oil until light brown.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Break up the sandwich steak into the hot pan and cook until brown.  Drain off fat.  Add the grilled onions to the meat and stir.

To make the eggs it's best to make one at a time in a small 6-inch skillet.  If you have more than one of these small pans, you can save a little time.

Beat an egg in a small bowl with a whisk until it is smooth, but not foamy.  Add a pinch of salt and pepper to the egg.  Heat a small 6-inch skillet over low heat.  Add 1/4 teaspoon of butter to the pan.  When the butter has melted add the egg to the pan.  Swirl the pan so that the egg spreads evenly.

As the egg begins to cook, use a spatula to pull in a couple of the edges so that raw egg flows from the top onto the hot pan.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then fold over one of the edges of the egg using a spoon or fork.  Fold it down about an inch.  Fold the opposite end over as well.  Then fold the remaining two edges over, creating a small rectangular or square mini-omelette.  Flip the little omelette over and turn off the heat.

Slice a bagel in half and place it with the faces up on a baking sheet.  Grill the faces of the bagel halves in your oven set on broil until golden brown.  You may also use a toaster oven for this step, but be sure to place the sliced bagel halves onto a small baking sheet or on aluminum foil.

When the bagels are toasted, spread about 1/2 tablespoon of the sauce onto the face of the top bagel half.  Place a slice of cheese onto the face of each bagel half.  Divide the meat into four portions and stack one portion onto the cheese on the bottom bagel half.  Place the finished omelette onto the meat on the bottom half of the sandwich.

Finish by flipping the top half of the sandwich over onto the bottom.  Heat for 15 seconds in microwave if needed to warm.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  butter
  3             medium  white onions -- sliced
  3               cans  beef broth - (14 oz ea) -- Swanson is best
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
  3        tablespoons  Kraft grated parmesan cheese
  6             slices  French bread baguette - (to 12 slices)
  6             slices  Swiss cheese
  6             slices  mozzarella cheese
  6        tablespoons  shredded parmesan cheese

SautÈ onions in melted butter in a large soup pot or saucepan for 15 to 20 minutes or until onions begin to brown and turn transparent.

Add beef broth, salt and garlic powder to onions.  Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 1 hour.  Add the grated parmesan cheese in the last 10 minutes of cooking the soup.

When soup is done, preheat oven to 350 degrees and toast the French bread slices for about 10 to 12 minutes or until they begin to brown.  When bread is done, set oven to broil.

Build each serving of soup by spooning about 1 cup of soup into an oven-safe bowl.  Float a toasted slice or two of bread on top of the soup, then add a slice of Swiss cheese on top of that.  Place a slice of mozzarella on next and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of shredded parmesan cheese over the top of the other cheeses.

Place the soup bowl on a baking sheet and broil for 5 to 6 minutes or until the cheese begins to brown.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

When soup is done, preheat oven to 350 degrees and toast the French bread slices for about 10 to 12 minutes or until they begin to brown.  When bread is done, set oven to broil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Build each serving of soup by spooning about 1 cup of soup into an oven-safe bowl.  Float a toasted slice or two of bread on top of the soup, then add a slice of Swiss cheese on top of that.  Place a slice of mozzarella on next and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of shredded parmesan cheese over the top of the other cheeses.

<DirT>
Place the soup bowl on a baking sheet and broil for 5 to 6 minutes or until the cheese begins to brown.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     egg whites
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  5        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  molasses
  1 1/2           cups  banana puree -- see * Note
  3        tablespoons  shortening
     1/4           cup  whole milk
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla butter nut extract
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda

* Note:  Puree whole bananas (approximately 3) in a food processor or blender until smooth and creamy.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a large bowl, whip the egg whites with an electric mixer until they become thick.  Do not use a plastic bowl for this.  Add the sugar to the egg whites and continue to beat until the mixture forms soft peaks.  Add the brown sugar, molasses, banana puree, shortening, milk and vanilla butter nut flavoring to the mixture, beating after each addition.

In a separate bowl, combine the remaining ingredients.  While beating the wet mixture, slowly add the bowl of dry ingredients.

Lightly grease a 9- by 14-inch pan with a light coating of non-stick cooking spray.  Be sure to coat the sides as well as the bottom of the pan.  Dump about 3 tablespoons of sugar into the pan, then tilt and shake the pan so that a light layer of sugar coats the entire bottom of the pan, and about halfway up the sides.  Pour out the excess sugar.

Pour the batter into the pan, and spread it evenly around the inside of the pan.  Sprinkle a light coating of sugar -- about two tablespoons -- over the entire top surface of the batter.  Gently shake the pan from side-to-side to evenly distribute the sugar over the batter.  Bake for 25 to 28 minutes or until the cake begins to pull away from the sides of the pan.

Remove the cake from the oven and turn it out onto a cooling rack.  When cake has cooled, place it onto a sheet of wax paper on a cutting board and slice across the cake 6 times, creating 7 even slices.  Next cut the cake lengthwise twice, into thirds, creating a total of 21 snack bars.  When the bars have completely cooled, store them in a resealable plastic bag or an airtight container.

This recipe yields 21 bars.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Candies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  20                    caramels -- unwrapped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  water
  2               cups  dry roasted peanuts
  1                     bag milk chocolate chips - (12 oz)
                        === CENTERS ===
     1/4           cup  whole milk
  5                     caramels -- unwrapped
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup
  1           teaspoon  butter
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  powdered sugar

Combine all ingredients for the centers, except the powdered sugar, in a small saucepan over low heat.  Stir often as the caramel slowly melts.  When the mixture is smooth, add 3/4 cup of powdered sugar.  Stir.  Save the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar for later.

Use a candy thermometer to bring the mixture to exactly 230 degrees, stirring often, then turn off the heat.  When the temperature of the candy begins to drop, add the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar to the pan, then use a hand mixer on high speed to combine.  Keep mixing until the candy cools and thickens and can no longer be mixed.  That should take a minute or two.

Let the candy cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it can be touched.  Don't let it sit too long -- you want the candy to still be warm and pliable when you shape it.  Take a tablespoon-size portion and roll it between your palms or on a countertop until it forms a roll with the width of your index finger, and measuring about 4 1/2-inches long.  Repeat with the remaining center candy mixture and place the rolls on wax paper.  You should have 8 rolls.  Let the center rolls sit out for an hour or two to firm up.

Combine the 20 caramels with the 1 1/2 teaspoons of water in a small saucepan over low heat.   Stir often until the caramels melt completely, then turn off the heat.  If you work fast this caramel will stay warm while you make the candy bars.

Pour the peanuts onto a baking sheet or other flat surface.  Using a basting brush and working quickly, "paint" a coating of caramel onto one side of a center roll.  Quickly turn the center over, caramel-side-down, onto the peanuts and press gently so that the peanuts stick to the surface of the candy.  Paint more caramel onto the other side of the roll and press it down onto the peanuts.  The candy should have a solid layer of peanuts covering all sides.  If needed, brush additional caramel onto the roll, then turn it onto the peanuts to coat the roll completely.  Place the candy bar onto wax paper, and repeat with the remaining ingredients.  Place these bars into your refrigerator for an hour or two so that they firm up.

Pour the milk chocolate chips into a glass or ceramic bowl and zap it in the microwave for 2 minutes on 50% power.  Gently stir the chips, then heat for an additional 30 seconds at 50% power.  Repeat if necessary, stirring gently after each 30 seconds.  Don't over cook the chips or the chocolate will burn and seize up on you.

Drop a candy bar center into the melted milk chocolate.  Cover the candy bar with chocolate using two forks, one in each hand.  When the candy is covered with chocolate, balance the bar on both of the forks, one at each end of the candy bar, and tap the forks on the top edge of the bowl so that much of the chocolate drops off.  Carefully place the candy bar onto wax paper and remove the two forks.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients, and then chill the candy bars until firm.

This recipe yields 8 candy bars.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  ground beef
  8                     hamburger buns
  16            slices  Kraft cheddar cheese Singles
     1/2           cup  diced onion
  32                    hamburger pickle slices - (to 40)
  8             slices  large beefsteak tomato, 1/2" thick
     1/4           cup  yellow mustard
                        === CHILI ===
  1              pound  ground beef (not lean) -- see * Note
     1/4           cup  flour -- plus
  1 1/4           cups  flour
  1 1/3           cups  beef broth
  4               cups  water
  3        tablespoons  chili powder
  2         tablespoon  grated (and then chopped) carrot
  1         tablespoon  white vinegar
  2          teaspoons  dried minced onion
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder

* Note:  Make sure the ground beef you use for the chili has a fat content of at least 20 percent.  This way you'll be sure to get enough fat to make the roux.

Prepare the chili by first browning the meat in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Crumble the meat as it browns.  When the meat has been entirely cooked (7 to 10 minutes), pour the meat into a strainer over a large cup or saucepan.  Let the fat drip out of the meat for about 5 minutes, then return the meat back to the first saucepan.  Cover and set aside.

With the fat from the meat, we will now make a roux -- a French contribution to thicker sauces and gravies usually made with fat and flour.  Heat the drippings in a saucepan over medium heat (you should have drained off around 1/2 cup of the stuff).  When the fat is hot, add 1/4 cup flour to the pan and stir well.  Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue to heat the roux, stirring often until it is a rich caramel color.  This should take from 10 to 15 minutes.  Add the beef broth to the pan and stir.  Remove from heat.

Meanwhile, back at the other pan, add the water to the beef, then whisk in the remaining 1 1/4 cups flour.  Add the roux/broth mixture and the other chili ingredients and whisk until blended.  Make sure your grated carrot is chopped up to the size of rice before you add it.

Crank the heat up to medium-high.  Stir often until you see bubbles forming on the surface of the chili.  Turn the heat down to medium-low, and continue to simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thick.  The chili should be calmly bubbling like lava as it simmers.  When it's done cooking, take the chili off the heat, cover it, and let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour before using it on the burgers.  It should thicken to a tasty brown paste as it sits.

To make your hamburgers, you'll first divide 3 pounds of hamburger into 16 portions of 3 ounces each.  Grill the burgers in a hot skillet or on an indoor griddle for 4 to 5 minutes per side or until done.  Use some salt and pepper on each patty.

Build the burgers by lightly toasting the faces of the hamburger buns.  Turn them over into a hot skillet or a griddle on medium heat.

Place one patty onto the bottom bun.  Position two slices of cheese on the meat.  Place another beef patty on the cheese.  Spoon about 1/3 cup of chili onto the beef patty.  Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of diced onion onto the chili.  Arrange 4 to 5 pickle slices on the onion.  Place a thick slice of tomato on next.

Spread mustard over the face of the top bun and top off your hamburger by turning this bun over onto the tomato.

This recipe yields 8 burgers with 6 cups of chili.

* Note:  Make sure the ground beef you use for the chili has a fat content of at least 20 percent.  This way you&apos;ll be sure to get enough fat to make the roux.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare the chili by first browning the meat in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Crumble the meat as it browns.  When the meat has been entirely cooked (7 to 10 minutes), pour the meat into a strainer over a large cup or saucepan.  Let the fat drip out of the meat for about 5 minutes, then return the meat back to the first saucepan.  Cover and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With the fat from the meat, we will now make a roux -- a French contribution to thicker sauces and gravies usually made with fat and flour.  Heat the drippings in a saucepan over medium heat (you should have drained off around 1/2 cup of the stuff).  When the fat is hot, add 1/4 cup flour to the pan and stir well.  Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue to heat the roux, stirring often until it is a rich caramel color.  This should take from 10 to 15 minutes.  Add the beef broth to the pan and stir.  Remove from heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, back at the other pan, add the water to the beef, then whisk in the remaining 1 1/4 cups flour.  Add the roux/broth mixture and the other chili ingredients and whisk until blended.  Make sure your grated carrot is chopped up to the size of rice before you add it.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Crank the heat up to medium-high.  Stir often until you see bubbles forming on the surface of the chili.  Turn the heat down to medium-low, and continue to simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thick.  The chili should be calmly bubbling like lava as it simmers.  When it&apos;s done cooking, take the chili off the heat, cover it, and let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour before using it on the burgers.  It should thicken to a tasty brown paste as it sits.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make your hamburgers, you&apos;ll first divide 3 pounds of hamburger into 16 portions of 3 ounces each.  Grill the burgers in a hot skillet or on an indoor griddle for 4 to 5 minutes per side or until done.  Use some salt and pepper on each patty.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Build the burgers by lightly toasting the faces of the hamburger buns.  Turn them over into a hot skillet or a griddle on medium heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place one patty onto the bottom bun.  Position two slices of cheese on the meat.  Place another beef patty on the cheese.  Spoon about 1/3 cup of chili onto the beef patty.  Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of diced onion onto the chili.  Arrange 4 to 5 pickle slices on the onion.  Place a thick slice of tomato on next.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread mustard over the face of the top bun and top off your hamburger by turning this bun over onto the tomato.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 burgers with 6 cups of chili.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  vanilla ice cream
     1/2           cup  caramel topping (Smucker's is good)
  1 1/2           cups  whipped cream
  4                     fresh strawberries
                        === CANDIED PECANS ===
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  butter
  1 1/4           cups  chopped pecans
                        === CINNAMON CROUTONS ===
  2               cups  cubed Honey Wheat Bushman Bread -- (see recipe, or
                        another sweet bread such as Hawaiian Sweet
                        Bread or Pillsbury Honey White Bread)
     1/3           cup  salted butter
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
                        === CINNAMON APPLES ===
  1                can  apple pie filling - (20 oz)
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar

For candied pecans, combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons water, 1 teaspoon butter, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Heat until mixture boils and all sugar granules are dissolved.  Add chopped pecans to mixture and stir for 1 to 2 minutes over heat.  Be sure that all pecans are well-coated.

Pour mixture onto a large plate and continue to stir until mixture hardens and begins to break up.  You should be able to separate all of the nuts.

For the croutons, preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Pour the slice bread cubes onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the bread has turned light brown.   Stir halfway through cooking time.

Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat.  Pour baked croutons into the pan and sautÈ until the bread is well-coated with butter.  Combine the 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon in a small bowl.  Sprinkle this mixture over the croutons while stirring so that the croutons are well-coated with cinnamon/sugar.  Remove croutons from the heat and pour them onto a plate to cool.

Prepare apples by carefully mixing them with 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar in a large bowl.  You want to be sure you don't stir hard enough to break up the apples.  Microwave the apple for 1 to 2 minutes or until hot.

To assemble the dessert for serving, first roll four cup-size scoops of ice cream in the pecan pieces.  You can do this step ahead of time if you like, keeping the pecan-covered scoops in your freezer.

Place an ice cream scoop onto a small plate, then pour about a tablespoon of caramel over the ice cream.  Dribble another tablespoon around the base of the ice cream onto the plate.  Spread the hot apples around the base of the ice cream being sure to divide them evenly amongst the four servings.

Divide the croutons into four portions and sprinkle them on the apples around the base of the ice cream scoop on each plate.

Spread a generous portion of whipped cream onto the top of each scoop of ice cream.  Top off each dish with a fresh strawberry.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Margarita salt -- for rim of glass

If you want salt on the rim of your glass, moisten the rim of a 16-ounce mug (or glass) and dip it in margarita salt.

To make the drink, fill the glass with ice.  Add a shot of tequila, a half shot of Triple Sec, then some sweet and sour mix and cranberry juice (in equal amounts -- about 1/3 cup each should do it) to within a half-inch of the top of the glass.  Stir.

Splash a half shot of Grand Marnier over the top of the drink.  Add a wedge of lime and serve with a straw.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  warm tap water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1            package  active dry yeast
  3 1/2           cups  flour
     1/2           cup  coarse-ground cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  oil
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  mozzarella -- sliced
  1              pound  sausage -- removed from the
                        casing and crumbled
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz) -- drained, and
                        coarsely crushed
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3          teaspoons  dried oregano
                        = (or 5 fresh basil leaves, shredded)
  4        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Crust:  Pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve the yeast with a fork.  Add 1 cup of flour, all of the cornmeal, salt, and vegetable oil.  Mix well with a spoon.  Continue stirring in the rest of the flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl.  Flour your hands and the work surface and kneed the ball of dough until it is no longer sticky.

Let the dough rise in an oiled bowl, sealed with plastic  wrap, for 45 to 60 minutes in a warm place, until it is doubled in bulk.  Punch it down and kneed it briefly.  Press it into an oiled 15-inch deep dish pizza pan, until it comes 2 inches up the sides and is even on the bottom of the pan.  Let the  dough rise 15 to 20 minutes before filling.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

While the dough is rising, prepare the filling.  Cook the crumbled sausage until it is no longer pink, drain it of its excess fat.  Drain and chop the tomatoes.

When the dough has finished its second rising, lay the cheese over the dough shell.  Then distribute the sausage and garlic over the cheese.  Top with the tomatoes.  Sprinkle on the seasonings and parmesan cheese.

Bake for 15 minutes at 500 degrees.  Then lower the temperature to 400 degrees and bake for 25 to 35 minutes longer.  Lift up a section of the crust from time to time with a spatula to check on its color.  The crust will be golden brown when done.

Serve immediately.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pieces  bacon
  5              large  shrimp
  3             slices  fresh jalapeÒo
  1              ounce  pepper-jack cheese
                        === SEASONING ===
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
  1               dash  cayenne pepper
  1               dash  allspice
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  ranch dressing
     1/4      teaspoon  dried cilantro

Preheat oven to broil.

Make the seasoning blend by combining the ingredients in a small bowl.  Set this aside.

Make the dipping sauce by combining the ranch dressing with cilantro in a medium bowl.

Cook the bacon in a frying pan over medium-high heat, but don't cook it all the way to crispy.  You want undercooked bacon that, when cool, will easily wrap around the shrimp.  Cook the bacon about 3 minutes per side, and don't let it brown.  When the bacon is done lay it on paper towels to drain and cool.

Shell the shrimp, leaving the last segment of the shell and the tail.  Remove the dark vein from the back of the shrimp, and then cut down into the back of the shrimp, without cutting all the way through, so that the shrimp is nearly butterflied open.  This will make a pocket for the pepper and cheese.

Pour 1 cup of water into a small bowl.  Add the shrimp and jalapeÒo peppers and microwave for 60 to 90 seconds.  Shrimp should be starting to firm up and change color.  Immediately pour the water out of the bowl, remove the jalapeÒo slices and pour cold water over the shrimp.  Place the the shrimp and jalapeÒo pepper slices onto paper towels to drain off excess water.

Build the appetizer by cutting the jalapeÒo slices in half and removing the seeds.  You should now have 6 jalapeÒo slices -- you'll need 5 of these.  Place one slice into the slit on the back of a shrimp.  Cut an inch-long chunk of cheese (about 1/4-inch thick), and place it on the jalapeÒo slice.  Wrap a piece of bacon around the shrimp, starting where the cheese is.  Start wrapping with the thinnest end of the bacon.  Go 1 1/2 times around the shrimp and then cut off the excess bacon and slide a skewer through the shrimp, starting with the end where the cheese is and piercing the cut end of the bacon on the other side.  Repeat with the remaining shrimp and slide them onto the skewer with the tails facing the same direction.

Put the skewer onto a baking sheet or broiler pan and sprinkle a very light coating of the seasoning blend over the shrimp, then broil for 3 to 4 minutes or until the bacon begins to brown and the cheese begins to ooze.  Serve over a bed of rice if desired.  Feed the left over bacon pieces to the dog while you scarf out on the shrimp.

This recipe yields 2 servings as an appetizer.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches                      Wraps


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     thin slices monterey jack cheese
  8                     thin slices cheddar cheese
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, diced
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh chives
  4              large  spring roll wrappers
  1                     beaten egg
  6               cups  vegetable oil - (to 10 cups)
                        Marinara (pasta) sauce -- on the side

Use a sharp knife to make 8 thin slices each from the end of standard-size hunks of cheddar and monterey jack cheeses.

Arrange 2 slices of cheddar and 2 slices of jack on your hand, then sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of diced jalapeÒo on top of the cheese.  Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of minced chives on next.  Sandwich the peppers and chives between the cheese and roll it all up.  Fold the cheese and squeeze it all together so that the peppers and chives are well sealed into the middle of the cheeses.

Lay a spring roll wrapper with one corner pointing away from you.  Arrange the cheese lengthwise on the center of the wrapper.  Fold one of the side corners over the cheese filling.   Brush a little beaten egg on the tip of the other side corner and fold it over the first corner so that it sticks.  Brush some beaten egg on the corner pointing away from you.  Fold the bottom corner up and over the filling.  Roll the wrapper up, keeping it tight, until it rolls over the top corner with the egg on it.  It should stick.  Repeat with the remaining rolls, then cover them all and chill for at least 30 minutes.  This will be long enough to heat up the oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees.

When the oil is hot, fry the rolls for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes or until the outside is golden brown.  Drain the rolls on a rack or paper towels for 2 minutes before serving with your favorite marinara sauce on the side for dipping.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  whole-wheat flour
     1/4           cup  bran
  2          teaspoons  baking powder

     2/3           cup  1% buttermilk
     2/3           cup  dates

Combine the all-purpose and whole wheat flours, bran, baking powder, soda, salt, cinnamon and brown sugar.  Cut in the butter.  Add the egg, buttermilk and dates; do not over mix.  (If the dough seems too sticky to work with, add a couple more tablespoons flour.)

                    Taco Bell's Enchirito - (Improved)

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ground beef
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried minced onion
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  onion powder
  1               dash  garlic powder
     1/2           cup  water
  1                can  refried beans - (16 oz)
  10             small  flour tortillas, fajita size - (to 12)
     1/4                onion -- diced (abt 1/2 cup)
  1                can  La Victoria red chile sauce - (10 oz)
  2               cups  shredded cheddar cheese

In a medium bowl, combine the ground beef with the flour, chili powder, salt, minced onion, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder.  Use your hands to thoroughly mix the ingredients into the ground beef.

Add the seasoned beef mixture to the water in a skillet over medium heat.  Mix well with a wooden spoon or spatula, and break up the meat as it cooks.  Heat for 8 to 10 minutes, or until browned.  The finished product should be very smooth with no large chunks of beef remaining.

Heat up the refried beans in a medium sauce pan over medium heat, or in the microwave for a couple of minutes on high.

Warm the tortillas in a steamer, or wrap them in a moist towel and microwave for 1 minute on high.  You may also heat up the tortillas individually by placing them in a hot pan over medium heat for about 15 seconds per side.

Spoon about 3 tablespoons of refried beans down the center of each tortilla.  Spoon 3 tablespoons of beef on top of the beans followed by a couple teaspoons of minced onion.  Fold the two sides of the tortilla over the beans and meat and flip the tortilla over onto a plate.

Spoon a couple tablespoons of red sauce over the top of the tortilla, then sprinkle on a couple tablespoons of the shredded cheddar cheese.  Heat up the dish for 30 to 45 seconds in the microwave, or until the cheese on top begins to melt.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

This recipe yields 10 to 12.

Comments:  Since Taco Bell brought the Enchirito back from the dead a couple years ago the product's formula has changed a bit.  With the exclusion of the sliced black olives on top, plus a few other minor changes, this recipe represents the "new" formulation of the chain's enchilada/burrito fusion product first introduced in the early 60's.  The technique for preparation has also been improved from the recipe found in the first Top Secret Recipes book and published on the Web site.  So, until Taco Bell changes it again, this is the ultimate clone that makes enough for an entire family of Enchirito lovers.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Puddings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     loaf white bread - (16 oz) -- cut in 1" cubes
     1/2           cup  sweetened shredded coconut
     1/3           cup  dried apricots -- julienne cut
  30            ounces  Coco Lopez cream of coconut
  2               cups  whole milk
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  6                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
                        === FOR SERVING AND GARNISH ===
                        Vanilla ice cream
                        Chocolate shavings
                        Whipped cream
                        Toasted coconut
                        Powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Line bottom of a 10- by 13- by 3-inch pan with half of the white bread.  Evenly sprinkle half of the julienne apricots and half of the shredded coconut over the white bread.  Top that with the remaining bread cubes and then the remaining apricots and coconut.  Distribute evenly.

In a sauce pan, heat milk, coconut cream, vanilla and granulated sugar until the sugar completely dissolves and the milk is tepid but not hot.  Stir occasionally.  Remove from heat.

In a separate mixing bowl, beat the eggs, then temper them by slowly adding 1 cup of warm milk mixture while stirring.  Slowly pour the egg/milk mixture back in the warm milk and stir until well incorporated.

Ladle the mixture over the bread, making sure all the bread gets moist.  Cover with foil and bake in a water bath for 1 hour.  Remove foil and bake for another 5 to 10 minutes until golden.

Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on one side and whipped cream on the other.  Sprinkle whipped cream with chocolate shavings and dust bread pudding with powdered sugar.  Finish with toasted coconut on the ice cream.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                          Waffle House's Waffles

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened
  2        tablespoons  shortening
     1/2           cup  half-and-half
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  buttermilk
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla

Combine flour, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl.  Stir to combine.

Lightly beat the egg in another medium bowl.  Add the sugar, butter, and shortening and mix well with an electric mixer until smooth.  Add the half-and-half, milk, buttermilk and vanilla.  Mix well.

Add the dry flour mixture to the wet mixture while beating.  Mix until smooth.  Cover and chill overnight.  (You can use batter right away if you like, but a good 12-hour chill makes the batter better.)

Rub a light coating of vegetable oil on a waffle iron.  Preheat the waffle iron.  Leave the batter out of the refrigerator to warm up a bit as your waffle iron is preheating.

Spoon 1/3 to 1/2 cup of batter into the waffle iron and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until the waffles are light brown.

This recipe yields 6 waffles.

Comments:  For the best results you really should chill the batter overnight in the fridge as they do in each of the restaurants.  The recipe still works fine if you cook up the waffles the same day.  At least wait for 15 to 20 minutes after you make the batter so that it can rest and thicken a bit.

Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  ground chuck
  1                     plain jumbo-sized sandwich bun -- (potato kind)
                        === CONDIMENTS ===
  1         tablespoon  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  HeinzÆ ketchup
                        Mustard -- as needed
  3             slices  HeinzÆ genuine dill pickle - (thin slices)
  2                     iceberg lettuce leaves - (to 3)
  2                     white onion rings - (to 3)
  1                     tomato slice
                        Cheese -- (optional)

Using waxed paper, form the 1/4 pound of beef into a 4-inch square patty.  Refrigerate until you're ready to cook.

Pre-heat an electric griddle to 375 to 400 degrees.  After its ready, toast the bun faces lightly...about 30 seconds.  Don't brown as much as the McDonald's or Burger King buns.  Set the bun(s) aside.

Cook the fresh or thawed burger patty about 3 minutes on the pre-heated griddle, salting the top immediately after laying it down.  After 3 minutes, turn the patty over, salt again, and cook for 3 more minutes.

While the burger is cooking, dress your toasted top bun in the following order:  1 tablespoon mayonnaise;  1 tablespoon HeinzÆ ketchup;  3 thin slices HeinzÆ genuine dills;  2 to 3 rings of fresh sliced white onion;  1 tomato slice;  2 to 3 iceberg lettuce leaves;  5 to 6 squirts of yellow mustard, evenly spaced.

After the meat is finished cooking, drain the exess fat by tilting to the side and applying pressure with your free hand.  Place the patty on top of the dressed bun, and add the toasted bottom bun.

Turn right side up, and eat -- or wrap in a 12- by 12-inch sheet of foil and allow to sit in a warm place 3 to 5 minutes before eating.

This recipe yields 1 burger.

Comments:  If you'd like the classic Wendy'sÆ double, cook two patties, and dress the bun the same.  If adding cheese, use only real American cheese and place it on top of the dressed bun prior to adding the cooked beef.  Double cheese?  Do the same.

For Wendy'sÆ classic bacon cheese burger, cook the burger and dress the bun as directed above.  For the bacon, use Oscar-MayerÆ Ready-Madeô pre-cooked bacon.  Simply microwave 2 slices for about 30 seconds, and add to your burger between the cheese and the beef patty.

Making the Beef Patties:  Divide the ground chuck into four equal sized portions.  On waxed paper, press each portion out into a square, evenly thick 5- by 5-inch patty.  Take a knife, and make two crosscuts on each of the four 1/4 pound patties, creating four smaller, equally-sized square sub-patties, 1/16 pound each (Do not separate them.  These cuts are for easy separation later.)

Using a clean pen cap as a "cookie cutter", make five small holes arranged like a "5" on dice in all four sub-patties (total of 16 patties....80 holes).  Keep the fresh beef patties flat on the waxed paper, and freeze for at least an hour (place them in the freezer like cookies in an oven).

For the Buns:  Use regular dinner rolls available at your supermarket.  They normally come 16 to a pack, and are 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 inches square.  You'll have to turn them sideways, and slice them right down the middle to create a "top" and "bottom".  Actually, the top should be slightly thicker than the bottom.  These work perfectly.

For the Onions:  Use the dried, chopped onions found in the spice aisle at your supermarket.  Make sure they're the "chopped" size, not "minced" size.  Use about 3 teaspoons (dry) for each set of four White Castle Sliders you plan to prepare.  Soak the onions in water for at least 30 minutes prior to using.  Drain the excess water.

For the Pickles:  Use Heinz Genuine sour dills, or Vlasic Original dills.  Neither of these come pre-sliced, so you'll have to slice them.  Slice them very thin.  I suggest cutting them at an angle....this will give you bigger chips.

Cooking your White Castle Sliders:  Steam Grilling is the cooking method used at White-Castle.  The patties are never "flipped", as the holes in them allow even cooking.

Pre-heat an electric griddle to 375 degrees.

Separate your pre-made, still-frozen beef patties into the four smaller pre-cut patties.  For each patty you intend to cook, evenly "pile" about 2 teaspoons of the prepared onions on the griddle and spread them out to a 2- by 2-inch square.  Add a dash of salt and pepper to each.  On top each "pile" of onions, place one frozen patty, pushing down to embed the beef patty firmly on top.  Add a dash of salt and pepper to the top of the beef patty.

Cook the beef patties on top of the onions for about 3 minutes.  After 3 minutes, add the pickle slice and put the tops of the buns on top of the burgers -- while they're still cooking.   Cook for an addtional minute.

Using a sharp spatula, lift each beef patty off the giddle one at a time, placing on the bottom of the bun.  Try to get as many onions as possible (your free hand will be holding down the top of the bun to the beef patty as you do this).

Dress your White-Castle Sliders as you wish.

This recipe yields 16 sliders.

Comments:  If you want cheese-sliders, divide one slice of real American Cheese into four square pieces and place on the top of the beef patty just prior to removing it from the griddle.
