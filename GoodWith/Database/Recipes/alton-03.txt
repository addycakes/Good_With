--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     ancho chiles -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and sliced
  3                     cascabel chiles -- stemmed, seeded,

  3                     dried arbol chiles -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and sliced
  2        tablespoons  whole cumin seeds
  2        tablespoons  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  smoked paprika

Place all of the chiles and the cumin into a medium nonstick saute pan or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook, moving the pan around constantly, until you begin to smell the cumin toasting, approximately 4 to 5 minutes.  Set aside and cool completely.

Once cool, place the chiles and cumin into the carafe of a blender along with the garlic powder, oregano, and paprika.  Process until a fine powder is formed.  Allow the powder to settle for at least a minute before removing the lid of the carafe.  Store in an airtight container for up to 6 months.

This recipe yields approximately 3/4 cup.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground nutmeg
  1         tablespoon  banana liqueur
  2                     under-ripe bananas -- halved lengthwise
     1/4           cup  dark rum
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-grated orange zest

Melt butter in a 10-inch heavy skillet over low heat.  Add brown sugar, allspice and nutmeg and stir until sugar dissolves.  Add banana liqueur and bring sauce to simmer.  Add bananas and cook for 1 minute on each side, carefully spooning sauce over bananas as they are cooking.  Remove bananas from pan to a serving dish.

Bring sauce to a simmer and carefully add the rum.  If the sauce is very hot, the alcohol will flame on its own.  If not, using stick flame, carefully ignite and continue cooking until flame dies out, approximately 1 to 2 minutes.  If sauce is too thin, cook for 1 to 2 minutes until it is syrupy in consistency.

Add orange zest and stir to combine.  Immediately spoon the sauce over bananas and serve.  Serve with waffles, crepes, or ice cream.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

With blender running, pour in 1/3 cup canola oil and blend until well combined.  Stop blender to brush down sides of container, if necessary.

Brush salmon with spice mixture.  Allow salmon to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to the high broiler setting.  Place salmon in the oven 6-inches from broiler.  Cook until salmon reaches an internal temperature of 131 degrees.  This will take approximately 15 minutes, but will vary with different ovens.  Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes, and then serve immediately.  Note that the internal temperature of the fish will a rise a little as carry-over cooking occurs.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  honey
     1/3           cup  walnut oil
  10            ounces  roasted cashews - (abt 2 cups)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Place the honey in a microwave-safe container and heat in the microwave for 15 seconds.  Remove from the microwave and add the oil to the container.  Place the nuts and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse for 5 seconds.

Then, while the processor is running, very slowly drizzle in the honey and oil.  Process until an emulsion is formed and the mixture is smooth; this will take approximately 45 seconds to 1 minute.  If the mixture is too thick and doesn't spread easily, add a little more oil.

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whole milk
  2               cups  water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
  1                cup  coarse-ground cornmeal
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4             ounces  sharp Cheddar -- shredded

Place the milk, water, and salt into a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat and bring to a boil.  Once the milk mixture comes to a boil, gradually add the cornmeal while continually whisking.

Once all of the cornmeal has been incorporated, decrease the heat to low and cover.  Remove lid and whisk frequently, every 3 to 4 minutes, to prevent grits from sticking or forming lumps; make sure to get into corners of pot when whisking.  Cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until mixture is creamy.

Remove from the heat, add the pepper and butter, and whisk to combine.  Once the butter is melted, gradually whisk in the cheese a little at a time.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  5             ounces  small diced onion - (abt 1 cup)
  5             ounces  small diced carrot - (abt 1 cup)
  5             ounces  small diced celery - (abt 1 cup)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- for sweating veggies
                        plus more if needed at end of cooking
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1              quart  chicken broth -- heated to a simmer
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                     bay leaf
  1                cup  heavy cream
  10            ounces  Fontina -- shredded
  1           teaspoon  Marsala wine
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  hot sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Melt butter in large heavy-bottomed soup pot over medium heat.  Add onion, carrot, celery, and salt.  Sweat for 5 to 10 minutes or until the vegetables begin to soften, stirring occasionally.  Sift the flour over the vegetables and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes.

Gradually add the chicken stock and bring to boil, stirring constantly.  Reduce heat to low and add the garlic and bay leaf.  Cover and simmer for 30 minutes or until vegetables are soft.

Remove bay leaf.  Turn off the heat, add the heavy cream, and then puree with an immersion blender or in a conventional blender.  Gradually add the cheese, 1 small handful at a time, and stir until melted before adding next handful.  Stir in the Marsala, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and white pepper.  Taste and add additional salt if desired.  If soup is not hot enough, return to a low heat until warmed through.

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 quarts; 4 servings.

Caution, when blending hot liquids:  Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes.  Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway.  If using a blender, release one corner of the lid.  This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions.  Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.

Melt butter in large heavy-bottomed soup pot over medium heat.  Add onion, carrot, celery, and salt.  Sweat for 5 to 10 minutes or until the vegetables begin to soften, stirring occasionally.  Sift the flour over the vegetables and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes.

Remove bay leaf.  Turn off the heat, add the heavy cream, and then puree with an immersion blender or in a conventional blender.  Gradually add the cheese, 1 small handful at a time, and stir until melted before adding next handful.  Stir in the Marsala, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and white pepper.  Taste and add additional salt if desired.  If soup is not hot enough, return to a low heat until warmed through.

Caution, when blending hot liquids:  Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes.  Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway.  If using a blender, release one corner of the lid.  This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions.  Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  dried parsley
  1           teaspoon  dried tarragon
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt -- plus
                        extra for seasoning chicken
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- plus
                        extra for seasoning chicken
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
  2                     large whole eggs -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water
  2               cups  Japanese bread crumbs (panko) -- plus
     1/4           cup  Japanese bread crumbs -- for filling
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

Combine butter, parsley, tarragon, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in the bowl of a stand mixer.  Place mixture on plastic wrap or waxed paper and roll into small log; place in freezer.

Place chicken breasts, 1 at a time, between 2 pieces of plastic wrap.  Squirt chicken lightly with water and squirt the top of the plastic wrap as well.  Pound to no less than 1/8-inch thickness.  Season each piece of chicken with salt and pepper.

Lay 1 chicken breast on a new piece of plastic wrap and place 1/4 of the compound butter and 1 tablespoon bread crumbs in the center of each breast.  Using the plastic wrap to assist, fold in ends of breast and roll breast into a log, completely enclosing the butter; roll very tightly.  Repeat with each breast.  Place chicken in refrigerator for 2 hours, or up to overnight.

Place egg and water mixture in 1 pie pan and 2 cups bread crumbs in a different pie pan.

Heat 1/2-inch of vegetable oil in a 12-inch saute pan over medium-high heat until oil reaches 375 degrees.

Dip each breast in the egg mixture and then roll in the bread crumbs.  Gently place each breast in oil, sealed-side down, and cook until golden brown, approximately 4 to 5 minutes on each side, until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.  Remove to a cooling rack set in sheet pan and allow to drain for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                             Chocolate Taffy

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Candies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sugar
     2/3           cup  Dutch process cocoa powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  light corn syrup
     1/4           cup  water -- plus
  1         tablespoon  water
  1           teaspoon  white vinegar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter -- plus
                        additional for greasing pan and hands

In heavy medium saucepan, combine sugar, cocoa powder, and salt.  Stir until thoroughly combined.  Add corn syrup, water, and vinegar to pan and place over medium heat.  Stir until sugar and cocoa dissolve, raise heat to high and bring to a boil.

Turn heat down to low, clip candy thermometer to side of pan and cook until mixture reaches 260 degrees.  Remove pan from heat, add the butter and stir.

Butter edges of sheet pan, line with silicone baking sheet and pour on taffy.  Allow to cool until you are able to handle it.

Once you are able to handle the taffy, don vinyl gloves, butter them, and begin to fold taffy in thirds using the silicone mat.  Pick up taffy and begin to pull folding the taffy back on itself repeatedly twisting as you go.  Taffy is done when it lightens in color, takes on a sheen, and becomes too hard to pull.

Roll into log, cut into fourths, roll each fourth into a 1-inch wide log, and cut into 1-inch pieces.  Make sure to keep pieces separated or they will stick to each other.  Wrap individual pieces of candy in waxed paper.  Store in airtight container 3 to 5 days.

This recipe yields about 60 pieces.

Once you are able to handle the taffy, don vinyl gloves, butter them, and begin to fold taffy in thirds using the silicone mat.  Pick up taffy and begin to pull folding the taffy back on itself repeatedly twisting as you go.  Taffy is done when it lightens in color, takes on a sheen, and becomes too hard to pull.

                            Chocolate Truffles

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Candies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped fine
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup
     1/4           cup  brandy
     1/2           cup  Dutch process cocoa powder, finely-chopped
                        nuts, and/or toasted coconut -- for coating truffles
  8             ounces  semisweet or bittersweet chocolate -- chopped fine

Place the 10 ounces of chocolate and butter in a medium-size glass mixing bowl.  Microwave for 30 seconds.  Remove and stir, and repeat this process 1 more time.  Set aside.

Heat the heavy cream and corn syrup in a small saucepan over medium heat until simmering.  Remove from the heat and pour the mixture over the melted chocolate mixture; let stand for 2 minutes.  Using a rubber spatula, stir gently, starting in the middle of bowl and working in concentric circles until all chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth and creamy.  Gently stir in the brandy.  Pour the mixture into an 8- by 8-inch glass baking dish and place in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Using a melon baller, scoop chocolate onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and return to the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Place the cocoa powder, nuts, and/or toasted coconut each in its own in pie pan and set aside.

In the meantime, place the 8 ounces of chocolate into a medium mixing bowl which is sitting on top of a heating pad lined bowl, with the heating pad set to medium.  Depending on the heating pad, you may need to adjust the heat up or down.  Stirring the chocolate occasionally, test the temperature of the chocolate and continue heating until it reaches 90 to 92 degrees; do not allow the chocolate to go above 94 degrees.  If you do, the coating will not have a nice snap to it when you bite into the chocolate.  Once you have reached the optimal temperature, adjust the heat to maintain it.

Remove the truffles from the refrigerator and shape into balls by rolling between the palms of your hands.  Use powder-free vinyl or latex gloves if desired.

Dip an ice cream scoop into the chocolate and turn upside down to remove excess chocolate.  Place truffles 1 at time into the scoop and roll around until coated.  Then place the truffle into the dish with either the cocoa powder, nuts or coconut.  Move the truffle around to coat; leave truffle in the coating for 10 to 15 seconds before removing.

In the meantime, continue placing the chocolate-coated truffles in the cocoa or other secondary coating.  After 10 to 15 seconds, remove the truffle to a parchment-lined sheet pan.  Repeat until all truffles are coated.  Allow to set in a cool dry place for at least 1 hour; or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.  Truffles are best when served at room temperature.

This recipe yields 30 to 35 truffles.

  24                    pearl onions - (to 30)
  4                     chicken thighs and legs
                        = (or 1 (5- to 7-lb) stewing chicken, cut
                        into serving pieces)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour - (to 1/2)
  2        tablespoons  water
  6             ounces  salt pork, slab bacon, or lardon -- cubed
  8             ounces  button mushrooms -- quartered
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2            bottles  red wine - (750 ml ea)
                        = (preferably pinot noir)
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1             medium  onion -- quartered
  2                     celery stalks -- quartered
  2             medium  carrots -- quartered
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  6             sprigs  fresh thyme - (to 8)
  1                     bay leaf
  2               cups  chicken stock or broth

Cut off the root end of each pearl onion and make an "x" with your knife in its place.  Bring 2 to 3 cups of water to a boil and drop in the onions for 1 minute.  Remove the onions from the pot, allow them to cool, and then peel.  You should be able to slide the onions right out of their skin.  Set aside.

Sprinkle the chicken on all sides with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Place the chicken pieces, a few at a time, into a large (1- or 2-gallon) sealable plastic bag along with the flour.  Shake to coat all of the pieces of the chicken.  Remove the chicken from the bag to a metal rack.

Add the 2 tablespoons of water to a large, 12-inch saute pan over medium heat along with the salt pork.  Cover and cook until the water is gone, and then continue to cook until the salt pork cubes are golden brown and crispy, approximately 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove the salt pork from the pan and set aside.

In the same pan, using the remaining fat, add the pearl onions, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and saute until lightly brown, approximately 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove the onions from the pan and set aside.  Next, brown the chicken pieces on each side until golden brown, working in batches if necessary to not overcrowd the pan.  Transfer the chicken into a 7- to 8-quart enameled cast-iron Dutch oven.

Add the mushrooms to the same 12-inch saute pan, adding the 1 tablespoon of butter if needed, and saute until they give up their liquid, approximately 5 minutes.  Store the onions, mushrooms and pork in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use.

Pour off any remaining fat and deglaze the pan with approximately 1 cup of the wine.  Pour this into the Dutch oven along with the chicken stock, tomato paste, quartered onion, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf.  Add all of the remaining wine.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

The next day, preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Place the chicken in the oven and cook for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the chicken is tender.  Maintain a very gentle simmer and stir occasionally.

Once the chicken is done, remove it to a heatproof container, cover, and place it in the oven to keep warm.  Strain the sauce in a colander and remove the carrots, onion, celery, thyme, garlic, and bay leaf.  Return the sauce to the pot, place over medium heat, and reduce by 1/3.  Depending on how much liquid you actually began with, this should take 20 to 45 minutes.

Once the sauce has thickened, add the pearl onions, mushrooms, and pork and cook for another 15 minutes or until the heated through.  Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary, remove from the heat, add the chicken and serve.  Serve over egg noodles, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Cookís Note:  If the sauce is not thick enough at the end of reducing, you may add a mixture of equal parts butter and flour kneaded together.  Start with 1 tablespoon of each.  Whisk this into the sauce for 4 to 5 minutes and repeat, if necessary.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             gallon  peanut oil
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced seeded jalapeÒo pepper
  1                can  cream-style corn - (8.5 oz)
     1/3           cup  finely-grated onion
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  4        tablespoons  cornstarch -- for dredging
  8                     beef hot dogs
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
  8                     sets chopsticks -- not separated

Pour oil into a deep fryer or large heavy pot and heat to 375 degrees.

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and cayenne pepper.  In a separate bowl, combine the jalapeÒo, corn, onion, and buttermilk.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients all at once, and stir only enough times to bring the batter together; there should be lumps.  Set batter aside and allow to rest for 10 minutes.

Scatter the cornstarch into a dry pie pan.  Roll each hot dog in the cornstarch and tap well to remove any excess.

Transfer enough batter to almost fill a large drinking glass.  Refill the glass as needed.  Place each hot dog on chopsticks, and quickly dip in and out of the batter.  Immediately and carefully place each hot dog into the oil, and cook until coating is golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.  With tongs, remove to cooling rack, and allow to drain for 3 to 5 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 corn dogs.

Pour oil into a deep fryer or large heavy pot and heat to 375 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and cayenne pepper.  In a separate bowl, combine the jalapeÒo, corn, onion, and buttermilk.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients all at once, and stir only enough times to bring the batter together; there should be lumps.  Set batter aside and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Scatter the cornstarch into a dry pie pan.  Roll each hot dog in the cornstarch and tap well to remove any excess.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer enough batter to almost fill a large drinking glass.  Refill the glass as needed.  Place each hot dog on chopsticks, and quickly dip in and out of the batter.  Immediately and carefully place each hot dog into the oil, and cook until coating is golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.  With tongs, remove to cooling rack, and allow to drain for 3 to 5 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  lump or backfin crabmeat
  1                cup  special crabmeat
                        = (small pieces white crabmeat)
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  non-fat powdered milk
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  shortening
  1                cup  hot water
  1           envelope  dry yeast
     1/8      teaspoon  sugar
     1/3           cup  warm water
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- sifted
                        Non-stick vegetable spray
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Electric griddle
                        Metal rings - (3" dia)

In a bowl combine the powdered milk, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, shortening, and hot water, stir until the sugar and salt are dissolved.  Let cool.

In a separate bowl combine the yeast and 1/8 teaspoon of sugar in 1/3 cup of warm water and rest until yeast has dissolved.  Add this to the dry milk mixture.  Add the sifted flour and beat thoroughly with wooden spoon.  Cover the bowl and let it rest in a warm spot for 30 minutes.

Preheat the griddle to 300 degrees.

Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt to mixture and beat thoroughly.  Place metal rings onto the griddle and coat lightly with vegetable spray.  Using #20 ice cream scoop, place 2 scoops into each ring and cover with a pot lid or cookie sheet and cook for 5 to 6 minutes.

Remove the lid and flip rings using tongs.  Cover with the lid and cook for another 5 to 6 minutes or until golden brown.  Place on a cooling rack, remove rings and cool.  Split with fork and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 muffins.

Cook's Note:  Small tuna cans with tops and bottoms removed work well for metal rings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
  3                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt -- plus
                        extra for seasoning
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable or canola oil
  2                     green plantains

Combine water, garlic and salt in medium-size glass bowl and set aside.

In a large (12-inch) saute pan, heat oil to 325 degrees.  Peel plantains and slice crosswise into 1-inch pieces.  Carefully add plantains to oil and fry until golden yellow in color, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per side.  (The oil should come halfway up the side of the plantain).

With a spider or slotted spoon, remove the plantains from the pan and place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, standing them on their ends.  With the back of a wide, wooden spatula, press each piece of plantain down to half its original size.  Then place the plantains in the water and let soak for 1 minute.  Remove and pat dry with a tea towel to remove excess water.

Bring oil back up to 325 degrees and return plantains to pan and cook until golden brown, approximately 2 to 4 minutes per side.  Remove to a dish lined with paper towels, and sprinkle with salt, if desired.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 side-dish servings.

  16            ounces  heavy cream - (2 cups)

Place the chopped chocolate into the bowl of a food processor.

Heat the heavy cream in a quart-sized, microwavable container and microwave for 3 to 4 minutes on high, or until it just begins to simmer; be careful not to allow cream to boil over.  Pour the cream over the chocolate and let stand for 2 minutes.

Process by pulsing several times until chocolate mixture is smooth.  Use as is for glazing.  If you wish to make a lighter frosting, allow it to come to room temperature, approximately 2 hours.  Once at room temperature, place in the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk on high for 2 to 3 minutes.

This recipe yields approximately 3 1/2 cups.

  1              pound  butter

Place butter in medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Bring butter to boil.  This takes approximately 2 to 3 minutes.  Once boiling, reduce heat to medium.  The butter will form a foam which will disappear.

Ghee is done when a second foam forms on top of butter, and the butter turns golden.  Approximately 7 to 8 minutes.  Brown milk solids will be in bottom of pan.

Gently pour into heatproof container through fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth.  Store in airtight container being sure to keep free from moisture.  Ghee does not need refrigeration and will keep in airtight container for up to 1 month.

This recipe yields slightly less than 1 pound of ghee.

  4              large  leeks -- cleaned, and
                        dark green sections removed
  2        tablespoons  bacon drippings

                        Crumbled bacon and goat cheese -- as accompaniment

Preheat grill to high.  Cut each leek in half lengthwise and rinse thoroughly to remove all dirt and sand.  Pat dry.

Brush the cut side of each leek half with the bacon drippings and sprinkle with kosher salt.  Grill over direct, high heat, cut-side down, with lid closed, approximately 6 to 7 minutes or until grill marks appear.  Remove the leeks to a sheet of aluminum foil and lay cut-side up.

Brush the leeks with balsamic vinegar.  Reassemble the leek halves together, wrap tightly in foil, and set back on the grill away from direct heat for 10 to 12 minutes.

Remove the leeks from the foil and serve immediately, as is or with crumbled bacon and goat cheese.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     egg yolks
  1                     teapsoon water
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper

Pour 1-inch of water into a large saucepan; over medium heat, bring to a simmer.  Once simmering, reduce the heat to low.

Place egg yolks and 1 teaspoon water in a medium mixing bowl and whisk until mixture lightens in color, approximately 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the sugar and whisk for another 30 seconds.

Place the mixture over the simmering water and whisk constantly for 3 to 5 minutes, or until there is a clear line that is drawn in the mixture when you pull your whisk through, or the mixture coats the back of a spoon.

Remove the bowl from over the pan and gradually add the butter, 1 piece at a time, and whisk until all of the butter is incorporated.  Place the bowl back over the simmering water occasionally so that it will be warm enough the melt the butter.  Add the salt, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper.  Serve immediately or hold in a thermos to keep warm.

This recipe yields approximately 1 1/2 cups.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  cooked long-grain or basmati rice
  1                cup  whole milk
     1/2           cup  heavy cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fennel seed
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley leaves
  2             pounds  pork butt - (2 1/2 lbs with bone) -- diced 1/4" pieces
  5                     feet of 36 millimeter collagen casings
                        = (do not allow to get wet at any time)
                        Shortening -- to lubricate nozzle
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Meat grinder with stuffing attachment or
                        manual stuffer

Toast fennel seed in medium-sized, heavy saute pan over medium heat, constantly moving seeds around in pan until they start to turn light brown, about 5 minutes.  Set aside to cool.  Once cool, grind seeds and combine with salt, pepper, and chopped parsley in medium mixing bowl.  Add pork and blend thoroughly.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Using the fine blade of a grinder, grind the pork.  After lubricating stuffer or stuffing attachment with shortening, load casing onto attachment, clipping end with a clothespin.  Stuff meat into casings, trying to avoid air pockets.

After stuffing is finished lay out on counter and tie off end.  Pinch and twist to form 4-inch sausages.  Wrap in parchment paper and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.  Store in refrigerator for use within 2 to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months.  If freezing, wrap in aluminum foil.

If using immediately, saute over medium heat in a heavy saute pan with 1/4-inch of water.  Bring water to boil, put on lid and cook for 10 minutes.  Remove lid and continue cooking over medium heat, turning every 2 to 3 minutes until golden brown.  Sausage should reach an internal temperature of 150 to 156 degrees.

This recipe yields 2 pounds or 10 to 12 (4-inch) sausage links.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             quarts  oil
                        = (peanut, vegetable, or canola)
  12            ounces  leeks -- cleaned, and
                        trimmed of dark green parts
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  1              large  egg
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt -- plus
                        additional for seasoning

Preheat the oil in a heavy 5-quart pot over medium-high heat to 375 degrees.

Slice the leeks into 1/2-inch wide rings, separating them 2 layers at a time.

In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the milk and the egg.  In another medium mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.  Divide the flour into 2 separate, shallow dishes and place the milk and egg mixture in a third.

Going 1 small handful at a time, dip the rings first into the first flour mixture, then into the milk and egg, and then into the second flour mixture.  Working in batches, fry the rings for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, or until golden brown.

Remove the rings to a cooling rack set inside a half sheet pan and allow to drain for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.  Season with additional salt, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LEMON FILLING ===
  4                     egg yolks
                        = (reserve whites for meringue)
     1/3           cup  cornstarch
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated lemon zest
  1                     pre-baked 9" pie shell
                        === MERINGUE TOPPING ===
  4                     egg whites
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
  2        tablespoons  sugar

Adjust the oven rack to the middle position.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Whisk egg yolks in medium-size mixing bowl and set aside.

In a medium saucepan, combine cornstarch, water, sugar, and salt.  Whisk to combine.  Turn heat on medium and, stirring frequently, bring mixture to a boil.  Boil for 1 minute.  Remove from heat and gradually, 1 whisk-full at a time, add hot mixture to egg yolks and stir until you have added at least half of the mixture.

Return egg mixture to saucepan, turn heat down to low and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 more minute.  Remove from heat and gently stir in butter, lemon juice, and zest until well combined.  Pour mixture into pie shell and top with meringue while filling is still hot.  Make sure meringue completely covers filling and that it goes right up to the edge of the crust.

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until meringue is golden.  Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack.  Make sure pie is cooled completely before slicing.

Meringue Topping:  Place egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.  Beat egg whites until soft peaks form and then gradually add sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form, approximately 1 to 2 minutes.  Use to top lemon filling.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     eggs -- warmed in hot water
                        for 5 minutes
  1              pinch  salt
  1           teaspoon  room temperature butter -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  butter -- for finishing omelet
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh chives

Crack warm eggs into bowl, add salt, and blend with fork.

Heat a 10-inch non-stick aluminum pan over medium-high heat.  Once pan is hot add butter and brush around surface of pan.  Pour eggs into center of pan and stir vigorously with rubber spatula for 5 seconds.

As soon as a semi-solid mass begins to form lift pan and move around until the excess liquid pours off into pan.  Using your spatula move around the edge of the egg mixture to help shape into round and loosen edge.  Let omelet sit in pan for 10 seconds without touching.

Shake pan to loosen from pan.  Lift up the far edge of the pan and snap it back toward you.  Using your spatula, fold over 1/3 of the omelet.  Slide omelet onto plate and fold over so that omelet is a tri-fold.  Coat with remaining butter and sprinkle with chives.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 1 servings.

                               Oyster Soup

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  heavy cream
  1               pint  oysters and liquor -- separated
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1           teaspoon  celery seed
  1 1/2      teaspoons  hot pepper sauce
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped parsley leaves,
                        chervil, or chives
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a heavy 2-quart saucepan over medium heat, bring the heavy cream and oyster liquor from the oysters to a simmer.  Remove from the heat.

Meanwhile, in a large saute pan over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the celery and a pinch of the salt and sweat for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the onion and continue cooking until translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Add celery seed, hot pepper sauce, and oysters and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the edges of the oysters start to curl.

Transfer the oysters to the carafe of a blender and add enough of the cream just to cover. Puree until the mixture is smooth.  Return the remaining cream to medium heat, add the pureed mixture, and cook until heated through.

Just before serving, add the lemon juice, chopped herbs, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes.  Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway.  If using a blender, release one corner of the lid.  This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions.  Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.

Categories    : Candies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  lightly-salted roasted peanuts
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  3               cups  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  water
                        Vegetable oil -- for coating saucepan
                        Softened butter -- for spatula

In a small bowl combine peanuts, cinnamon, and cayenne.  Set aside.

Brush the inside of a medium-sized heavy saucepan with vegetable oil.  Add the sugar and water to the saucepan, cook over high heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until it comes to a boil.  Stop stirring, cover and cook for 3 minutes.

Uncover, reduce heat to medium, and cook until the sugar is a light amber color.  Stir in peanuts.  This will greatly reduce the temperature of the sugar so work quickly.

Once evenly mixed, pour mixture onto a sheet pan lined with a silicone baking mat or buttered parchment paper.  Using a buttered spatula, spread thin.  If necessary, in order to achieve single layer of peanuts, top with second sheet pan whose underside has been buttered.  Cool completely and then break into pieces.

This recipe yields 4 cups.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                     vanilla bean -- scraped
  1         tablespoon  orange liqueur
  6             ounces  dried pears -- roughly chopped
  1 1/4         ounces  walnuts -- toasted, and
                        finely chopped
  25                    wonton wrappers - (to 30)
                        Bowl of water -- for sealing wontons
     1/2        gallon  vegetable or peanut oil -- for frying

In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring water and sugar to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved.  Remove from the heat and stir in vanilla bean scrapings and orange liqueur.

Place pears in the bowl of a food processor and process until finely chopped, stopping to scrape down the bowl if necessary.  Add the sugar syrup and pulse just until combined.  Transfer the pears to a bowl and stir in the walnuts.  Place the mixture in the refrigerator to cool completely, approximately 1 hour.  The filling may be made up to 1 day ahead of time.

Heat oil in a 6-quart Dutch oven to 360 degrees.

To form the dumplings, remove 1 wonton wrapper from the package, covering the others with a damp cloth.  Brush the edges of the wrapper lightly with water.  Place 1 teaspoon of the pear mixture in the center of the wrapper.  Fold over the edges, seal, and shape as desired.  Set on a sheet pan and cover with a damp cloth.  Repeat procedure until all of the filling is gone.

Gently place the wontons in the oil, 7 to 8 at a time.  Fry until golden, approximately 2 minutes.  Remove to a cooling rack set in a sheet pan lined with newspaper and let cool at least 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 25 to 30 wontons.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  ground pork
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped scallions
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped red bell pepper
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  2          teaspoons  ketchup
  1           teaspoon  yellow mustard
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  light brown sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  35             small  wonton wrappers - (to 40)
                        Water -- for sealing wontons
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil - (to 4) -- for frying
  1 1/3           cups  chicken stock -- divided

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.

Combine the first 11 ingredients in a medium-size mixing bowl (pork through cayenne).  Set aside.

To form the dumplings, remove 1 wonton wrapper from the package, covering the others with a damp cloth.  Brush 2 of the edges of the wrapper lightly with water.  Place 1/2 rounded teaspoon of the pork mixture in the center of the wrapper.  Fold over, seal edges, and shape as desired.  Set on a sheet pan and cover with a damp cloth.  Repeat procedure until all of the filling is gone.

Heat a 12-inch saute pan over medium heat.  Brush with vegetable oil once hot.  Add 8 to 10 potstickers at a time to the pan and cook for 2 minutes, without touching.  Once the 2 minutes are up, gently add 1/3 cup chicken stock to the pan, turn the heat down to low, cover, and cook for another 2 minutes.

Remove wontons to a heatproof platter and place in the warm oven.  Clean the pan in between batches by pouring in water and allowing the pan to deglaze.  Repeat until all the wontons are cooked.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 35 to 40 potstickers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3 oz) -- chilled
  2        tablespoons  lard - (1 oz) -- chilled
  6             ounces  all-purpose flour - (abt 1 cup) -- plus
                        extra for rolling dough
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4           cup  ice water -- in spritz bottle
                        Approximately 32 ounces of dried beans -- for blind baking

Place butter and lard in freezer for 15 minutes.  When ready to use, remove and cut both into small pieces.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour and salt by pulsing 3 to 4 times.  Add butter and pulse 5 to 6 times until texture looks mealy.  Add lard and pulse another 3 to 4 times.  Remove lid of food processor and spritz surface of mixture thoroughly with water.  Replace lid and pulse 5 times.  Add more water and pulse again until mixture holds together when squeezed.  Place mixture in large zip-top bag, squeeze together until it forms a ball, and then press into a rounded disk and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Place 2 metal pie pans in the refrigerator to chill.

Remove dough from refrigerator.  Cut along 2 sides of the plastic bag, open bag to expose dough, and sprinkle both sides with flour.  Cover again with plastic and roll out with a rolling pin to a 10- to 11-inch circle.  Open plastic again and sprinkle top of dough with flour.

Remove pie pans from refrigerator and set first pan on top of dough.  Turn everything upside down and peel plastic from bottom of dough.  Place second pan upside down on top of dough and flip again.  Remove first pan from atop dough.  Trim edges if necessary, leaving an edge for meringue to adhere to.  Poke holes in dough and place in refrigerator for 15 minutes.

Place a large piece of parchment paper on top of dough and fill with dry beans.  Press beans into edges of dough and bake in the oven for 10 minutes.  Remove parchment and beans and continue baking until golden in color, approximately 10 to 15 minutes longer.  Remove from oven and place on cooling rack.  Let cool completely before filling.

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) piecrust.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  whole milk
  1                cup  coarse ground cornmeal
  4             ounces  unsalted butter
  8             ounces  dark brown sugar - (abt 1 cup)
  6             slices  canned pineapple in heavy syrup
  6                     maraschino cherries
     1/3           cup  chopped pecans -- toasted
  3        tablespoons  juice from canned pineapple
  3              whole  eggs
  4 3/4         ounces  all-purpose flour - (abt 1 cup)
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  5 3/4         ounces  sugar - (abt 3/4 cup)
     1/2           cup  canola oil

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a microwave-proof dish, bring the milk to a boil.  Remove the milk from the microwave and add the cornmeal.  Stir and let soak at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Set aside.

Melt the butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat.  Once the butter has melted, add the brown sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat and carefully place 1 slice of pineapple in the center of the pan.  Place the other 5 slices around the center slice in a circle.  Place the cherries in the centers of the pineapple slices and sprinkle the nuts evenly over the fruit.  Drizzle pineapple juice over top.

Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a medium mixing bowl and whisk to combine.

In a separate mixing bowl, whisk the eggs.  Add the sugar to the eggs and whisk to combine.  Add the canola oil and whisk.  Add the cornmeal and milk to the egg mixture and whisk to combine.  Add this to the flour mixture and stir just until combined.

Pour the batter over the fruit in the skillet and bake for 40 to 45 minutes.  Remove from oven and let cool for 30 minutes in the skillet.  Set a platter on top of the skillet and carefully invert the cake.  Serve.

This recipe yields 1 (10-inch) cake.

                          Pressure Cooker Chili

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  stew meat
                        = (beef, pork, and/or lamb)
  2          teaspoons  peanut oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
  1             bottle  beer - (12 oz)
                        = (preferably a medium ale)
  1                     container salsa - (16 oz)
  30                    tortilla chips
  2                     chipotle peppers canned in adobo sauce -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  adobo sauce from the chipotle peppers
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin

Place the meat in a large mixing bowl and toss with the peanut oil and salt.  Set aside.

Heat a 6-quart heavy-bottomed pressure cooker over high heat until hot.  Add the meat in 3 or 4 batches and brown on all sides, approximately 2 minutes per batch.  Once each batch is browned, place the meat in a clean large bowl.

Once all of the meat is browned, add the beer to the cooker to deglaze the pot.  Scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pot.  Add the meat back to the pressure cooker along with the salsa, tortilla chips, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, and ground cumin and stir to combine.

Lock the lid in place according to the manufacturer's instructions.  When the steam begins to hiss out of the cooker, reduce the heat to low, just enough to maintain a very weak whistle.  Cook for 25 minutes.  Remove from the heat and carefully release the steam.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Place the meat in a large mixing bowl and toss with the peanut oil and salt.  Set aside.

Heat a 6-quart heavy-bottomed pressure cooker over high heat until hot.  Add the meat in 3 or 4 batches and brown on all sides, approximately 2 minutes per batch.  Once each batch is browned, place the meat in a clean large bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Once all of the meat is browned, add the beer to the cooker to deglaze the pot.  Scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pot.  Add the meat back to the pressure cooker along with the salsa, tortilla chips, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, and ground cumin and stir to combine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lock the lid in place according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions.  When the steam begins to hiss out of the cooker, reduce the heat to low, just enough to maintain a very weak whistle.  Cook for 25 minutes.  Remove from the heat and carefully release the steam.  Serve immediately.

  6             pounds  Boston butt - (to 8)
                        === BRINE ===
  8             ounces  molasses - (3/4 cup)
  12            ounces  pickling salt
  2             quarts  bottled water
                        === RUB ===
  1           teaspoon  whole cumin seed
  1           teaspoon  whole fennel seed
  1           teaspoon  whole coriander
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  onion powder
  1         tablespoon  paprika

Combine molasses, pickling salt, and water in 6-quart Lexan.  Add Boston butt making sure it is completely submerged in brine, cover, and let sit in refrigerator for a minimum of 8 hours.  12 hours is ideal.

Place cumin seed, fennel seed, and coriander in food grinder and grind fine.  Transfer to a small mixing bowl and stir in chili powder, onion powder, and paprika.

Remove Boston butt from brine and pat dry.  Sift the rub evenly over the shoulder and then pat onto the meat making sure as much of the rub as possible adheres.  More rub will adhere to the meat if you are wearing latex gloves during the application.

Preheat smoker to 210 degrees.  Place butt in smoker and cook for 10 to 12 hours, maintaining a temperature of 210 degrees.  Begin checking meat for doneness after 10 hours of cooking time.  Use fork to check for doneness.  Meat is done when it falls apart easily when pulling with a fork.

Once done, remove from pot and set aside to rest for at least 1 hour.  Pull meat apart with 2 forks and serve as sandwich with coleslaw and dressing as desired.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  1                     red bell pepper -- sliced into rings
  1             medium  onion -- sliced into rings
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1              small  zucchini -- sliced
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
                        extra for grilling or sauteing if desired
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped red onion
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  1              quart  chicken stock or broth
  1                cup  coarse ground cornmeal
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2             ounces  grated Parmesan

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a large, oven-safe saucepan heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the red onion and salt and sweat until the onions begin to turn translucent, approximately 4 to 5 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low, add the garlic, and saute for 1 to 2 minutes, making sure the garlic does not burn.

Turn the heat up to high, add the chicken stock, bring to a boil.  Gradually add the cornmeal while continually whisking.  Once you have added all of the cornmeal, cover the pot and place it in the oven.

Cook for 35 to 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes to prevent lumps.  Once the mixture is creamy, remove from the oven and add the butter, salt, and pepper.  Once they are incorporated, gradually add the Parmesan.

Serve as is, or pour the polenta into 9- by 13-inch cake pan lined with parchment paper.  Place in the refrigerator to cool completely.

Once set, turn the polenta out onto a cutting board and cut into squares, rounds, or triangles.  Brush each side with olive oil and saute in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, or grill.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  sirloin steak, 1" to 1 1/4" thick
  2          teaspoons  olive oil

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Move rack with steak to top position in oven, moving rack with foil and drippings just underneath, and cook for 3 minutes.  Flip 1 last time and cook for another 3 minutes.  Transfer steak to wire rack and rest for 3 to 5 minutes.  The above times are for medium doneness.  Adjust cooking times up or down as desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Kosher salt -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  black peppercorns -- coarsely crushed
  2        tablespoons  clarified unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  beef stock or broth
  3        tablespoons  cognac
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  green peppercorns in brine -- drained, and
                        slightly crushed

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.

Sprinkle steaks with kosher salt and crushed black pepper.  Heat butter in a 12-inch, heavy-bottomed saute pan over medium heat.  Once butter is hot, add steaks and cook until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare and 3 minutes per side for medium.  Remove steaks from pan and place on a rack set on a sheet pan; place in oven to keep warm.

Add the stock to the saute pan and whisk until the crispy bits release from bottom of pan.  Allow the liquid to reduce for 3 to 4 minutes over medium-high heat.  Add cognac, heavy cream, and green peppercorns to the pan.  Increase heat to high and cook, whisking continually, until sauce thickens slightly, just enough to coat the back of a spoon; this will take 5 to 7 minutes.

Season the sauce, to taste, with kosher salt.  Place steaks on plates, top with sauce, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              small  acorn squash - (1 to 1 1/4 lbs ea)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into 4 pieces
     1/2         pound  ground pork
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
     1/4           cup  chopped celery
     1/4           cup  chopped carrot
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1 1/2           cups  cooked rice
  1            package  frozen spinach - (10 oz) -- completely thawed,
                        drained and chopped
     1/2           cup  toasted pine nuts
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano
                        Generous pinch kosher salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cut 1-inch off the top of each acorn squash and scoop out the seeds.  If necessary in order for the squash to sit upright, cut off a small portion of the bottom.  Put 1 of the 4 pieces of butter in the cavity of each squash.  Set squash on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.  Set aside.

In a large saute pan over medium heat, brown the ground pork until no longer pink.  Remove the meat from the pan, add the olive oil and saute the onion, celery, and carrot until they begin to soften, approximately 7 to 10 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with the white wine.

Return the pork to the pan along with the cooked rice, spinach, pine nuts, oregano and salt and pepper, to taste.  Stirring constantly, heat mixture thoroughly, approximately 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Divide the mixture evenly among the squash, top each squash with its lid and bake for 1 hour or until the squash is tender.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  unsalted butter -- softened
  1                cup  sugar
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  milk
                        Powdered sugar -- for rolling dough

Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt.  Set aside.

Place butter and sugar in large bowl of electric stand mixer and beat until light in color.  Add egg and milk and beat to combine.  Put mixer on low speed, gradually add flour, and beat until mixture pulls away from the side of the bowl.  Divide the dough in half, wrap in waxed paper, and refrigerate for 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Sprinkle surface where you will roll out dough with powdered sugar.  Remove 1 wrapped pack of dough from refrigerator at a time, sprinkle rolling pin with powdered sugar, and roll out dough to 1/4-inch thick.  Move the dough around and check underneath frequently to make sure it is not sticking.  If dough has warmed during rolling, place cold cookie sheet on top for 10 minutes to chill.

Cut into desired shape, place at least 1-inch apart on greased baking sheet, parchment, or silicone baking mat, and bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until cookies are just beginning to turn brown around the edges, rotating cookie sheet halfway through baking time.  Let sit on baking sheet for 2 minutes after removal from oven and then move to complete cooling on wire rack.  Serve as is or ice as desired.  Store in airtight container for up to 1 week.

This recipe yields about 3 dozen 2 1/2-inch cookies.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  water
  1           teaspoon  household bleach
  24            sprigs  fresh tarragon*
  24                    fresh chive shoots*
  6               cups  white wine vinegar

* You will need half of the herbs when you start the recipe and half in 2 weeks.  It is best to purchase the second half of the herbs when they are needed.  If using pint jars for storage, you will need 3 jars.  If using small wine bottles, each holds approximately 13 ounces; therefore, you will need 4 bottles.

Put the water and bleach in a large container.  Dunk 12 sprigs of tarragon and 12 chive shoots in the solution, and then rinse in cold water.  Pat dry.

Heat the vinegar in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, and heat until vinegar reaches 190 degrees.  Place the herbs in a container large enough to hold the vinegar.  Pour the vinegar over the herbs, and after the vinegar has cooled, place the lid on the container.  Set in a cool dark place for 2 weeks.

After 2 weeks, sanitize the second half of the herbs as previously, rinse, pat dry, and set aside.

Sterilize the containers and lids that you will store the vinegar in by immersing them in a large pot of boiling water and boiling for 10 minutes.  If using corks, purchase pre-sterilized corks, and then dip them in and out of boiling water 3 to 4 times.

Discard the old herbs.  Strain the vinegar through a sanitized colander or funnel lined with cheesecloth.  Divide the fresh herbs among the containers and pour the vinegar over them.  Seal and refrigerate.  The vinegar may be stored at room temperature for 5 to 6 weeks or in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.

This recipe yields 6 cups vinegar.

* You will need half of the herbs when you start the recipe and half in 2 weeks.  It is best to purchase the second half of the herbs when they are needed.  If using pint jars for storage, you will need 3 jars.  If using small wine bottles, each holds approximately 13 ounces; therefore, you will need 4 bottles.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the water and bleach in a large container.  Dunk 12 sprigs of tarragon and 12 chive shoots in the solution, and then rinse in cold water.  Pat dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the vinegar in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, and heat until vinegar reaches 190 degrees.  Place the herbs in a container large enough to hold the vinegar.  Pour the vinegar over the herbs, and after the vinegar has cooled, place the lid on the container.  Set in a cool dark place for 2 weeks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
After 2 weeks, sanitize the second half of the herbs as previously, rinse, pat dry, and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sterilize the containers and lids that you will store the vinegar in by immersing them in a large pot of boiling water and boiling for 10 minutes.  If using corks, purchase pre-sterilized corks, and then dip them in and out of boiling water 3 to 4 times.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Discard the old herbs.  Strain the vinegar through a sanitized colander or funnel lined with cheesecloth.  Divide the fresh herbs among the containers and pour the vinegar over them.  Seal and refrigerate.  The vinegar may be stored at room temperature for 5 to 6 weeks or in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 cups vinegar.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  turkey breast - (abt 1 1/2 to 2 lbs)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped shallots
     1/2           cup  white wine
     1/3           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped parsley leaves

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.

Cut the turkey breast crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces.  Place pieces of turkey, 1 at a time, between 2 pieces of plastic wrap.  Squirt the meat lightly with water and squirt the top of the plastic wrap as well.  Pound to no less than 1/8-inch thickness.

Season both sides of meat with salt and pepper and then dredge in flour.  Shake off the excess flour.  Set aside.

In a large saute pan over medium to medium-high heat, heat olive oil and 4 tablespoons butter.  Once hot, but not yet smoking, brown turkey scaloppine quickly, about 1 minute on each side, and remove to an ovenproof platter.  Place in oven to keep warm.

Reduce the heat to low and add the shallots to the pan.  Saute for 1 to 2 minutes or until they begin to turn translucent.  Add wine and lemon juice to the pan and simmer until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes.  Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and whisk to combine.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, if necessary.  Pour sauce over turkey, sprinkle with parsley, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     turkey - (10 to 12 lbs) -- with giblets removed
  1              quart  chicken broth
  2             ounces  dried mushrooms
  1                cup  chopped onion
  1                cup  chopped celery
  1                cup  chopped green pepper
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- plus
                        extra for rubbing on turkey
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt -- plus
                        extra for seasoning turkey
  3               cups  Challah bread in 1/2" cubes
                        = (from approximately 4 to 5 slices)
  4             ounces  unsweetened dried cherries - (abt 1 cup)
  2             ounces  chopped pecans - (abt 1/2 cup)
  2              whole  eggs -- beaten
  2          teaspoons  dried rubbed sage
  2          teaspoons  dried parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- plus
                        extra for seasoning chicken
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
  1                     re-usable organic cotton produce bag*

*Cook's Note:  The bag is optional.  Once the stuffing is made, you can place the stuffing into the bag and then place the bag into the cavity of the turkey.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Place the turkey into a deep, high-sided bowl on its end with the stuffing end up.  Set aside.

Heat the chicken broth in the microwave in a large microwave-proof container.  Place mushrooms in a glass bowl and pour heated broth over them.  Cover and allow to sit for 35 minutes.

In a large mixing bowl toss the onion, celery, and green pepper with the oil and salt.  Place the vegetables on a sheet pan and roast for 35 minutes.  During the last 10 minutes of cooking, spread the cubed bread over the vegetables, return to the oven, and continue cooking.

Drain mushrooms, reserving 1 cup of liquid.  Chop the mushrooms and place in a large microwave-proof bowl with the vegetables and bread, reserved chicken stock, cherries, pecans, eggs, sage, parsley and black pepper.  Stir well in order to break up pieces of bread.  Use your hands to combine, if necessary.  Heat the stuffing in a microwave on high power for 6 minutes.

While the stuffing is heating, rub the bird with oil.  Working quickly, place the stuffing into the cavity of the turkey to avoid losing heat.  Place the turkey into a roasting pan, on a rack, and season with salt and pepper.  Place the roasting pan on the middle rack of the oven.  Roast for 45 minutes and then reduce the heat to 350 degrees and cook for another 60 to 75 minutes or until the bird reaches an internal temperature of 170 degrees.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bag mixed frozen vegetables - (16 oz)
     2/3           cup  plain yogurt
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  cumin seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  fennel seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  mustard seeds
  1           teaspoon  ground turmeric
     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground coriander
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground cinnamon
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- crushed
  3                     dried red chiles -- stems and seeds
                        removed if less heat is desired
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- (optional)

Poke several holes in the bag of frozen vegetables and microwave on high for 2 to 3 minutes or until thawed.  Set aside.

In medium mixing bowl, whisk together yogurt and cornstarch.  Set aside.

Heat oil in a 10-inch, non-reactive saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add cumin seeds, fennel seeds and mustard seeds, cover pan with a splatter screen, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to pop.

Once they begin to pop, turn the heat down to medium, and add turmeric, onion powder, coriander, cinnamon, garlic, and chiles.  Saute until garlic turns golden brown in color, approximately 3 to 5 minutes.

Gently add the vegetables, sugar, salt and pepper, if desired, and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until vegetables are heated through.  Remove vegetables from heat, pour into bowl with yogurt mixture, and stir to combine.  Remove chiles if desired, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 2 main course servings or 4 side-dish servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  firm tofu
     1/2           cup  coarsely-grated carrots
     1/2           cup  shredded Napa cabbage
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped red pepper
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped scallions
  2          teaspoons  finely-minced fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro leaves
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Bowl of water -- plus
                        additional water for steamer
  35             small  wonton wrappers - (to 40)
                        Non-stick vegetable spray -- for the steamer

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.

Cut the tofu in half horizontally and lay between layers of paper towels.  Place on a plate, top with another plate, and place a weight on top (a 14-ounce can of vegetables works well).  Let stand 20 minutes.

After 20 minutes, cut the tofu into 1/4-inch cubes and place in a large mixing bowl.  Add the carrots, cabbage, red pepper, scallions, ginger, cilantro, soy sauce, hoisin, sesame oil, egg, salt, and pepper.  Lightly stir to combine.

To form the dumplings, remove 1 wonton wrapper from the package, covering the others with a damp cloth.  Brush the edges of the wrapper lightly with water.  Place 1/2 rounded teaspoon of the tofu mixture in the center of the wrapper.  Shape as desired.  Set on a sheet pan and cover with a damp cloth.  Repeat procedure until all of the filling is gone.

Using a steaming apparatus of your choice, bring 1/4- to 1/2-inch of water to a simmer over medium heat.  Spray the steamer's surface lightly with the non-stick vegetable spray to prevent sticking.  Place as many dumplings as will fit into a steamer, without touching each other.  Cover and steam for 10 to 12 minutes over medium heat.

Remove the dumplings from the steamer to a heatproof platter and place in oven to keep warm.  Repeat until all dumplings are cooked.

This recipe yields 35 to 40 dumplings.

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  2 1/2         ounces  vegetable shortening - (abt 1/3 cup)
  2           packages  instant yeast
     1/3           cup  warm water -- (95 to 105 degrees)
  2                     eggs -- beaten
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground nutmeg
  23            ounces  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting surface
                        Peanut or vegetable oil -- for frying
                        = (1 to 1/2 gallons, depending on fryer)

Place the milk in a medium saucepan and heat over medium heat just until warm enough to melt the shortening.  Place the shortening in a bowl and pour warmed milk over.  Set aside.

In a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let dissolve for 5 minutes.  After 5 minutes, pour the yeast mixture into the large bowl of a stand mixer and add the milk and shortening mixture, first making sure the milk and shortening mixture has cooled to lukewarm.  Add the eggs, sugar, salt, nutmeg, and half of the flour.

Using the paddle attachment, combine the ingredients on low speed until flour is incorporated and then turn the speed up to medium and beat until well combined.  Add the remaining flour, combining on low speed at first, and then increase the speed to medium and beat well.

Change to the dough hook attachment of the mixer and beat on medium speed until the dough pulls away from the bowl and becomes smooth, approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer to a well-oiled bowl, cover, and let rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size.

On a well-floured surface, roll out dough to 3/8-inch thick.  Cut out dough using a 2 1/2-inch doughnut cutter or pastry ring and using a 7/8-inch ring for the center whole.  Set on floured baking sheet, cover lightly with a tea towel, and let rise for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oil in a deep fryer or Dutch oven to 365 degrees.  Gently place the doughnuts into the oil, 3 to 4 at a time.  Cook for 1 minute per side.  Transfer to a cooling rack placed in baking pan.  Allow to cool for 15 to 20 minutes prior to glazing, if desired.

This recipe yields 20 to 25 doughnuts.
