Categories    : Cakes                           Cheesecake
                Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  graham cracker crumbs
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds -- toasted
  1           teaspoon  sugar -- plus
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2                     containers nonfat cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  8             ounces  "brick" Neufch‡tel cheese -- room temperature
                        = (reduced-fat cream cheese)
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/4           cup  nonfat sour cream

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Beat eggs to blend in small bowl.  Combine cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup almonds, 1 1/2 tablespoons beaten egg and 1 teaspoon sugar in processor.  Using on/off turns, blend until almonds are finely ground and crumb mixture holds together, adding more beaten egg by teaspoonfuls if mixture is crumbly.

Press crumb mixture onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish (crust will be thin).  Bake crust until set, about 8 minutes.  Cool while preparing filling.

Beat nonfat and reduced-fat cream cheeses and remaining 3/4 cup sugar in large bowl until smooth.  Beat in remaining beaten eggs, then vanilla extract, lemon peel and almond extract.  Gently spread filling in prepared crust.  Bake cheesecake until puffed and firm to touch in center, about 40 minutes.

Remove cheesecake from oven.  Spread sour cream evenly over top; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup almonds.  Cool cheesecake on rack 1 hour.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and refrigerate overnight.  Cut into wedges.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per serving:  calories, 346;  total fat, 12 g;  saturated fat, 4 g;  cholesterol, 93 mg.

Comments:  Prepare this a day in advance to give the flavors time to blend and the cake a chance to become firm and properly chilled.

Transfer soup to processor.  Using on/off turns, blend to coarse puree.  Season soup with salt and pepper.  Ladle into bowls over basil and garlic.  Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.  Sprinkle with cheese.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Our take on this soup is faithful to the classic flavors.  Assorted marinated vegetables from the local Italian deli are nice to start, and wedges of almond cake with espresso are a great finish.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Omelets


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  4             ounces  red Swiss chard -- stemmed, chopped
     3/4      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  grated sharp cheddar cheese
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in 8-inch-diameter nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.  Add garlic; sautÈ until soft, about 2 minutes.  Stir in chard, cover and cook until tender, about 4 minutes.  Stir in hot sauce.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to small bowl.  Wipe skillet clean.

Whisk eggs, 1/4 cup cheese, salt and pepper in medium bowl to blend.  Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter in same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add half of egg mixture and cook until eggs are just set in center, tilting pan and lifting edge of omelet with spatula to let uncooked portion flow underneath, about 2 minutes.  Scatter half of chard mixture over half of omelet.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup cheese over chard.  Fold omelet over cheese; slide out onto plate.  Repeat with remaining butter, egg mixture, chard and cheese.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  This southern-style omelet would go nicely with sautÈed plum tomatoes and warm corn bread.  Dessert can be butter pecan ice cream drizzled with bourbon.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     chicken breast halves with skin and bones
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped carrot
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  slivered prosciutto - (packed) -- abt 1 1/2 oz
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh sage
                        = (or 1 1/2 tspns dried sage)

Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chicken and sautÈ until brown, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer chicken to plate.

Add onion, carrot and celery to skillet; sautÈ until vegetables begin to brown, about 5 minutes.  Return chicken and any accumulated juices to skillet; add wine, prosciutto and sage.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover; simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 6 minutes per side.  Serve chicken with sauce.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  This can also be prepared with duck breasts, which is how it is often made in Tuscany.  Either way, the dish is good with rosemary-flavored mashed potatoes and sautÈed artichoke hearts.  To end, crumble macaroons over melon balls.

  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     2/3           cup  diced smoked ham
     1/2         small  fresh fennel bulb -- diced
     1/2           cup  canned low-salt chicken broth
     1/2           cup  dry Sherry
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  grated orange peel

Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chicken to skillet.  SautÈ until brown, about 3 minutes per side; transfer to plate.

Add 1 tablespoon oil, ham and fennel to skillet and sautÈ until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes.  Add broth, Sherry, garlic and orange peel; boil 2 minutes.  Return chicken to skillet; simmer until cooked through, about 4 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  For a casual supper, broil rounds of prepared polenta roll, and toss romaine lettuce with oil and vinegar; end with cheesecake.  For a special dinner, have broccoli spears with browned butter and orzo pilaf with Parmesan.  Buy a hazelnut dacquoise or other fancy cake from the bakery for a great dessert.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped red onion
  3        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  3          teaspoons  fresh lime juice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  plain nonfat yogurt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  curry powder
  3               cups  broccoli florets

Line strainer with double-thick layer of cheesecloth, extending over sides; set over deep bowl.  Add yogurt to strainer.  Chill overnight (liquid will drain from yogurt and yogurt will thicken).  Transfer yogurt to small bowl; discard liquid.

Stir oil and garlic in small nonstick skillet over medium heat 30 seconds.  Stir in curry powder.  Whisk curry mixture into yogurt.  Season with salt.  Chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

Per serving:  calories, 54;  total fat, 1 g;  saturated fat, 0.5 g;  cholesterol, 0.

Comments:  Start making this dip one day before you plan to serve it, since the yogurt has to drain and thicken overnight.  A piece of cheesecloth is needed for the first step of the recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  coarse-grained mustard
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
     3/4           cup  dry Italian-style breadcrumbs
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped green onion tops
  4              large  chicken drumsticks - (abt 1 lb)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Spray small baking sheet with vegetable oil spray.

Whisk mayonnaise, mustard and Worcestershire sauce in medium bowl to blend.  Whisk breadcrumbs and green onions in another medium bowl to blend.

Dip 1 chicken drumstick in mayonnaise mixture; turn to coat.  Place drumstick in crumb mixture; turn to coat.  Transfer to prepared baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining drumsticks.

Bake chicken until cooked through, about 25 minutes.

This recipe yields 2 servings (can be doubled).

Comments:  Scalloped potatoes, steamed broccoli, and sliced tomatoes with blue cheese dressing go well with these drumsticks.  We like lemon meringue pie for dessert.

     1/3           cup  sour cream
     1/4           cup  chopped red onion
  3        tablespoons  chopped cilantro

  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  4                     taco shells

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     asparagus spears -- trimmed, halved
                        lengthwise, cut into 1 1/2" pieces
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1            package  refrigerated pizza crust dough - (10 oz)
  1                can  diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings -- (14 1/2 oz), drained
  5 1/2         ounces  soft fresh goat cheese log (such as
                        Montrachet)
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh marjoram
     1/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Toss asparagus with oil in medium bowl to coat.  Unroll pizza dough on baking sheet, forming 9- by 12-inch rectangle.  Spoon tomatoes over dough, leaving 3/4-inch plain border.  Scatter asparagus with oil over tomatoes.

Bake pizza 7 minutes.  Remove from oven.  Crumble goat cheese over pizza.  Sprinkle with marjoram and crushed pepper.  Bake until crust is golden around edges, about 9 minutes longer.

This recipe yields 2 servings (can be doubled).

Comments:  A lovely start to this spring supper would be mugs of green pea soup sprinkled with chives.  Accompany the pizza with an arugula, radicchio and endive salad dressed with balsamic vinaigrette.  Offer gelato for dessert.

  2        tablespoons  minced fresh mint
     1/2           cup  orzo (rice-shaped pasta)

  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil -- plus

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  2          teaspoons  water
  1           teaspoon  dried fines herbes or dried salad herbs
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Beat eggs, 2 tablespoons parsley, 2 teaspoons water, dried herbs, salt and pepper in small bowl to blend.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in small nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add half of egg mixture (about 1/2 cup) to skillet.  Cook until eggs are just set in center, tilting pan and lifting edge of omelet with spatula to let uncooked portion flow underneath, about 2 minutes.

            Ham And Peach Kebabs With Marmalade-Mustard Glaze

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  orange marmalade
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1                     ham steak, 1/2"-thick - (8 to 10 oz) -- cut into 1" pieces
  2             medium  peaches -- peeled, pitted,
                        and cut into 1 1/2" chunks
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Whisk marmalade, oil, mustard and lemon juice in small bowl to blend.  Alternate ham pieces and peach chunks on 4 metal skewers.  Brush with marmalade glaze.  Sprinkle with pepper.  Grill until ham is slightly charred and fruit is softened, turning and brushing often with glaze, about 6 minutes.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  There's a southern accent to this entrÈe, so round out the menu with corn muffins, coleslaw and three-bean salad; then bring on the coconut layer cake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  oriental sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  unseasoned rice vinegar
  2                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- cut into 1" pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Whisk first 4 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Place 2 tablespoons sauce in small bowl for glaze.  Mix chicken into remaining sauce; let stand 10 minutes.

Thread chicken onto 4 metal skewers, spacing pieces 1/2 inch apart.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.  Grill chicken until cooked through and slightly charred, brushing with glaze and turning often, about 8 minutes.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

Mix first 3 ingredients on large plate.  Using rolling pin, pound chicken between sheets of waxed paper to scant 1/2-inch thickness.  Rinse chicken with cold water so that coating will adhere.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Press both sides of chicken into crumb mixture to cover.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Carefully add chicken to skillet.  SautÈ until chicken is cooked through and golden brown, turning with tongs, about 4 minutes per side.  Serve chicken with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Creamed spinach and baked sweet potatoes drizzled with maple syrup make good partners for these crispy cutlets.  Top vanilla frozen yogurt with fudge sauce and a few raspberries for dessert.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fresh cilantro leaves - (packed)
  4        tablespoons  canned low-salt chicken broth
  6          teaspoons  reduced-sodium soy sauce
  6          teaspoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  4          teaspoons  oriental sesame oil
  4          teaspoons  minced seeded jalapeÒo chilies
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  32                    littleneck clams -- scrubbed
  12            ounces  linguine -- freshly cooked
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped red bell pepper
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place 2 large baking sheets in oven to heat.  Cut 4 sheets of foil, each about 18 inches long.

Place 1 foil sheet on work surface.  Arrange 1/4 cup cilantro on 1 half of foil.  Top with 1 tablespoon broth, 1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons ginger, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, 1 teaspoon jalapeÒo and 1/2 teaspoon garlic.  Arrange 8 clams atop.  Fold foil over, enclosing contents completely and crimping edges tightly to seal.

Repeat with remaining 3 foil sheets, cilantro, broth, soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil, jalapeÒo, garlic and clams.  Place foil packets on heated baking sheets.  Bake until clams open, about 20 minutes (discard any that do not open).

Divide linguine among 4 bowls.  Open 1 foil packet over pasta in each bowl to retain juices.  Sprinkle with bell pepper and green onions and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The juices from the clams combine with spicy Asian flavors to make a great pasta sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2                     red bell peppers -- cut into strips
  6                     green onions -- cut into thin strips
     2/3           cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  9             ounces  fresh linguine
     1/4           cup  toasted pine nuts

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add peppers; sautÈ until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.  Add green onions and sautÈ 2 minutes.  Transfer vegetable mixture to bowl.

Add cream and wine to same skillet and simmer until mixture thickens, about 3 minutes.  Mix in cheese and all but 1 cup vegetable mixture.  Simmer sauce 2 minutes to blend flavors; season with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid.

Return pasta to pot.  Add sauce and toss to coat over medium heat, adding reserved cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls to moisten, if desired.  Mound pasta on plates.  Garnish with reserved 1 cup vegetables.  Sprinkle with pine nuts.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  On a weekday, accompany this main course with breadsticks and marinated vegetables from the deli.  Wrap up with grapes and cookies.  For a festive occasion, start with an antipasto of olives and roasted vegetables, then serve an arugula, radicchio and toasted walnut salad dressed with lemon vinaigrette.  Finish with an Italian fruit crostata.

                         New Orleans-Style Shrimp

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  dried rosemary
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1              pound  uncooked large shrimp
                        Toasted French bread

Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over high heat.  Add garlic, rosemary and cayenne pepper and stir 30 seconds.  Add wine and Worcestershire sauce and boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 5 minutes.  Add shrimp to sauce.  Simmer until shrimp are just opaque in center, about 3 minutes for peeled or 5 minutes for unpeeled.  Serve shrimp with toast.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Donít bother peeling the shrimp for an everyday meal -- just team them with cole-slaw and toasted bread (and napkins); follow it all with sliced bananas and pecan cookies.  When itís time for a party, peel the shrimp, and place them on angel hair pasta tossed with a colorful selection of roasted bell peppers.  Vanilla bread pudding with brandy sauce is a special finale.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     beef rib-eye steaks - (10 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  coarsely-ground pepper
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter
  6             ounces  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  1                     shallot -- thinly sliced
     3/4           cup  Merlot
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme

Sprinkle steaks on both sides with salt and 2 teaspoons pepper; press to adhere.  Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add steaks; cook to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium.  Transfer steaks to 2 plates (do not clean skillet).

Add 1 tablespoon butter to pan.  Add mushrooms and shallot; sautÈ 2 minutes.  Add wine and thyme and boil until wine is reduced by half, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in 2 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.  Pour over steaks.

This recipe yields 2 servings (can be doubled).

Comments:  This elegant entrÈe deserves special accompaniments, like buttered baby carrots sprinkled with chopped tarragon, twice-baked potatoes (available frozen) and a spinach salad tossed with toasted walnuts.  New-York-style cheesecake with strawberries provides the properly indulgent finale.

Sprinkle steaks on both sides with salt and 2 teaspoons pepper; press to adhere.  Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add steaks; cook to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium.  Transfer steaks to 2 plates (do not clean skillet).

Add 1 tablespoon butter to pan.  Add mushrooms and shallot; sautÈ 2 minutes.  Add wine and thyme and boil until wine is reduced by half, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in 2 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.  Pour over steaks.

Comments:  This elegant entrÈe deserves special accompaniments, like buttered baby carrots sprinkled with chopped tarragon, twice-baked potatoes (available frozen) and a spinach salad tossed with toasted walnuts.  New-York-style cheesecake with strawberries provides the properly indulgent finale.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     top loin (New York strip) steaks, 3/4" thk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  canned beef broth
  3        tablespoons  Sherry wine vinegar
  1                     shallot -- finely chopped
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chilled butter
     1/4      teaspoon  dried tarragon

Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper.  Heat medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add steaks and cook about 4 minutes per side for rare; transfer to plates.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  penne pasta
  2              small  zucchini -- quartered lengthwise
                        and cut into 2" strips
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut 2" by 1/2" strips
     1/2           cup  bottled balsamic vinaigrette
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  crumbled garlic-and-herb feta cheese -- (abt 2 oz)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint
                        Salt -- to taste

Preheat broiler.  Cook pasta in pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.  Drain pasta and place in large bowl.

Meanwhile, combine zucchini and bell pepper in medium bowl.  Add 3 tablespoons vinaigrette and toss to coat.  Arrange vegetables on broiler pan; sprinkle with pepper.  Broil vegetables until just tender and beginning to brown, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.

Add vegetables to bowl with pasta.  Mix in remaining vinaigrette, cheese and mint.  Season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Canned chicken soup with a bit of oregano and lemon juice, accompanied by warm pita bread, starts the meal with the proper Greek flavors.  Purchased baklava and strong coffee splashed with ouzo conclude the dinner in a spirited way.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  8             ounces  lean ground pork
  2               cups  chopped onions
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cans  low-salt chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz ea)
  1                can  golden hominy - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  2               cans  diced green chilies - (4 oz ea)
  8        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add pork, onions and cumin and sautÈ until pork is brown, about 5 minutes.  Add flour and stir 2 minutes.  Add broth and hominy.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until thickened, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.

Stir in chilies and 6 tablespoons cilantro.  Simmer 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Similar to the Latin posole, this stew would be terrific with yellow rice (there are several supermarket choices) and an avocado, grapefruit and red onion salad.  Cinnamon-spiced brownies make a good dessert.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  1                can  pink salmon with bones - (14 3/4 oz) -- drained

  1                cup  low-fat (1%) milk
  4             ounces  soft fresh goat cheese (such as
                        Montrachet)
  3        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - (packed)
                        Salt -- to taste

     1/2           cup  chopped green onions

Using electric mixer, beat until almost smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  Beat in eggs.  Stir in salmon and green onions.

Transfer mixture to prepared dish.  Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.  Bake casserole until golden and heated through, about 45 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     bacon slices -- coarsely chopped
  1              large  onion -- sliced
  2            bottles  clam juice - (8 oz ea)
  1                     russet potato - (abt 12 oz) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" pieces

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  asparagus -- trimmed
  1           teaspoon  olive oil (preferably extra-virgin)
  2              large  tangerines or small oranges
     1/3           cup  fresh tangerine juice or orange juice
  2          teaspoons  rice vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  oriental sesame oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated tangerine peel or orange peel
  1                     garlic clove -- pressed
     3/4      teaspoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped green onion tops
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped dry-roasted peanuts

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Place asparagus in medium bowl.  Pour enough cold water over asparagus to cover; let stand 15 minutes.  Drain.  Spread asparagus in 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan; drizzle with oil.  Roast asparagus until crisp-tender, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Transfer asparagus to platter; cool.

Using sharp knife, cut peel and white pith from tangerines.  Cut between membranes to release segments.  Arrange tangerine segments atop asparagus.  Whisk tangerine juice, vinegar, sesame oil, peel, garlic and ginger in small bowl to blend.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.  Drizzle over asparagus.  Sprinkle with green onion tops and peanuts and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per serving:  calories, 117;  total fat, 5 g;  saturated fat, 1 g;  cholesterol, 0.

Comments:  This lively Asian-style salad is terrific on its own or teamed with roast chicken, roast lamb or broiled shrimp.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     chicken breast halves with skin and bones
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh rosemary
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

                   Sausage And Warm Potato Salad Supper

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     fully-cooked smoked sausages
  1         tablespoon  olive oil - (to 2 tbspns)
  2 1/2           cups  packaged refrigerated diced potatoes with
                        onion - (abt 12 oz)
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped red onion
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Using toothpick, pierce sausages in several places.  Transfer to medium skillet; add enough water to reach depth of 1/4 inch.  Bring water to boil over high heat.  Reduce heat, cover skillet and simmer sausages 5 minutes.  Uncover; continue to simmer until water cooks away and sausages are brown and heated through, turning sausages occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Transfer sausages to 2 plates.

Add enough oil to drippings in skillet to measure 2 tablespoons.  Heat over medium-high heat.  Add potatoes (with onion) and red onion.  Cover; cook until potatoes are golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Mix in parsley and vinegar.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spoon potato salad next to sausages.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Look for diced potatoes with onion in the supermarket's refrigerated deli case or in the freezer section.  Pair the main course with sautÈed spinach, coleslaw, good mustard and dark bread.  A pint of ale adds gusto; apple pie is the finishing touch.

Using toothpick, pierce sausages in several places.  Transfer to medium skillet; add enough water to reach depth of 1/4 inch.  Bring water to boil over high heat.  Reduce heat, cover skillet and simmer sausages 5 minutes.  Uncover; continue to simmer until water cooks away and sausages are brown and heated through, turning sausages occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Transfer sausages to 2 plates.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add enough oil to drippings in skillet to measure 2 tablespoons.  Heat over medium-high heat.  Add potatoes (with onion) and red onion.  Cover; cook until potatoes are golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Mix in parsley and vinegar.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spoon potato salad next to sausages.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Look for diced potatoes with onion in the supermarket&apos;s refrigerated deli case or in the freezer section.  Pair the main course with sautÈed spinach, coleslaw, good mustard and dark bread.  A pint of ale adds gusto; apple pie is the finishing touch.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  calf's liver in 1/4"-thick slices
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
     1/4           cup  canned beef broth
  1 1/2    tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley

Sprinkle liver with salt and pepper; dust with flour.  Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add liver and sautÈ until crisp and golden, about 3 minutes per side for medium.  Transfer liver to plates.

Add garlic to skillet; stir 30 seconds.  Add broth and vinegar and boil 1 minute, scraping up browned bits.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.  Spoon sauce over liver; sprinkle with parsley.

                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon
                        = (or 2 tspns dried tarragon)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1           teaspoon  grated lime peel
     2/3           cup  diced peeled mango
     1/3           cup  diced red bell pepper
     1/3           cup  diced sweet onion - (such as
                        Vidalia or Maui)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12                    sea scallops

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Whisk first 4 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Transfer 1 tablespoon dressing to small bowl and reserve.  Mix mango, bell pepper and onion into remaining dressing in medium bowl; season salsa to taste with salt and pepper.

Thread scallops on 2 skewers.  Brush reserved 1 tablespoon dressing over scallops; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill scallops until just opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer scallops to plates.  Spoon salsa alongside.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Pecan-studded rice pilaf and sautÈed pattypan squash are great with the scallops, and lemon pound cake with sugared berries tops off the meal nicely.

Comments:  Corn tortillas and bottled salsa are great with the salad.  For dessert, top purchased vanilla pudding with fresh blueberries and a touch of cinnamon.  This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- mashed
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     3/4         pound  pork tenderloin - (to 1 lb)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  canned low-salt chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Blend first 5 ingredients in small bowl.  Sprinkle pork with spice mixture, salt and pepper.  Place in 13- by 9- by 2-inch pan.  Roast until thermometer inserted into center of pork registers 150 degrees, about 20 minutes.  Transfer pork to plate.

                  Spicy Grilled Chicken And Green Onions

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  hot pepper sauce
  2          teaspoons  honey
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  7                     green onions
  2                     skinless boneless chicken breast halves
                        Salt -- to taste

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Whisk oil, hot sauce, honey and paprika in 9-inch glass pie dish to blend.  Mince 1 green onion; mix into marinade.  Transfer 2 tablespoons marinade to small bowl and reserve.  Add chicken to marinade in pie dish and turn to coat.  Let stand 10 minutes, turning occasionally.

Sprinkle chicken and remaining whole green onions with salt.  Grill chicken and whole onions until chicken is cooked through and onions soften, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Transfer chicken and onions to plates.  Drizzle with reserved 2 tablespoons marinade.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

Buy some carrot and celery sticks to dip into blue cheese dressing for a cool starter.  Deli potato salad is good with the chicken, and classic southern ambrosia -- sliced oranges with coconut -- is a refreshing end.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  bottled teriyaki sauce
  1           teaspoon  wasabi paste (horseradish paste) -- or more to taste
  12                    sea scallops
  4                     metal skewers - (12" long)
  8              whole  green onions
                        Sesame seeds

Preheat broiler.  Blend teriyaki sauce and 1 teaspoon wasabi in medium bowl, adding more wasabi if desired.  Transfer 3 tablespoons sauce mixture to small bowl and reserve.  Mix scallops into sauce in medium bowl; let stand 10 minutes.

Thread 6 scallops onto each of 2 skewers.  Thread all onions onto remaining 2 skewers by pushing 1 skewer through bulbs of all onions and another skewer (parallel to first) through all onions 2 inches above bulbs.

Place scallops and onions on broiler pan; brush with marinade.  Broil until scallops are just opaque in center and onions are charred, turning occasionally and brushing with marinade, about 6 minutes total.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Serve with reserved sauce mixture.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Try packaged Asian rice mix (or steamed white rice), and tomato and cucumber salad sprinkled with seasoned rice vinegar.  To end, spoon sliced fruits over mango sorbet.  Look for the horseradish paste in the Asian foods section or next to the packaged sushi.

  6                     oil-packed sun-dried tomato halves -- patted dry, chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Nonstick olive oil spray
  6                     frozen phyllo pastry sheets -- thawed
                        Red Pepper Sauce -- (see recipe)

Cook kale in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 5 minutes.  Drain.  Cool; squeeze dry.  Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and garlic and sautÈ until tender, about 7 minutes.  Cool.

Finely chop tofu, cheeses, dill and flour in processor.  Transfer to bowl.  Stir in onion mixture, kale and sun-dried tomatoes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray large baking sheet with oil spray.  Stack 2 phyllo sheets, one atop the other, on work surface; spray phyllo with oil spray.  Top with 2 more phyllo sheets.  Spray with oil spray.  Repeat with remaining 2 phyllo sheets.  Spread tofu mixture lengthwise down center of phyllo in 3-inch-wide strip, leaving about 1 1/2-inch border on each short side.  Fold short sides of phyllo in over filling, then roll up into log, enclosing filling completely.  Spray phyllo log with oil spray.  Transfer strudel to prepared baking sheet.

Bake strudel until golden brown, about 40 minutes.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.  Rewarm in 350 degree oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.)  Cool 10 minutes.  Cut strudel crosswise into 6 pieces.  Place on plates.  Spoon Red Pepper Sauce alongside.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  fully-baked pizza crust, such as Boboli -- cubed
  1 1/2           cups  diced tomatoes
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil
     1/2           cup  bottled Italian dressing
  1              small  green bell pepper -- chopped
  1                cup  diced fresh mozzarella cheese - (abt 4 oz)
     1/2       package  sliced pepperoni - (3 1/2 oz pkg)
  1                     large bunch arugula -- stemmed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Toss pizza crust, tomatoes, basil and 1/4 cup dressing in large bowl; let stand 5 minutes.  Mix in bell pepper, cheese, pepperoni and arugula.  Add remaining 1/4 cup dressing; toss to combine.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Begin the meal with chilled canned vichyssoise sprinkled with chopped fresh chives.  A bowl of marinated green and black olives goes well with the salad, and a compote of the season's best fruits -- berries, melon and peaches -- is a nice finish.  This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  solid white tuna packed in oil - (6 oz)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  chopped red onion
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  4          teaspoons  chopped fresh sage
                        = (or 1 tspn dried sage leaves)
  1                can  cannellini beans - (15 to 16 oz) -- drained well
                        = (white kidney beans)

Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  veal cutlets
  4          teaspoons  minced fresh sage
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1              large  shallot -- chopped
     1/2           cup  Merlot or other dry red wine

Using rolling pin, pound veal between sheets of waxed paper to 1/4-inch thickness.  Sprinkle veal with 3 teaspoons sage, salt and pepper.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add veal and cook to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium.  Transfer veal to plates.

Add chopped shallot to skillet; stir 30 seconds.  Add wine and remaining 1 tablespoon butter.  Boil sauce until reduced almost to glaze, stirring up any browned bits, about 2 minutes.  Spoon sauce over veal; sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon sage and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Cabernet Sauvignon can be substituted for the Merlot, but either way, have mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli florets with the veal, and wedges of chocolate mousse cake afterward.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  3             medium  carrots -- peeled, and
                        quartered lengthwise
  2              large  tomatoes -- quartered
  1              large  onion -- cut into 8 wedges
     1/2         small  butternut squash -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut lengthwise into 1/2"-thick wedges
  6                     garlic cloves -- unpeeled
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6               cups  canned vegetable broth -- or more if needed
  4               cups  finely-chopped kale
  3              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  1                     bay leaf
  1                can  Great Northern beans - (15 oz) -- drained

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Spray rimmed baking sheet with oil spray.  Arrange carrots, tomatoes, onion, squash and garlic on sheet.  Drizzle with oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Toss to coat.  Bake until vegetables are brown and tender, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.

Transfer carrots and squash to work surface.  Cut into 1/2-inch pieces; set aside.  Peel garlic cloves; place in processor.  Add tomatoes and onion; puree until almost smooth.  Pour 1/2 cup broth onto baking sheet; scrape up any browned bits.  Transfer broth and vegetable puree to large pot.  Add 5 1/2 cups broth, kale, thyme and bay leaf to pot; bring to boil.  Reduce heat; simmer uncovered until kale is tender, about 30 minutes.

Add beans and reserved carrots and squash to soup.  Simmer 8 minutes to blend flavors, adding more broth to thin soup if necessary.  Season with salt and pepper.  Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Bring to simmer before serving.)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per serving:  calories, 191;  total fat, 4 g;  saturated fat, 0.5 g;  cholesterol, 0.

Comments:  Many dark, leafy greens, like kale, contain calcium.  The beans have it, too.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Spray rimmed baking sheet with oil spray.  Arrange carrots, tomatoes, onion, squash and garlic on sheet.  Drizzle with oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Toss to coat.  Bake until vegetables are brown and tender, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.

Transfer carrots and squash to work surface.  Cut into 1/2-inch pieces; set aside.  Peel garlic cloves; place in processor.  Add tomatoes and onion; puree until almost smooth.  Pour 1/2 cup broth onto baking sheet; scrape up any browned bits.  Transfer broth and vegetable puree to large pot.  Add 5 1/2 cups broth, kale, thyme and bay leaf to pot; bring to boil.  Reduce heat; simmer uncovered until kale is tender, about 30 minutes.
</DirT>

Add beans and reserved carrots and squash to soup.  Simmer 8 minutes to blend flavors, adding more broth to thin soup if necessary.  Season with salt and pepper.  Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Bring to simmer before serving.)
