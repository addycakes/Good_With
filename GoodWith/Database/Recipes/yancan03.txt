--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame seeds
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
                        = (or dark soy sauce)
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  5                     dried black mushrooms
     1/4           cup  diced carrot
  2        tablespoons  diced Sichuan preserved vegetables -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped baby bok choy - (abt 3)

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     ripe but firm avocadoes -- peeled, pitted,
                        and diced
     1/2           cup  diced onion
     1/2           cup  diced fresh tomato
     1/4           cup  sliced green onion
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro
  3        tablespoons  sake
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  chili garlic sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR THE NACHOS ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  1              small  taro -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  2              small  sweet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  thinly-sliced roast duck - (abt 1 cup)
  2          teaspoons  Hoisin sauce
  2                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        sliced thinly

Mix the avocados, onion, tomato, green onions, ginger, cilantro, sake, lime juice, vegetable oil, chili garlic sauce and salt together in a large bowl, without mashing the avocado.  Serve immediately or cover with plastic wrap pressed directly to the surface and refrigerate until ready to use.

For the Nachos:  Pour enough vegetable oil into the wok to fill to 3 inches.  Heat to 375 degrees.  Slip as many taro or sweet potato slices into the oil as will float freely and fry until crisp and golden, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.

To serve:  Mound 1 cup of the guacamole in the center of a plate.  Insert the points of a few of each type of chip into the dip.  Use the remaining guacamole to top as many of the remaining vegetable chips as possible with 1 heaping teaspoonful of guacamole.  Top the guacamole with 1 slice of the duck, a pea-size dot of hoisin sauce, and a few green onion slices.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  thinly-sliced peeled ginger
  8              whole  star anise pods
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  2          teaspoons  toasted whole Sichuan peppercorns
  3                     cardamom pods -- lightly crushed
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1              whole  duck - (4 to 6 lbs)
     3/4           cup  soy sauce
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2                cup  vegetable oil
     1/3                English cucumber -- cut thin strips,
                        abt 2" long - (abt 1 cup)
  5                     green onions -- trimmed, cut
                        into 2" lengths, and then into strips
     1/3           cup  Hoisin sauce
                        Several Mandarin pancakes
                        = (or thin flour tortillas)

Place the ginger, star anise, cinnamon, Sichuan peppercorns and cardamom in the center of an 8-inch square of cheese cloth.  Bring the corners of the square together and tie them with a string to form a bag that encloses the spices.

For the Dish:  Place the duck in a 5-quart pot and pour in enough cold water to cover.  Add the spice bag and bring the water to a boil over high heat.  Adjust the heat so the water is simmering, cover the pot and simmer until the duck thigh is tender when poked with a fork, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Lift the duck from the water with a large wire skimmer or by inserting a sturdy wooden spoon into the body cavity.  Hold the duck over the pot to allow water to drain back into the pot.  Transfer the duck to a colander and drain completely.  Cool to room temperature.

Stir the soy sauce and sugar together in a small pan over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved.  Let cool.  Pat the duck dry on all sides with paper towels.  Brush the duck 3 or 4 times with the soy syrup to coat it well.

Heat the oil in a wok over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Hold the syrup coated duck by a hook inserted behind its wing joint or with a sturdy pair tongs and suspend the duck over the hot oil.  With a Chinese ladle, spoon the hot oil repeatedly over the duck until the skin is caramelized and crispy, 5 to 6 minutes.

Briefly cool the duck.  Remove the skin from the duck and cut the skin into thin strips.  Using your hands, and using rubber gloves for protection if you find the duck too hot, remove the meat from the bones, tossing it into a bowl as you work.

Shred the meat with two forks.  Place the duck meat and skin on a serving plate.  Place separate bowls of cucumber, green onions and hoisin sauce and a plate of green onion pancakes alongside.

To eat, spread a small amount of hoisin sauce over a green onion pancake, top with some of the duck meat and skin, cucumber and green onion.  Roll the pancake around the filling like a burrito.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirS>
<DirT>
Place the ginger, star anise, cinnamon, Sichuan peppercorns and cardamom in the center of an 8-inch square of cheese cloth.  Bring the corners of the square together and tie them with a string to form a bag that encloses the spices.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Dish:  Place the duck in a 5-quart pot and pour in enough cold water to cover.  Add the spice bag and bring the water to a boil over high heat.  Adjust the heat so the water is simmering, cover the pot and simmer until the duck thigh is tender when poked with a fork, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lift the duck from the water with a large wire skimmer or by inserting a sturdy wooden spoon into the body cavity.  Hold the duck over the pot to allow water to drain back into the pot.  Transfer the duck to a colander and drain completely.  Cool to room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir the soy sauce and sugar together in a small pan over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved.  Let cool.  Pat the duck dry on all sides with paper towels.  Brush the duck 3 or 4 times with the soy syrup to coat it well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the oil in a wok over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Hold the syrup coated duck by a hook inserted behind its wing joint or with a sturdy pair tongs and suspend the duck over the hot oil.  With a Chinese ladle, spoon the hot oil repeatedly over the duck until the skin is caramelized and crispy, 5 to 6 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Briefly cool the duck.  Remove the skin from the duck and cut the skin into thin strips.  Using your hands, and using rubber gloves for protection if you find the duck too hot, remove the meat from the bones, tossing it into a bowl as you work.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Shred the meat with two forks.  Place the duck meat and skin on a serving plate.  Place separate bowls of cucumber, green onions and hoisin sauce and a plate of green onion pancakes alongside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To eat, spread a small amount of hoisin sauce over a green onion pancake, top with some of the duck meat and skin, cucumber and green onion.  Roll the pancake around the filling like a burrito.
</DirT>

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  russet [Idaho] potato - (abt 2) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2         pound  salt cod fillets
     1/4           cup  chopped green onion
     1/4           cup  minced cilantro
     1/4           cup  chopped pitted oil-cured olives
  1                     egg white
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  grated ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  1                cup  Japanese breadcrumbs (panko)
                        = (or coarse dry breadcrumbs)
  1                     egg -- for coating

Place cod in a bowl and cover with cold water.  Soak for 6 to 8 hours, changing the water once or twice.  Drain, rinse very well and pat dry.  Shred fish with your fingers.

Pour 3 inches of water into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add the diced potatoes, and cook until tender, 10 to 12 minutes.  Drain the potatoes, return them to the pan briefly.  (The heat from the pan will evaporate excess moisture from the potatoes.)  Mash the potatoes until smooth, then whisk in the butter.

Stir the cod into the mashed potatoes.  Stir in the green onion, cilantro, olives, egg white, sesame oil, salt, garlic, ginger and pepper.

In a chilled bowl, whip the cream until it holds soft peaks.  Gently fold the whipped cream into cod mixture with a rubber spatula.

Using two large soupspoons, form about 3 tablespoons of the cod-potato mixture into an oval fish cake.  Set the cod cake on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining potato mixture.

Spread the breadcrumbs on a plate.  Beat the egg in a wide, shallow bowl.  Dip each cod cake into egg, turning it gently to coat all sides.  Allow any excess egg to drip back into the bowl, then roll the cake in breadcrumbs to coat all sides.  Set the coated fish cakes on a baking sheet.

Place a large skillet over medium heat and pour in 1/4 inch of vegetable oil.  When the oil is hot -- a corner of a cod cake will give off a lively sizzle when dipped in the oil -- add as many of the fish cakes to the skillet as will fit without touching each other.  (You may need to do this in two batches.)  Cook, turning once, until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes.

Remove the fish cakes with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels.  If necessary, repeat with the remaining cod cakes.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
  1           teaspoon  chili sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  1           teaspoon  turmeric powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
     1/3           cup  finely-diced onion
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/4           cup  finely-diced peeled russet potato
     1/4           cup  grated carrot
     1/2         pound  ground beef
                        === FOR THE PUFFS ===
  1                     packge frozen puff pastry dough - (17 oz) -- defrosted
  2                     eggs yolks -- lightly beaten with
  2          teaspoons  water

In small bowl combine cornstarch solution, chili sauce, sesame oil, curry powder, tumeric powder, salt, sugar, black pepper and 5-spice powder.

For the Filling:  Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the onion, ginger, and garlic; stir-fry until the onion is tender, about 1 minute.  Add the potato and carrot and stir-fry until they are almost tender, about 3 minutes.  Add the ground beef and stir-fry until it is broken up and no longer pink, about 2 minutes.  Add the seasoning mixture and mix well.  Scoop the filling from the wok and cool completely before continuing.

For the Puffs:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Roll out each sheet of dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thick.  Cut the dough into 3-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or tumbler.  Place about 1 tablespoon of stuffing in center of each round.  Moisten the edges of dough with the tip of your finger dipped in water.  Fold the dough in half to enclose the filling.  Press the edges together firmly to seal, then crimp the edges with the tines of a fork.

Place the pies 2 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet.  Brush the tops with egg yolk mixture.  Bake until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1         tablespoon  chili garlic sauce
  2          teaspoons  dry mustard powder
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  4                     beef steaks, abt 1" thick - (6 oz ea) -- trimmed
                        = (such as New York strip steaks)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  8                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced ginger
  4                     button mushrooms -- sliced, thinly
  4                     shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed, and
                        caps thinly sliced
  3                     oyster mushrooms -- (optional)
     1/3           cup  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or 1/3 cup dry sherry)

Stir the whipping cream, oyster-flavored sauce, chili garlic sauce and dry mustard together in a small bowl until thoroughly mixed.

For the Dish:  Sprinkle both sides of the steak lightly with the salt and black pepper.

Heat a skillet large enough to hold the steaks in a single layer over medium-high heat.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan.  Lay the steaks into the pan and cook, turning once halfway through the cooking, until they are done to your liking, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare, longer for more well-done steaks.  Transfer the steaks to a plate and cover them with aluminum foil, shiny-side down, to keep them warm.

Return the pan to medium-high heat and add the butter.  When melted, add the garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the mushrooms and wine; stir-fry until the mushrooms are tender, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the sauce and bring to a boil.  Divide the steaks among four plates and spoon the mushroom sauce over them.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE DOUGH ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  boiling water
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  4                     dried black mushrooms
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced napa cabbages
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  ground beef
  1                     Chinese sausage - (abt 2 oz) -- chopped, (optional)
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced cilantro
     1/4           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  1         tablespoon  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DIPPING SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  chili garlic sauce
  1         tablespoon  Chinese black vinegar
                        = (or balsamic vinegar)
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2               cups  water

For the Dough:  Sift flour into a medium mixing bowl, slowly pour boiling water in flour while stirring with a wooden spoon.  (Note: do not let the water cool before adding it to flour; it must be very hot in order to cook the starches.)  Continue stirring until dough forms a ball.  Remove dough onto a lightly floured work surface.  While the dough is still quite warm, knead it until smooth.  Roll it into a 1-inch wide cylinder and portion into 16 equal pieces.  Roll pieces into balls; cover with a damp paper towel until ready to fill.

For the Filling:  In a medium bowl, combine mushrooms, cabbage, ground meat, Chinese sausage, ginger, cilantro, chicken stock, oyster-flavored sauce, sesame oil, cornstarch and white pepper.  Mix well.

For the Dipping Sauce:  In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, black vinegar, sesame oil and sugar. Stir until sugar dissolves. Set aside.

For the Dumpling Preparation:  On a lightly-floured work surface, flatten a ball of dough with the palm of your hand.  Using a rolling pin, roll it into a thin disk.  Place a heaping tablespoon filling into the center of the disk, bring the sides together and seal only the top, leaving opposite sides open and filling exposed.  Place dumpling, seam-side up, on a plate, pressing down lightly to give it a flat base.  Cover with a damp paper towel while filling the remaining dumplings.

Place a 10-inch non-stick frying pan over medium heat until hot.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Place half of the potstickers, seam-side up, into pan.  Cook until bottoms are golden brown, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Add 1 cup water; reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until all liquid is absorbed, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Repeat with remaining potstickers, oil and water.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === FOR THE GOLDEN PANCAKES ===
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2       package  fresh thin Chinese egg noodles -- (abt 8 oz)
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
     1/4         pound  flank steak -- sliced thinly
                        across the grain
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- approximately
     1/2                onion -- sliced thinly

Remove from the pan.  Add onion and stir-fry until almost tender, about 1 minute.  Add the asparagus and cook, stirring, until tender-crisp, about 2 minutes.  Return the meat to wok.  Pour in the sauce and bring to a boil; continue cooking until slightly thickened.

Spoon beef asparagus stir-fry over the crispy noodle cake.

     1/4           cup  water
  4          teaspoons  soy sauce
                        = (or light soy sauce)

For the Sauce:  Stir the water, soy sauce, wine and sugar together in a small saucepan.

For the Rolls:  Cut each rice noodle sheet into four 5- by 8-inch rectangles.  Lay one of the rice noodle rectangles on the work surface with one of the long edges toward you.  Spread 1/4 cup of the filling in a band along the bottom edge of the rice noodle.  Roll loosely to enclose the filling.  Flatten the roll slightly with your hand and place it in a heatproof 9-inch glass pie plate.  Repeat with the remaining noodles and filling, arranging the rolls in a single layer in the baking dish as you work.

Prepare the wok for steaming.  Steam the rolls over high heat until the beef is cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes.

Heat the sauce to simmering, pour over the steamed rolls and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 rolls for 4 servings.

Flatten the roll slightly with your hand and place it in a heatproof 9-inch glass pie plate.  Repeat with the remaining noodles and filling, arranging the rolls in a single layer in the baking dish as you work.

</DirT>
<DirT>

</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 rolls for 4 servings.

  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  minced canned chipotle pepper in adobo
                        === FOR THE ROLLS ===
  2                     sheets Japanese nori
  2               cups  cooked medium-grain rice -- cooled
                        Wasabi paste -- to taste
  2                     strips ahi tuna, cut 1/4" by 8" long
     1/4                carrot -- shredded
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced Japanese pickled ginger -- plus more
                        for serving the rolls
  2                     chives
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  toasted white sesame seeds
                        === FOR THE BEER BATTER ===
     1/4           cup  bread flour
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  almond meal
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  Kosher salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  6        tablespoons  beer -- or as needed
                        === FOR THE DEEP-FRYING ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
                        Cornstarch -- for dusting

Stir the soy sauce and wasabi powder together in a small bowl until blended, then stir in the plum sauce and hoisin sauce.

For the Chipotle Aioli:  Stir the mayonnaise, garlic and chipotle peppers together in a small bowl until blended.

For the Rolls:  Place a sheet of nori horizontally over a bamboo mat or a piece of plastic wrap.  Spread 1 cup of the rice evenly over the nori, leaving a 1/2- to 3/4-inch border along the top edge.  Spread a thin film of the wasabi paste over the rice.  Place thin strips of ahi end-to-end across the bottom third of the rice.  Spread a thin film of chipotle aioli along one side of the ahi.  Sprinkle half the carrot and half the ginger over the ahi.  Lay one of the chives alongside the ahi.  Sprinkle half the salt and pepper and half the sesame seeds over the filling.  Starting with the edge closest to you, and lifting the mat or plastic wrap to help you along, form a compact cylinder.  Wet the top edge of the nori and press to seal.  Repeat to make a second roll.

For the Beer Batter:  Stir the bread flour, all-purpose flour, almond meal, baking powder, salt and pepper together in a wide, shallow bowl until blended.  Stir in the beer.  The batter should be just thick enough to coat a spoon.  If the consistency is too heavy, add more beer, one tablespoon at a time, until adjusted.

For the Deep-Frying:  Pour enough vegetable oil into In a deep wide skillet to fill 2 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Dredge the rolls in cornstarch to coat them lightly.  Shake off the excess.  Dip the rolls into the batter, rolling them to coat all the sides evenly.  Let the excess batter drip back into the bowl, then immediately slide the roll into the hot oil.  Deep-fry, turning as necessary, until the batter is golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Slice each roll diagonally into 2 or 3 pieces.  Serve hot with dipping sauce and additional pickled ginger.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

     1/4         pound  fish mousse
     1/4         pound  uncooked medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined,

                        one stalk regular celery, minced)
  1                     green onion -- trimmed, minced
  1           teaspoon  grated ginger
  1                     egg white
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE WONTONS ===
  16                    wonton wrappers
                        === FOR THE SEAFOOD MARINADE ===
  2          teaspoons  Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
     1/4      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  12                    uncooked medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined
  6                     sea scallops -- halved horizontally
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  6               cups  seafood stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  16                    snow peas -- ends trimmed
  12                    thin slices Char Siu
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper

Pour enough warm water over the tangerine peel in a small bowl to cover completely.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain the peel and mince.

Make the filling:  Stir the fish mousse, shrimp, Chinese celery, green onion, ginger, egg white, salt, sesame oil, pepper and tangerine peel together in a small bowl until well mixed and spongy.

For the Wontons:  Place 1 heaping teaspoonful of the filling in the center of each wonton wrapper.  (Keep the remaining wrappers covered with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out.)  Brush the edges of the wrapper with a fingertip dipped in water, then fold the wrapper in half to form a triangle.  Pinch the edges firmly to seal.  Pull the opposite corners of the base of the triangle together, moisten one of the corners with water, and press the corners together firmly to seal.  Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling, covering the formed wontons with a damp kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out.

For the Seafood Marinade:  Stir the rice wine, sesame oil and pepper together in a small bowl until blended.  Toss the shrimp and scallops gently in the marinade until coated.  Set aside for 10 minutes.

For the Dish:  Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.  Add the wontons and cook until they rise to the surface, about 5 minutes after the water returns to a boil.  Drain well.

Meanwhile, bring the stock to a boil in a separate pot.  Adjust the heat so the stock is simmering, then stir in the marinated shrimp and scallops and the snow peas.  Simmer until the seafood is cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Slide the cooked wontons and Char siu into the broth and season the broth with salt and pepper.  Ladle the soup into large warm bowls, dividing the wontons, shrimp, scallops and snow peas evenly.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1            package  flat Chinese egg noodles - (16 oz)
  3                     baby bok choy -- halved lengthwise

Arrange the bok choy around the noodles and cover the bowl with aluminum foil, shiny-side down, to keep warm.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the seafood and carrots, stir-fry until the shrimp turn pink, about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and sauce; mix well.  Bring to a boil.  Scoop the contents of the wok into the center of the noodles and serve immediately.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  vegetable stock
                        = (or canned vegetable broth)
     1/4           cup  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2                     bean curd sticks
  6                     dried mushrooms
  2                     dried wood ear mushrooms
     1/4           cup  dried lily buds
     1/2           cup  dried bean thread noodles
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  fermented bean curd
  1                cup  button mushrooms -- stems trimmed,
                        and caps quartered
  1                cup  napa cabbage in 1" pieces
  6                     tofu puffs
     1/2           cup  canned water chestnuts -- drained
     1/2           cup  trimmed green beans in 2" lengths
     1/4           cup  canned ginko nuts -- drained
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil

Stir the stock, oyster-flavoured sauce, soy sauce and sugar together in a medium bowl until the sugar is desolved.

For the Dish:  Pour enough warm water over the dried bean curd sticks in a medium bowl to cover them completely.  Soak until soft enough to cut, about 1 hour.  Drain the bean curd and cut into bite-sized pieces.

Pour enough warm water over the mushrooms, wood ears and lily buds in a large bowl to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain.  Discard the black mushroom stems and leave the caps whole.  Cut the wood ear mushrooms into thin strips.  Cut off the hard tip of the lily buds, then tie each bud into a knot in the center.

Pour enough warm water over the bean thread noodles in a medium bowl to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 10 minutes.  Drain the noodles, lay them out on a cutting board and cut them in half crosswise.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the bean curd and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the fermented red bean curd, mushrooms, wood ears, lily buds, noodles, button mushrooms, cabbage, tofu puffs, water chestnuts, green beans, pine nuts, gingko nuts and sauce.  Stir once or twice to mix well and bring to a boil.  Adjust the heat so the liquid is simmering, cover the wok and simmer until the bean curd is tender, 8 to 10 minutes.

Stir in the sesame oil, scoop onto a serving platter and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        === FOR THE QUESADILLAS ===
  8                     flour tortillas - (8" dia)
     1/2         pound  mozzarella cheese -- cut thin slices
  32                    cilantro -- leaves, (optional)
  2                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into thin strips abt 2" long

Toss the tomatoes, water chestnuts, onion, green onions, cilantro and salt together in a medium bowl until well mixed.

For the Filling:  Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add both types of char siu, roast duck, Chinese sausage and green onion.  Stir-fry until the sausage is cooked through about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the hoisin sauce and chili garlic sauce.

For the Quesadillas:  Heat a 9- or 10-inch non-stick pan over medium-high heat until hot.  For each quesadilla, place 1 tortilla in the pan.  Top with 1 slice cheese, 2 to 3 tablespoons of the pork mixture, 8 cilantro leaves, green onions and a second slice of cheese.  Cover the filling with another tortilla.  Cook, turning as needed, until the cheese is melted and the tortilla is browned on both sides, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 3 more quesadillas.  Cut the quesadillas in wedges and serve hot with the salsa.

                      Chicken And Vegetable Pillows

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  boneless chicken breast halves
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  4                     fresh shiitake mushrooms -- thinly sliced
  4                     green onions -- halved
  4                     asparagus spears -- trimmed, blanched
     1/2         small  carrot -- julienned
     1/2         small  zucchini -- julienned
     1/4           cup  julienned bamboo shoots
  1         tablespoon  julienned ginger
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     2/3           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or cup canned chicken broth)
     1/4           cup  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onion

Prepare the chicken:  Remove the tender from underneath the breast and save for another use.  Butterfly each breast and place it between two pieces of plastic wrap.  Pound it with a meat mallet or the side of a cleaver until 1/2-inch thick.  Repeat with the remaining breasts.

Place the chicken in a bowl with the soy sauce, wine, cornstarch, sugar, 5-spice powder and white pepper; stir until the chicken is evenly coated.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

For the Filling:  Remove each breast from the marinade, lightly shaking off the excess marinade.  Place the breast on a work surface with the crease pointing towards you.  Evenly distribute a quarter of the filling ingredients on the bottom third of the breast.  Roll the filling up in the breast.  Tie a kitchen string around the ends of the rolled chicken breast to secure.  Repeat with the remaining breasts.

For the Dish:  Place a flat-bottomed wok or medium non-stick frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the bottom.  Place the breasts in the pan, seam-side down, and cook until golden brown on all sides.  Remove the chicken from wok.

Remove any excess oil from the pan; return the breasts to the wok and add the stock, wine and soy sauce.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the filling ingredients are tender, about 15 minutes.  With a slotted spoon or metal tongs, remove the chicken to a serving platter.

Increase the heat to high; add the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring until the sauce boils and thickens, about 30 seconds.  Pour sauce over the chicken on the serving platter.  Or serve each breast sliced diagonally with a spoonful of the sauce.  Sprinkle with the green onions.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                             Chicken Siu Mai

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dim Sum

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     dried black mushrooms
  1              pound  ground chicken
     1/4           cup  minced bamboo shoots
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  1                     green onion -- trimmed, minced
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/8      teaspoon  sesame oil
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  30                    round siu mai wrappers
  3        tablespoons  grated carrots
  2        tablespoons  frozen peas -- thawed
  2                     lettuce leaves
                        = (or 2 napa cabbage leaves)

Pour enough warm water over the mushrooms in a small bowl to cover them completely.  Let soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain the mushrooms, discard the stems and mince the caps.

Make the filling:  Stir the ground chicken or turkey, bamboo shoots, egg, green onion, soy sauce, salt, ginger, sugar, cornstarch, sesame oil, pepper and mushrooms together in a bowl until thoroughly combined and spongy.

Make the dumplings:  Place a heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center of a siu mai wrapper.  (Keep the remaining wrappers covered with a damp kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out.)  Bring the sides of the wrapper together, bunching them around the filling and smoothing out any pleats.  (If you like, you can spend a little time making nice, even pleats on each dumpling.)  Flatten the bottom of the dumpling by tapping it against a firm surface and squeeze the sides of the dumpling gently so the filling plumps out of the top.  Place a few shreds of carrot and a pea over the filling.  Set the dumpling on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.  Cover the formed dumplings with a damp kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out.

Prepare a wok for steaming.  Line a steaming basket with the lettuce or cabbage leaves.  Arrange half the dumplings without touching each other in the prepared basket.  Steam over high heat until the filling is cooked through, about 15 minutes.

Transfer the dumplings to a serving platter and cover with foil, shiny-side down, to keep them warm while you steam the remaining dumplings.  Serve the dumplings warm.

This recipe yields 25 to 30 dumplings for 12 servings.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  Hoisin sauce
     1/4           cup  honey
  2        tablespoons  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1         tablespoon  sesame seed paste
                        = (or mashed white fermented bean curd)
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
  1               drop  red food colouring - (to 5) -- (optional)
  2             pounds  boneless pork shoulder or butt -- excess fat trimmed,
                        cut into pieces abt 1" thick, 3" wide,
                        and 8" long

Marinate the pork:  Stir the sugar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, honey, rice wine, sesame seed paste, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, salt, black pepper, five spice powder and red food coloring (if using) together in a bowl.  Place the pork in a large resealable plastic bag, pour the marinade into the bag and seal the bag securely.  Turn the bag to coat the pork with marinade.  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight, turning the bag occasionally.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Remove the pork from the marinade and reserve the marinade.  Place the pork on a rack set over a foil-lined baking pan.  Bake, uncovered, brushing occasionally with the reserved marinade, for 30 minutes.

Turn the pieces of pork over and bake, brushing occasionally with the reserved marinade, until the pork is cooked through and tender, about 45 minutes.

Let the pork rest for 10 minutes before cutting into thin slices.  The pork can be served hot or cold.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable shortening or butter -- for greasing pan
  4              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  cake flour
  1                cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  whole or part skim milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1 1/2      teaspoons  water
     1/2           cup  lard
                        = (or vegetable shortening)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Whipped cream -- (optional)
                        Drained rinsed fresh berries -- (optional)

Grease a 6-inch Chinese steamer basket or a 1-quart soufflÈ dish with the shortening or butter.  Line the bottom with a circle of parchment paper and the sides with a band of paper.

Beat the eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer until thick and doubled in volume, 4 to 5 minutes.  Stir the flour and sugar together in a small bowl.  While continuing to beat the eggs, add the flour/sugar mixture to the eggs 2 tablespoons at a time.  Beat until light, about 10 minutes.  Add the milk and baking powder and beat for 2 minutes.

Dissolve the baking soda in the water and pour into the batter.  Continue beating and add the lard and vanilla extract.  Beat until incorporated, about 2 minutes.  Pour the batter into the prepared container.

Prepare a wok for steaming.  Set the container into the steamer, cover tightly and steam over high heat for 30 minutes or until a wood pick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.

Remove the cake from the steaming basket and cool slightly.  Cut into wedges with a serrated knife.  Serve plain or with berries and whipped cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2            cup  water
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  alum powder
  4               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus more
                        for kneading the dough
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

Stir the water, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and alum powder together in a large bowl.  Let stand until small bubbles form, about 5 minutes.

Stir in the flour and mix until the dough is stiff and smooth.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface.  Knead, adding more flour as necessary to prevent sticking, until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let stand, until slightly puffy and soft, about 30 minutes.

Knead the dough again for 5 minutes, recover, and let stand for 30 minutes.

Knead the dough briefly to remove any air bubbles.  Rub the 1 tablespoon oil over the surface of the dough, then place the dough in a 2-gallon resealable plastic bag.  Seal the bag, then press the dough inside the bag into a rectangle.  Let the dough rise in a warm location of the kitchen until it puffs slightly, about for 4 hours.

Place the dough on a lightly floured surface.  Flatten and stretch the dough to make a 12- by 8-inch rectangle about 1/4-inch thick.  Cut the dough crosswise into 12 strips, each about 2/3- to 1-inch wide, then cut the strips in half crosswise.

Form the doughnuts:  stack two strips of dough, one atop the other, then press a thin chopstick lengthwise along the center of the top piece of dough to seal the two pieces of dough together.

Pour enough oil into a wok to fill 3 inches.  Heat to 350 degrees.  Hold the ends of one of the doughnuts, stretch it out to about 6 inches, then carefully slip it into the hot oil.  The doughnut will shrink in length then puff.  Fry the doughnuts, a few at a time, turning continuously until golden brown, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Remove the doughnuts with a wire skimmer or slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Fry the remaining doughnuts.  Serve with jook or sprinkled with powdered sugar.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 doughnuts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  mashed drained medium tofu
  1                cup  finely-chopped roasted peanuts
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        === FOR THE CREPES ===
     2/3           cup  water
     1/3           cup  milk
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- for frying

Stir the tofu, peanuts and sugar together in a bowl until well blended.

For the Crepes:  Whisk the water, milk, egg and oil together in a separate bowl until blended.  Add the flour and mix until smooth.

Heat a non-stick 8-inch frying pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of the oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan.  Add 1/4 cup of the batter to the pan, while tilting the pan so the batter covers the entire bottom of the pan in an even layer.  Cook until the crepe is set and the bottom is light brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Turn the crepe and cook until set, about 30 seconds.  Spread one-fourth of the tofu mixture in a one-inch band, slightly below the center of the crepe.  Fold the bottom of the crepe over the filling, then roll the crepe into a neat, slightly flattened cylinder.  Slide the filled crepe onto a warm plate and cover with aluminum foil, shiny-side down, to keep warm.

Make and fill three more crepes as described above, adding more oil to the pan as needed.  (Leftover crepe batter, if any, can be refrigerated for up to two days.)  Cut each crepe into thirds and serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm white fish fillets
                        = (such as catfish or grouper)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE SEASONINGS ===
     1/4           cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  plum sauce
  3        tablespoons  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  pickled cucumber
                        = (or pickled ginger)
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped carrot
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped green bell pepper
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
     1/4           cup  cornstarch

Lay one of the fillets on a cutting board with the tail end facing you.  Working with a thin-bladed knife and holding the blade parallel to the cutting board, cut through the center of the fillet starting at one of the long sides.  Do not cut all the way through the fillet; the idea is to 'butterfly' it, so it opens up like a book.  Close the fillet back up and cut it crosswise -- through the uncut side -- into 1/2-inch strips.  Sprinkle fish filets with salt and pepper.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

For the Seasonings:  Stir the ketchup, vinegar, plum sauce, chicken stock, brown sugar and pickled cucumber or ginger together in a small bowl until well blended.

For the Dish:  Heat a 2-quart saucepan over high heat until hot.  Add oil and swirl to coat the bottom.  Add the celery, carrot, onion and bell pepper and stir-fry until the carrots are tender-crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.  Pour in the seasonings, bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat to low to keep the sauce warm.

Pour enough vegetable oil into the wok to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 375 degrees.  Dust the fish strips with cornstarch to coat them lightly and shake gently to remove any excess.  Hold one of the fish strips by the uncut end and slowly lower the cut end into the oil.  Move the fish constantly as you lower it so the cut ends begin to curl.  When the ends begin to curl, release the fish into the oil.  Repeat with as many of the remaining fish fillets as will fit into the oil without crowding.  Cook until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the fillets with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining fillet strips.

Arrange the fried fillets on a warm platter with the curled ends facing up or toward the side.  Spoon the sauce over the fish and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Lay one of the fillets on a cutting board with the tail end facing you.  Working with a thin-bladed knife and holding the blade parallel to the cutting board, cut through the center of the fillet starting at one of the long sides.  Do not cut all the way through the fillet; the idea is to &apos;butterfly&apos; it, so it opens up like a book.  Close the fillet back up and cut it crosswise -- through the uncut side -- into 1/2-inch strips.  Sprinkle fish filets with salt and pepper.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  mushroom vegetable stock
                        = (or canned vegetable broth)
  2        tablespoons  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  4                     dried black mushrooms
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  1            package  firm tofu - (14 oz) -- drained, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  5             slices  peeled ginger
  2                     shallots -- quartered
  1                     leek, white part only -- halved lengthwise,
                        rinsed well, then cut into 2" lengths
  1                     carrot -- sliced thinly on
                        the bias

Stir the vegetable stock, oyster-flavored sauce, sugar and pepper together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.

For the Dish:  Pour enough warm water over the mushrooms in a medium bowl to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain.  Discard the mushroom stems and cut the caps into quarters.

Pour enough oil into a 2-quart saucepan to fill 3 inches.  Bring to 350 degrees over medium-high heat.  Slip about one-third of the tofu into the oil.  Deep-fry until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove the tofu with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining tofu.  Reserve the oil.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the reserved oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the ginger and shallots and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 20 seconds.  Add the mushrooms, leek, and carrot.  Stir-fry for 1 minute.

Transfer the contents of the wok to a clay pot.  (If you do not have a clay pot, the recipe may be prepared from start to end in a wok.)  Pour in the sauce and stir in the tofu.  Bring to a boil over medium heat, then adjust the heat so the sauce is simmering.  Cover the pot and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes.  Serve hot from the pot, if using, or ladle the contents of the wok into a warm serving bowl.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dried cloud-ear mushroom
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  1            package  firm tofu - (14 oz) -- drained, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  julienned ginger
  1                     red jalapeÒo chili pepper -- seeded, julienned
     1/4           cup  chopped Chinese celery, stems only
                        = (or regular celery)
  4                     tofu puffs -- cut in half
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro leaves
  1                     green onion -- chopped
                        === SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  vegetarian oyster-flavoured sauce
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  chili brown bean paste
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  Chinese black vinegar
                        = (or balsamic vinegar)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Soak the cloud ears in warm water to cover until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain and squeeze to remove excess liquid.  Discard the tough stems and coarsely chop.

Prepare a 2-quart saucepan for deep-frying.  Heat the oil to 350 degrees.  Using a paper towel, pat the firm tofu to remove any excess liquid.  Carefully slide half of the firm tofu into the oil; cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining firm tofu.

Prepare the sauce.

Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the ginger, chili pepper and Chinese celery; cook, stirring until the celery is tender, about 1 minute.  Add the fried firm tofu, tofu puff and sauce; cook for 1 minute.  Transfer the mixture into a 2-quart clay pot.  Place over medium-high heat; cover and simmer for 15 minutes.

Remove the clay pot from the heat and sprinkle with the cilantro and chopped green onion.  Serve directly from the clay pot.

Sauce:  In a small bowl, combine the water, vegetarian oyster-flavored sauce, soy sauce, chili brown bean paste, sesame oil, vinegar, salt, sugar and pepper; stir until the sugar is dissolved.  Set aside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh Chinese egg noodles
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  5                     wonton wrappers -- thinly sliced
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  2                     green onions -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  bean sprouts
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced Chinese roast pork
                        = (or cooked shredded chicken)
     1/4           cup  shredded Sichuan pickled vegetables
     1/4           cup  chopped roasted peanuts
                        === SAUCE ===
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  2        tablespoons  smooth peanut butter
  2        tablespoons  sesame paste
  1         tablespoon  Chinese black vinegar
  1           teaspoon  chili sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  toasted ground Sichuan peppercorns
     1/2      teaspoon  dried red chili flakes

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Cook the noodles according to package instructions.  Drain, rinse and drain again.  Place in a colander, toss in 1 teaspoon sesame oil to coat and top with 2 cups ice cubes.  Place in sink or place over a bowl to catch the dripping water.

Prepare a small saucepan for deep-frying.  Heat the oil to 350 degrees.  Slide the wonton strips into the hot oil.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the strips are a light golden brown, about 1 minute.  Remove with slotted spoon or wire strainer and drain on paper towels.  Set aside.  Reserve the oil.

Place a non-stick frying pan over high heat until hot.  Add 1 teaspoon of the reserved oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Pour the egg into the pan, tilting to spread evenly across the bottom of the pan.  Cook until the egg is firm in the center, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes; remove the eggs from the pan and set on a cutting board.  Cool slightly and cut into thin strips.

For the Sauce:  Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 2 teaspoons of reserved oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the garlic, cook until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the stock, peanut butter, sesame paste, vinegar, chili sauce, sesame oil, sugar, salt, Sichuan peppercorns and red chili flakes; mix until smooth.  Bring to a boil and cook for 30 seconds.  Pour into a small serving bowl.

Remove any remaining ice cubes from the noodles.  Mound the noodles in the center of a large serving platter; surround the noodles with the wonton strips, egg strips, green onions, bean sprouts, roast pork, Sichuan pickled vegetables and peanuts.  Serve the sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

To clean the crabs, pull off the top shell.  Remove and discard the feathery off-white lungs and spongy parts under the shell.  Break off the legs and claws and crack them with a cleaver or mallet.  If using a Dungeness crab, cut the bodies into 4 pieces each.  If using blue crabs, cut the bodies in half.  Dust the crab pieces with flour to coat lightly.

For the Sauce:  Stir the chicken stock, rice wine, green onions, basil, vinegar and soy sauce together in a bowl.

For the Dish:  Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the coated crab pieces and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add the ginger and stir-fry for 2 minutes.  Pour in the sauce and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to simmering, cover the wok and cook, stirring once, until the crab is cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.

Stir in the dissolved cornstarch and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.

Scoop the contents of the wok onto a serving platter and serve immediately.

                       Crispy Bean Curd Sheet Wrap

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Wraps

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     dried black mushrooms
     1/2           cup  dried shredded wood ear mushrooms
     1/2       package  firm tofu
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1              small  carrot -- thinly sliced
  2                     Chinese long beans -- halved lengthwise,
                        and cut into 2" lengths - (abt 1/2 cup)
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced celery
  1              piece  pressed tofu -- cut thin slices
  2        tablespoons  vegetarian oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  3                     bean curd sheets -- cut into 4" squares
  3        tablespoons  flour -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  water - (to 1 1/2) -- for thick paste
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
                        Sweet chili sauce -- for dipping

In a small bowl soak the mushrooms and woodears in warm water to cover until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain and discard the stem from the mushroom and thinly slice the cap.  Squeeze the woodears to remove excess water.

Place firm tofu in cheesecloth or dish towel and firmly squeeze to remove liquid from tofu; it will look dry and crumbly.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the carrots, long beans, celery, pressed tofu, mushrooms and woodears; cook, stirring until carrots are tender-crisp, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Add the vegetarian oyster-flavored sauce, salt, pepper and crumbled firm tofu; cook, while stirring, until the vegetables are tender, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Transfer from the wok to a bowl and allow the mixture to cool.

Prepare the wrap:  Place one bean curd sheet square on work surface.  Place 2 heaping tablespoons of the filling in the center of the square.  Using a brush or your fingertips, paint the edges of the square with the flour paste.  Fold one corner of the square over the filling to create a triangle.  Firmly press the edges to seal.  Repeat with remaining bean curd sheet squares.

Prepare a wide 2-quart sauce pan for deep-frying.  Heat oil to 350 degrees.  Slide wraps two at a time into the hot oil.  Fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Serve hot with sweet chili sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 wraps.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  minced green onions
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
                        === FOR THE VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  Chinese rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  1 1/2     tablespoon  white miso
  1 1/2     tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  chunky peanut butter
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4           cup  water -- or as needed
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2                     halibut fillets - (7 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  Japanese breadcrumbs (panko)
                        = (or coarse dry breadcrumbs)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  butter
     1/2           cup  sliced shiitake mushroom caps
     1/2           cup  enoki mushroom
  1                cup  corn kernels - (abt 2 ears)
  2                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into thin strips about 2" long
  2           teaspoon  black sesame seeds

Stir the minced green onion and ginger together in a heat-proof bowl.  Heat a small skillet over high heat until hot.  Add 1/2 cup vegetable oil and heat just until it begins to smoke.  Carefully pour the oil into the bowl.  Let it sizzle and cool.  Reserve.

For the Vinaigrette:  Combine 1/2 cup vegetable oil, the vinegar, chicken stock, mayonnaise, miso, sugar, peanut butter, mustard and sesame oil in a blender jar or the work bowl of a food processor.  Blend until smooth.  With the motor running pour in enough water to attain a consistency similar to a heavy syrup.

For the Dish:  Season the halibut fillets with salt and pepper.  Drizzle just enough of the seasoned oil onto the fillets to coat both sides completely.  Pat the panko onto both sides of the halibut.

Heat a sautÈ pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Pour in 1/4 vegetable cup oil and place the halibut fillets into the pan, dropping them away from you to prevent splashing yourself with oil.  Cook, making sure the panko does not burn, until both sides are golden brown and the halibut is cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.  Remove and place on paper towels to drain.  Pour the remaining oil out of the pan.

Place the butter in the pan and place over high heat.  As soon as the butter is melted add the shiitake and all but a few of the enoki mushrooms.  SautÈ until tender, about 2 minutes.  Add the corn kernels and sautÈ for another 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.  Season the vegetables with salt and pepper to taste.

Spoon 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette onto each of two plates.  Make a well in the center of the vinaigrette.  Spoon half the mushroom and corn mixture in the well on each plate.  Set the halibut filets on top of mushroom and corn.  Scatter the green onion strips, black sesame seeds and the reserved enoki over the fillets.  Drizzle a small amount of the seasoned oil over the vinaigrette and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Stir the minced green onion and ginger together in a heat-proof bowl.  Heat a small skillet over high heat until hot.  Add 1/2 cup vegetable oil and heat just until it begins to smoke.  Carefully pour the oil into the bowl.  Let it sizzle and cool.  Reserve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Vinaigrette:  Combine 1/2 cup vegetable oil, the vinegar, chicken stock, mayonnaise, miso, sugar, peanut butter, mustard and sesame oil in a blender jar or the work bowl of a food processor.  Blend until smooth.  With the motor running pour in enough water to attain a consistency similar to a heavy syrup.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Dish:  Season the halibut fillets with salt and pepper.  Drizzle just enough of the seasoned oil onto the fillets to coat both sides completely.  Pat the panko onto both sides of the halibut.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a sautÈ pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Pour in 1/4 vegetable cup oil and place the halibut fillets into the pan, dropping them away from you to prevent splashing yourself with oil.  Cook, making sure the panko does not burn, until both sides are golden brown and the halibut is cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.  Remove and place on paper towels to drain.  Pour the remaining oil out of the pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the butter in the pan and place over high heat.  As soon as the butter is melted add the shiitake and all but a few of the enoki mushrooms.  SautÈ until tender, about 2 minutes.  Add the corn kernels and sautÈ for another 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.  Season the vegetables with salt and pepper to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette onto each of two plates.  Make a well in the center of the vinaigrette.  Spoon half the mushroom and corn mixture in the well on each plate.  Set the halibut filets on top of mushroom and corn.  Scatter the green onion strips, black sesame seeds and the reserved enoki over the fillets.  Drizzle a small amount of the seasoned oil over the vinaigrette and serve.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Spring/Summer Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  grated ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  6             ounces  skinless salmon fillet -- cut into 1/2" wide
                        by 1 1/2" long strips
  6             ounces  skinless halibut fillet -- cut into 1/2" wide
                        by 1 1/2" long strips
  1                     ripe mango
  12                    spring roll wrappers
  24                    cilantro -- leaves
  2             slices  fresh ginger - (quarter size) -- cut thin strips
  1         tablespoon  flour -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

Stir the wine, cornstarch, ginger, salt and pepper together in a medium bowl.

For the Dish:  Toss the salmon and halibut gently in the marinade until coated.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

Peel the mango and cut the fleshy portions from each side of the pit.  Cut the flesh into 12 pieces, each more or less the same size as the fish.

Make the spring rolls:  Place a wrapper, shiny-side down and with one of the corners pointing toward you, on the work surface.  Place a strip of salmon, a strip of halibut, a strip of mango, 2 cilantro leaves and a few strips of ginger across the lower third of the wrapper.  Fold the corner closest to you over filling, then fold the right and left corners over that.  Roll firmly just enough to completely enclose the filling.  Brush the exposed sides and top of the wrapper with some of the flour paste.  Continue rolling into a compact roll, pressing lightly to seal.  Cover the spring rolls with a damp towel to keep them from drying out while preparing the remaining rolls.

Pour enough oil into a wok or 2-quart saucepan to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Carefully slide a few rolls into the oil and fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining rolls.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 12 rolls.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     3/4         pound  raw medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined,

             Double Harmony Meatballs In Sweet And Sour Sauce

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatballs


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  ground chicken or ground turkey
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped water chestnuts
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced cilantro
  1         tablespoon  chopped pimento
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2                egg -- beaten
     1/4      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === PORK MEATBALLS ===
     1/2         pound  ground pork
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped water chestnuts
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1 1/2     tablespoon  minced cilantro
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2                egg -- beaten
     1/4      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === PREPARATION ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
     1/2           cup  sweet and sour sauce -- homemade or
                        store-bought

Combine all the ingredients for both meatballs in separate bowls.  Mix them one at a time with your hands until the ingredients are evenly distributed and the mixture is spongy.  Shape the two meatball mixes into 1-inch balls (about the size of ping-pong balls).

Pour enough oil into a wok or 2-quart saucepan to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Deep-fry the meatballs in three batches, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Heat the sweet and sour sauce in a saucepan large enough to hold all the meatballs over medium heat until hot, about 1 minute.  Add the meatballs and toss until coated and all are heated through.  Mound the meatballs on a serving platter and spoon any sauce remaining in the pan over them.

This recipe yields 5 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  large shrimp - (abt 16) -- shells intact
  3        tablespoons  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
     1/2        medium  onion -- sliced thinly
  2             slices  peeled ginger - (quarter size)
     1/2           cup  Fen Chiew (Chinese distilled spirits)
                        = (or brandy)
  3               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
     1/4           cup  Chinese rice wine

  2                     green onions -- trimmed, and

                        Steamed rice -- for serving

Using kitchen shears, cut through the shells along the back of each shrimp working from the head to the tail.  Remove the sand vein.  Toss the shrimp in a bowl with the rice wine (first amount), ginger, and garlic.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

Heat a 2-quart saucepan over medium high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the yellow onion and cook, stirring constantly, until softened and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the ginger and the shrimp along with their marinade and remove the pot from the heat.

Pour the high alcohol content wine into the pot, return the pot to the heat and, standing well back from the pot, ignite the wine with a long kitchen or fireplace match.  Let burn until the flames die down, 5 to 7 minutes.

Pour the chicken stock over the shrimp, stir in the green onions, and bring to a boil.  Cook for about 2 minutes.  Serve with steamed rice.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3         pound  boneless skinless chicken meat
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
                        === FOR THE DRESSING ===

  2 1/2    tablespoons  honey
                        = (or 2 1/2 tbspns sugar)
  2        tablespoons  plum sauce

  2          teaspoons  soy sauce

     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
                        === FOR THE SALAD ===
  2           packages  dried bean thread noodles -- split
                        = (2 bundles, about 2 oz ea)
  4               cups  thinly-shredded iceberg lettuce -- abt 1/3 head
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped cilantro - (packed loose)
  2                     green onions -- sliced thinly
                        on the bias- (abt 1/3 cup)
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  10                    wonton wrappers -- cut 1/4" wide strips
     1/4           cup  chopped roasted pine nuts
  1         tablespoon  toasted black sesame seeds

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Toss the chicken with the oil, salt and five-spice powder.  Place on a pan and place in the oven until cooked through.

Cool the chicken on a rack until cool enough to the touch and slice into 1/2-inch pieces.

For the Dressing:  In a bowl add the vinegar, honey or sugar, plum sauce, sesame oil, mustard, soy sauce, and chili garlic sauce; using a whisk, mix the ingredients together.  Slowly add the oil and whisk until incorporated.  Refrigerate until needed.

For the Salad:  In a medium bowl, soak 1 bundle of the dried bean thread noodles in warm water to cover until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain and pat dry with a towel to remove excess water and cut in half.

Toss the softened bean thread noodles, lettuce, cilantro and green onions together in a large salad bowl.  Cover and refrigerate.

Pour enough vegetable oil into a wok to fill 3 inches.  Bring the oil to 350 degrees over medium-high heat.  Carefully slip a few of the wonton strips into the oil.  Fry until light golden brown, about 15 to 20 seconds.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining wonton strips, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a steady temperature.

Increase the heat under the wok until the oil reaches 375 degrees.  Separate the strands of the remaining bean thread noodles.  Deep-fry the noodles, stirring them gently to separate the strands until they puff and expand, about 5 to 10 seconds.  Remove and drain on paper towels.

Scatter the chicken over the lettuce mixture, pour the dressing over the salad and toss together.  Scatter the wonton strips, chopped pine nuts and sesame seeds over the top of the salad and top with the fried bean thread noodles.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring the stock, water, duck carcass, celery, chopped carrot, onion, ginger, peppercorns and star anise to a boil in a large pot.  Adjust the heat so the liquid is simmering, cover the pot and simmer for 3 hours.  Strain the stock and discard the solids.

Pour the broth back into the pot and bring to a simmer.  Add the cabbage, carrot strips and mushrooms.  Simmer until the vegetables are tender, 7 to 8 minutes.  Add the green onions and tofu.  Simmer gently until the tofu is heated through.  Season to taste with the salt and black pepper and ladle into warm soup bowls.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                      Duck-Filled Sweet Sesame Balls

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dim Sum

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped roast duck meat
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped dried apricot
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped green onion
  2        tablespoons  Hoisin sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DOUGH ===
  1              pound  glutinous rice flour
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/4           cups  water
     1/4           cup  gin
                        === FOR THE SESAME BALL ASSEMBLY ===
  1                cup  raw white sesame seeds
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

Stir the duck, apricots, green onions, hoisin sauce, salt, sesame oil and pepper together in a medium bowl until blended.

For the Dough:  Stir the rice flour, sugar and baking powder together in a large bowl.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the water and gin.  Stir with chopsticks or a fork until the dough is smooth.

Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes.

For the Sesame Ball Assembly:  Divide the dough into 20 pieces.  Flatten each piece with your fingers into a 2-inch circle.  Place about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of each circle.  Gather and pinch the edges of the circle together to seal in the filling.  Roll between your palms to form a ball.  Repeat with the remaining dough and filling, covering the filled rolls with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out.  Roll the dough balls in the sesame seeds, pressing lightly to help the seeds adhere to the dough.

Pour enough oil into a 2-quart saucepan to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Slide a few of the dough balls into the oil.  Using a Chinese strainer or flat skimmer, move the dumplings around to brown evenly.  When the dumplings rise to the top of the oil, use the strainer to keep them submerged, until they are golden brown, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining dumplings.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 20 dumplings.

              Dungeness Crab With Basil San Francisco-Style

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  store-bought garlic-herb seasoning
                        = (such as McCormick)
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1                     live dungeness crab - (abt 3 lbs)
                        = (or 4 live blue crabs)
                        Cornstarch -- for dusting
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  8                     fresh basil leaves

Stir the garlic, garlic-herb seasoning, garlic salt, pepper and sugar together in a small bowl until blended.

For the Dish:  Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Slip the crab(s) into the water and cook for 2 minutes.  Drain the crab(s), rinse under cold water, and drain again.  If you like, pull off the top shell from the crab(s) in one piece and reserve for a garnish.  (Invert top shell to remove organs and extra water.)

Remove and discard the lungs attached to the shell above the legs and the spongy parts under the shell.  Twist off the claws and legs; crack them with a cleaver or mallet.  Cut the body into 4 pieces (or in half, if using blue crabs) with a heavy chef's knife.  Place the crab pieces into a colander and allow them to drain excess liquid.  Dust the crab pieces with cornstarch to coat them lightly.

Pour enough oil into a wok to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 365 degrees.  Deep-fry the crab, in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pieces, until the shells change color, 2 to 3 minutes.  Lift out the crab with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Spoon the oil from the wok into a heatproof container and return the wok to high heat.  Add the butter and olive oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the seasonings and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 20 seconds.  Add the fried crab and stir to coat.  Pour in the stock and bring to a boil.  Adjust the heat so the sauce is simmering, cover the wok and simmer until the crab is cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes.

Stir in the basil and transfer the crab onto a serving platter.  Spoon the sauce over the crab and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                 Eight Treasures Honeydew Melon Bowl Soup

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  honeydew melon
     1/2                boneless skinless chicken breast -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2             ounces  boneless pork -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2                     sea scallops - (abt 2 oz) -- halved horizontally
  6                     uncooked medium shrimp - (abt 2 oz) -- shelled, deveined,
                        and tails left intact
     1/4           cup  canned straw mushroom -- drained
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced carrot
  2        tablespoons  frozen peas -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  Smithfield or smoked ham -- (optional), cut
                        into thin strips
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2               cups  chicken stock -- or as needed
                        = (or canned chicken broth)

Cut off one-fourth of the honeydew melon from one of the short ends.  Scoop out the seeds and place the melon cut-side up in a deep heat-proof bowl large enough to hold the melon snugly.

Bring a saucepan of water to a boil.  Stir the chicken and pork into the water and cook for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.  Drain.  Add the chicken and pork along with the scallops, shrimp, straw mushrooms, carrot, peas, ham, ginger, sesame oil, salt and pepper to the melon.  Pour in enough of the chicken stock to fill the melon to just below the cut.  Cover the opening with the cut piece of melon.

Lower the bowl into a stockpot, pour in enough water to come half way up the sides of the bowl.  Bring the water to a boil, cover the pot and steam over medium-high heat until the pork is cooked through, 40 to 50 minutes.  Replenish the water in the pot as necessary.

Lift the bowl from the stockpot and serve the soup directly from the melon, including if you like, a little of the melon with every serving.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  barley
  2        tablespoons  dried shrimp
  8                     dried lily buds
  1                     duckling - (abt 4 lbs) -- cleaned, and
                        wing tips removed
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
     1/2           cup  canned lotus seeds -- drained
  2             medium  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        and caps chopped - (abt 1/4 cup)
  1                     salty duck egg yolk
  2        tablespoons  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1             gallon  water - (to 1 1/2)
  8              whole  star anise pods
  1         tablespoon  salt

Pour enough warm water over the barley in a small bowl to cover completely.  Soak for 2 hours.

Meanwhile, pour enough warm water over the dried shrimp and lily buds in separate bowls to cover them.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain.  Cut off the hard tips of the lily buds, then tie each bud into a knot in the center.

Rub the dark soy sauce evenly on the outer skin of duckling, let stand for 10 minutes.

Stir the drained barley, dried shrimp, lily buds, lotus seeds, mushrooms, egg yolk, oyster-flavored sauce, salt, sugar and pepper together in a bowl until mixed.  Spoon the stuffing into the duck body cavity.

Stretch the flap of neck skin over the neck opening and fasten it securely in place with metal or bamboo skewers.  Overlap the flaps of skin on either side of the body cavity and fasten them securely with skewers to prevent the marinade from leaking.  Let stand for 30 minutes.

For the Dish:  Heat a wide skillet over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the bottom.  Place the duck, breast-side down, in the pan and cook until lightly browned, about 4 to 5 minutes each side.

Lift the duck from the pan and place, neck-side down, into a large stock pot.  Pour enough water into the pot to cover the duck.  Add the star anise and salt to the water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Adjust the heat so the liquid is simmering, cover the pot and simmer until the meat is no longer pink at the thigh joint, about 1 hour.  (Check by pricking the meat lightly with a fork at the joint.)

Lift the duck from the cooking liquid, allowing excess liquid to drain back into the pot.  Place the duck on a serving platter and remove the skewers.  Scoop the stuffing and any liquid out of the cavity and mound the stuffing on a serving platter.

Using a heavy meat cleaver, cut the duck into pieces: cut along both sides of the backbone and remove it.  Cut off the legs at the thigh joint and the wings.  Cut the breasts into 3 pieces each.  Place the duck pieces over the stuffing and sauce.  Serve with steamed rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Pour enough warm water over the barley in a small bowl to cover completely.  Soak for 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, pour enough warm water over the dried shrimp and lily buds in separate bowls to cover them.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain.  Cut off the hard tips of the lily buds, then tie each bud into a knot in the center.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rub the dark soy sauce evenly on the outer skin of duckling, let stand for 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir the drained barley, dried shrimp, lily buds, lotus seeds, mushrooms, egg yolk, oyster-flavored sauce, salt, sugar and pepper together in a bowl until mixed.  Spoon the stuffing into the duck body cavity.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stretch the flap of neck skin over the neck opening and fasten it securely in place with metal or bamboo skewers.  Overlap the flaps of skin on either side of the body cavity and fasten them securely with skewers to prevent the marinade from leaking.  Let stand for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Dish:  Heat a wide skillet over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the bottom.  Place the duck, breast-side down, in the pan and cook until lightly browned, about 4 to 5 minutes each side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lift the duck from the pan and place, neck-side down, into a large stock pot.  Pour enough water into the pot to cover the duck.  Add the star anise and salt to the water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Adjust the heat so the liquid is simmering, cover the pot and simmer until the meat is no longer pink at the thigh joint, about 1 hour.  (Check by pricking the meat lightly with a fork at the joint.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lift the duck from the cooking liquid, allowing excess liquid to drain back into the pot.  Place the duck on a serving platter and remove the skewers.  Scoop the stuffing and any liquid out of the cavity and mound the stuffing on a serving platter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a heavy meat cleaver, cut the duck into pieces: cut along both sides of the backbone and remove it.  Cut off the legs at the thigh joint and the wings.  Cut the breasts into 3 pieces each.  Place the duck pieces over the stuffing and sauce.  Serve with steamed rice.

  2                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" lengths
  2                cup  bean sprouts
     1/4           cup  red bell pepper -- cut thin strips
     1/4           cup  sliced fresh button mushroom
                        Cilantro leaves

Stir the cornstarch and salt together in a medium bowl.  Add the fish slices and toss gently to coat them evenly with the marinade.  Set aside for 10 minutes.

For the Sauce:  Stir the lemon juice, oyster-flavored sauce and pepper together in a small bowl.

For the Dish:  Heat a wok over medium heat until hot.  Pour in the oil.  Add the marinated fish.  Stir-fry gently until the fish is cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes.  Scoop the fish out onto a plate and set aside.

Add the ginger, green onions, bean sprouts, bell pepper and mushrooms to the wok and stir-fry until tender-crisp, about 2 minutes.  Pour the sauce into the wok and slide in the cooked fish.  Continue cooking until the fish is heated through, about 1 minute.

Scoop the contents of the wok onto a serving platter and scatter the cilantro leaves over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  oyster-flavoured sauce
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2         pound  boneless skinless chicken -- minced

                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2               cups  cooked long grain rice -- grains separated
                        with fingers
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped Chinese olives
                        = (or 1/4 cup pitted oil-cured olives)
  2        tablespoons  frozen peas -- thawed
  4                     fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        and caps diced
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten

Sprinkle the rice into the wok and stir-fry until heated through, about 2 minutes.  Add the olives, peas and mushrooms.  Cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Push the rice to the sides of the wok and pour the eggs into the center well.  Scramble the eggs until set, then stir to combine the rice and egg.  Add the seasonings and the green onions, and stir-fry until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.  Scoop the rice onto a warm serving platter and serve hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or cup dry sherry)
     1/4           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  3        tablespoons  fermented sweet rice
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  6                     dried cloud-ear mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/2         pounds  firm white fish fillets -- cut 2" by 4" pieces
  2                     green onions -- cut 2" lengths
  2          teaspoons  finely-shredded ginger
     1/2           cup  sliced bamboo -- shoots
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced green onions

In small bowl, combine wine, stock, fermented sweet rice, soy sauce and sugar; stir until sugar is dissolved.

For the Dish:  Soak cloud ears in warm water to cover until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain and squeeze out excess water.

Place a wok over high heat until hot.  Add oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add fish fillets and sear them for 30 seconds per side.  Remove fish and place on a plate.

To wok, add green onions and ginger; cook, stirring until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add cloud ears and bamboo shoots and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Return fish to wok, pour in sauce and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until fish begins to flake and the center is opaque about 5 minutes.  Add cornstarch solution; cook, stirring lightly, until sauce boils and thickens.  Spoon fish and sauce onto a serving plate and garnish with the sliced green onions.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  finely-diced onion
     1/3           cup  unsweetened coconut milk

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable cooking spray -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  white sesame seeds
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  almonds extract
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
     1/4           cup  powdered sugar

Grease a 9-inch square glass baking dish using the vegetable cooking spray.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the sesame seeds and 1 tablespoon of the cornstarch over the bottom of the pan.

Whisk the water, flour, sugar, egg yolks, 1 tablespoon cornstarch and almond extract together in a medium saucepan until smooth.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with the whisk, until the custard is very thick, 5 to 7 minutes.

Pour the custard into the baking dish and spread it into an even layer with a lightly greased spatula.  Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon sesame seeds and 1 tablespoon cornstarch over the top of the custard.  Lightly press into the custard.  Chill the custard, covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator until cool, about 30 minutes.  The custard may be made up to a day in advance.

Cut the custard into sixteen 4- by 1-inch bars.  Pour enough oil into a wok to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium-low heat to 180 degrees.  Carefully remove the custard from the pan, a few at a time, and gently slide them into the oil.  Fry until golden brown, turning occasionally.  Drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining custard.  Sprinkle the fried custard with the powdered sugar and serve warm.

This recipe yields 16 (4- by 1-inch) bars.

                Fried Ice Cream With Ginger-Caramel Sauce

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
                        = (or 2 sticks slab brown sugar)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  water
  3        tablespoons  orange-flavoured liqueur
                        = (such as Triple Sec, Grand Marnier or
                        Cointreau)
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced crystallized ginger -- (optional)
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1              quart  vanilla ice cream
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  crushed Ritz crackers - (abt 6 oz)
                        = (or other butter crackers)
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

Place the brown sugar and butter in a 2-quart pan and cook over medium heat until the butter is melted, about 2 minutes.  Add the water, liqueur, and crystallized ginger; reduce the heat to low and stir until the brown sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil.  Simmer, stirring constantly, until the sauce has thickened, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cover the pan to keep the sauce warm until ready to serve.

For the Dish:  Chill a rimmed baking pan in the freezer.  With an ice cream scoop, form rounds of ice cream about the size of tennis balls.  Placing them on the chilled pan as you do.  Return the pan to the freezer until the ice cream is very hard, at least 4 hours.

Beat the eggs and milk in a wide shallow bowl until completely blended.  Spread out the flour and cracker crumbs in separate bowls.  Working quickly, roll an ice cream ball in flour to coat it completely, then dip in the egg-milk mixture, then roll in the cracker crumbs, pressing the crumbs onto the ice cream balls.  Return the coated ice cream ball to the cold pan and repeat with the remaining balls.  Return the pan to the freezer immediately and chill until the ice cream is very hard, at least 4 hours or up to a day.  Refrigerate the egg/milk mixture and set the crumbs and flour aside.

Repeat the coating process, then return the coated ice cream balls to the freezer until you are ready to cook and serve them.  (The coated ice cream balls will keep sealed in an airtight container in the freezer for up to a month.)

Prepare the caramel sauce.

Pour enough oil into a 2-quart pan or wok to fill 3 to 4 inches (there should be enough oil to completely submerge the ice cream balls).  Bring oil to 350 degrees over medium-high heat.  Deep-fry the ice cream balls, two at a time, until golden brown, 45 seconds to 1 minute.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Spoon warm caramel sauce over the ice cream balls and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Make sure the to always keep the Ice Cream very cold.  It must go directly from the freezer to the fryer or you will have a horrible mess.  Otherwise, this is a very fun dessert.  The contrast of the ice cream and the crispy coating with the hot and cold temperatures is delightful.

  1 1/2      teaspoons  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  sesame oil
                        == FOR THE FRIED RICE ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  3               cups  cold cooked long-grain rice -- grains separated
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  4                     dried black mushrooms
  5                     asparagus stalks -- cut diagonally
                        into 1" pieces
  1                     roma tomato -- diced

In separate small bowls, toss the scallops and shrimp with 1 teaspoon cornstarch each.

For the Chicken Marinade:  In a separate small bowl, stir the garlic, cornstarch, wine, soy sauce and ginger; add the chicken and toss gently to coat.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

For the Sauce:  Stir the stock, cornstarch, oyster-flavored sauce, soy sauce, sugar and sesame oil together in a medium bowl.

For the Fried Rice:  Heat a wok over medium-high heat until hot.  Add 2 teaspoons of the oil.  Pour the eggs into the wok and cook, stirring, until the eggs are slightly firm, about 30 seconds.  Add the rice, salt, sugar, and pepper, stirring constantly until heated through.  Transfer to a serving platter and cover with foil, shiny-side down, to keep warm.

For the Dish:  Pour enough warm water over the mushrooms in a bowl to cover them completely.  Let stand until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain thoroughly.  Remove and discard the stems and cut the caps in quarters.

Return the wok to high heat, add 1 tablespoon oil, and swirl to coat the pan.  Add the chicken and stir-fry until the chicken is no longer pink, about 3 minutes.  Add the shrimp and scallops; stir-fry until the shrimp turn pink, about 1 minute.  Add the asparagus, mushrooms and tomatoes and stir-fry until the asparagus is tender-crisp, 1 to 2 minutes.

Pour the sauce mixture into the wok and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and is lightly thickened.  Scoop the contents of the wok over the fried rice and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     dried black mushrooms
  2             ounces  squid -- cleaned
  8             ounces  fresh winter melon in 1/2" cubes
  4             ounces  Geoduck clam meat
                        = (or giant clam or Manilla clam meat)
  3               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
     1/3           cup  diced carrot
     1/4           cup  quartered button mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  frozen peas -- thawed
  1         tablespoon  small diced smoked ham
  1         tablespoon  Chinese rice wine

     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Soak the mushrooms in enough warm water to cover until softened.  Drain, discard the stems and quarter the caps.

Separate the squid tentacles from the bodies.  Leave the tentacles whole.  Cut the bodies open along one side so they lie flat on the cutting board and lightly score the inner side in a small crisscross pattern.  Cut the scored bodies into 1 1/2- by 2-inch pieces.

Bring a 2-quart saucepot of water to boil.  Add the winter melon; cook until tender crisp, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon.  Blanch the clams and squid in the same water until the meat is opaque, about 30 seconds.

In a 3-quart saucepot combine the stock, carrots, both mushrooms, peas, ham, wine, salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to medium and simmer until the carrots are tender, about 4 minutes.  Add the winter melon and seafood; cover and simmer until the seafood is cooked through, about 2 minutes.  Ladle into the soup bowls.

  1                     cilantro sprig -- (optional)

Stir the stock, rice wine, oyster-flavored sauce and sugar together in a medium bowl until the sugar is dissolved.

For the Dish:  Scrub the clams shells under cold water.  Discard any clams with open shells that donít close when tapped.

Pour 1 pint of water into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add the clams, cover and cook until their shells open, 2 to 3 minutes.  Scoop the clams into a bowl with a slotted spoon, discarding any clams that do not open.  Set the clams aside and discard the broth.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the ginger, garlic, chili and preserved vegetables.  Stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Pour in the broth and bring to a boil.  Adjust the heat so the broth is simmering, add the bean thread noodles and cover the wok.  Simmer, stirring occasionally to separate the noodles, until the noodles are soft, 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir the clams into the broth and continue stirring until the clams are heated through.

Scoop the broth, noodles and clams into a large serving bowl.  Scatter the green onions and red bell pepper over the noodles, top with the cilantro sprig and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  cold cooked long-grain rice -- grains separated
                        with fingers
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4                     egg yolks -- lightly beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4         pound  uncooked medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and cut into 1/2" pieces
     1/4         pound  cooked crabmeat -- flaked
  2                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" lengths, and shredded
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS ===
                        Cooked crabmeat from 2 leg segments

                        and cut into bite-sized pieces
  2          teaspoons  flying fish roe caviar (tapico)

Heat a wok over medium heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Reduce the heat to low, add the rice and egg yolks.  Cook, stirring continuously, until each grain of rice is coated with the yolks and golden in color, about 2 minutes.

Increase the heat to high, make a well in the center of the rice to expose the bottom of the wok and add 1 tablespoon of the oil.  Drop the garlic and shrimp into the well, stirring constantly until the shrimp turn pink, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.

Mix the shrimp and rice together.  Add the flaked crab meat, 1 of the green onions, water, salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring, until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.  Scoop the rice onto a serving platter, garnish with the remaining green onion and the crab leg meat, lobster and roe, if using.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 15    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  warm water -- (105 degrees)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  bread flour
  1                cup  warm milk -- (105 degrees), plus
  2        tablespoons  warm milk -- (105 degrees)
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (105 degrees)
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water
                        All-purpose flour -- for rolling dough
  2               cups  bun filling -- of your choice
  2                     eggs -- well beaten

Stir the 1/4 cup warm water (first amount), 1 tablespoon sugar (first amount) and yeast together in a large bowl until the sugar is dissolved.  Set aside until the mixture begins to bubble, about 10 minutes.

Stir the all-purpose flour and bread flour together in a medium bowl.  Stir the warm milk, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar, butter and yolk mixture into the yeast mixture until well blended.  Stir in the flour mixture, half at a time, and mix until you have a soft dough, 3 to 4 minutes.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm location.  Let the dough rise, until roughly doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Turn the dough onto a floured cutting board.  With a sharp knife, divide the dough into 15 roughly-equal pieces.  Roll a piece of dough out on a floured surface to a 4-inch circle.  Place 1 1/2 tablespoons of desired filling into the center of the dough circle.  Gather the edges of the dough over the filling, and twist them together to seal.  Place the bun, seam-side down, on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

Brush all exposed surfaces of the buns with the beaten eggs.  Bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 15 buns.

              Golden Glutinous Rice Dumpling - {Hom Sui Gok}

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dim Sum

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  glutinous rice flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1                cup  water
  3        tablespoons  gin
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  2 1/2         ounces  ground pork
  1 1/2         ounces  raw medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and minced
     1/4           cup  chopped green onion
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  6                     dried black mushrooms
                        === PREPARATION ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

In a large mixing bowl, combine the glutinous rice flour, sugar and baking powder; make a well in the center.  Pour the water and gin into well, stirring with chopsticks or a fork until the dough forms a ball.  Place dough onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Cut the dough in half and roll each half into a 10-inch cylinder.  Cut each cylinder into ten 1-inch pieces.  Roll each portion into a ball and cover with a damp towel.

For the Filling:  Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain and squeeze to remove excess water.  Discard the stems and mince the caps.

In a medium bowl, combine the mushrooms, pork, shrimp, green onion, sesame oil, soy sauce, oyster-flavored sauce, wine, sugar, salt and white pepper.  Mix well.

For the Dumpling Preparation:  With your finger tips flatten one portion of the dough into a 2-inch circle.  Place a heaping teaspoon of the filling onto the circle and gather the edges together and pinch to seal.  Roll into an oval shape.  Continue until all the dumplings are prepared.

Pour 2 inches of oil into a 2-quart sauce pan.  Heat to 350 degrees.  Carefully slide the dumplings, a few at a time, into the oil.  Once they float to the top, use a Chinese wire strainer or slotted metal spoon to keep them submerged in the oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Remove with the strainer or slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining dumplings.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 5 servings.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the glutinous rice flour, sugar and baking powder; make a well in the center.  Pour the water and gin into well, stirring with chopsticks or a fork until the dough forms a ball.  Place dough onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Cut the dough in half and roll each half into a 10-inch cylinder.  Cut each cylinder into ten 1-inch pieces.  Roll each portion into a ball and cover with a damp towel.

<DirT>
For the Filling:  Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain and squeeze to remove excess water.  Discard the stems and mince the caps.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium bowl, combine the mushrooms, pork, shrimp, green onion, sesame oil, soy sauce, oyster-flavored sauce, wine, sugar, salt and white pepper.  Mix well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Dumpling Preparation:  With your finger tips flatten one portion of the dough into a 2-inch circle.  Place a heaping teaspoon of the filling onto the circle and gather the edges together and pinch to seal.  Roll into an oval shape.  Continue until all the dumplings are prepared.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour 2 inches of oil into a 2-quart sauce pan.  Heat to 350 degrees.  Carefully slide the dumplings, a few at a time, into the oil.  Once they float to the top, use a Chinese wire strainer or slotted metal spoon to keep them submerged in the oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Remove with the strainer or slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining dumplings.  Serve hot.

     1/2         pound  firm white fish fillets -- thinly sliced
                        = (such as snapper, sea bass or halibut)
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR THE CHOWDER ===
  4                     dried black mushrooms
  4               cups  chicken or fish stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
     1/3           cup  Chinese black vinegar
                        = (or balsamic vinegar)
  3             slices  peeled ginger - (quarter size) -- cut thin strips
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2       package  silken tofu - (14-oz pkg) -- drained, and
                        cut into thin strips
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  3        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro

Stir the cornstarch and salt together in a small bowl.  Toss the sliced fish fillets gently in the marinade until coated.  Set aside for 10 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm white fish fillets -- finely chopped
  1                     in a food processor
     1/4           cup  frozen green peas -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped carrots
  2          teaspoons  minced cilantro
  3        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  oyster-flavoured sauce
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                     egg white
     3/4           cup  Japanese breadcrumbs (panko)
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sesame seeds

     1/2      teaspoon  Chinese dry mustard

Cook, turning once, until golden brown, about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side.  Remove fish patties with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with remaining patties.  Serve cakes warm with the dipping sauce on the side.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  uncooked shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and finely chopped
  1                     egg white
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped cilantro
     1/2      teaspoon  toasted sesame seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  rice vinegar
     1/3           cup  water
     1/4           cup  ketchup
  1           teaspoon  grated ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
                        === FOR THE WONTONS ===
  20                    wonton wrappers
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  6                     bay scallops
  6             slices  Classic Char Siu
     1/4           cup  cleaned squid in 1/2" rounds
     1/4           cup  diced onion
     1/4           cup  diced red bell pepper
     1/4           cup  diced green bell pepper
     1/4           cup  diced fresh pineapple
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

Stir the shrimp, egg white, cilantro, sesame seeds, salt and pepper together in a bowl until well blended.

For the Sauce:  Stir the sugar, vinegar, water, ketchup, ginger and pepper sauce together in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Cook, stirring until the sugar dissolves.  Add the dissolved cornstarch and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Remove the pan from heat and cover to keep warm.

For the Wontons:  Place a heaping teaspoonful of the filling in the center of a wonton wrapper.  (Keep the remaining wonton wrappers covered with a damp kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out.)  Brush the edges of the wrapper with a fingertip dipped in water, then fold the wrapper in half to form a triangle.  Pinch the edges firmly to seal.  Pull the opposite corners of the base of the triangle together, moisten one of the corners with water, and press them together to seal.  Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling, covering the formed wontons with a damp kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the scallops, char siu, squid and onion and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add the bell peppers, pineapple and sauce.  Bring to a boil, adjust the heat so the sauce is simmering and simmer for 1 minute.  Turn off the heat and cover the wok to keep the sauce warm until the wontons are cooked.

Pour enough vegetable oil into a 2-quart saucepan to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Slip a few of the wontons into the oil and fry, a few at a time, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 3 to 3 1/2 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining wontons.

To serve, place wontons in a wide serving bowl.  Spoon the hot sauce over the wontons or serve on the side.

Stir the shrimp, egg white, cilantro, sesame seeds, salt and pepper together in a bowl until well blended.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Sauce:  Stir the sugar, vinegar, water, ketchup, ginger and pepper sauce together in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Cook, stirring until the sugar dissolves.  Add the dissolved cornstarch and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens.  Remove the pan from heat and cover to keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Wontons:  Place a heaping teaspoonful of the filling in the center of a wonton wrapper.  (Keep the remaining wonton wrappers covered with a damp kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out.)  Brush the edges of the wrapper with a fingertip dipped in water, then fold the wrapper in half to form a triangle.  Pinch the edges firmly to seal.  Pull the opposite corners of the base of the triangle together, moisten one of the corners with water, and press them together to seal.  Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling, covering the formed wontons with a damp kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the scallops, char siu, squid and onion and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add the bell peppers, pineapple and sauce.  Bring to a boil, adjust the heat so the sauce is simmering and simmer for 1 minute.  Turn off the heat and cover the wok to keep the sauce warm until the wontons are cooked.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour enough vegetable oil into a 2-quart saucepan to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Slip a few of the wontons into the oil and fry, a few at a time, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 3 to 3 1/2 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining wontons.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, place wontons in a wide serving bowl.  Spoon the hot sauce over the wontons or serve on the side.

                Hakka Shrimp-Stuffed Peppers And Eggplant

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  dried shrimp
     1/2         pound  firm white fish fillet -- diced
                        = (such as snapper or cod)
  1                     egg white
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  chopped cilantro
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  1                     Asian eggplant
  1                     red bell pepper
  2                     Anaheim chilies
                        Cornstarch -- for dusting
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/3           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  salted black beans -- rinsed, drained,
                        and chopped
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed dried red chili
     1/4           cup  fish or chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water

Pour enough warm water over the dried shrimp in a small bowl to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain and squeeze out the excess water with your hands.

Prepare the stuffing:  Combine the soaked dried shrimp, fish fillets, egg white, cornstarch, cilantro, sugar and salt in the work bowl of a food processor.  Process to a smooth paste.

For the Dish:  Trim and discard the eggplant stem.  Cut the eggplant on the bias into 1-inch pieces.  Butterfly each piece by cutting horizontally almost all the way through the slice, starting at one of the long sides.  Quarter red bell pepper, remove the seeds, and trim the curved ends so the pieces lay flat.  Cut the chili in half lengthwise and discard the stem, seeds and white fleshy ribs from the inside of the pepper.

Dust the vegetables lightly with cornstarch to coat them lightly.  Spread the fish stuffing in an even layer over the inside of the pepper and chili pieces.  Fill the butterflied eggplant slices with the remaining mousse, dividing it evenly.  Dust the vegetables with additional cornstarch to coat them lightly.

Heat a 9- to 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and swirl to coat the bottom.  Fry the peppers, mousse-side down, and the eggplant flesh-side down (turning once) until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the water, cover the skillet and cook until the stuffing is cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Transfer the vegetables to a warm serving platter.

Pour off the water from the skillet and dry throughly.  Pour in the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and heat over medium heat until hot.  Add the black beans, garlic and chilies and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add the stock, soy sauce and sugar and bring to a boil.  Add the dissolved cornstarch and cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens slightly.  Spoon the sauce over the peppers and eggplant and serve hot.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  2        tablespoons  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  chili garlic sauce
                        === FOR THE STUFFING ===
  2             ounces  ground pork
  2             ounces  uncooked medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and minced
  2        tablespoons  minced water chestnuts
  1                     egg white
  1           teaspoon  minced cilantro
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2                     dried black mushrooms
  1            package  firm tofu - (14 oz) -- drained
                        Cornstarch -- for dusting
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced bamboo shoots
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced carrot

Stir the stock, oyster-flavored sauce and chili garlic sauce together in a small bowl until well blended.

For the Stuffing:  Stir the ground pork, shrimp, water chestnuts, egg white, cilantro, sesame oil, salt and pepper together in a medium bowl until well blended.

For the Dish:  Pour enough warm water over the mushrooms in a small bowl to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain.  Discard the stems and cut the caps into thin strips.

Cut the tofu in half horizontally to make 2 pieces, each about 3/4-inch thick.  Cut each piece into quarters to make a total of 8 pieces.  Using a spoon, hollow out the center of each tofu rectangle to make a little box.  Pat the tofu 'boxes' dry and dust them with cornstarch to coat them lightly.  Fill each with about 1 tablespoon of the stuffing, mounding it slightly.  Dust each piece of stuffed tofu with additional cornstarch to coat them lightly.

Pour enough oil into a 2-quart pan to fill 3 inches.  Heat oil over medium-high heat to 350 degrees.  Deep-fry the stuffed tofu, a few pieces at a time, until the tofu is golden brown and the filling is cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Reserve the oil.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the reserved oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, green onion and carrot.  Stir-fry until the carrot is tender-crisp, about 2 minutes.  Add the sauce and bring to a simmer.  Slip the fried tofu into the sauce and stir gently to coat.  Transfer the tofu onto a serving platter, stuffing-side up, serve hot.

Bake the fish until cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes.

While the fish is baking, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the sauce ingredients and reserved marinade.  Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.  Remove the pan from the heat and cover to keep warm.

Transfer the fish and green onions to a serving platter, spoon the hot sauce over the fish and serve immediately.

                          Home-Style Roast Duck

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  duckling - (abt 4 lbs) -- cleaned
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  Hoisin sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  toasted Sichuan peppercorns
     1/2      teaspoon  ground Chinese five-spice powder
  3                     star anise pods
  2             slices  peeled ginger
  2                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" lengths
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- crushed
                        === FOR THE GLAZE ===
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/4           cup  distilled white vinegar
     1/4           cup  honey
                        = (or maltose syrup)
     1/8      teaspoon  red food colouring -- (optional)

Marinate the duck:  Rinse the duck inside and out under cold water.  Pat all surfaces dry.  Clip off the wing tips with kitchen shears.  If the head and neck are not attached to the duck, pull the neck skin over the neck opening and, with a metal skewer, secure the skin over the opening.

Stir the sugar, hoisin sauce, salt, Sichuan peppercorns, five-spice powder, star anise, ginger, green onions and garlic together in a small bowl until well blended.

Pour the marinade into the cavity of the duck.  Overlap the flaps of the skin on either side of the cavity and sew them shut with a trussing needle and thread.  The opening will have to be sewn securely shut to keep the liquid marinade from leaking out as the duck hangs.

For the Glaze:  Stir the water, distilled vinegar, honey and food color, if using, together in a small bowl until blended.

For the Dish:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Tie a string securely around the duck's neck or under its wings to serve as a hanger.  Leave about a foot of the string attached and clip the excess string.

Bring an 8- to 12-quart stock pot of water to a boil.  Hold the duck by the string and slowly lower it into the boiling water until it is completely submerged.  Let steep for 2 minutes then lift the duck from the water, letting the excess water drip back into the pot.  Hold the duck over a large bowl and carefully pour the glaze over the duck, taking care to coat the entire surface of the duck with glaze.  Repeat the glazing process 2 to 3 times to ensure the duck is evenly coated.

Hang the duck in a cool place until the skin is taut and dry, 4 hours to overnight.  You can reduce the time to 2 hours by using an electric fan.  Aim a fan, set on high, directly at the hanging duck.  Move the fan, or the duck, as necessary to dry all the sides evenly.

Place the duck, breast-side up, on a rack in a foil-lined roasting pan.  Remove the string.  Roast the duck until the skin is brown and crispy, 40 to 50 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before carving.  The duck can be served warm with a bowl of steamed rice or as an ingredient in numerous dishes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Deep-fry the chicken, a few pieces at a time, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Reserve the oil.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 1 tablespoon of the reserved oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the asparagus and zucchini and stir-fry until tender-crisp, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Pour in the sauce and bring to a boil.  Stir in the chicken and simmer until heated through, about 1 minute.  Stir in the peanuts until coated.  Scoop onto a warm serving platter and serve immediately.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 7     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dim Sum

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  wheat starch
  2        tablespoons  tapioca starch
  1                cup  boiling water
  1         tablespoon  lard or vegetable shortening
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
     1/2         pound  bay or sea scallops -- minced
     1/2           cup  minced cooked spinach
     1/4           cup  chopped water chestnuts
     1/4           cup  chopped Chinese or regular celery
  1                     egg white
  1         tablespoon  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon zest
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice -- plus
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  3                     garlic cloves
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  6             slices  ginger - (quarter size) -- cut thin strips

Sift the wheat starch and tapioca starch into a bowl.  Make a well in the center of the starches and pour the boiling water all at once into the well.  Stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball.  (The boiling water will cook the starches, which will result in a transparent wrapper.  It is important to not let the water cool before adding it to the starches.)

Make a dent in the dough, insert the lard or shortening into it and knead the dough until the lard is incorporated.  (Kneading by hand works best, even though the mixture is quite hot.)  Divide the dough ball in two.  Roll each half into a cylinder 1-inch in diameter.  Cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rest for 15 minutes.

Cut the dough cylinders into 3/4-inch lengths and roll each piece into a ball.  Cover with a damp towel until ready to use, up to 30 minutes.

For the Filling:  Stir the scallops, spinach, water chestnuts, celery, egg white, rice wine, soy sauce, cornstarch, ginger, lemon zest, salt and white pepper together in a medium bowl until well blended.  Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes.

For the Dipping Sauce:  Stir the soy sauce, rice vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, sugar and ginger together until the sugar is dissolved.  Set aside.

For the Dumplings:  Place one of the dough balls between two squares of plastic wrap.  Using a tortilla press, flatten the dough into a thin circle.  (If you donít have a tortilla press, roll the dough balls out using a rolling pin.  Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the filling into the center of the wrapper and bring the sides of the wrapper together around the filling; line up edges to form a half circle and pinch the edges to seal.  Place the dumplings, without touching each other, onto two heatproof dishes or glass pie plates.

Prepare a wok for steaming.  Steam the dumplings, one plateful at a time, over high heat until the dough is translucent, 12 to 15 minutes.  Serve with the dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 7 servings.

     1/2        medium  onion -- cut 1/2" dice
     1/2                red bell pepper -- cut 1/2" dice
  1              small  zucchini -- cut 1/2" dice
  2                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" lengths
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1           teaspoon  water
     1/2           cup  glazed walnuts

Stir the soy sauce and cornstarch together in a bowl.  Stir the chicken in the marinade and stir until evenly coated.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

For the Sauce:  Stir the stock, hoisin sauce, rice wine, sesame oil, salt and five spice powder together in a small bowl until blended.

For the Dish:  Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the chicken and stir-fry until it begins to brown, about 2 minutes.  Scoop the chicken out of the wok and set aside.

Add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of oil to the wok and swirl to coat the sides.  Add the celery, onion, bell pepper, zucchini and green onions; stir-fry until vegetables are tender-crisp, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.

Return the chicken to the wok and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Pour the sauce ingredients into the wok and bring to a boil.  Pour in the cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens, 30 seconds.  Add walnuts and stir to coat.  Scoop onto a serving platter and serve immediately.

                 Winged Chicken Feet In Black Bean Sauce

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Dim Sum
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  chicken wings -- wing tips removed
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  6                     thin slices ginger -- julienned
  2                     green onions -- cut into 2" lengths
  2                     star anise pods
  1                     red or green jalapeÒo pepper -- julienned
  1                     cilantro sprig
  2               cups  water
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Hoisin sauce
                        = (or chee hou sauce)
  1         tablespoon  light brown sugar - (packed)

In a large bowl, evenly coat chicken wings with the 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce; set aside for 15 minutes.

For the Dish:  Prepare a large saucepan for deep-frying.  Heat the oil to 350 degrees.  Using a slotted spoon, carefully slide chicken wings and feet into oil; cook, stirring until golden brown, about 2 to 4 minutes.  Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Reserve oil.

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved oil, swirling to coat sides.  Add the ginger, green onions, star anise, jalapeÒo and cilantro to wok; cook, stirring until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the chicken wings; stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add the water, soy sauce, wine, dark soy sauce, hoisin sauce and brown sugar, stir to coat wings.  Reduce heat to medium, cover and simmer until meat is no longer pink, about12 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon, place on a serving plate and cover with foil, shiny-side down, to keep warm.

Pour the sauce through a metal strainer into a 1-quart sauce pan.  Place sauce pan over medium-high heat, add black beans, and cook until liquid is reduced by half, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Pour in cornstarch solution; cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens slightly.  Spoon sauce over chicken wings and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

              Wok-Braised Duck Breast With Chili-Beer Sauce

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     duck breast halves - (4 to 6 oz ea)
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  2                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" lengths
  4             slices  peeled ginger - (quarter size) -- cut thin strips
  1         tablespoon  brown bean chili sauce
     1/2           cup  sliced button mushroom
     1/3           cup  red bell pepper in 2" lengths
                        === FOR THE COOKING SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  light or dark beer or ale
  2        tablespoons  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  1         tablespoon  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  2          teaspoons  Hoisin sauce
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground toasted Sichuan peppercorns

Score the skin of the duck breasts with diagonal cuts 1 inch apart.  The cuts should go almost all the way through the skin without reaching the meat.  Repeat in the opposite direction to create crosshatching marks.

Heat a wok over medium heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Place the breast halves, skin-side down, in the wok and cook until the skin is crispy and brown, about 4 minutes.  Turn the breast halves and cook until the meat is light brown, about 1 minute.  Remove from the wok and allow the duck to rest while continuing.  Turn off the heat and spoon off all but one 1 tablespoon of the drippings from the wok.

While the duck is cooling, prepare the Cooking Sauce:  Stir the beer, stock, rice wine, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, salt and Sichuan peppercorns together in a medium bowl until the salt is dissolved.

Cut the cooled duck breasts on the bias into 1/2-inch slices.

Heat the wok and drippings over high heat until hot.  Add the green onions, ginger and brown bean chili sauce.  Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the sliced duck, cooking sauce, mushrooms and bell pepper.  Bring to a boil.  Adjust the heat so the sauce is simmering.  Cover the wok and simmer until the duck is slightly pink in the center (medium), 5 to 7 minutes.  Scoop onto a warm serving platter and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Score the skin of the duck breasts with diagonal cuts 1 inch apart.  The cuts should go almost all the way through the skin without reaching the meat.  Repeat in the opposite direction to create crosshatching marks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a wok over medium heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides.  Place the breast halves, skin-side down, in the wok and cook until the skin is crispy and brown, about 4 minutes.  Turn the breast halves and cook until the meat is light brown, about 1 minute.  Remove from the wok and allow the duck to rest while continuing.  Turn off the heat and spoon off all but one 1 tablespoon of the drippings from the wok.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the duck is cooling, prepare the Cooking Sauce:  Stir the beer, stock, rice wine, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, salt and Sichuan peppercorns together in a medium bowl until the salt is dissolved.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut the cooled duck breasts on the bias into 1/2-inch slices.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the wok and drippings over high heat until hot.  Add the green onions, ginger and brown bean chili sauce.  Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the sliced duck, cooking sauce, mushrooms and bell pepper.  Bring to a boil.  Adjust the heat so the sauce is simmering.  Cover the wok and simmer until the duck is slightly pink in the center (medium), 5 to 7 minutes.  Scoop onto a warm serving platter and serve immediately.

              Wok-Braised Lobster Tails In Creamy Rum Sauce

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lobsters tails - (8 oz ea)
     1/4           cup  butter
  1                cup  finely-diced onion
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
  1                cup  fish or chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
     1/2           cup  evaporated milk
  2        tablespoons  oyster-flavoured sauce
  1           teaspoon  fish sauce
     1/3           cup  light rum
  2        tablespoons  whole cilantro leaves
     1/4           cup  whole basil leaves
                        Fresh cilantro sprig

Butterfly the lobster tails:  Clip off the fins along outer edges of the shell.  Bend the tail backwards -- against its natural curve -- cracking several joints in the shell.  (That will prevent the tails from curling during cooking.)  Place the tail, shell-side up, on a cutting board.  Using a large, sturdy knife and starting from the thick end of the tail, cut through the top shell and into the meat.  Donít cut all the way through to the bottom, thinner shell.  Open up the lobster shell to expose the meat.

Melt the butter in a wok over high heat until bubbling.  Quickly add the onion and pepper and cook, stirring, until the onion is soft but not browned, about 1 minute.  Pour the fish stock, evaporated milk, oyster-flavored sauce and fish sauce into the wok and bring to a boil.  Adjust the heat so the liquid is simmering and place the lobster tails, meat-side down, on top of the onion broth.  Cover and simmer until the lobster meat is opaque, 6 to 8 minutes.

Transfer the lobster to a plate and set aside.  Pour the rum into the wok and increase the heat to high.  Boil until the sauce is reduced by half, 30 seconds to 2 minutes, or until the sauce is as thick and rich as you like.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     live dungeness crab
                        = (or 4 live blue crabs)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
  1                cup  cornstarch
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  2           packages  dried bean thread noodles - (2 oz ea)
  4        tablespoons  butter
  8                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
     1/4           cup  Chinese rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce

Clean the crab and cut into pieces.  Sprinkle the crab pieces with the salt and pepper.  Toss the crab pieces with the cornstarch in a large bowl to coat them evenly.

Pour enough oil into a wok to fill 3 inches.  Heat to 350 degrees.  Slide the coated crab pieces into the hot oil.  Deep-fry until crab is cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes.  Scoop the crab from the oil with a wire skimmer or slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Pour enough warm water over the bean thread noodles in a large bowl to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 10 minutes.  Drain the noodles, lay them out lengthwise on a cutting board and cut them in half crosswise.  Drop the noodles into a pan of boiling water and cook until translucent, about 1 minute.  Drain, rinse under cold water, and drain again.  Place in a serving bowl.  Cover with foil, shiny-side down, to keep warm.

Carefully ladle all but 1 tablespoon of the frying oil out of the wok into a heatproof container.

Add the butter and 1 tablespoon of the reserved oil to the wok.  Cook until the butter is frothy and begins to brown lightly.  Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Pour the chicken stock, rice wine, and fish sauce into the wok and bring to a boil, stirring.  Add the crab and toss to coat with sauce.  Continue cooking to allow the flavors to blend, 1 to 2 minutes.

Spoon the crab and pan juices over the bean thread noodles and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  ground pork
  2             ounces  uncooked shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and finely chopped
  1                     egg white
  1           teaspoon  minced cilantro
     1/2      teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  sesame oil
  1               dash  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  seasoned rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sweet chili sauce
  2        tablespoons  minced green onions
  2          teaspoons  hot chili oil
  2          teaspoons  minced cilantro
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced ginger
                        === FOR THE WONTONS ===
  16            square  wonton wrappers

Stir the ground pork, shrimp, egg white, cilantro, ginger, sugar, salt, sesame oil and pepper together in a medium bowl, stirring rapidly with a fork in one direction until the mixture is stiff and spongy.

For the Sauce:  Stir the soy sauce, rice vinegar, chili sauce, green onion, chili oil, cilantro, garlic and ginger together in a small bowl until blended.

For the Wontons:  Place 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center of each wonton wrapper.  (Keep the remaining wrappers covered with damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out.)  Brush the edges of the wrapper with a fingertip dipped in water, then fold the wrapper in half to form a triangle.  Pinch the edges firmly to seal.  Pull the opposite corners of the base of the triangle together, moisten one of the corners with water, and press the two base corners firmly together to seal.  Cover the folded wontons with a damp kitchen towel to prevent drying.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Slip the wontons into the water and bring the water back to a boil.  Stir occasionally, especially after the wontons are first added, to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pot.  Cook until the wontons rise to the top of the water, about 5 minutes.

Scoop the wontons into a colander with a wire skimmer or slotted spoon and drain.  Toss the wontons and sauce together gently in a serving bowl until the wontons are lightly coated.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     dried black mushrooms
  8                     paper-thin slices peeled daikon -- each trimmed
                        to a 4" by 2" rectangle
  8               ears  baby corn
  8             medium  asparagus spears -- bottoms trimmed
                        to leave 4" of tip
  8                     four-inch thin carrots sticks
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
                        === FOR THE VEGETABLE SPRING ROLLS ===
  6                     dried black mushrooms
  4                     dried wood ear mushrooms
  1              piece  dried snow fungus
     1/2           cup  chopped button mushroom
  3        tablespoons  oyster-flavoured sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  8                     spring roll wrappers
  1         tablespoon  flour -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
                        Sweet chili sauce -- for dipping

Prepare the diakon roll ingredients:  Pour enough warm water over the mushrooms in a medium bowl to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Discard the stems and lightly squeeze the caps to remove excess liquid.  Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil.  Add winter melon slices and cook until pliable, 20 to 30 seconds.  Drain.

Make the vegetable rolls:  Place a rectangle of the diakon melon on the work surface with one of the short ends closest to you.  Lay one of each vegetable: mushroom, baby corn, asparagus and carrot, across the width of the strip.  Gently roll the vegetables up in the diakon melon.  (The ends of the vegetables will be sticking out of the sides of the rolls.  Place each roll in a heatproof dish as you form it.

Prepare a wok for steaming.  Set the dish of diakon melon rolls in the steamer basket and steam over high heat until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.  Turn off the heat and keep the vegetable rolls warm in the steamer while preparing the sauce and frying the spring rolls.

For the Sauce:  Stir the stock, salt, pepper and dissolved cornstarch together in a small saucepan over medium heat until the sauce boils and thickens, 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Pour sauce over steamed diakon rolls.

For the Vegetable Spring Rolls:  Pour enough warm water over the black mushrooms, wood ears, and white fungus in a medium bowl to cover them completely.  Soak until softened, about 20 minutes.  Drain.  Discard the mushroom stems and chop the caps coarsely.  Chop the wood ears finely.  Slice off the yellow stem from the snow and chop the fungus coarsely.  Stir the black mushrooms, wood ears, snow fungus together with the button mushrooms, oyster-flavored sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper until well blended.

Place a wrapper, shiny-side down and with one of the corners pointing toward you, on the work surface.  Spoon 1/3 cup of the filling across the lower third of the wrapper.  Fold the corner closest to you over filling, then fold the right and left corners over that.  Roll firmly, just enough to completely enclose the filling.  Brush the exposed sides and top of the wrapper with some of the flour paste.  Continue rolling into a compact roll, pressing lightly to seal.  Cover the filled spring rolls with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out.

Pour enough vegetable oil into a wok or 2-quart saucepan to fill 3 inches.  Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Deep-fry spring rolls in 2 batches until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes, turning occasionally.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Place spring rolls on platter opposite the diakon melon rolls and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Martin Yan

Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     boneless skin-on duck breast halves
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2          teaspoons  water
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  1                cup  zesty lemon sauce
     1/4           cup  pineapple chunks
  2        tablespoons  chicken stock
                        = (or canned chicken broth)
  1         tablespoon  crystallized ginger -- cut thin strips

Lay the duck breast halves, skin-side down, on a work surface and trim any fat that extends beyond the breast meat.  Turn breast halves over and, with the tip of a knife, lightly score the skin in a crosshatch pattern to keep the skin from shrinking.  Sprinkle both sides of the duck breasts with salt and pepper.  Dust with cornstarch to coat lightly, tapping off any excess.

Prepare the Sauce:  Stir the lemon sauce, pineapple chunks, stock and ginger together in a bowl.

Heat a wide skillet over medium-high heat until hot.  Add the oil, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan.  Add the duck breasts, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is crisp and brown, 4 to 5 minutes.  Flip the breasts and cook until the meat is cooked to medium-rare, 5 to 6 minutes.

Transfer the duck to a plate.  Spoon off all but 1 tablespoon of the drippings from the pan.  Return the pan to medium-high heat, pour in the sauce and bring to a boil.  For a thicker sauce, stir in the dissolved cornstarch and cook until the sauce boils and thickens, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat.

To serve, slice each duck breast on the bias into 5 slices.  Fan the slices out on a plate and spoon the sauce over them.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
