  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  Jack cheese
  2             pounds  Cheddar
  3                     red peppers
  2             pounds  mushrooms
  2                     red onions
  1              bunch  basil
     1/2         bunch  parsley
  6             ounces  butter
  20                    eggs
  4               cups  milk
  2             pounds  ham

In processor slice peppers; remove.  Slice onions; remove.  Slice mushrooms; remove.  In processor chop basil and parsley until fine; remove.  In processor, grate Jack with cheddar cheese; remove.  Julienne ham by hand.

In medium pan, melt butter.  Add onion; cook 5 minutes.  Add peppers and heat with onions.  Add mushrooms and cook 10 minutes.  Drain well.

Prepare a 6- by 13- by 2-inch pan with cooking spray.  Spread 1/2 of cheese into pan; spread peppers, onions and mushrooms over cheese.  Spread parsley and basil over vegetable mixture.  Spread ham over parsley and basil.  Spread remaining cheese over ham.

In processor, place eggs and milk.  Blend well.  Pour over mixture.  Set on cookie sheet and bake 1 to 1 1/2 hours at 300 degrees.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  My grandmother would make this recipe in Holland in the cold winter days.  It is delicious.  The downside is this recipe is for about 12 people, so we would eat the same dish for three days.  (Of course grandmother would not have used a food processor, like us modern cooks).

                             BBQ Turkey Bacon

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Poultry
                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Good turkey bacon
  2        tablespoons  BBQ sauce
  1         tablespoon  Worcester sauce
  1                cup  egg beaters
                        Regular oatmeal -- dry, uncooked

In a dish that is not too flat, pour the egg beaters, add BBQ sauce and Worcester sauce.  Stir well until it all mixes together.  Then add about 1/2 cup oatmeal and stir well again.

In the meantime, the bacon should be at room temperature.  Take one slice of the bacon and drag it through the mixture of egg beater, etc., first one side, then the other, so that the sauce with the oatmeal adheres to the bacon.

Place as many slices of bacon on your pre-heated stove top grill as possible.  Fry until as crisp as you want it.  We find that we must turn the bacon at three or four times.

Serve warm with your main dish.  Very heart healthy, tangy, it will please.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     celery stalk -- minced
  1             medium  onion -- minced
  12            ounces  flaked crabmeat -- shell removed

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  B & B Liqueur
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1         tablespoon  Old Bay seasoning
  8             medium  shallots -- peeled, left whole
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  B & B Liqueur
  2             ounces  veal demi-glace
  1                cup  cream

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4         pound  shallots -- thinly sliced
     1/4         pound  bacon -- coarsely chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed, and
                        squeezed dry
  6        tablespoons  heavy cream
  1 1/3           cups  fresh bread crumbs -- divided
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper

In a large saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Add the sliced shallots and cook over moderate heat until light golden, 5 to 7 minutes.  Set aside.

Place bacon in food processor and pulse until finely chopped.  Transfer bacon to a large bowl.  Add chicken (in 2 batches) to the food processor and pulse until minced.  Add to the bowl with the bacon.  Next add thawed spinach, heavy cream, 1/3 cup bread crumbs, cooked shallots, 1 teaspoon black pepper, salt and cayenne.  Mix to thoroughly blend the ingredients.  Form 1/4 cup of mixture into little round cakes.  (May freeze at this point for future use.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  In a shallow bowl, mix 1 cup bread crumbs with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.  Coat the cakes with the bread crumbs.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over moderately-high heat.  Add 8 of the cakes and fry, turning once until browned, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to a baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining chicken cakes.  Bake the cakes for about 10 to 12 minutes until firm and done.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  These will remind you of crab cakes (no crab, of course); this recipe is well worth the effort.  Smaller cake would make a wonderful appetizer for a party and larger one for a luncheon entree. ...Peggy

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts -- (6 oz ea)
                        === BANTEN COCONUT SAUCE ===

  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1              ounce  ginger -- diced
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg powder
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  tumeric
  1              ounce  tamarind water -- (see below)
  1                cup  coconut milk
                        Some chili paste
                        Juice from half a lime
                        === TAMARIND WATER ===
  1              ounce  tamarind pulp
  1                cup  water

Sauce:  Heat oil in pan.  Saute shallots and garlic for 2 minutes.  Add in the ginger and continue to saute for another 2 minutes.  Add the nutmeg powder and sugar and saute for another 2 minutes.  Add the tumeric.  Pour in the tamarind water (see below), chili paste, and coconut milk and bring to a boil.

Turn the heat down and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.  Season, remove from heat, and pour in a blender.  Process at high speed for a couple of minutes until the sauce becomes smooth.  Remove from the blender and keep warm.

Heat oil in a frying pan and fry the chicken breast on each side for approximately 5 minutes, then remove from the pan and keep warm in the oven.  Serve with rice and stir fry vegetables.

For the Tamarind Water:  Cut tamarind into small pieces and add to the water.  Place in a small pan and bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  Turn heat to low and let it simmer for 5 minutes.  All the tamarind should be disintegrated.  Strain through a sieve and squeeze the pulp to extract all the essence.  This can be kept in the refrigerator for a week.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                  Chicken Cashew Curry Luncheon Sandwich

Recipe By     :Submitted by Seal Beach Inn & Gardens, Seal Beach, CA
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
  1                cup  cashews -- (optional 1/2 cup
                        almond chunks and 1/2 cup cashews)
  1                cup  seedless grapes currants or
                        golden raisins
     3/4           cup  low-fat mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  curry powder to taste
  1 1/2      teaspoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  honey
  6                     croissants
                        Curly lettuce leaves

Broil, bake or saute three boneless, skinless chicken breasts (six breasts halves).  For especially juicy and tender chicken we slowly saute the breasts in a skillet over a very, very low flame for about 20 minutes or until the meat is cooked, white inside.

Shred cooked chicken into small bite-sized chunks.  Add one cup of cashews which have been partially broken in a plastic baggy.  Another option is to add half a cup of almonds chunks and half a cup of cashew chunks and whole mixed.  Add one cup of cleaned and washed seedless grapes; currants and or golden raisins can be added or substituted for the grapes although we find the grapes juiciness makes this sandwich.

To 3/4 cup of low-fat mayonnaise add one teaspoon (or more to taste) of curry powder, one 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon juice, one tablespoon of honey.  Blend all well and toss with above ingredients.  Serve on a fresh split croissant on a pretty curly lettuce leaf.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     split boneless chicken breasts - (to 6) -- cleaned, pounded,
                        and cut into 1" strips
                        Flour -- for dredging
  4                     eggs -- beaten
                        Olive oil -- as needed
     1/3           cup  sherry
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
  1         tablespoon  butter

Dip chicken into flour then into beaten eggs, place in shallow frypan that has hot olive oil in it.  Cook chicken on one side until the edges begin to brown, then turn over.

As the second side begins to show that the edges are cooked trough, squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon over the chicken, pour 1/3 cup of sherry over the chicken and add 1 tablespoon of butter.

When butter is melted, the French is done, serve with rice and enjoy.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  I took a gourmet cooking class locally just to find out how to make this dish.  It is fast and wonderful, very rich but very good.

Method can also be used with fresh haddock, lobster meat or imitation crab.  ...Diane Van Der Woude

Comments:  Chicken Pot Pie was a family favorite at my Mom's home.  When chicken pot pie was made at Mom's, plans were changed to make it to dinner when invited.  The last meal she made for us before her sudden death was a "spur of the moment" Monday evening dinner of what else, pot pie.  I have written the recipe as close as possible, the real recipe was "a little flour, dash of salt and add water till it holds together."  Side dishes were made up of a favorite vegetable or salads of those around the table.  ...Debbie Hershey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  chopped fresh fennel
     1/2           cup  diced onions
     1/4           cup  diced celery
     1/2           cup  sliced leeks
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/2           cup  diced red pepper
     1/2           cup  diced green pepper
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  Sambucca
  8               cups  chicken stock
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano
  2           teaspoon  dry basil - (2 tbspns if fresh)
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  ground fennel seed
  1                cup  diced cooked chicken
     1/2           cup  cooked rice
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  cold water

Saute fresh fennel, onion, celery, and leeks in two tablespoons olive oil for five minutes.  Add garlic, red pepper, green pepper, wine, and Sambucca.  Simmer for 2 minutes, then add chicken stock, oregano, basil, cayenne pepper, and ground fennel seed.

Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for ten minutes.  Stir in chicken, rice, and salt to taste.  Thicken slightly with cornstarch dissolved in water.  Check for seasonings, heat thoroughly, and serve.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This is a soup that just won't let you stop with one bowl.  A rich, clear broth with great chicken flavor, a hint of anise from the fennel, and rice for body.  It has become a favorite of the Inn's guests since it was created.  Serve it accompanied with a Zesty Mustard Salad and several loaves of a crusty French bread.  Fresh Brie, fruit, and the last of the bread should be a fine ending to the meal (except for the Chocoholics in the party).

                      Cider Vinegar Grilled Chicken

Recipe By     :Submitted by Inn on the Twenty, Jordan, Ontario
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     chicken breasts -- on the bone
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar

Preheat grill to medium-high heat.  Toss chicken breasts with vegetable oil, green onion, herbs, and black pepper and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours.  To grill, season chicken with salt and place breasts skin-side down on grill.  Cover and cook for 15 minutes.  Turn chicken and cook 10 to 15 minutes more (depending on the heat of your grill).

As chicken breasts start taking on color, about 2/3 through the cooking process, begin sprinkling them with vinegar.  Continue to do so periodically until all the vinegar has been used.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The flavor of a charcoal grill adds so much to this dish, but a gas grill will work just fine.  Adding the vinegar to the chicken while it's on the grill creates a fair bit of smoke, and the aroma will probably draw the attention of your neighbors.

Vinegar means "sour wine" and is very important in cooking, as it commonly used to balance the taste of a dish against salt or richness.  Cider vinegar goes very nicely with chicken, but you may very well use balsamic, white wine, red wine, basic white, or raspberry vinegar -- any of these will work.  Take advantage of the summer season and make your own flavored vinegars by steeping raspberry, basil, thyme, or mint in good-quality wine vinegar.

Preheat grill to medium-high heat.  Toss chicken breasts with vegetable oil, green onion, herbs, and black pepper and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours.  To grill, season chicken with salt and place breasts skin-side down on grill.  Cover and cook for 15 minutes.  Turn chicken and cook 10 to 15 minutes more (depending on the heat of your grill).
</DirT>
<DirT>
As chicken breasts start taking on color, about 2/3 through the cooking process, begin sprinkling them with vinegar.  Continue to do so periodically until all the vinegar has been used.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The flavor of a charcoal grill adds so much to this dish, but a gas grill will work just fine.  Adding the vinegar to the chicken while it&apos;s on the grill creates a fair bit of smoke, and the aroma will probably draw the attention of your neighbors.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Vinegar means &quot;sour wine&quot; and is very important in cooking, as it commonly used to balance the taste of a dish against salt or richness.  Cider vinegar goes very nicely with chicken, but you may very well use balsamic, white wine, red wine, basic white, or raspberry vinegar -- any of these will work.  Take advantage of the summer season and make your own flavored vinegars by steeping raspberry, basil, thyme, or mint in good-quality wine vinegar.

                          Duecker Egg Casserole

Recipe By     :Submitted by Noble Manor, Mineola, TX
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast                       Casseroles
                Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  hot sausage
  1                     yellow onion -- chopped
  1              large  bell pepper -- chopped
  3             medium  potatoes -- grated
  8                     eggs -- slightly beaten
  6             slices  white or wheat bread -- broken
  1                     large jar pimentos -- I usually drain the
                        juice off
  2               cups  milk
  1 1/2           cups  grated cheddar cheese (to 2 cups) -- I use a sharp
                        cheddar

Cook the first 4 ingredients together on the stove top.  Recommend cooking or browning the sausage first then add the three remaining ingredients.

While that is browning, mix the remaining ingredients well in a separate bowl (big bowl) and then add browned meat mixture.  Pour into greased 9- by 12-inch baking dish.  At this point you may refrigerate and bake the next morning.

Bake 25 to 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven, or until lightly browned.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  We garnish with Pace chunky mild salsa.  Recipe can be doubled.  This recipe serves better when cooked and given some time to set prior to serving.  After sitting, warm up in low heat oven.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     flour tortillas - (ea 12" dia)
  6             slices  firm white sandwich bread
  6                     eggs
  1                cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  Dijon-style mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Fresh ground pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh sage
  2        tablespoons  butter
  8             ounces  mushrooms -- sliced
  6             ounces  smoked ham -- cut julienne strips
  8             ounces  cheddar cheese -- grated

Spray a 3-quart oval baking dish with non-stick spray.  Cut 2 end pieces about 3 inches wide from tortillas and set aside.  Fit large pieces of tortillas into pan to cover bottom.  Remove crusts from bread and cut into cubes, setting aside.  Using a whisk, combine eggs with milk and seasonings.  Saute mushrooms in butter.

Layer bread cubes, ham, mushrooms, and cheese in the prepared pan.  Repeat layers, ending with cheese.  Pour egg mixture over each layer as it is completed.  Cut reserved tortilla into 3/4-inch strips, brush with a little of the egg mixture, and arrange strips in lattice pattern over top of strata.  Cover well with foil and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.

To bake, remove from refrigerator.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place strata on cookie sheet and wrap foil around the outside of the baking dish, making a raised edge to support sides of strata as it bakes.  Bake 60 to 90 minutes or until browned and solid.  Let sit 10 minutes before removing from the pan.

This recipe yields 6 servings.  May be doubled to serve 12.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  red potatoes -- sliced 1/4" thick
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              bunch  green onions -- diced
  4             medium  to large mushrooms - (to 5) -- chopped
  1              pound  Jimmy Dean hot sausage -- cooked, crumbled,
                        and drained
  8                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/4         pound  cheddar cheese -- grated

Slice potatoes, salt and pepper to taste (I always add little sugar to anything I salt.  It adds a wholeness to the flavor.) and cook in light oil.  Crumble sausage into skillet and cook, covered, on medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.  (This sausage is spicy rather than hot).  Dice onions and saute in butter as you chop mushrooms, then add to onions.

When sausage is done, drain WELL (very important to a clean taste of the dish).  Add onion/mushrooms to sausage and mix.  Beat eggs with water, salt and pepper to taste.

In prepared pan, layer potatoes, then sausage.  Add eggs; move around in the potato/onion/mushrooms to incorporate ingredients.  Top with cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees 20 to 25 minutes.  Done when toothpick comes out clean.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  2              large  eggs per person
                        Bacon -- as needed

Pre-cook the bacon partially, enough to cook away most of the fat, but leave the slices flexible.  (If you use the microwaveable kind, don't overcook them either.)  Line a standard muffin tin with the bacon (depending on your bacon, this may take 1 1/2 slices of bacon.

Drop abut 5 drops of bacon fat in the bottom of each cup to prevent sticking (or you can lightly spray them with shortening).  Put one egg in each cup and cook at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  (Check the eggs by inserting a knife between the yolk and white.  You can immediately tell if they're done.  Do not go by appearances -- it's deceiving.)

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  My grandmother used to make these for us on weekends and I have always loved them.

Categories    : Breakfast                       Casseroles
                Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  flour
  1                cup  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  marjoram
     1/4      teaspoon  basil
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped parsley -- or judicious
                        amounts of whatever fresh herbs are in
                        the garden
     1/4         pound  bacon or sausage -- sauteed, drained,
                        and crumbled
     1/3           cup  dried bread crumbs -- (optional),
                        buttered

Make a roux with butter and flour; add milk, herbs, and cheese.  Then in a casserole dish put a layer of eggs, bacon, parsley, and sauce.  Repeat.  Sprinkle bread crumbs on top.

Cook uncovered in 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  This dish benefits greatly from the homemade bacon and sausage we get from our local butcher, but we've also used vacuum-packed linguisa to good effect.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This is my grandmother's recipe from Rockford, Illinois.  Whenever somebody was getting married and you were going to have a fancy brunch for them, you made my Grandmother Gertrude's egg casserole.

Comments:  Julia Mae Mason Calvert, known to her grandchildren as "Granny Nanny", was born in Denton County in 1905.  She was the oldest of 9 girls and played the role of the family's "second" mother all her life.  She married her high school sweetheart, Howell W. Calvert, Sr., and had 5 children of their own.  They were married for over 60 years, and learning to stretch those dollars and make the most of all the meals became second nature to her.  Granny Nanny was always the person people called upon to take food when families were in need.  Mae, as her adult friends called her, would travel miles with her trunk loaded down to deliver food to people in time of tragedy, many times not knowing who they were, just that they were hurting and needed some help.

Granny Nanny always had food that she could "throw together" at the last minute to feed visitors, grandkids, and family.  Everyone always went home with a "care" package of homemade jellies, peanut butter, canned goods, etc.

She joined her many friends and some family in Heaven on March 2, 1994, and if God assigns duties to His Angels in Heaven, surely Granny Nanny would be assigned to the role of "A Number 1 Cook", keeping all the other Angels happy with all sorts of good eats.  Among them would definitely be mouth-watering treats such as Granny Nanny's Peanut Butter Pie and Chicken and Dumplings.

This recipe was scribbled in hand by her.  Almost too simple to work... but it does and they are fantastic!  Just follow the simple but time-proven steps.  ...Julia Pannell

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  fresh asparagus (thin stalks) -- cut into 3" pieces
  6              large  sour dough bread pieces -- (if you cut ends
                        off and cut in two, you end up with 12
                        helping-size squares)
  6             slices  ham -- cut to size of
                        the bread squares
  4                     eggs (or 1 cup egg substitute)
  1 1/2           cups  milk (may use skim)
     1/2           cup  grated sharp cheddar cheese (may be
                        low-fat)
  1                     green onion -- finely chopped
  1                     Spray butter or margarine
                        Garlic salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Sprinkle of nutmeg

Lightly brush/spray butter or margarine over 6 slices of bread as prepared above.  Place bread, buttered-side up, in a 9- by 13-inch buttered glass dish.  Sprinkle with half of the cheese.  Layer with ham and raw asparagus.  Cover with remaining 6 buttered bread squares.

In a bowl, lightly beat eggs and add milk, onion, garlic salt, and pepper.  Pour over bread.   Sprinkle nutmeg over the top.  Bake, covered, at 325 degrees for 25 minutes.  Uncover and bake 25 more minutes.

Sprinkle with remaining cheese and return to oven for 10 minutes (uncovered).   Let cool for 10 minutes.  Recipe may be doubled and made the night before; cover and refrigerate.

Goes great with blackberry baby muffins and fresh fruit.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  I substituted 6 ounces of Nova Lox (purchased at neighborhood grocery store in 3-ounce packages) for some Jewish guests that stayed here.  A couple of months later, I won entrance into a new Jewish cookbook called "Eat! Enjoy! The 101 Best Jewish Recipes in America," which is now on the shelves of major bookstores.

Comments:  I substituted 6 ounces of Nova Lox (purchased at neighborhood grocery store in 3-ounce packages) for some Jewish guests that stayed here.  A couple of months later, I won entrance into a new Jewish cookbook called &quot;Eat! Enjoy! The 101 Best Jewish Recipes in America,&quot; which is now on the shelves of major bookstores.

                            Kentucky Hot Brown

Recipe By     :Submitted by Beaumont Inn, Harrodsburg, KY
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry
                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  turkey breast -- roasted, sliced
  1              slice  white bread -- toasted
  2             slices  tomato
  2             slices  bacon -- cooked, drained
                        === SAUCE ===
  2             ounces  butter
  3             ounces  flour
     3/4           cup  cream
     1/4           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  Swiss cheese -- grated
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Sauce:  Heat butter and add flour.  Whisk and slowly cook for 5 minutes.  Whisk in cream and milk; heat.  Whisk in cheese until melted.  Season.  Simmer for 30 minutes.  Sauce should be very thick.

Quarter toast and place in oven-safe dish.  Top with turkey and tomatoes.  Cover well with sauce.  Bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.  Garnish with bacon.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Comments:  This is a regional favorite that originated at Louisville's Brown Hotel earlier in this century.  Many variations can be found, most commonly country ham is added and a cheddar sauce is substituted.  This is our version, which I feel is closer to the original recipe.  It is offered on our lunch menu.  ...Chef Nick Sundberg

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  oil
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onions
  1                cup  chopped green bell peppers
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  3              whole  bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  dry thyme
  2          teaspoons  Cajun seasoning containing salt -- (like Tony Cachere
                        or Zatoiains)
  1                cup  tomato paste
  3               cups  crushed whole tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1                can  Rotel tomatoes -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1                cup  chicken stock or water

                        cut in strips, and dredged in
  3        tablespoons  flour

In large pot, heat oil and saute onions, celery, pepper, and garlic until onions are clear.  Add rest of seasonings, stir until fragrant, and add chicken strips dredged in flour.  Stir to keep flour from sticking.

When chicken is browned, add tomatoes and paste, sugar, and Worcestershire. One-half cup of vermouth may be added -- correct seasonings and simmer 15 minutes.  Serve over fluffy white rice.

Comments:  Since Madame Julia's is named for a legendary free woman of color (and former slave) whose very freedom was a result of her cooking expertise, these recipes are representative of what she might have cooked for her master and his wealthy friends, either at their town house in New Orleans or plantation up river at Pointe Coupee Parish.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry
                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fresh turkey - (abt 16 lbs)
  1              pound  kosher salt - (abt 2 1/2 cups)
  1              small  yellow onion -- chopped
  1                     carrot -- chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped
  4                     fresh thyme sprigs
  4                     fresh flat-leaf parsley sprigs
  16       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        Double-thick piece cheesecloth -- 24" square

Remove the giblets and neck, if included, and reserve for making gravy, if desired.  Rinse the turkey inside and out with cold water.  In a large pot or 5-gallon bucket, combine the salt and 1 gallon of cold water and stir to mix.  Carefully set the turkey in the water and add more cold water to cover by 2 to 3 inches.  Refrigerate or place the container in a very cool place (32 to 40 degrees) for 8 to 12 hours.

Remove the turkey from the brine, rinse well and pat dry with paper towels.  Let the turkey come to room temperature, at least 1 hour but no more than 1 1/2 hours.

Position a rack in the bottom of an oven and preheat to 450 degrees.

In a large bowl, combine the onion, carrot, celery, thyme, parsley and half of the butter, and toss to mix.  Pack the body and neck cavities loosely with the vegetables.  With kitchen twine, truss the legs together loosely and secure the neck flap to the back with a couple of trussing pins or sturdy toothpicks.  Rub the turkey with half of the remaining butter and set the bird on its side on a rack in a large roasting pan.

Roast for 15 minutes, then turn the turkey on its other side and roast for 15 minutes more.  Reduce the heat to 325 degrees.  Soak the cheesecloth in the remaining butter, turn the turkey breast-side up and place the cheesecloth over the breast.  Add about 1/2 cup water to the pan.

Continue roasting, basting with the pan juices every 15 to 20 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the breast registers 165 degrees, and inserted into the thigh, away from the bone, registers 180 degrees.  If the breast begins to cook too quickly, tent loosely with aluminum foil.  Total roasting time should be about 3 hours.  Let the turkey rest 20 to 30 minutes before carving.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  In the kitchen at Wheatleigh, turkeys are soaked in salt-water brine before the chefs slowly roast the birds for the hotel's Thanksgiving dinner.  The roast turkey is served with a creamy giblet gravy and a savory pear, chestnut and sage dressing.

Remove the giblets and neck, if included, and reserve for making gravy, if desired.  Rinse the turkey inside and out with cold water.  In a large pot or 5-gallon bucket, combine the salt and 1 gallon of cold water and stir to mix.  Carefully set the turkey in the water and add more cold water to cover by 2 to 3 inches.  Refrigerate or place the container in a very cool place (32 to 40 degrees) for 8 to 12 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the turkey from the brine, rinse well and pat dry with paper towels.  Let the turkey come to room temperature, at least 1 hour but no more than 1 1/2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Position a rack in the bottom of an oven and preheat to 450 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, combine the onion, carrot, celery, thyme, parsley and half of the butter, and toss to mix.  Pack the body and neck cavities loosely with the vegetables.  With kitchen twine, truss the legs together loosely and secure the neck flap to the back with a couple of trussing pins or sturdy toothpicks.  Rub the turkey with half of the remaining butter and set the bird on its side on a rack in a large roasting pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast for 15 minutes, then turn the turkey on its other side and roast for 15 minutes more.  Reduce the heat to 325 degrees.  Soak the cheesecloth in the remaining butter, turn the turkey breast-side up and place the cheesecloth over the breast.  Add about 1/2 cup water to the pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Continue roasting, basting with the pan juices every 15 to 20 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the breast registers 165 degrees, and inserted into the thigh, away from the bone, registers 180 degrees.  If the breast begins to cook too quickly, tent loosely with aluminum foil.  Total roasting time should be about 3 hours.  Let the turkey rest 20 to 30 minutes before carving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 12 servings.
