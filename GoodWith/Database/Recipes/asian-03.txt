                       Asparagus Cooked Like Ferns

Recipe By     :Katherine Heyhoe
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh asparagus
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  toasted pine nuts -- coarsely chopped

Snap off the woody ends of the asparagus.  Cut the stalks on the diagonal into 1 1/2-inch lengths. 

Heat the sesame oil in a medium skillet or wok.  Add the asparagus and stir-fry over high heat for 1 minute.  Add the soy sauce and broth, then cover and simmer on low until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. 

Place the asparagus on a platter.  Reduce the sauce, then pour on top and cover with a sprinkling of toasted pine nuts. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  "No Fern Picking."  "Fern Picking Allowed (With Permit)."  In springtime, in the mountains where we live, these signs are put up by the forest rangers along the main road, known as the Rim of the World Highway.  Apparently, the Lake Arrowhead area of the San Bernardino Mountains is one of the few places where a particular variety of bracken ferns flourishes annually.  While this may not be important to you, it is of extreme significance to the Korean population of Southern California, for they consider these ferns to be a great culinary delicacy. 

Only the top part with the most tender leaves is used.  These ferns are often described as tasting a bit like asparagus, itself a delicacy in Western cultures, though not as rare.  They do indeed have that same asparagus-artichoke type of flavor, but much more tender and subtle.  The forest rangers' office charges $20 for a fern-picking permit and provide bags for harvesting.  There is a 50-pound limit per permit.  This may sound like a lot, but like spinach, these ferns collapse considerably when heated.  It takes many pounds of ferns to make a meal, and that's why you never see just one Korean picking ferns. 

Since it is unlikely you will find the much-loved ferns in your area, I have adapted a traditional fern-cooking recipe for asparagus.  Simple as it seems, you'll be surprised at the depth of flavor in this dish.  You see, the sesame oil, when heated, produces a sweet flavor.  Frying, then steaming, the asparagus in the sesame oil further brings out the natural sweetness and musty taste of the vegetable, and these flavors are finally reinforced by the sweet, mild taste of toasted pine nuts.  I am very fond of this recipe, and use it frequently as a side dish or appetizer.  I am sure you will enjoy it, even without using ferns.

               Baby Chicken And Ginseng Soup - {Samgyetang}

Recipe By     :Copeland Marks, "The Korean Kitchen"
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Korean
                Poultry                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  glutinous rice -- well rinsed
  2             pieces  fresh ginger - (each 2" long)
  1                     scallion -- sliced thin
  6                     jujubes (Korean dates)
  2                     garlic clove -- halved lengthwise
  1              small  chicken or cornish game hen -- (abt 1 lb)
  2               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  sesame seeds -- toasted
  1           teaspoon  Korean sesame oil
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Mix the rice, ginseng root, scallion, 3 of the jujubes and 1 garlic clove together and stuff the chicken.  Sew up the opening. 

Put the chicken in the "tukbaege" or in a heavy pot with a cover that is just a bit larger than the chicken.  Add the 2 cups water, the other 3 jujubes, the other garlic clove, the sesame seeds and sesame oil and the pepper.  Bring to a boil, cover the pot and reduce heat to low.  Simmer over low heat for 1 hour. 

The soup will develop a thick, cloudy consistency and the chicken will soften enough to melt away from the bones.  Serve hot in the "tukbaege" if you have one, or transfer the chicken and broth to a large serving bowl. 

This recipe serves 2 with a variety of side dishes. 

Comments:  This Samgyetang is a celebrated soup from the island of Cheju, and deservedly so since the prestigious, almost mystical, ginseng root is cooked and eaten like a vegetable with the chicken.  The Samgyetang is cooked in a tukbaege and brought still bubbling to the table.  It is considered to be a summer dish in restaurants and homes. 

Koreans will break up the chicken and rice in the pot so that it becomes a gruel.  I prefer that each person helps himself out of the pot, taking something of all the ingredients and spooning the rich, thick broth over all.  It seems to me more aesthetic without altering the taste. 

The jujubes prove a touch of contrasting sweetness to the chicken, rice and ginseng.  Ginseng, or "insam" as it is also called in Korea, tastes to me like a slightly bitter parsnip.  Its properties are alleged to be strengthening and bring about rejuvenation.

                        Barbecue Beef - {Bulgogi}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Korean


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  lean beef tenderloin
     1/2           cup  light soy sauce
     1/4           cup  dark soy sauce
     1/2           cup  Water
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped green onion
  3          teaspoons  crushed garlic
  2          teaspoons  finely-minced fresh ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  white sesame seeds -- toasted and ground
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil

Cut the beef across the grain into very thin slices, then cut into narrow strips. 

In a glass or stainless steel dish mix all remaining ingredients together.  Add the beef and stir thoroughly.  Cover and let marinate for at least 3 hours. 

Preheat a tabletop broiler (griller), protecting the tabletop with an asbestos mat or other suitable heat shield.  Each diner, or the host/hostess, places a portion of meat on the broiler (griller) and cooks it quickly on both sides. 

The meat is dipped into the sauce before eating.  Use wooden chopsticks or small forks/fondue forks. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Bulgogi or Bulgalbi, broiled (grilled) beef strips and beef ribs respectively, exemplify an age-old Korean tradition of cooking on a curved iron hotplate -- a tradition that is matched in northern China and neighboring Mongolia as introduced by the Manchurians. 

Today this has been streamlined for table service, with specially built cone-shaped hotplates fitted over tabletop burners, to provide an enjoyable and intimate eating experience. 

Meats of all kinds, including mutton, pork and poultry, offal and seafood, are cooked in this way, being first marinated in a spicy mixture encompassing the characteristic seasonings: soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, pepper or chili, toasted sesame seeds and green onions.  The meat is marinated well in advance so that the flavor is intense.  Cooking time is minimal -- just enough to cook through and seal the surface. 

Serve Bulgogi with white rice and yangnyum kanjang sauce, together with a selection of accompaniments such as kim chee (chili pickled cabbage) and jeot khal (spiced whitefish).

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Korean


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  sirloin or rib steak
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     scallions, white part only -- cut 2" long
                        julienne strips
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  hot red chili powder - (to 3 tspns)
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame seeds
  10             large  lettuce leave - (to 12)
  3                     garlic cloves -- sliced thin

Cut the steak into thin slices 3 inches long and 2 inches wide.  This can be done easily if the steak is half frozen.  Mix the steak with salt, 1 tablespoon sesame oil and the pepper; rub seasonings into the meat.  Set aside for 15 minutes. 

Soak the scallion slices in ice water for 15 minutes.  Drain well.  Mix together the soy sauce and the remaining 2 teaspoons sesame oil and toss this with the scallion slices.  Set aside. 

Mix the chili powder, sugar and sesame seeds together.  Rub this seasoning on the inside curl of the lettuce leaves.  Set aside. 

Grill the steak for 1 to 3 minutes for rare, medium, or well done, according to taste, over charcoal or in a gas or electric broiler. 

Take 1 lettuce leaf, put several slices of steak in the center, add about 1 tablespoon of the seasoned scallions, a sliver or two of garlic, fold the lettuce over the steak and eat.  Make as many sandwiches as you can eat. 

Serve with rice and side dishes or as a glorified appetizer with drinks. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

              Barbecued Squid Rectangles - {Ojingau Bulgogi}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  fresh squid - (to 3 lbs) -- body size 8" to 9"
  2        tablespoons  gochu jang paste - (to 3 tbspns) -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  chopped scallion
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  toasted sesame seeds
  1         tablespoon  Korean sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Clean the squid, remove the very thin black skin, inner stomach and contents.  Remove the tentacles and reserve for another use.  Rinse the body well in cold water and drain. 

Cut the body into 4 to 6 rectangles.  Score each piece 3 times lengthwise and crosswise.  Blanch each piece in boiling water for 3 seconds, then quickly remove and drain. 

Prepare the seasoning.  Mix into a paste all the ingredients except the squid, remembering that the gochu jang is a hot paste and should be added to taste.  Mix the squid with the seasoning and let stand for 1/2 hour. 

Broil the squid over charcoal or in a gas or electric broiler for only 2 minutes since squid toughens with excessive cooking.  The squid may also be panfried with 1 teaspoon corn oil in a skillet over high heat, just enough to sear both sides of the rectangle.  The barbecue, however, is the traditional method. 

Serve warm with steamed rice 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Cut the body into 4 to 6 rectangles.  Score each piece 3 times lengthwise and crosswise.  Blanch each piece in boiling water for 3 seconds, then quickly remove and drain. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Prepare the seasoning.  Mix into a paste all the ingredients except the squid, remembering that the gochu jang is a hot paste and should be added to taste.  Mix the squid with the seasoning and let stand for 1/2 hour. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Broil the squid over charcoal or in a gas or electric broiler for only 2 minutes since squid toughens with excessive cooking.  The squid may also be panfried with 1 teaspoon corn oil in a skillet over high heat, just enough to sear both sides of the rectangle.  The barbecue, however, is the traditional method. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Serve warm with steamed rice 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                     Bean Curd Stew - {Tubu Tchigae}

Recipe By     :Marc and Kim Millon, "Flavours of Korea"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     firm bean curd cake - (to 1 1/2)
  2                     loin pork chops on the bone - (to 3 -- abt 1 lb)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2          pint  meat broth - (about)
  2        tablespoons  Red Pepper Sauce - {Kochujang} -- (see recipe)
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, crushed,
                        and finely chopped
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (1" long) -- peeled, crushed,
                        and finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2                     celery stalks -- diagonally sliced
  1                     green pepper -- seeded, and
                        sliced on the diagonal
  1                     zucchini -- diagonally sliced
  2                     fresh chillies - (to 3) -- seeded and sliced
  3                     spring onions -- diagonally shredded

Cut the bean curd into cubes and set aside.  Trim the pork chops of all fat, and cut into thick matchsticks.  Use the trimmings and the bones to make a meat broth, if no other homemade broth is available; season with salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. 

Heat the vegetable oil in a pot and fry the meat for 5 minutes or until brown.  Add the kochujang, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil and cook over a medium flame for about 10 minutes, stirring all the while. 

Add meat broth, bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer and add the celery, green pepper, courgette, and chillies.  Simmer for about 25 to 30 minutes. 

Add the bean curd to the pot 5 minutes before ready to serve.  Simmer, then transfer to a large bowl.  Garnish with shredded spring onions. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Tubu tchigae is a classic, the sort of everyday food that Koreans yearn for when they have been away from home too long.  When Halmoni prepared this for Syngman Rhee, the then first President of the Republic of Korea sighed in ectasy and nostalgia (the man, a slight, skinny figure from pictures I have seen, had, remembers Halmoni, an immense and almost insatiable appetite).  Halmoni's tubu tchigae is exceedingly simple to prepare, but its taste is authentic and truly delicious.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  beef or veal liver -- in one piece
  3               cups  water
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (1/2" long) -- sliced
  2                     fresh burdock roots -- scraped, well
                        rinsed, chopped/ (optional), see * Note
  4                     semi-hot green chilies -- seeded, chopped
  1                     carrot -- chopped (1/2 cup)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  chopped scallion
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  flour
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Corn or soybean oil -- for pan frying

* Note:  Burdock (Arctium Lappa) is also known as gobo or Japanese burdock.  The roots are scraped and well rinsed in cold water to eliminate bitterness.  Although they do not have much flavor, the roosts are used in the fritter because they remove the strong liver aroma. 

Rinse the liver well in cold water.  Drain.  Bring to a boil 3 cups water, 1 teaspoon of the salt, the ginger and the liver.  Simmer over moderate heat for 15 minutes.  Drain, cool, and chop the liver. 

Mix the liver, burdock if used, chilies, carrot, pepper, scallion, garlic, soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of the flour into a fritter mixture. 

Shape fritters 2 inches across and 1/2-inch thick.  Coat them with flour, then with egg.  Heat the oil in a skillet and fry the fritter over moderate heat for 1 minute on each side, or until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels. 

Serve warm with rice, kimchi and dip of your choice. 

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Korean


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4         pounds  beef spareribs
     1/3        medium  carrot - (abt 1 1/2 oz)
  2                     dried shiitake mushrooms -- soaked in water
  1                     green onion
  1                     green pepper
  2 1/2         ounces  canned bamboo shoots
  1         tablespoon  salad oil
  1         tablespoon  mirin
  1           teaspoon  roasted sesame seeds
                        === MARINADE SAUCE ===
  5        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sake
  2 1/2    tablespoons  mirin
  3 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed garlic
     1/8      teaspoon  ground chili pepper
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SHREDDED OMELET ===
  1                     egg
  1              pinch  salt

Cut spareribs into serving pieces.  Remove any membrane and excess fat.  Place bone-side down and make a deep slit in center.  Then -- slice meat in half using the knife flat end uncut.  Slice the other side and open out flat. 

Make incisions at 1/4-inch intervals.  This process not only helps the meat to absorb the marinade but also makes eating easier. 

Combine all marinade ingredients and add spareribs.  Let stand 3 to 4 hours. 

In a saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon salad oil.  Add drained spareribs and cook over high heat.  Reserve the marinade sauce. 

Pour enough water to cover and simmer until the meat is tender.  Add remaining marinade and continue to cook, until the liquid is boiled down to half, constantly skimming. 

Slice carrot.  Cut up remaining vegetables and add to the pan.  When heated through, stir in mirin to glaze.  Pour in sesame oil and immediately remove from heat.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds and shredded omelet. 

To make the shredded omelet:  Korean dishes often use this as a colorful garnish.  The yolks and whites may also be cooked separately to add two-tone colors.  Do not brown the surface when cooking. 

Beat egg lightly (do not whisk), add a pinch of salt.  Pour into hot thinly greased skillet or square omelet pan. 

Roll the skillet around to spread evenly, over very low heat.  When the surface is nearly dry, separate the edges and turn over; cook slightly. 

Cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch-widths and place in layers.  Shred finely.  One egg yields about 3 tablespoons of shredded omelet. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  For richer flavor, add boiled chestnuts, ginkgo nuts or pine nuts if available.  Cook the dish low and slow and add sesame seeds and red chile for deeper flavor.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  Chinese cabbage (the long,
                        straight-leafed variety)
     1/4         pound  Chinese turnip

  4        tablespoons  hot pepper flakes
  2        tablespoons  cayenne pepper

Remove the large outside leaves of the cabbage.  Cut them in half lengthwise, then cut across the grain into 2-inch lengths.  Cut all the inside leaves into 2-inch lengths at the same time.  Place the cabbage in a very large pot. 

Quarter the turnip, then slice across the grain holding the 4 quarters together for more speed and convenience in slicing. 

Pour the oil from the anchovies over the cabbage and turnip.  Slice the anchovies across the grain.  Crush the garlic.  Cut the scallions into 2-inch lengths, then slice thin lengthwise.  Add these ingredients to the pot.  Season with salt, pepper flakes and cayenne pepper, and mix thoroughly.  Cover the pot and let the mixture stand at room temperature for 2 days.

                        Chestnut Rice - {Bam Bap}

Recipe By     :Copeland Marks, "The Korean Kitchen"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Rice/Grains


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  rice
  6                     chestnuts
  3 1/2           cups  water

Rinse the rice in cold water and drain. 

Peel the chestnuts of their outer brown skins and the inner, thinner skin linings.  Cut them into halves, if large, or leave them whole if they are small. 

Combine the rice, chestnuts and water, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cook for about 15 minutes.  Stir once or twice toward the end of the cooking.  The water will have been absorbed and the chestnuts softened. 

Serve warm. 

This recipe yields 6 servings at Korean meals. 

Comments:   Korean chestnuts are the size of a small egg -- very large, solid and sweet.  It is astonishing in the autumn, the chestnut season, to see a large heap of these giant chestnuts piled in pyramids in the public marketplaces.  In New York, during the Thanksgiving/Christmas season, reasonably good chestnuts imported from Italy are available and make a satisfactory substitute. 

Prepare the chestnuts in this manner: Chestnuts that have been well dried by leaving them at room temperature for a day or two are easier to peel with a serrated knife.  Sometimes the peel can be broken off with your fingers.  To remove the inner and outer skin, cut off about half of the thick outer shell and drop the chestnuts in boiling water.  Cover the pan and cook for 5 minutes.  Drain, cool enough to handle, then pull off both skins.

          Chicken In A Hot Chili Sauce - {Dak Cochu Jang Boekum}

Recipe By     :Copeland Marks, "The Korean Kitchen"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Korean
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  chicken parts -- loose skin
                        and fat discarded
  5        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1                     scallion -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  5        tablespoons  hot fermented chili paste (gochu jang)
  2        tablespoons  Korean sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame seeds
     1/2           cup  water

Cut the chicken into 3-inch pieces.  Divide the wings.  Mix the parts with the sugar and marinate for 1 hour or more (the sugar is a tenderizer). 

Mix together all the other seasonings -- garlic, scallion, ginger, soy sauce, gochu jang, sesame oil and sesame seeds.  Mix well, add to the chicken, and marinate for another hour. 

Pour the 1/2 cup of water into a pan and bring to a boil.  Add the chicken and marinade and simmer, covered, over low heat for about 1/2 hour, which is enough to cook the chicken and evaporate nearly all the liquid.  Stir the mixture once or twice during this process. 

Serve warm with rice, salads and kimchi. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Koreans in the southern part of the country like salty and chili-hot foods.  The cities of Kwangju and Chongju in the southwest Korea, where I spent some culinary research time, are centers for this hot salty dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  chicken wings
  10                    green onions
                        === SEASONING MIXTURE ===
  3 1/3    tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  minced green onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2    tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  1                     dried red pepper -- shredded
  1         tablespoon  prepared sesame seeds
  2        tablespoons  sesame seed
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper

Steam chicken wings about 10 minutes or until cooked.  Cool, then with your fingers tear into thin strips. 

Wash green onions and cut into 2-inch strips 

Combine chicken, green onions and Seasoning Mixture.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  If you do not have a steamer, you can make one by placing an empty can with both ends removed in the center of a deep pot.  Pour in boiling water to a level 1 inch below the top of the can.  Place the chicken wings on a heat resistant plate and balance it on top of the can.  Cover and maintain the boil.  Have a kettle of boiling water ready if it becomes necessary to add more to the pot. 

Don't let this dish sit too long before serving, or it gets soggy.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  chicken parts
  8               cups  water or chicken broth
  2          teaspoons  salt -- or to taste
  3        tablespoons  chili powder -- or to taste
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Korean sesame oil
  1              pound  noodles
  2                     scallions -- processed to a paste
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed to a paste

Cook the chicken in water or broth and salt until tender, about 45 minutes.  Remove the chicken and reserve the broth.  Shred the meat by hand; discard skin and bones. 

Mix the shreds with the chili powder, soy sauce and sesame oil.  Mix well so that the chicken develops a red color. 

Bring the reserved broth to a boil, add the noodles, scallion paste and garlic paste and cook until the noodles are al dente, about 5 minutes. 

Pour the broth and noodles into a large serving bowl or individual bowls.  Add the seasoned chicken to the center of the bowl but do not stir. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1              pound  Korean or Chinese thin noodle
                        === MIXTURE A ===
  1           teaspoon  powered red pepper
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4                green onion -- shredded
                        === MIXTURE B ===
  3        tablespoons  minced green onion
  3        tablespoons  light soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  prepared sesame seeds
                        === MIXTURE C ===
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  minced green onion
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
                        A little finely-shredded dried red pepper
                        === GARNISH & SERVING ===
                        Finely shredded dried red pepper
                        Salt
                        Light soy sauce
                        Vinegar
                        Mustard

Start preparing for the dish at least one day before serving.  Cut giant white radish in half lengthwise and slice across very thinly.  Combine with the Mixture A ingredients.  Let stand one day or more to make kimchi. 

Bring 10 cups water to a boil and add beef, skim several times until scum is thoroughly removed, then add sliced garlic.  Continue cooking over low heat about two hours.  When a skewer or fork slides easily into the meat, remove from pot, slice thinly, and mix with the Mixture B ingredients.  Add a few drops of light soy sauce and salt to broth while hot.  Strain and cool. 

Cut cucumbers in half lengthwise and then across into thin slices.  Combine with the Mixture C ingredients. 

Hardboil the eggs and shell them.  Cut a slice off each end for balance; then cut them in half crosswise. 

Peel and core the pear, and cut lengthwise into thin slices.  Dip in salt water and drain. 

Bring a large quantity of water to a boil, and add the noodles.  Boil for 4 or 5 minutes, stirring with chopsticks or cooking spoon.  Then rinse in cold water, rubbing noodles between your hands. 

Separate noodles into four portions and place them in large individual bowls, mounding them in a spiral shape.  Place on top in the order given; kimchi, cucumbers, beef, pear and eggs.  Garnish with a little shredded red pepper.  Pour over a generous amount of chilled soup.  Serve with soy sauce, vinegar, and mustard. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Cooked Tofu And Ground Meat - {Dubu Jjim}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             blocks  tofu
  4        tablespoons  sesame oil
                        Ground beef -- (?? amount)
                        === MIXTURE A ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/2    tablespoon  minced green onion
     2/3      teaspoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === MIXTURE B ===
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  water
  1                     green onion -- thinly sliced
  1                     dried red pepper -- finely shredded
     1/2    tablespoon  prepared sesame seeds

Cut each block of tofu in half lengthwise, then crosswise into 3/8-inch slices.  Spread a muslin dish towel or cheesecloth on a dry cutting board, wrap the tofu in it, and press lightly to remove excess water. 

Thoroughly combine ground beef and the Mixture A ingredients.  Heat skillet and pour in 4 tablespoons sesame oil.  Fry both sides of sliced tofu until golden brown.  Spread seasoned beef on one side of fried tofu with a knife. 

Place tofu in casserole meat-side up, and add the Mixture B ingredients.  Sprinkle with the sliced green onion, shredded red pepper, and the ground sesame seeds.  Cook over medium heat until sauce is thickened.  Serve hot in the casserole. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Heating the oil before adding tofu to the pan should keep the tofu from sticking to the bottom.  If, despite your care, it does stick, pour in a little more sesame oil along the side of the pan.

                  Cream Of Pine Nut Porridge - {Jat Juk}

Recipe By     :Copeland Marks, "The Korean Kitchen"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Snacks


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  pine nuts
  1                cup  water
  4                     dried jujubes (Korean dates) -- soaked in water
                        for 2 hours
  2          teaspoons  honey
     1/4           cup  rice flour -- dissolved in
     1/2           cup  water -- left 5 minutes
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

Grind the pine nuts in a processor with 1/2 cup water for about 1/2 minute.  Add the balance of the water and process the mixture until smooth.  Pour through a metal strainer and rub the particles through, preferably with a wooden spoon.  Discard the small amount of residue, which is mostly the "eyes" or buds of the pine nuts. 

When the jujubes are ready, cut out and discard the pits.  Cut the jujubes into thin slices and mix with the honey.  Set aside. 

Simmer the rice flour paste in a pan over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the mixture just starts to bubble.  This is the soup thickener. 

Add the pine nut mixture, the sugar and salt to the rice flour and bring to a low boil for 2 minutes.  The lightly thickened porridge, smooth and creamy, is now ready. 

Pour it into individual bowls and garnish with a teaspoon of the jujube and honey.  Serve warm. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  The porridge, it is not quite a soup, is usually served on three different occasions.  The first is for breakfast as a special treat, since pine nuts are expensive everywhere.  The second is as a restorer of strength for persons who are ill or debilitated.  The third occasion is as a snack anytime of day when special friends meet -- not the tea or coffee hour but pine-nut soup time.

                  Cucumber Vegetable Salad - {Ol Namul}

Recipe By     :Judy Hyun, "The Korean Cookbook"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Salads/Dressings
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     cucumbers
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1                     garlic clove
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sesame seeds
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  sugar

Slice the cucumbers in circles.  Sprinkle salt over the cucumber slices, mix well and let them stand for 30 minutes.  Place the cucumbers in a damp cloth and gently but firmly squeeze out as much water as possible.  The less watery the cucumbers, the better tasting the dish. 

Crush the garlic, then combine it with the cucumbers, salt, sesame seeds, sesame oil, pepper and sugar in a bowl.  Mix well. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This simple cucumber salad is a pleasant accompaniment to a hot summer night.  Small cucumbers are suggested; they are not quite as watery as the large ones nor do they require peeling.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     eggs -- lightly beaten with
  1              pinch  salt
  8             ounces  flank steak or thin-cut round steak
     1/4         bunch  Chinese cabbage kimchi - (abt 8 oz)
  4               thin  green onions - (to 5)
  4        tablespoons  flour
                        Sesame oil
                        Vinegar-Soy Sauce
                        === SEASONING MIXTURE FOR BEEF ===
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  minced green onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  prepared sesame seeds
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper

Lightly squeeze kimchi to remove excess liquid.  Cut the kimchi and green onions into 2-inch lengths.  Cut the beef into pieces a little smaller than the kimchi, and mix the meat thoroughly with Seasoning Mixture. 

Place the kimchi, green onions and beef (in that order) on bamboo skewers.  Dredge skewered ingredients with flour, shake off excess flour and then coat thoroughly with the beaten eggs. 

Heat a little sesame oil in skillet and fry a skewer over medium heat, pouring a tablespoon of the remaining eggs over the skewer.  Don't let the egg brown.  When meat is cooked, with chopsticks or spatula fold excess eggs toward skewer to wrap, and turn.  Fry until light brown.  Repeat the process with remaining skewers. 

This recipe yields 8 skewers. 

Comments:  Strain beaten eggs if there is any foam.  Add 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil to the skillet if the egg starts to brown before the meat is cooked. 

A recipe for "Kim Chi" made fron Chinese cabbage can be found in this collection.  Also, many Korean grocery stores sell home-made kimchi whose flavor is excellent.

Categories    : Korean                          Pickles/Relishes
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
  1              pound  oriental eggplants - (abt 2)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     semi-hot green chili -- seeded, and
                        cut 3"-long julienne strips
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  2                     scallions -- cut 3"-long strips,
                        the white part quartered
  2          teaspoons  hot red chili flakes
  3        tablespoons  julienne stips of onion, chinese chive,
                        or Korean radish
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (1" long) -- crushed

Bring the water, eggplants and salt to a boil in a saucepan large enough to contain all the ingredients.  Cook over moderate heat for 3 minutes, turning the eggplant in the water now and then.  The eggplant should be half-cooked and pliant but not mushy.  Remove and set aside, cool, and cut into 3 equal pieces.  Cut a deep cross in one end of each piece so that they can be opened and stuffed.  Set aside. 

Thoroughly mix the green chili, garlic, ginger, scallions, chili flakes and onion or chive or radish together.  Open up the cut in each eggplant and push in about 2 tablespoons of the stuffing.  Place the stuffed eggplant in a glass or plastic container that has a tight cover.  Cover the container and put it in a cool but not refrigerated spot for 1 day to mature.  Then serve and refrigerate. 

The kimchi is best eaten during the first 3 days if you prefer a light flavor but for more bite, wait until later in the week when the mixture will have fermented.  It can be refrigerated for a maximum of 1 week. 

This recipe yields 1 quart.

                      Fried Kelp - {Da Shima Twigim}

Recipe By     :Copeland Marks, "The Korean Kitchen"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Snacks
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            pieces  dried black kelp - (3" ea)
  1                cup  corn oil
  2        tablespoons  sugar

Wipe each piece of the dried kelp with a damp (not soaking) cloth. 

Heat the oil in a skillet over moderate heat.  One at a time, put a very lightly dampened piece of kelp in the hot oil, holding it with chopsticks, until the color changes to dark green.  Bubbles may appear on the kelp surface and it will develop a crispness. 

While the kelp is still hot sprinkle on a few grains of sugar.  The sugar will cling to the kelp when it is still hot and just removed from the oil.  It will not do so when cold. 

Eat as a side dish or snack food with tea or a drink. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  The hallmark of Korean cooking is the use of the natural foods in appealing ways.  Seaweed, which is now domesticated, that is to say raised on farms jutting out into the sea, supplements food that is raised on land.  Containing iodine and a host of other minerals and with a flavor reminiscent of an ocean breeze, the fried kelp (Laminaria japonica) with a light sprinkling of sugar is an example of the culinary ingenuity of the Koreans.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MANDU FILLING ===
  10            ounces  firm tofu
  8             ounces  kimchi -- minced
  12            ounces  extra-lean ground beef
  2                     green onions -- minced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame seeds
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === MANDU WRAPPERS AND COOKING ===
  1            package  round egg roll wrappers (gyoza)
                        Vegetable oil -- as neded
                        Water -- as neded
                        === DIPPING SAUCE - {CHOJANG} ===
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes - (to 1/2 tspn) -- (optional)

Make the mandu filling:  Wrap the tofu in cheesecloth or a clean kitchen towel.  Squeeze out the excess water.  Crumble the tofu into a mixing bowl. 

Place the kimchi in a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth and press or squeeze to remove excess moisture.  Add the kimchi to the bowl. 

Add the remaining mandu filling ingredients to the bowl and mix thoroughly.  At this point, the mandu mixture may be covered and refrigerated until ready to fill the dumplings.  (It will keep as long as one day.) 

Stuff and cook the mandu:  For best results, line 2 baking sheets with waxed paper, then dust a layer of cornstarch on the waxed paper to keep the mandu from sticking. 

Set out a small dish of water.  Place several dumpling wrappers on a cutting board.  Fill each with about 1 teaspoon of filling.  Dip your finger in the water and run it over the edge of the dumpling skin.  Fold the top over and press to seal, removing as much air as possible.  Set the mandu on the prepared baking sheets while you stuff the remaining dumpling skins. 

Note:  Koreans traditionally curve the mandu into a ring shape, so the ends meet and are sealed with water.  This type of shape is ideal for soups, but for fried mandu, I prefer the flatter, half-moon shapes as described above.  If you have one of the potsticker gadgets that folds and seals the dumplings in one motion, you'll find the process goes much quicker.  You can also freeze the stuffed mandu on a cornstarch-dusted baking sheet to keep them from sticking together, then transfer to an air-tight container and freeze until ready to use. 

Heat a skillet with just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom surface.  (To speed up the cooking process, use two skillets.)  When the oil is very hot, gently place a layer of stuffed mandu in the skillet, being careful not to overlap them.  When the mandu are golden brown on the bottom, flip them over. 

Quickly add 2 tablespoons water to the pan, cover and steam the mandu until cooked through, about 2 minutes.  Uncover the pan and place the mandu on a serving dish (you can keep them warm in a low oven while you cook the remaining mandu.  Serve the mandu with dipping sauce. 

Make the dipping sauce:  Combine all ingredients.  Serve the dipping sauce in one communal bowl, or set out one small bowl and plate per person. 

This recipe yields about 50 mandu. 

Comments:  Mandu, Korean dumplings, can be boiled in water then served in soups.  Or serve them like potstickers by frying them on one side then steaming them until done.  Serve fried mandu with a soy-vinegar dipping sauce.  If you prefer, you can make the stuffing without tofu (tubu in Korean), substituting ground beef or pork, or even ground turkey instead.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Make the mandu filling:  Wrap the tofu in cheesecloth or a clean kitchen towel.  Squeeze out the excess water.  Crumble the tofu into a mixing bowl. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Place the kimchi in a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth and press or squeeze to remove excess moisture.  Add the kimchi to the bowl. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Add the remaining mandu filling ingredients to the bowl and mix thoroughly.  At this point, the mandu mixture may be covered and refrigerated until ready to fill the dumplings.  (It will keep as long as one day.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Stuff and cook the mandu:  For best results, line 2 baking sheets with waxed paper, then dust a layer of cornstarch on the waxed paper to keep the mandu from sticking. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Set out a small dish of water.  Place several dumpling wrappers on a cutting board.  Fill each with about 1 teaspoon of filling.  Dip your finger in the water and run it over the edge of the dumpling skin.  Fold the top over and press to seal, removing as much air as possible.  Set the mandu on the prepared baking sheets while you stuff the remaining dumpling skins. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Note:  Koreans traditionally curve the mandu into a ring shape, so the ends meet and are sealed with water.  This type of shape is ideal for soups, but for fried mandu, I prefer the flatter, half-moon shapes as described above.  If you have one of the potsticker gadgets that folds and seals the dumplings in one motion, you&apos;ll find the process goes much quicker.  You can also freeze the stuffed mandu on a cornstarch-dusted baking sheet to keep them from sticking together, then transfer to an air-tight container and freeze until ready to use. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Heat a skillet with just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom surface.  (To speed up the cooking process, use two skillets.)  When the oil is very hot, gently place a layer of stuffed mandu in the skillet, being careful not to overlap them.  When the mandu are golden brown on the bottom, flip them over.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Quickly add 2 tablespoons water to the pan, cover and steam the mandu until cooked through, about 2 minutes.  Uncover the pan and place the mandu on a serving dish (you can keep them warm in a low oven while you cook the remaining mandu.  Serve the mandu with dipping sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/4           cups  water
  1           teaspoon  salt

  1 1/2        bunches  green onions
  1              small  red bell pepper
                        Cooking oil -- as needed

Cut green onions about 7 to 8 inches long (about half size of whole green onions).  Divide the bottom part of the onion into two vertically in order make them thin. 

Slice red pepper thinly. 

In a bowl, put warm water and put a little bit of salt.  In salted water, put frozen oyster to defrost. 

When the oyster is defrosted, take it out and drain well.  Cut the oyster into small pieces. 

In a large bowl, mix flour, water, onion powder, garlic salt, and egg together.  Put oyster into the flour mixture and mix well. 

In a fry pan, spread cooking oil, and wait until the heat goes through (medium heat). 

Pour 1/3 of the flour and oyster mixture and make it plain.  Reduce heat.  Put 1/3 of the green onion above the flour.  Put 1/3 of the red pepper slices between the slices of green onion. 

When the bottom part is well done and the surface starts to be firm, press the pancake with big spoon and turn it.  Cook it 1 to 2 minutes more until the bottom part is well done. 

Make 3 pancakes.  Serve when it is warm.  If you like salty taste, it can be served with soy sauce, vinegar mixture (1 tablespoon of soy sauce and 1 teaspoon vinegar). 

This recipe yields 3 servings. 

Comments:  Pa Jeon is very popular food in Korea.  It is wonderful party dish and good appetizer served with oriental wine.

                        Iced Korean Cucumber Soup

Recipe By     :Katherine Heyhoe
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     cucumbers
  2               cups  chicken broth -- degreased
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  4                     green onions -- chopped diagonally
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame seeds
  15                    ice cubes - (to 20)

If the cucumbers are waxy, peel them.  If the skin is thin and unwaxed, leave it on.  Cut the cucumber into matchstick julienne, about 2 inches in length.  To make the soup more attractive, cut the ends of the matchsticks on the diagonal. 

In a large serving bowl, mix together the chicken broth, water, cider vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar and white pepper.  Stir in the cucumber and green onions.  Chill well. 

Just before serving, stir the ice cubes and sesame seeds into the soup.  Taste the soup to correct the seasonings.  It should be pleasantly tart and slightly salty, with a hint of sesame.  If the flavorings seem too strong, then dilute with additional water, but keep in mind that the ice cubes will thin down the flavors as they melt. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  This delectable dish is the perfect antidote for heatstroke.  In Korea, the summer heat soars way above 100 degrees.  Consequently, this tart, ice cold and uncooked soup became an extremely popular dish at my mother's parties.  You prepare it in advance and then, just before serving, add the ice cubes.  Stir the ice cubes around for a few seconds and you have a very cold, icy cold, much colder than just chilled, soup.  The ice cubes also function to firm up the cucumbers and make them crunchy.  I like the lightness of it, as it contains no cream with but a small amount of fat from the sesame oil, and the crispness of the raw matchstick cucumbers gives it a refreshing texture. 

As with so many Asian dishes, this soup has great aesthetic appeal as well.  The paleness of the light green cucumbers is accented by the green and white of the onions and the tan specks of sesame seeds.  If you can get very fresh, unwaxed cucumbers for this recipe, then use them with the peel on for added color, taste and texture.  If only waxed cucumbers are available, then you must peel them before use. 

By the way, this is really a very traditional Korean soup, and this recipe is exactly the way my mother's mother made it for her.  It's not surprising that such an icy, tangy soup as this would be served in Korea.  The summers there can be stiflingly hot, even though the winters are bitterly cold.  The Koreans are also very fond of cucumbers and include them in most of their meals, either cooked, pickled or raw.  A popular version of kim chi, the Korean national dish, consists of cucumbers pickled in red hot chili powder and is quite potent indeed. 

As a final tidbit, because of its crisp and refreshingly tart flavor, this soup is also known in the Western world as "Korean Gazpacho."

  1 1/3    tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  2                     green onion -- minced
     1/2           cup  salted shrimp
  2 1/2    tablespoons  salt

Discard the outside leaves of Chinese cabbage and cut lengthwise into halves or quarters.  Let soak in salted water for a whole day. 

When Chinese cabbage has become wilted, place in colander to drain.  Shred giant white radish and mix with powdered red pepper.  Let stand for 10 minutes.  Cut watercress into 2-inch lengths.  Slice onions thinly.  Slice cuttlefish.

Tightly pack Chinese cabbage into a crock and pour in the reserved juice and Mixture B ingredients.  Place a dish small enough to fit inside the crock on top of the Chinese cabbage in order to press it gently.  Cover with plastic wrap. 

The kimchi will be ready to eat after a week at 44 to 46 degrees.  Then store in refrigerator.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  ground beef
     1/2           box  hard tofu
  10                    green hot peppers
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2                     beaten eggs
  3        tablespoons  water
                        Cooking oil -- as needed
                        === SAUCE ===
  5        tablespoons  chopped green onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  3        tablespoons  soysauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  sesame seed
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Squeeze tofu with paper towel and mash it.  In a large bowl, put beef, mashed tofu and the sauce and mix well. 

Cut hot peppers lengthwise into two.  Apply flour to the inner side of peppers.  Fill peppers with beef and tofu mixture (Kochoo Jeon).  Shape remaining beef and tofu mixture into 1-inch round patties (Don Jeon). 

Coat round patties with flour.  Coat meat side of stuffed pepper with flour.  Dip stuffed peppers and patties into beaten egg.  In a fry pan, cook Jeons with cooking oil until golden (mediun heat). 

Serve when they are warm.  Sprinkle some soy sauce if you like salty taste. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Jeon is traditional Korean dish.  It is not an ordinary dish you can eat everyday.  Of course you can eat it everyday if you like, but traditionally, it is usually used for party. 

There are various kinds of Jeons in Korea (zuccini Jeon, fish Jeon, beef liver Jeon, hot pepper Jeon, circle shape Jeon, and so on).  Kochoo Jeon means hot pepper Jeon, and Don Jeon means circle shape Jeon ("Don" means coin).  Coating with flours and dipping into eggs, and saute with cooking oil is the typical way of making Jeons.

  8               cups  rich beef broth
  1                can  bamboo shoots - (3 oz) -- drained
  18                    canned gingko nuts -- drained
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts -- (optional)
  1                     fresh red chili -- shredded
  3                     green onions -- shredded
                        === VINEGAR SOY DIPPING SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  light soy sauce
     1/4           cup  white vinegar
     1/4           cup  white sesame seeds -- toasted and ground
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped green onions

Very thinly slice the liver, sprinkle with salt and pepper and fry lightly in a little vegetable oil with a few drops of sesame oil until colored and sealed on the surface.  Set aside. 

Boil the tripe for 8 minutes in lightly salted water; drain and cut into narrow strips. 

Cut the beef into thin slices.  Pound with a meat mallet or the side of a cleaver and cut into small squares. 

Mix the ground meat with the egg, adding salt, pepper and a few drops each of sesame oil and soy sauce.  Form small meatballs with wet hands.  Fry in a half-and-half mixture of sesame and vegetable oils until lightly browned. 

Peel and slice the carrot.  Drain the mushrooms and remove the stems.  Bring the stock to the boil in a suitable vessel in the center of the table.  Add the meat, vegetables and nuts and simmer gently for about 15 minutes.  Spoon straight from the pot into small bowls with the vinegar soy dip. 

When the meat and vegetables have been eaten, add the finely shredded chili and green onions to the remaining stock and serve in soup bowls. 

Vinegar Soy Dipping Sauce:  Mix all ingredients.  The sauce keeps for several days in the refrigerator without the green onions, one day with the green onions added. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  beef oxtail - (you can use more if
                        you like more meat in your soup)
  5                     garlic cloves
  1             medium  onion -- halved, (optional)
                        A small amount sliced fresh ginger root -- (optional)
  2                     green onions -- finely sliced

Put oxtail in cold water for 1 to 2 hours to remove extra blood.  Rinse well. 

In a large pot, put oxtail and garlic cloves with enough water (at least 5 to 8 times of tail) and bring to boil.  (In addition to garlics, you can also put small amount of sliced ginger root and one whole onion, to remove greasy smell.  But these are not strictly required). 

While the pot is boiling, remove bubbles and other dark stuffs on the boiling surface.  Repeat 2 to 3 times until water looks clean.  Watch when it begins to boil and open the lid; or you will mess up the stovetop. 

Reduce heat and simmer 3 to 5 hours, or until the color of the soup is a bit milky.  Turn off heat and remove floating fat carefully.  (Most people don't like greasy taste of that fat!) 

When you serve, put relevant amount of tail meat and soup in a large soup bowl.  Add 1 tablespoon chopped fresh green onion in the soup bowl.  Use salt and gound black pepper to taste.  Serve with steamed rice.  Enjoy! 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                  Meat And Vegetable Hot Pot - {Chongol}

Categories    : Korean                          Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COOKING BROTH ===
     1/4          pint  rice wine or dry cooking sherry
     1/4          pint  soy sauce
     1/2          pint  beef broth or chicken broth or water
  2        tablespoons  sugar - (heaped)
                        === MEAT AND VEGETABLES ===
  1              pound  sirloin steak -- cut against grain
                        into thin strips
  3                     celery stalks -- cut diagonal strips
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into diagonal slices
  1          large can  bamboo shoot (in one piece) -- sliced into large
                        matchsticks, excess moisture squeezed out
     1/2         pound  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- sliced
  15                    spring onions -- cut 2" long pieces
     1/2                Chinese cabbage -- cut 1" wide pieces
  2              small  white onions -- peeled, halved,
                        and cut into thin slices lengthwise
  1              pound  spinach
  2                     bean curd cakes -- halved horizontally,
                        then sliced
  1                     konnakyu cake -- cut thin slices

Note:  If fresh shiitake mushrooms are not available substitute 10 to 15 dried Chinese mushrooms, cleaned, trimmed, and soaked for 1 to 2 hours or until soft, then sliced. 

Chongol should be prepared in a large flat pan set over a burner at the table, if possible.  Otherwise, cook then transfer to a bowl and serve immediately.  It will be necessary to cook this amount in 2 or 3 batches, so divide the ingredients accordingly. 

In a large pan or pot, heat 1 tablespoon oil, and stir-fry the sliced steak for a few minutes to brown.  Next add the hard vegetables to the pan, celery, bamboo, carrots, sliced onions, and dried mushrooms (if not using fresh).  Add a few ladles of the cooking broth, bring to the boil and simmer for about 5 minutes. 

Next add the spring onions, mushrooms, spinach, and cabbage and cook for further 2 to 3 minutes, adding more cooking broth as necessary necessary. 

Finally add the konnyaku and bean curd and cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir well to coat with sauce and serve immediately. 

Continue cooking in batches until all the ingredients are finished. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Chongol, Korea's version of sukiyaki, is a one-pot meal, traditionally prepared over a burner at the table.  Any number of ingredients can be added to the simmering deep and wide pan of cooking broth: this is Halmoni's version, a most substantial and festive array which includes strips of meat, a variety of vegetables, bean curd, and konnyaku, the rather bland but chewy curd which is a feature of the Korean kitchen.  As such, chongol is an always popular and rather theatrical party favourite.  But chongol is the sort of dish where you can utilize whatever is at hand, to make it as grand or as simple as you like.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4         ounces  bean threads
  5             ounces  lean beef
  1                     green onion
  4                     dried shiitake mushrooms -- soaked in water
     1/3         ounce  dried cloud ear mushrooms -- soaked in water
  1              ounce  carrot
  1                     green pepper
     2/3      teaspoon  salad oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SAUCE A ===
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  sake
     1/2      teaspoon  mirin
                        Crushed garlic
                        Roasted sesame seeds
                        Finely-chopped green onion
                        === SAUCE B ===
  1           teaspoon  roasted sesame seeds
     2/3      teaspoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/3      teaspoon  sesame oil
                        Crushed garlic
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        MSG -- to taste
                        === SHREDDED OMELET ===
  1                     egg
  1              pinch  salt

In salted boiling water, cook bean threads 3 to 4 minutes until transparent.  Remove from heat.  Drain and cut into 2 1/2-inch lengths. 

Cut beef into julienne strips.  In a bowl combine the Sauce A ingredients and add beef to marinate. 

Slice green onion diagonally.  Remove stems of shiitake mushrooms and cut into julienne strips.  Cut ear mushrooms into bite size pieces.  Cut carrot and green pepper into julienne strips. 

Heat salad oil in a skillet and add green onion.  Cook briefly and season with salt and pepper.  In the same manner cook all vegetables. 

Heat salad oil in a skillet and cook beef strips. 

In a bowl combine the Sauce B ingredients.  Add bean threads and mix well.  Add vegetables and beef.  Mix lightly and transfer to serving bowl.  Garnish with shredded omelet. 

To make the shredded omelet:  Korean dishes often use this as a colorful garnish.  The yolks and whites may also be cooked separately to add two-tone colors.  Do not brown the surface when cooking. 

Beat egg lightly (do not whisk), add a pinch of salt.  Pour into hot thinly greased skillet or square omelet pan. 

Roll the skillet around to spread evenly, over very low heat.  When the surface is nearly dry, separate the edges and turn over; cook slightly. 

Cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch-widths and place in layers.  Shred finely.  One egg yields about 3 tablespoons of shredded omelet. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Much like a precursor to Japanese sukiyaki, this dish is redolent with vegetables, noodles, beef and is artfully garnished with egg strips.

                    Persimmon Punch - {Soo Jeung Kwa}

Recipe By     :Copeland Marks, "The Korean Kitchen"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages                       Fruit
                Korean

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             gallon  cold water
     1/4         pound  fresh ginger -- rinsed, and
                        sliced thin with skin on
  2             ounces  cinnamon sticks - (8 to 10)
  2               cups  sugar -- or to taste
  6                     semi-dried whole persimmons -- cut 1" triangles

Bring the water to a boil with the ginger and cinnamon sticks. Cook over moderate heat for 1/2 hour.  Strain the liquid and discard the ginger but leave the cinnamon in the punch. 

Add the sugar while the liquid is still hot, to dissolve it.  Add the persimmons to the lukewarm liquid and cool.  The color of the punch becomes an old rose shade.  Refrigerate the punch and serve cold. 

Serve whenever wanted with any Asian food. 

This recipe yields 1 gallon. 

Comments:  The Korean persimmon (Diospyros kaki) used in the punch is the large, orange, egg-shaped type.  It is eaten when fully ripe -- very soft, orange-colored and with a creamy texture. 

In Korea, the unripe persimmons are picked in the autumn when the fruits are becoming ripe.  The fruits are peeled and strung together but spaced like the lights on a Christmas tree.  The strings of fruit are then attached to the persimmon tree to dry.  Cool nights and warm days accelerate the drying, but during the week that it takes to dry, certain microbes that are floating freely in the garden air attach themselves to the peeled persimmons.  After several days, the persimmons wilt and each one is then pushed together by hand to flatten on the drying string. 

When a white mold appears the fruit is dry enough to be packaged and sold, to be used in the punch.  This procedure is a good illustration of the Korean ingenuity used in preserving their seasonal fruits and vegetables.  It may also explain why dried persimmons are so expensive and uncommon.

                        Pork Roast - {Chaeyuk Kui}

Recipe By     :Judy Hyun, "The Korean Cookbook"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  pork shoulder or other lean pork
  2                     scallions
  1                     garlic clove
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
  4         tablespoon  Red Bean Paste - {Kochu Chang} -- (see recipe)

Cut the pork into 4 or 5 slices about 1/4-inch thick. 

Mince the scallions.  Mince or crush the garlic.  Combine both ingredients with the remaining seasonings in a bowl.  Add the pork slices and mix well until all sides of the pork are coated. 

Grill immediately or marinate until ready to serve.  It is important that the pork be well done; the outside should be dark, almost charred.  A charcoal, an electric or an oven grill may be used. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This dish is fairly spicy: it gets its highly seasoned flavor from kochu chang (red bean paste, found in many Oriental food stores.  If it is not available, Japanese miso sauce may be substituted).  Although the amount indicated is recommended, it is possible to use a little less.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  Chinese turnip
  1 1/2         pounds  Chinese cabbage
  1                cup  water
     1/4           cup  salt
  4              large  scallions
  4              large  garlic cloves or 6 small cloves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh ginger
  7          teaspoons  cayenne pepper

Wash the leaves of a Chinese cabbage and cut them into 2-inch lengths (the leafy end may be left longer; it will shrivel the most).  Peel the Chinese turnip, halve it lengthwise down the center and then slice thin across the grain. 

Combine the salt and water.  Place the vegetables in a large pot.  Pour the salted water over the surface of the vegetables and cover the pot.  Leave overnight. 

The next day, mince the scallions, garlic and ginger.  Drain the vegetables, which should be wilted and reserve the salty water.  Season with the cayenne, scallion, garlic and ginger.  Mix the vegetables by hand, using rubber gloves if available.  Pack this mixture tightly into jars.  Pour the salted water over the mixture so that the liquid comes to within 1/2 inch of the top of the jar. 

Keep at room temperature for 2 or 3 days, then refrigerate. 

This recipe yields about 2 jars of kimchi which should be enough for a large dinner party.

                      Red Bean Paste - {Kochu Chang}

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Korean


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  Red bean paste
  2        tablespoons  Powdered red cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  Soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  Sugar

Mix all the ingredients well.  Serve in a small dish for dipping. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Red bean paste is particularly tasty served with fresh scallions and radishes or added to some soups.  Korean kochu chang may be pruchased at many Oriental food stores.  If it is not available, Japanese miso sauce may be substituted.  This recipe is for a more pungent kochu chang than that which comes directly from the jar.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Red bean paste is particularly tasty served with fresh scallions and radishes or added to some soups.  Korean kochu chang may be pruchased at many Oriental food stores.  If it is not available, Japanese miso sauce may be substituted.  This recipe is for a more pungent kochu chang than that which comes directly from the jar.

                      Red Pepper Sauce - {Kochujang}

Recipe By     :Marc and Kim Millon, "Flavours of Korea"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Condiments
                Korean                          Sauces


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  kochujang
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, crushed,
                        and finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  rice or cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  toasted sesame seeds
  2                     spring onions -- shredded finely
                        on the diagonal
  2          teaspoons  sugar

Mix all the ingredients together and serve in saucers as a dip, with grilled meats, raw fish, or vegetables. 

Comments:  Kochujang, the characteristic staple red pepper, bean and glutinous rice paste, is usually purchased in jars already prepared, and is an essential staple of the Korean kitchen.  However, a more tasty red pepper sauce to be served as a dip or dressing can be made by adding a few more ingredients to the already prepared basic sauce. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Categories    : Korean                          Rice/Grains


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  rice
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  4               cups  water

Soak rice in water for 1 hour; drain well. 

Drop sesame oil in a pan and stir-fry rice for 4 to 5 minutes.  Add 4 cups of water and bring to a boil.  When it begins to bubble up, stir once.  Turn heat to the lowest and cover.  Simmer.  The chuk is done if the rice grains have become translucent and the water is absorbed. 

Note:  Do not salt chuk because it is usually served with soy sauce or pickles. 

Variation:  Grind the soaked rice with sesame oil in a blender.  Pour through a sieve.  Boil the thin rice water on the top first and add the sediment in the bottom.  Simmer. 

Variation:  Add some Chinese leeks when you cook hun chuk.

              Roasted Unhulled Barley Water Tea - {Bori Cha}

Recipe By     :Copeland Marks, "The Korean Kitchen"
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages                       Korean


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unhulled barley
  5               cups  boiling water

Put the barley in a large skillet and toast over moderate heat for about 10 minutes until the grains have turned to a dark coffee color.  Stir and shake the pan now and then during this time.  Set aside and cool. 

Put the toasted barley into the boiling water and simmer over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes.  Strain the mixture and discard the barley. 

Cool and serve at room temperature or refrigerate and serve when wanted. 

This recipe yields 5 cups. 

Comments:  Koreans are not essentially tea drinkers like the Chinese or Japanese.  Upon being seated in a Korean restaurant or home you are more than likely to be served a very pale-colored tea prepared from barley.  This brew, which has a light earthy flavor, is considered to be a health tea, good for one's digestive system, especially if sipped after dining.  I prefer to take the tea in small Chinese teacups at room temperature although it can be served quite warm or cooled in the refrigerator.

                      Seasoned Raw Beef - {Yuk Hoe}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Korean


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  beef fillet
  1                     pear
  1                     egg yolk
                        === SEASONING MIXTURE ===
  4        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2         tablespoon  minced green onion
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  garlic juice
  2 1/2      teaspoons  prepared sesame seeds
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped pine nuts

Cut the beef into slender matchstick-sized pieces.  Combine beef and Seasoning Mixture; use a light hand when mixing to keep the shredded beef from forming clumps.  Sprinkle with the pine nuts.  Place in mound on serving dish.  Make a depression on top and slide the egg yolk into it. 

Peel and core pear.  Slice thinly, dip in salt water, then drain.  Place on serving dish next to the beef.  The egg yolk is mixed into the meat before eating. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Pears are often combined with raw meat in Korean cooking.  The Oriental pear is round and crisp, halfway between American apple and pear in taste and texture.  This pear can occasionally found in the fall in supermarkets or oriental grocery stores.  Ask for bae (Korean) or nashi (Japanese).

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     live crabs
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds
  2        tablespoons  Korean sesame oil
  4        tablespoons  chopped scallions, green part only
  3        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped ginger
  2        tablespoons  hot red chili powder
  1             medium  onion -- cut thin slices
  3                     red semi-hot chilies -- seeded, thinly
                        sliced diagonally
  3                     green semi-hot chilies -- seeded, thinly
                        sliced diagonally
  1                cup  soy sauce

Scrub the crabs with a firm brush to clean.  Remove and discard the upper shell.  Only the body and legs of the crab are used.  Do not dislodge the orange crab roe that clings to the inner shell and contents.  Cut the body into halves, then each half into 2 or 3 pieces including the legs. 

Mix together the sugar, sesame seeds and oil, scallions, garlic, ginger, red chili powder, onion and chilies.  Mix this with the soy sauce, then strain the seasoned sauce into a marinating bowl.  Reserve the seasoning ingredients.  Mix the crab pieces in the sauce and marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for 24 hours. 

The next day add the seasoning ingredients to the crab and soy sauce, mix well, and serve at room temperature with steamed rice and an assortment of other Korean dishes. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  yellow soybean sprouts
  7               cups  cold water
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3                     scallions -- cut into 1" lengths
  1           teaspoon  chopped ginger
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame seeds
  1           teaspoon  korean sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  hot chili powder (Gochu Karu)
  1                     egg -- beaten, (optional
                        but recommended)

Preapare the bean sprouts by snipping off the root end and removing the bean skin which might still be attached to the sprout. 

Bring the 7 cups cold water to a boil and add all the other ingredients except the beaten egg.  Cook over moderate heat for 6 minutes, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 minutes more (My teacher cautioned me not to uncover the pan during this time since it releases a "fishy" aroma). 

Dribble the egg, if used, into the boiling soup, remove from the heat and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                  Spiced Crab Soup - {Denjang Jiege Keh}

Recipe By     :Copeland Marks, "The Korean Kitchen"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
  2        tablespoons  denjang paste
  1                     soft bean curd -- in 1/2" cube
  1           teaspoon  hot red chili powder -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  water
  1              slice  ginger - (quarter-size)
  1              small  onion -- sliced (1/3 cup)
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed
  2                     crabs -- each in 4 pieces
     1/2           cup  sliced zucchini

Put the water and bean paste (denjang) into a pan and simmer over low heat, covered, for 10 minutes.  Add the bean curd and cook for 5 minutes more. 

Now add all the other ingredients and cook for 15 minutes more.  Serve in 4 individual bowls with rice and an assortment of side dishes. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  The people of Kwangju where this recipe originates like their food salty and chili-hot.  The fermented denjang paste provides the basis of the seasonings, aided by the chili and ginger.  The fresh crabs absorb the flavors and the entire soup is enormously attractive.  I went to my teacher's house one August in the middle of a three day pre-typhoon downpour.  Sheets of water poured out of the sky as my taxi wended its way to the edge of town.  The rice fields in this rice-growing region shimmered with an intense green as the rain engulfed the paddy.  It had a wild, wet beauty but I was glad when I arrived and could concentrate in comfort on the crabs and the soup.

                     Spinach Salad - {Sigumchi Namul}

Recipe By     :Katherine Heyhoe
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh spinach
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2          teaspoons  toasted sesame seed
  1               dash  crushed red pepper flakes -- (optional)

Wash the spinach well and remove the tough stems.  Cook the spinach until just barely wilted and still tender, either by steaming or blanching. 

Drain and squeeze the liquid from the spinach with your hands, or place the spinach in a sieve and press with the back of a spoon.  Roughly chop the spinach. 

Mix the remaining ingredients together then toss with the spinach.  Serve at room temperature or chilled. 

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings. 

Comments:  Koreans lightly cook many of their vegetables, then mix them with a simple soy and sesame dressing, to be served at room temperature or cold.  This recipe makes a small amount compared to Western standards, but keep in mind that Koreans serve several namul, or vegetable side dishes, at the same time.  This dish, with some Golden Mandu, and a bean sprout or watercress salad, makes a refreshing light meal.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Wash the spinach well and remove the tough stems.  Cook the spinach until just barely wilted and still tender, either by steaming or blanching. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Drain and squeeze the liquid from the spinach with your hands, or place the spinach in a sieve and press with the back of a spoon.  Roughly chop the spinach. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Mix the remaining ingredients together then toss with the spinach.  Serve at room temperature or chilled. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Koreans lightly cook many of their vegetables, then mix them with a simple soy and sesame dressing, to be served at room temperature or cold.  This recipe makes a small amount compared to Western standards, but keep in mind that Koreans serve several namul, or vegetable side dishes, at the same time.  This dish, with some Golden Mandu, and a bean sprout or watercress salad, makes a refreshing light meal.

                  Spring Chicken Soup - {Yonggyebaeksuk}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Korean
                Poultry                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     spring chicken
     1/2           cup  glutinous rice
  10                    garlic cloves
  6                     jujubes (Korean dates)
  6                     chestnuts
  1                     ginger knob
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1               dash  MSG

Remove the organs, lower legs, feet and head from the chicken and clean. 

Stuff the chicken cavity with the glutinous rice and 5 cloves of garlic.  Sew the body cavity shut. 

Put the stuffed chicken in a pot and add water enough to simmer.  Add the jujubes, peeled chestnuts, ginger and remaining cloves of garlic.  Cover the pot and bring to a boil.  Then reduce the heat and simmer for 1 hour. 

Add the salt, black pepper and sliced green onion just before eating. 

Hint 1:  Stuff the chicken cavity with only a little glutinous rice, leaving room for it to expand as it cooks. 

Hint 2:  For medicinal use, take the boiled chicken out of the broth, add ginseng root and simmer the broth again. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                     Spring Onion Pancakes - {Pajon}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
                        A few drops sesame oil
                        === BATTER ===
     1/4           cup  rice flour (or all-purpose flour)
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  water - (approximately)
                        A few drops sesame oil
  1               dash  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        === VEGETABLES ===
  4                     green onions -- cut on the diagonal
                        into 1-inch lengths
  1 1/2           cups  fresh bean sprouts (mung bean sprouts) -- see * Note

* Note:  You can use impeccably fresh bean sprouts raw, or blanch them for 1 minute in boiling water and plunge into an ice bath to barely cook them.  Dry thoroughly before use. 

Combine the dipping sauce ingredients and set aside. 

Mix together the batter ingredients (except for the vegetable oil for frying).  The batter should resemble a thin pancake batter; adjust the amount of water accordingly.  Stir in the bean sprouts and green onions. 

Heat vegetable oil in a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat.  You want just enough oil to barely film the surface.  Pour in half the batter or enough to make a large pancake about 1/4-inch thick.  Fry on one side until golden brown but not scorched, then flip and cook the other side until golden.  (You may need to lower the heat to prevent burning.)  Remove the pancake and repeat with the remaining batter. 

To serve, cut the pancakes into wedges, as if slicing a pizza.  Serve warm or at room temperature with dipping sauce. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  These delicious treats are eaten as snacks or with meals.  The basic pajon uses spring onions or green onions, but the Koreans also mix in all sorts of vegetables and even meats.  This version adds bean sprouts, but I also enjoy them cooked with slivered oyster mushrooms, julienned carrots, and bell pepper strips.  The rice flour adds a wonderful texture, but if you can't find it, use all-purpose flour.  Serve these warm or at room temperature, with or without the dipping sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3         pound  beef
     1/2        medium  onion
     1/2         bunch  spinach

                        === SAUCE FOR BEEF AND MUSHROOMS ===
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/2    tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === SAUCE FOR SEASONING ===
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce - (to 2 tbspns)
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
                        Sugar -- (optional)

                           Steamed Rice - {Bab}

Recipe By     :Judy Hyun, "The Korean Cookbook"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Korean
                Rice/Grains                     Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  rice
  2               cups  water

Pour the rice into a cooking pot.  Fill the pot nearly to the brim with cold water, then pour the water out.  The rice will remain at the bottom of the pot.  Repeat this process 4 or 5 times, or until the water seems quite clear.  Rinsing the rice in this manner eliminates any excess starch. 

Cover the rice with 2 cups water and let it stand for 30 minutes.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and steam for 20 minutes or until dry. 

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings. 

Comments:  Generally speaking, if Americans are to be served, use 1/2 cup uncooked rice for each person.  Double the amount if cooking for Koreans, especially Korean men.

                 Steamed Rice Cake With Mung Beans - ...

Recipe By     :Copeland Marks, "The Korean Kitchen"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Korean
                Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  glutinous rice
  2               cups  skinless yellow mung beans
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/4           cup  sugar

Rinse the rice well, cover with cold water and soak overnight or for 12 hours.  Drain well and grind in a processor.  This will result in a dense, sticky paste. 

Cover the beans well with cold water and soak for 2 hours.  Drain.  Put the beans in a Chinese-style steamer and steam them for 15 minutes.  Grind the beans coarsely in a processor.  Mix them with the salt and sugar. 

Wrap a wet kitchen towel (flat, not Turkish weave) over and around the perforated steamer tray.  Prepare a layered cake on the towel in this way: Put down in a round or rectangle shape a layer 1/4-inch thick of the ground mung beans.  Cover this with 1/2 inch of the glutinous rice and cover with another 1/4 inch of the beans.  Cover the steamer tightly and steam for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Test with a toothpick.  If the toothpick emerges dry, then the cake is done. 

Lift out the cake in the towel and carefully turn it upside down on a cutting board.  Allow the cake to cool somewhat and slice into convenient sections while still warm.  Serve immediately while fresh with tea or coffee. 

The cake should be stored in a freezer since it does ferment when refrigerated for more than 1 day.  Put the cake sections in aluminum or plastic trays, cover and freeze.  Remove when wanted and rewarm in a steamer for 5 to 10 minutes. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  If the skinless yellow mung beans are unavailable, you may use the green mung beans but they must be skinned before preparing this rice cake.  Soak them in water to cover for 4 hours.  Rub the beans between your hands in the water and the skins will separate quite easily.  Drain, discard the skins, and use the green beans as noted in the recipe except that additional soaking is not necessary. 

Glutinous rice, also known as sweet rice, is reserved in Asia for special occasions, many times for sweets.  The rice is dense and gummy and can be attractive to western tastes.  The Nokdoo has simple ingredients, is vegetarian, fat-free and delicious, if unconventional, for the tea and coffee hour break.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/3           cups  glutinous rice
  1              pound  chestnuts
  5             ounces  dates
  3 1/2    tablespoons  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  5             ounces  raisins
     1/4           cup  honey
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts
                        === SEASONING MIXTURE ===
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar
  1 1/2           cups  sugar

Wash glutinous rice and soak in water for overnight.  Shell chestnuts and cut into halves.  Wash and pit dates, and cut into 2 or 3 pieces. 

Drain rice, and place in a steamer basket.  Make a hole in the center of rice.  Steam over high heat about 30 minutes until cooked.  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup water during steaming. 

Transfer rice to a large bowl.  Add Seasoning Mixture to the hot rice and mix well.  Add sesame oil and cinnamon, and mix thoroughly once more.  Gently stir in the raisins, dates and chestnuts. 

Place the bowl of rice pudding in the steamer and steam about 5 hours until chestnuts are cooked.  Add more boiling water as needed.  Sprinkle with honey and mix while steaming.  Sprinkle with pine nuts before turning off heat. 

The hot steamed rice pudding can be packed into a round cake pan, unmold and cut into pieces before placing on serving dish. 

This recipe yields 10 servings. 

Comments:  This pudding is called Yak-Sik in Korean, which means "medicine food."  Yak is often used in the name for honey-flavored sweets, because honey is good for the health and is sometimes used medicinally by Koreans.

                 Stuffed Cabbage Pickle - {Bosam Kimchi}

Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Accompaniment                   Korean
                Pickles/Relishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  napa cabbage
  1                     korean radish - (abt 1 lb)
     1/2        gallon  cold water
  3             ounces  coarse salt
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  dried hot red chili flakes
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh ginger
  5                     scallions -- cut into 1" lengths
     1/4         pound  octopus -- cut very thin slices
  4                     chestnuts -- peeled, sliced thin
  1         tablespoon  pine nuts
  1           teaspoon  dried red chili threads

Remove and reserve 8 large outer cabbage leaves.  Cut the remainder of the cabbage horizontally into 1 1/2-inch pieces.  Set aside. 

Cut the unpeeled radish into 1-inch cubes, then cut each cube into 1/4-inch thick slices. 

Thoroughly mix the water and salt together.  Put the sliced cabbage leaves on top.  Pour enough of the brine over the vegetables to cover them, and weight the contents with a saucer to keep the vegetables under the brine.  Leave overnight in a cool place to wilt.  The next day drain it, discarding the brine.  Set aside the outer cabbage leaves. 

Mix together the fish sauce, chili flakes, garlic, ginger, scallions, octopus, chestnuts, pine nuts and red chili threads, then combine with the cabbage and radish pieces in a large bowl. 

Place 4 wilted cabbage leaves on a plate, arranging them one across the other to cover it.  Put half of the cabbage and radish mixture in the center of the leaves.  Fold the leaves over the mixture to enclose the contents and place in the glass container with the folded leaves underneath.  Do this for each bundle. 

A certain amount of liquid will accumulate during the next day (the kimchi juice) but if not enough to cover the cabbage, add more liquid.  (Mix 1 tablespoon fish sauce and 1 quart of water.)  Pour this over the kimchi and put a plate over all to press the kimchi under the liquid to keep if from deteriorating. 

The Bosam is best eaten 3 to 4 days after preparation.  It should be stored in a cool place. 

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

              Stuffed Cucumber Kimchee - {Oi Sobagi Kimchi}

Recipe By     :Katherine Heyhoe
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Korean
                Pickles/Relishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  cucumbers
  3        tablespoons  salt
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              piece  ginger - (abt 1") -- peeled and minced
  6                     green onions -- finely chopped
  1                     Korean radish or several red radishes -- julienned
  4        tablespoons  dried red chile powder
  1         tablespoon  sugar

Note:  You will need several sterilized jars for this recipe. 

If the cucumbers have wax on them, peel them.  Cut them in half width-wise.  Take each half then make two slits lengthwise at 90-degree angles to each other, cutting from the raw end almost to the base but not all the way through. 

Rub salt on all sides of the cucumbers.  Place cucumbers in a colander in the sink for 2 to 3 hours, or until wilted but still with some spring to them.  While the cucumbers are draining, make the stuffing. 

Stir together the garlic, ginger, green onion, radish, dried red chile powder and sugar. 

Heat a pot of boiling water.  After they have been salted and drained, quickly dip the cucumbers in the boiling water, swirl them around for 1 to 2 seconds to remove the excess salt, then plunge into ice water.  Wipe the cucumbers dry then press the stuffing into the slits. 

Place the cucumbers in the jars, cover tightly and let sit in a cool dark place for one day.  Serve chilled within two or three days, while still crisp. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Stuffed cucumber kimchi is one of those hot/cold dishes so welcomed on a sunny summer day.  Countries with hot climates use chiles in abundance, and Korea is no exception.  The heat from the chiles causes sweat, which cools the body as it evaporates, while the cold, crispness of the cucumbers refreshes.  Kimchi, by the way, can be made with cabbage, radishes and many other vegetables, but it always includes a hefty dose of red chiles.  It is the national dish of Korea, where no meal is served without at least one bowl of this spicy, condiment-like salad.

                       Stuffed Sausage - {Soonday}

Recipe By     :Copeland Marks, "The Korean Kitchen"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Korean                          Rice/Grains


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              piece  small beef intestine - (36" long)
  2               cups  rice -- cooked, still firm
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1              slice  fresh ginger - (1") -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black or white pepper
  1         tablespoon  Korean sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds -- crushed
  5                     scallions -- chopped
  2               cups  beef or pork blood
                        (or 8-oz canned tomato puree)

Comments:  In a number of cultures cooks stuff the small intestine of the cow, sheep or pig and boil, bake or roast it.  In Tunisia, this is known as "merguez", in Eastern Europe as "kishke", in Indonesia, it is the spectacular "usus" in coconut milk.  The "soonday" of Korea is entirely different. 

It originated in the cold climate of mountainous North Korea where the intestines of the wild mountain pigs were used.  Now it's prepared all over the country and brought in large buckets to the public markets of Pusan, Kyongu, Seoul, Taegu and elsewhere.  This sausage stuffing is made of rice, seasonings and beef or pork blood (or substitute 8 ounces canned tomato puree). 

Clean the intestine as received from your butcher once again.  Rinse well in cold water, then soak in lightly salted water for 1 hour; this makes the intestine firm and easier to handle.  Tie up one end firmly with cotton string. 

Prepare the stuffing.  Mix the cooked rice, garlic, ginger, salt, pepper, sesame oil, sesame seeds, scallions and either blood or tomato puree.  Loosely stuff the intestine either by machine or by a funnel -- forcing the stuffing along the entire length.  Do not fill too tightly since the intestine may split in cooking when the rice expands.  Tie the open end firmly. 

The intestine may also be stuffed as individual sausages in which case it is cut into the desired lengths, tied, filled and tied again. 

Place the soonday in a large pan, curling it around like a snail.  Cover it with lightly salted water and bring to a boil.  Then turn to low and cook uncovered for 3/4 hour.  At the end of this time, insert a skewer in the soonday to test for doneness.  As when testing a cake, if the skewer is dry and the soonday is firm to pressure, it is done. 

Cut diagonally into 1/4-inch thick slices and serve warm or at room temperature (warm is better).  Serve on festive occasions especially after the harvest of rice, cabbage (or whatever is being grown) with your favorite Korean dip. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Loosely stuff the intestine either by machine or by a funnel -- forcing the stuffing along the entire length.  Do not fill too tightly since the intestine may split in cooking when the rice expands.  Tie the open end firmly. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;The intestine may also be stuffed as individual sausages in which case it is cut into the desired lengths, tied, filled and tied again. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Place the soonday in a large pan, curling it around like a snail.  Cover it with lightly salted water and bring to a boil.  Then turn to low and cook uncovered for 3/4 hour.  At the end of this time, insert a skewer in the soonday to test for doneness.  As when testing a cake, if the skewer is dry and the soonday is firm to pressure, it is done. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Cut diagonally into 1/4-inch thick slices and serve warm or at room temperature (warm is better).  Serve on festive occasions especially after the harvest of rice, cabbage (or whatever is being grown) with your favorite Korean dip.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  6        tablespoons  rice or cider vinegar
     3/4          pint  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  toasted sesame seeds - (heaping)
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (1/2" long) -- peeled, crushed,
                        and finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  red pepper powder
  2          teaspoons  sugar

Comments:  Cho jang is an essential condiment of the Korean table, used as a dressing for vegetables, a dip for fried fish, meats, fritters, and dumplings, or simply as a flavouring ingredient.  Everybody has their own version, but do experiment to include more or less of those ingredients -- chillies, chopped garlic, sesame oil, fresh coriander -- whichever you like best.  Here is Halmoni's recipe for making a large batch to store and use as necessary.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Cho jang is an essential condiment of the Korean table, used as a dressing for vegetables, a dip for fried fish, meats, fritters, and dumplings, or simply as a flavouring ingredient.  Everybody has their own version, but do experiment to include more or less of those ingredients -- chillies, chopped garlic, sesame oil, fresh coriander -- whichever you like best.  Here is Halmoni&apos;s recipe for making a large batch to store and use as necessary.

  2             pounds  young Korean radish - (2" to 3" long)
     1/4           cup  salt -- plus

  2        tablespoons  flour
  3                     scallions -- shredded into thin
                        3"-long pieces
  1              whole  garlic head -- cloves peeled,
