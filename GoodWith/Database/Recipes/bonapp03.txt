  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  2          teaspoons  grated orange peel
  6               cups  coarsely-grated peeled Golden Delicious
                        apples - (abt 3 lbs)
  3        tablespoons  honey
                        Pastry Crust Dough -- (see recipe)
                        = (2 dough disks)
  1                     egg -- beaten for glaze

Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add sugar; stir until mixture turns deep golden, about 8 minutes.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean and orange peel.  Stir 1 minute.  Add apples.  Reduce heat to medium-low; cook until mixture is thick, golden and reduced to 2 1/4 cups, stirring often, about 40 minutes.  Mix in honey.  Cool to room temperature.  Discard vanilla bean.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Roll out 1 dough disk on floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer crust to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Trim dough overhang to 1/2 inch.  Fold overhang in and press, forming double-thick sides.  Spread filling evenly in crust.

Roll out second dough disk on floured surface to 12-inch round.  Cut into fourteen 3/4-inch-wide strips.  Arrange seven strips diagonally atop filling, trimming ends of strips at tart pan edges.  Form lattice by placing seven dough strips diagonally atop first seven strips; trim ends of strips at tart pan edges.  Brush lattice with egg glaze.

Bake galette until crust is golden, about 55 minutes.  Cool on rack.  Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A country-style fruit tart with a lattice top.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  whole milk
  1              piece  vanilla bean - (2" long) -- split lengthwise
  2              large  egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
                        Pastry Crust Dough -- (see recipe)
                        = (1 dough disk)
     1/2           cup  blanched whole almonds
     1/3           cup  powdered sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- room temperature
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
  1              pinch  salt
  3               cans  unpeeled apricot halves in heavy syrup -- well drained
                        = (15 1/4 oz ea),
  3        tablespoons  honey

Pour milk into small saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Bring to simmer.  Remove from heat.  Whisk yolks, 3 tablespoons sugar and cornstarch in bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk milk mixture into yolk mixture.  Return to pan.  Whisk over medium heat until custard thickens and boils, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to bowl; cool.  Discard vanilla bean.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Roll out pastry on floured surface to 14-inch round.  Transfer to 11-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Press crust into pan.  Trim edges to 1/2-inch overhang; fold in and press, forming double-thick sides.  Freeze crust until firm, about 20 minutes.  Bake until light golden, about 20 minutes.  Cool.  Maintain oven temperature.

Finely grind almonds and powdered sugar in processor.  Add cooled custard; blend using on/off turns.  Blend in butter, then whole egg, extract and salt.  Pour into crust; smooth top.  Arrange apricot halves, round-side up, atop filling.

Bake tart until filling is set and golden, about 45 minutes.  Remove from oven.  Drizzle honey over.  Return to oven for 3 minutes.  Cool completely in pan.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  In early summer, apricots are abundant in Provence; here, we've called for canned apricots, which are always available.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CUSTARD ===
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
  1              pinch  salt
  1 1/4           cups  whole milk
  2             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  dark rum
                        === CRUST ===
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
     1/4           cup  ice water -- or more if needed
                        === TO FINISH ===
  3             medium  bananas -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/3"-thick slices
  6        tablespoons  golden brown sugar
                        Whipped cream -- (optional)

For Custard:  Whisk egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch and salt in medium bowl to blend.  Bring milk to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Gradually whisk hot milk into yolk mixture.  Return mixture to saucepan.  Whisk over medium heat until custard thickens and boils, about 2 1/2 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and rum and whisk until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.  Transfer custard to bowl.  Place plastic wrap directly atop surface of custard.  Refrigerate overnight.

For Crust:  Blend all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons sugar and salt in processor.  Cut in chilled butter using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 1/4 cup ice water and process until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough together; divide into 6 equal balls.  Flatten each ball into disk.  Wrap each disk in plastic; refrigerate 30 minutes.

Roll out 1 dough disk to 7-inch round.  Transfer to 4 1/2-inch tartlet pan with removable bottom.  Trim dough overhang to 1/2 inch.  Fold overhang in, pressing and forming double-thick sides.  Pierce crust all over with fork.  Repeat with remaining 5 dough disks.  Freeze crusts 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake crusts until golden brown and baked through, piercing with fork if crusts bubble, about 40 minutes.  Cool completely in pans on rack.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Store airtight in tartlet pans at room temperature.)

Preheat broiler.  Divide custard equally among crusts (generous 1/4 cup for each).  Place banana slices decoratively atop each tartlet, covering custard completely.  Brush bananas lightly with water.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon brown sugar over bananas on each tartlet.  Broil just until sugar melts and bubbles, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Garnish with cream, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  In these sweet tartlets, sliced bananas are sprinkled with brown sugar and caramelized under the broiler.  Make the chocolate custard a day ahead to allow it to chill and thicken.

For Custard:  Whisk egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch and salt in medium bowl to blend.  Bring milk to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Gradually whisk hot milk into yolk mixture.  Return mixture to saucepan.  Whisk over medium heat until custard thickens and boils, about 2 1/2 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and rum and whisk until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.  Transfer custard to bowl.  Place plastic wrap directly atop surface of custard.  Refrigerate overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Crust:  Blend all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons sugar and salt in processor.  Cut in chilled butter using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 1/4 cup ice water and process until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough together; divide into 6 equal balls.  Flatten each ball into disk.  Wrap each disk in plastic; refrigerate 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out 1 dough disk to 7-inch round.  Transfer to 4 1/2-inch tartlet pan with removable bottom.  Trim dough overhang to 1/2 inch.  Fold overhang in, pressing and forming double-thick sides.  Pierce crust all over with fork.  Repeat with remaining 5 dough disks.  Freeze crusts 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake crusts until golden brown and baked through, piercing with fork if crusts bubble, about 40 minutes.  Cool completely in pans on rack.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Store airtight in tartlet pans at room temperature.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat broiler.  Divide custard equally among crusts (generous 1/4 cup for each).  Place banana slices decoratively atop each tartlet, covering custard completely.  Brush bananas lightly with water.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon brown sugar over bananas on each tartlet.  Broil just until sugar melts and bubbles, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Garnish with cream, if desired.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  In these sweet tartlets, sliced bananas are sprinkled with brown sugar and caramelized under the broiler.  Make the chocolate custard a day ahead to allow it to chill and thicken.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     rack baby back pork ribs - (1 3/4 to 2 lbs -- cut 2-rib sections
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/4      teaspoons  ground cumin
  1                cup  purchased barbecue sauce
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  minced red onion
  2        tablespoons  bourbon
  2          teaspoons  chili powder

Prepare barbecue (medium heat).  Sprinkle ribs with salt, pepper and 1/2 teaspoon cumin.  Place ribs, meaty-side up, on grill.  Cover and grill 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, mix barbecue sauce, cilantro, onion, bourbon, chili powder and remaining 3/4 teaspoon cumin in heavy small saucepan; bring to boil, stirring occasionally.  Place saucepan at edge of grill to keep sauce warm.

Turn ribs meaty-side down.  Cover and grill until cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Turn ribs over again; brush meaty side generously with sauce.  Cover and grill ribs until sauce sets thickly, about 3 minutes longer.

     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1                can  pure pumpkin puree - (15 oz)
  1                can  black beans -- drained - (15 oz)
  1                can  light unsweetened coconut milk - (14 oz)
  1                cup  canned vegetable broth
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  2          teaspoons  fresh lime juice
     3/4      teaspoon  grated lime peel
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Stir cumin in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat 30 seconds.  Add pumpkin, beans, coconut milk, broth and 3 tablespoons cilantro.  Bring soup to boil, stirring constantly.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 3 minutes to blend flavors.  Mix in lime juice and lime peel.  Season soup with salt and pepper.

Ladle soup into bowls.  Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon cilantro.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Start with vegetable sticks and dip from the supermarket.  Warm tortillas and a plate of sliced red onion, orange and avocado are nice sides.  To end, sprinkle rum and brown sugar over fresh pineapple chunks.  Look for the coconut milk in the Asian foods section of the grocery store.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pineapple -- peeled, halved
                        lengthwise, cored, each half cut
                        lengthwise into 9 wedges
  1                cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
                        Brown Sugar-Ginger Ice Cream -- (see recipe)
  6        tablespoons  sweetened flaked coconut -- toasted

Preheat broiler.  Line large baking sheet with foil.  Arrange pineapple wedges side by side in single layer on prepared baking sheet.  Pat pineapple wedges with paper towels to remove excess moisture.

Using fingertips, press 1 cup brown sugar through coarse sifter over pineapple.  Broil pineapple wedges until brown sugar caramelizes, watching closely to avoid burning and rotating baking sheet to broil evenly, about 3 minutes.

Arrange 3 wedges of warm caramel-ized pineapple in triangle on each of 6 plates.  Place scoop of Brown Sugar-Ginger Ice Cream in center of pineapple triangle.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon coconut over each dessert and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Broiled pineapple is teamed with an easy-to-make ice cream and topped with toasted coconut for a tropical treat.  The pineapple would also be good with purchased mango or coconut sorbet or with vanilla ice cream.

Comments:  Broiled pineapple is teamed with an easy-to-make ice cream and topped with toasted coconut for a tropical treat.  The pineapple would also be good with purchased mango or coconut sorbet or with vanilla ice cream.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              pints  chocolate or vanilla ice cream -- slightly softened
                        === BUTTERSCOTCH SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  dark corn syrup
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- diced
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === COOKIES ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  9        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick + 1 tbspn) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  semisweet chocolate chips - (abt 9 oz)

For Butterscotch Sauce:  Combine first 5 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over low heat until both sugars dissolve.  Increase heat and boil until large bubbles break on surface and sauce drops thickly from spoon, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat; whisk in cream and vanilla (mixture may bubble vigorously).  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover; chill.  Rewarm slightly over low heat before using.)

For Cookies:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides with parchment paper; butter paper.

Sift flour, baking soda and salt into small bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat butter and both sugars in large bowl until well blended.  Add egg and vanilla and beat until smooth.  Beat in flour mixture.  Stir in chocolate chips.  Drop half of dough by large spoonfuls into each prepared pan; spread evenly.  Bake cookies until light golden, about 18 minutes.  Cool cookies in pans on racks.  Carefully turn out cookies; peel off parchment.

Place 1 cookie, top-side up, in 9-inch springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Drizzle 1/4 cup sauce over.  Spread evenly with ice cream; drizzle with 1/2 cup sauce.  Top with remaining cookie, top-side up; press gently to adhere.  Drizzle with 2 tablespoons sauce.  Cover pan and freeze ice cream cake at least 5 hours.  Cover and chill remaining sauce.  (Cake and sauce can be prepared 3 days ahead.)

Cut around cake with small knife to loosen.  Release pan sides.  Let cake stand until ice cream is slightly softened, about 20 minutes.  Rewarm butterscotch sauce over low heat.  Cut cake into wedges; serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Hereís a party-size ice cream sandwich that everyone will love.  We use two 9-inch-diameter cake pans so that the cookies keep their round shape when baking.  And thereís no need for last-minute fuss; this can be made up to three days ahead.

Sift cake flour, baking soda and salt into medium bowl.  Stir cocoa and 1/2 cup water in large bowl until very thick paste forms.  Set aside.

Beat unsalted butter, sugar and brown sugar in another medium bowl until well blended.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Gradually add egg mixture to cocoa mixture, beating until mixture is smooth.  Beat in dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk in 2 additions each, beating well after each addition.

Divide batter between prepared pans.  Bake until tester inserted into center of cakes comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on rack 15 minutes.  Turn cakes out onto racks; peel off parchment.  Cool completely.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Wrap in plastic and store at room temperature.)

Using serrated knife, cut each cake horizontally in half (layers will be thin).  Using 9-inch tart pan bottom as aid, transfer 1 cake layer, cut-side up, to platter.  Spread generous 1/2 cup Chocolate-Chocolate Chip Cream Frosting over.  Repeat layering 2 more times, using 1 cake layer and generous 1/2 cup frosting for each layer.  Top with fourth cake layer, cut-side down.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake.  Sprinkle top with white and bittersweet chocolate shavings.  Chill at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours.  Slice cake.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Make this showstopping dessert even more stunning by garnishing it with fresh raspberries and mint sprigs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Yellow cornmeal
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  2               cups  fresh goat's milk or whole milk
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/4           cup  honey
  5        tablespoons  sugar
  4              large  eggs -- separated
                        Black Cherry Compote -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 9- by 5- by 2 1/2-inch metal loaf pan.  Dust with cornmeal; tap out excess.

Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into heavy medium saucepan; add bean.  Add milk, butter, lemon peel and salt.  Bring to simmer, stirring until butter melts.  Remove from heat.  Gradually whisk in 1 cup cornmeal.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Mix in honey and 3 tablespoons sugar.  Cool to just lukewarm, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Discard vanilla bean.  Whisk in yolks.

Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl until foamy.  Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons sugar over whites and beat until medium-soft peaks form.  Gently fold whites into cornmeal mixture in 2 additions.  Pour batter into prepared pan.

Bake cake until top cracks and tester inserted into center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 45 minutes.  Cool cake in pan on rack (cake will fall in center).  Turn out onto plate.  Using sharp serrated knife, cut cake into 3/4-inch-thick slices.  Place 1 slice on each plate.  Top with Black Cherry Compote.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Traditionally, this cake -- a Christmas specialty of the town of SÈguret in the Vaucluse -- is made with goat's milk (look for it in the supermarket dairy case), but feel free to use cow's milk.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     russet potato - (8 to 9 oz) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  6              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  olive oil (preferably extra-virgin)
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  whole-grain Dijon mustard
  4        tablespoons  minced smoked salmon - (abt 1 oz)
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped green onions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cook potato in pot of boiling salted water until very tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain.  Cool potato.

Meanwhile, place eggs in medium saucepan; cover with water.  Bring to boil.  Cover; remove from heat and let stand 15 minutes.  Drain.  Rinse eggs with cold water until cool.  Peel off shells.  Halve eggs lengthwise.  Reserve 3 egg yolks for another use.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1            package  chocolate wafer cookies - (9 oz) -- coarsely broken
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  1            package  frozen unsweetened raspberries - (12 oz) -- thawed, and
                        juices reserved
  6             ounces  good-quality white chocolate -- finely chopped
  4           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
                        White chocolate curls -- (optional)

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Double-wrap outside of pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil.  Place cookies in processor and blend until coarse crumbs form.  Add butter and process until evenly moistened.  Press crumb mixture firmly onto bottom and halfway up sides of prepared pan.  Bake crust 8 minutes; cool on rack.

For Filling:  Press raspberries and juices through fine strainer into small bowl.  Measure 1/2 cup puree for filling (reserve remaining puree for another use).  Stir white chocolate in small metal bowl set over saucepan of barely simmering water until just melted and smooth; set aside.

Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar in large bowl until smooth and fluffy.  Beat in flour, then eggs, 1 at a time.  Beat in whipping cream and vanilla.  Transfer 2 1/4 cups batter to medium bowl; stir in melted white chocolate.  Stir reserved 1/2 cup raspberry puree and almond extract into remaining batter in large bowl.

Pour raspberry batter into prepared crust; place springform pan in large roasting pan.  Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come 1 inch up sides of pan.  Bake until raspberry filling is softly set in center and beginning to puff at edges, about 50 minutes.  Remove roasting pan from oven; let raspberry layer cool 5 minutes to firm slightly.

Starting at edge of pan, spoon white chocolate batter in concentric circles onto raspberry layer.  Smooth top.  Bake until white chocolate filling is set in center, about 30 minutes.  Refrigerate cake uncovered until cold, at least 4 hours.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead; cover and keep refrigerated.)

Cut around pan sides with small knife to loosen cheesecake; release sides.  Garnish cheesecake with white chocolate curls, if desired.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3              large  plum tomatoes -- quartered
  4             ounces  crimini mushrooms -- quartered

                        Yellow cornmeal

* Note:  A dried herb mixture available at specialty foods stores and in the spice section of some supermarkets.  A combination of dried thyme, basil, savory and fennel seeds can be substituted.

Pour 1 1/2 cups warm water into large bowl; sprinkle yeast over.  Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 10 minutes.  Stir in 1 cup flour, 1 tablespoon herbes de Provence and sea salt, then 2 tablespoons oil until well blended.  Mix in enough flour, 1 cup at a time, to form thick and slightly sticky dough.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Form into ball.  Oil large bowl.  Add dough; turn to coat.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap, then towel.  Let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled, about 1 hour.

Position 1 rack in center and 1 rack in top third of oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Sprinkle 2 baking sheets generously with cornmeal.  Punch dough down.  Turn out onto floured surface; divide in half.  Press out each half to 11- by 8-inch irregularly shaped oval.  Transfer to prepared baking sheets.

Brush each oval with 1 tablespoon oil.  Sprinkle each with 1 1/2 teaspoons herbes de Provence.  Using sharp knife, make several 2-inch-long cuts in each oval (do not cut through edges), spacing cuts evenly apart and cutting through dough to work surface.  Pull dough apart at cuts to create openings.  Cover loosely with plastic; let rise in warm draft-free area until slightly puffed, about 20 minutes.

Place dough in oven.  Immediately pour about 1/4 cup water onto bottom of oven, creating steam.  Bake breads until golden on top and slightly crisp on bottom, switching sheets between racks and turning front of each sheet to back of oven halfway through baking, about 18 minutes.  Transfer sheets to racks; cool breads 10 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 2 breads.

              Grilled Cheddar, Mustard And Chive Sandwiches

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  regular or light mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh chives or green onions
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8             slices  country-style white bread, 5" x 4" x 1/2" 
  8             ounces  sharp cheddar cheese -- grated
  4        tablespoons  butter - (1/2 stick)

Mix mayonnaise, chives and Dijon mustard in small bowl.  Season with generous amount of pepper.  Spread 1 side of each bread slice with mayonnaise mixture.  Divide cheddar cheese among 4 bread slices, then top with remaining bread, mayonnaise-side down.

Preheat oven to 250 degrees.  Melt 2 tablespoons butter in griddle or heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add 2 sandwiches; turn to coat with butter.  Cook until golden on each side and cheese melts, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer to baking sheet.  Keep warm in oven.  Repeat with remaining 2 tablespoons butter and remaining sandwiches.

This recipe yields 4 sandwiches.

Comments:  Some interesting food folklore: In his desperation to stay at the gambling table and assuage his hunger at the same time, Englishman John Montagu, the fourth Earl of Sandwich, asked his manservant to bring him two pieces of bread with some meat in between, thereby inventing -- need we say more?

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     lamb shanks - (12 to 16 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  4             medium  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4"-thick rounds
  2 1/2           cups  chopped onions
  1 1/2           cups  sliced celery
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  dried rosemary
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (28 oz)
  2               cups  water
  2               cups  dry red wine
  1              piece  orange peel - (3" by 1") -- orange part only
  12                    baby red-skinned potatoes
  6             medium  carrots -- peeled,
                        and cut into 2" pieces
  6             medium  parsnips -- peeled,
                        and cut into 2" pieces
     1/2           cup  Kalamata olives -- pitted

Sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper.  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, cook lamb until brown, about 8 minutes.  Transfer to large bowl.

Reduce heat to medium.  Add carrot rounds, onions and celery to pot.  SautÈ until vegetables are tender and golden, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic, rosemary and oregano.  SautÈ 1 minute.  Stir in tomatoes with juices, 2 cups water, wine and orange peel.  Return lamb to pot, pressing to submerge.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to low.  Cover; simmer until lamb is just tender, about 2 hours 15 minutes.

Add potatoes, 2-inch carrot pieces, parsnips and olives to pot.  Simmer uncovered until vegetables are tender and lamb is very tender, about 30 minutes longer.  Using slotted spoon, transfer lamb and vegetables to platter.  Boil juices in pot until thickened enough to coat spoon, about 5 minutes.  Discard orange peel.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.

Spoon sauce over lamb and vegetables and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A full-bodied Merlot would go well with this impressive Mediterranean-style dish.  For an appetizer, offer melba toast spread with blue cheese; pass hot crusty bread with the shanks; and complete the supper with a simple green salad.  Afterward, break out a lemon meringue pie from the bakery.

Add sugar; simmer until mixture is reduced to 1/3 cup, about 3 minutes.  Stir in cream.  Whisk yolks to blend in medium bowl.  Gradually whisk in hot cream mixture.  Whisk in lemon juice.

Strain custard through sieve into 4-cup measuring cup.  Divide among six 2-cup ramekins or soufflÈ dishes.  Cover ramekins with foil.  Place ramekins in 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan.  Add enough hot water to pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.

Bake custards until just set, about 45 minutes.  Remove pan from oven; let custards cool in water in pan.  Transfer ramekins to refrigerator.  Chill at least 4 hours or overnight.  Serve chilled.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Often used to make herb tea and liqueurs in Provence, the fragrant herb lemon verbena gives a nice lift to these rich, silky lemon custards.  Look for fresh lemon verbena at farmers' markets and nurseries; dried lemon verbena can be found at specialty foods stores.

Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR CRUST ===
     1/3           cup  almonds - (abt 2 oz)
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
                        === FOR FILLING ===
     2/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  crËme fraÓche or sour cream
  4              large  eggs
                        Lemon slices -- (optional)

Make crust:  Finely grind almonds in processor.  Add flour, sugar and salt and process until blended.  Add butter and process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  With machine running, add ice water, 1 tablespoonful at a time, and blend until moist clumps form, adding more water if dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic; chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Roll out dough on floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Fold dough overhang in, pressing to adhere and forming double-thick sides.  Pierce dough all over with fork.  Freeze 20 minutes.

Bake crust until set and light golden, piercing with fork if crust bubbles, about 30 minutes.  Cool crust on rack 15 minutes.  Maintain oven temperature.

Make filling:  Whisk lemon juice and sugar in medium bowl to blend.  Whisk in crËme fraÓche.  Whisk in eggs 1 at a time until well blended.  Pour mixture into crust.

Bake tart until filling is set, covering crust edges with foil if browning too quickly, about 35 minutes.  Cool tart completely in pan on rack.  Refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

Remove pan sides.  Garnish tart with lemon slices, if desired.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                   Lentil Soup With Roasted Vegetables

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     eggplant - (1 to 1 1/4 lbs) -- unpeeled, and
                        quartered lengthwise
  4              large  plum tomatoes -- quartered lengthwise
  1              large  onion -- cut into 8 wedges
     1/2         large  green bell pepper -- quartered, seeded
  4              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  5               cups  water -- or more if needed
  1 1/4           cups  dried brown lentils
  4          teaspoons  ground cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  plain nonfat yogurt

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Arrange first 5 ingredients on large nonstick baking sheet.  Drizzle with oil.  Roast vegetables 20 minutes.  Turn vegetables over and roast until tender and brown around edges, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes longer.  Cool slightly (do not clean baking sheet).

Scoop eggplant pulp from peel into processor; discard peel.  Add onion and garlic to processor; purÈe until smooth.  Transfer eggplant mixture to large saucepan.  Coarsely chop tomatoes and bell pepper; combine in small bowl.

Add 1 cup water to baking sheet; stir to scrape up any browned bits.  Add to saucepan with eggplant mixture.  Add 4 cups water, lentils and cumin and bring to boil.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer until lentils are almost tender, about 30 minutes.  Mix in all but 1/4 cup tomato and bell pepper mixture.  Simmer uncovered until lentils are very tender, thinning with more water if soup is too thick, about 10 minutes longer.  Season with salt and pepper.

Ladle soup into bowls.  Drizzle large spoonful of yogurt over each.  Top with remaining 1/4 cup tomato and bell pepper mixture and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  Masa Harina (corn tortilla mix) -- see * Note*
  1              pound  pork chorizo sausage -- casings removed
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  14             large  eggs
  4        tablespoons  corn oil - (about)
                        === CHIPOTLE RANCHERA SALSA ===
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
     1/4           cup  crumbled queso aÒejo or
                        shredded Monterey Jack cheese

* Note:  Available at Latin American markets and many supermarkets.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spread Masa Harina on heavy baking sheet.  Bake until fragrant and golden, stirring often, about 15 minutes.  Cool Masa Harina.  Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees.

Cook chorizo in heavy large skillet over medium heat until brown, breaking up with back of fork, about 10 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer chorizo to paper-towel-lined plate to drain.  Transfer sausage to oven.

Sift Masa Harina, flour and next 5 ingredients into large bowl.  Whisk buttermilk, 2 eggs and 3 tablespoons oil in medium bowl to blend.  Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients and whisk just until blended (batter will be thick).

Lightly coat griddle with oil.  Heat over medium heat.  Working in batches, spoon scant 1/2 cup batter onto griddle.  Using spoon, spread batter to make 4-inch-diameter pancake.  Cook until bottom is golden, about 4 minutes.  Turn and cook until second side is golden, about 3 minutes.  Transfer to baking sheet; place in oven.  Repeat to make 6 pancakes total, brushing griddle with oil as needed.

Meanwhile, bring large skillet of salted water to simmer.  Working in batches, crack 12 eggs into skillet.  Simmer until eggs are softly poached, about 3 minutes.  Remove eggs from water; drain.

Divide pancakes among plates.  Sprinkle chorizo around pancakes.  Top each pancake with 2 eggs.  Spoon salsa over eggs.  Top with cilantro, onions and cheese.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The Masa Harina adds a pleasant flavor to the light and fluffy pancakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  poblano chilies
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4 1/2           cups  frozen corn kernels
  1                     jalapeÒo chile - (to 2) -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano
  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (14 1/2 oz) -- drained,
                        and 3/4 cup of the juice reserved
     3/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     butternut squash - (abt 2 lbs) -- peeled, halved
                        lengthwise, cut crosswise 1/2"-thick slice
  1 1/2           cups  shredded sharp cheddar cheese
  1 1/2           cups  shredded Monterey Jack cheese
  7               cups  water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2               cups  yellow cornmeal
  1                cup  plain yogurt
  2                     tomatoes -- sliced
                        Fresh cilantro sprigs

Roast poblano chilies over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose chilies in paper bag.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Peel, seed and coarsely chop chilies.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add corn kernels and cook until beginning to brown, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Add jalapeÒo chilies, garlic, cumin and oregano; sautÈ 2 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Mix in roasted poblano chilies, canned tomatoes, 1/2 cup reserved juice from canned tomatoes, green onions and cilantro.  Season with salt and pepper.

Cook squash in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.  Drain.  Set aside.  Mix cheeses in medium bowl.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil 15- by 10- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Combine 5 cups water and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in heavy large saucepan.  Bring to boil.  Combine cornmeal and remaining 2 cups water in medium bowl.  Gradually whisk cornmeal mixture into boiling salted water.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cook until cornmeal is very tender and mixture is thick, stirring often, about 14 minutes.  Remove from heat and mix in yogurt.

Spread 2/3 of cornmeal over bottom of prepared dish (cover remaining cornmeal to keep warm).  Arrange squash over cornmeal in dish.  Sprinkle squash with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle 2 cups cheese over squash.  Spoon corn kernel mixture evenly over cheese, spreading with spatula.  Spread remaining cornmeal evenly over corn kernel mixture.  Arrange tomato slices atop cornmeal, pressing gently.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Drizzle remaining 1/4 cup juice from canned tomatoes over.  Sprinkle remaining cheese evenly over casserole.

Bake casserole uncovered until heated through and top is golden, about 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm, covered with foil, in 350 degrees oven until heated through, about 30 minutes.)

Let casserole stand 15 minutes.  Garnish with cilantro sprigs and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Margaritas and some guacamole with chips and/or vegetable "dippers" would start this Mexican-style dinner off right.  Ladle out black bean soup to precede the tamale pie, and serve a Caesar salad with it.  Finish by teaming lime sorbet with orange segments that have been marinated in tequila.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bag frozen pitted dark sweet cherries (16  -- halved, thawed,
                        and undrained
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  kirsch (clear cherry brandy) or
                        regular brandy
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut small pieces
  2              large  egg yolks
  1              large  egg
  2          teaspoons  all-purpose flour
                        Powdered sugar
                        Fresh mint

Combine cherries with juices, 1/2 cup sugar, kirsch, and cinnamon in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Simmer until sauce thickens and is slightly reduced, about 10 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, remove 1/4 cup cherries from sauce; drain well.  Transfer to work surface and chop coarsely; reserve chopped cherries for cakes.  Set aside cherry sauce.

Butter two 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups.  Whisk cocoa and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in small bowl to blend.  Stir chocolate and butter in heavy small saucepan over low heat until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.  Remove from heat; whisk in cocoa mixture.  Whisk in egg yolks, then whole egg and flour.  Fold in reserved 1/4 cup chopped cherries.  Divide batter between prepared ramekins.  (Sauce and cake batter can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately; chill.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake cakes uncovered until edges are set but center is still shiny and tester inserted into center comes out with some wet batter attached, about 22 minutes.

Warm sauce over low heat.  Cut around cakes to loosen; turn out onto plates.  Spoon sauce alongside.  Sift powdered sugar over; garnish with mint.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Try any leftover sauce on ice cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
  1              pound  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, caps sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8               cups  one-inch pieces Wonder Bread or
                        other white bread - (packed) -- abt 12 slices
  2 1/4           cups  whole milk
  1 1/2           cups  half-and-half
  5              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  chopped fresh chives or green onion tops
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  9             ounces  soft fresh goat cheese, such as Montrachet -- crumbled
  1 1/2           cups  grated Parmesan cheese - (packed) -- abt 4 oz
  1                cup  grated Fontina cheese - (packed) -- abt 4 oz

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms and sautÈ until tender, about 8 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cool.

Combine bread and milk in large bowl.  Let stand until milk is absorbed, about 15 minutes.

Whisk half-and-half and next 6 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Stir in goat cheese.

Place half of bread mixture in single layer in prepared glass baking dish (bread will not cover bottom of baking dish).  Top with half each of mushrooms, Parmesan cheese, Fontina cheese, and half-and-half mixture.  Repeat layering with remaining bread, mushrooms, Parmesan and Fontina cheeses, and half-and-half mixture.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Bake strata uncovered until firm in center, puffed and golden, about 1 hour.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  When Wonder Bread hit the market in Indianapolis in 1921, it truly was a wonder: The loaves were larger than the ones Americans were accustomed to, and the revolutionary plastic packaging and addition of preservatives prolonged the breadís shelf life.  In 1930, pre-sliced loaves became available, changing the world of sandwiches forever.  Sliced Wonder Bread is also great in this strata; its spongy texture is perfect for soaking up the eggs and milk.

                             Nacho Cheese Dip

Categories    : Appetizers                      Dips/Spreads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  beer
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
  1                can  refried beans - (16 oz)
     1/2           cup  purchased chunky hot salsa
  1            package  Velveeta cheese - (16 oz) -- cut into 1/2" pieces
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
                        Tortilla chips

Combine beer, cumin, dried oregano and garlic powder in heavy medium sauce-pan.  Bring to simmer.  Add beans and salsa; stir until heated through.  Add Velveeta cheese; stir until cheese melts, about 3 minutes.  Stir in cilantro.  Transfer to bowl.  Serve warm with tortilla chips.

This recipe yields about 4 cups.

Comments:  Kraft introduced Velveeta in 1928, and its special cooking properties quickly caught on: When melted, it was as smooth as velvet (hence the name), and it would never curdle when heated.  While many Americans today prefer regional or handmade cheeses, a lot of them still secretly indulge in a little Velveeta.  After all, Grandmaís macaroni and cheese would never be the same without it.  Velveeta makes this dip unbelievably creamy, too; scoop it up with tortilla chips, or try it in tacos.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  hard-boiled eggs -- peeled
     1/4           cup  chopped red onion
  5        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  alfalfa sprouts or radish sprouts
  2                     large slices multi-grain bread -- toasted

Place eggs in large bowl; mash coarsely with back of fork.  Mix in onion, mayonnaise, mustard and thyme.  Season salad with salt and pepper.  Mound salad, then sprouts on bread, dividing equally.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  This knife-and-fork sandwich is terrific with potato chips, pickles and marinated vegetables from a market salad bar or the deli.  Brownies ‡ la mode are a delicious finish.

                            Oreo Overkill Pie

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Pies


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  20                    Oreo cookies
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1              quart  cookies and cream ice cream -- slightly softened
  1              large  banana -- peeled, sliced thin
                        Purchased hot fudge sauce

Finely grind cookies in processor.  Transfer 2 tablespoons cookie crumbs to small bowl; reserve.  Add melted butter to remaining crumbs in processor; blend until moist crumbs form.  Press crumb mixture onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter metal pie pan.  Freeze crust until firm, about 10 minutes.

Spread half of ice cream in crust.  Top with banana slices.  Spread remaining ice cream over.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons cookie crumbs over pie.  Freeze until firm, about 4 hours.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover; freeze.)  Serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Oreos have been popular since Nabisco introduced them in 1912, and they are still the best-selling cookie in the world.  There are those folks who twist the cookies apart and eat the filling first, and those who dunk the entire Oreo into a big glass of ice-cold milk.  In this recipe, Oreos make a great pie crust that's filled with cookies and cream ice cream.  Die-hard fans won't think this dessert is overkill at all.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  purchased teriyaki sauce -- plus
  4          teaspoons  purchased teriyaki sauce
  1                     sirloin steak abt 1" thick - (8 to 10 oz)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  dark brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lime peel
                        Salt -- to taste
  2               cups  shredded Napa or other green cabbage
     1/2           cup  very thinly sliced red onion
  2        tablespoons  slivered fresh mint

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Spoon 2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce onto plate.  Add steak; turn to coat.  Sprinkle steak with pepper; let stand 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, whisk oil, lime juice, dark brown sugar, grated lime peel and remaining 4 teaspoons teriyaki sauce in small bowl to blend.  Season dressing with salt and pepper.  Transfer half of dressing to medium bowl; mix in cabbage, red onion and mint.  Divide mixture between 2 plates.

Grill sirloin steak until cooked to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Transfer steak to cutting board; slice thinly.  Arrange steak slices atop cabbage mixture.  Drizzle remaining dressing and any steak juices on board over each salad and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Take-out sushi is the ideal starter for this meal, and purchased sesame noodles sprinkled with chopped peanuts go perfectly with the main course.  Serving mini-scoops of refreshing fruit sorbets -- like lemon, peach and boysenberry -- with fortune cookies would be a really cool finish.

                   Pear And Sweet Wine Gelatin Parfaits

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  sparkling white grape-flavored Jell-O -- (6 oz)
  1 1/4           cups  sweet Muscat wine, such as Quady Essensia
                        = (or other sweet dessert wine)
     1/2           cup  water
  2 1/2           cups  seltzer or club soda
  2              large  ripe pears -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- (optional)

Place Jell-O in large bowl.  Bring 1 cup Muscat and 1/2 cup water to boil in medium saucepan.  Pour over Jell-O in bowl; stir until dissolved, about 2 minutes.  Cool to room temperature, whisking occasionally.  Stir in seltzer (mixture will be foamy).  Refrigerate until Jell-O is set, at least 6 hours or overnight.

Mix chopped pears and remaining 1/4 cup Muscat in small bowl.  Spoon half of Jell-O into 4 wine goblets or parfait glasses, dividing equally.  Top with pear mixture, then remaining Jell-O.  Garnish with mint sprigs, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Jell-O has been glimmering and shimmering since 1897, and it took America by storm during the 1920s: That was the era for molded salads and desserts.  Jell-O has been a staple in the American pantry since then, and in 1997, in celebration of its hundred-year anniversary, the company brought out a sparkling white grape flavor that is mixed with seltzer rather than water, giving it an appealing spritz.  Here weíve added sweet Muscat wine, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR CRUST ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  water -- or more if needed
                        === FOR FILLING ===
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2 1/2         pounds  onions -- thinly sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1              small  bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  drained capers
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  20                    NiÁois olives
  16                    anchovy fillets

Make crust:  Mix flour and salt in processor.  Add butter and oil.  Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Using on/off turns, mix in enough water 1 tablespoon at a time to form moist clumps.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill at least 2 hours.

Make filling:  Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat.  Add onions, garlic, bay leaf and thyme; stir to blend.  Cover and cook until onions are very tender, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.  Uncover and sautÈ until most liquid evaporates and onions are golden, about 10 minutes longer.  Stir in capers.  Season mixture with salt and pepper.  Cool completely; discard bay leaf.  (Dough and filling can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Keep dough chilled.  Cover and chill filling.  Let dough soften slightly at room temperature before rolling out.)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Lightly oil large baking sheet.  Roll out dough on floured surface to 11-inch round.  Transfer dough to prepared sheet.  Crimp edges of dough to form stand-up border.  Spread filling evenly over dough.  Arrange olives and anchovies decoratively atop filling.

Bake pissaladiËre until crust is crisp and golden, about 30 minutes.  Transfer to platter and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  center-cut pork loin, 1/3"-thick
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  canned low-salt chicken broth
  6                     fresh ripe figs -- quartered
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper.  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 4 pork slices and sautÈ until brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer pork to baking sheet.  Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to skillet.  Repeat with remaining 4 pork slices.  Transfer pork to oven to keep warm.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shallots and sautÈ until tender, about 2 minutes.  Add 2 tablespoons vinegar.  Simmer until vinegar evaporates, scraping up any browned bits on bottom of skillet, about 1 minute.  Add chicken broth.  Simmer until mixture is reduced by half, about 4 minutes.  Add figs and whipping cream.  Simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 4 minutes.  Add remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar and any accumulated juices from pork.  Simmer until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, about 2 minutes longer.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Arrange pork on plates.  Spoon sauce over.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In this entrÈe, balsamic vinegar gives tartness to a cream sauce that balances nicely with the pork and figs.  SautÈed spinach or chard would go well with the dish.

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper.  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 4 pork slices and sautÈ until brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer pork to baking sheet.  Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to skillet.  Repeat with remaining 4 pork slices.  Transfer pork to oven to keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shallots and sautÈ until tender, about 2 minutes.  Add 2 tablespoons vinegar.  Simmer until vinegar evaporates, scraping up any browned bits on bottom of skillet, about 1 minute.  Add chicken broth.  Simmer until mixture is reduced by half, about 4 minutes.  Add figs and whipping cream.  Simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 4 minutes.  Add remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar and any accumulated juices from pork.  Simmer until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, about 2 minutes longer.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange pork on plates.  Spoon sauce over.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  In this entrÈe, balsamic vinegar gives tartness to a cream sauce that balances nicely with the pork and figs.  SautÈed spinach or chard would go well with the dish.

  1                     bone-in leg of lamb - (6 to 7 lbs) -- excess fat trimmed

  2          teaspoons  minced fresh savory
                        = (or 1 tspn dried savory)
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh rosemary
                        = (or 3/4 tspn dried rosemary)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3 1/2         pounds  russet potatoes -- unpeeled, and
                        cut into 1/4"-thick rounds
  2 1/2         pounds  onions -- thinly sliced

Thinly slice lamb.  Arrange lamb on large platter.  Surround with potato mixture and any juices from pan and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16             whole  graham crackers - (abt 8 oz)
  1                cup  whole almonds -- toasted
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted
  1 1/2         quarts  coffee ice cream -- softened until
                        spreadable
                        Fudge Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1                jar  marshmallow creme - (7 oz)
  2               cups  miniature marshmallows

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Finely grind graham crackers, toasted almonds and 3 tablespoons sugar in processor.  Add 1/2 cup melted butter; process mixture until moist crumbs form.  Press graham cracker mixture onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Bake crust until edges are golden, about 12 minutes.  Cool graham cracker crust completely.

Spread 2 cups softened ice cream in crust.  Spoon 3/4 cup cooled Fudge Sauce over.  Freeze until sauce is just set, about 10 minutes.  Refrigerate or freeze remaining ice cream as necessary to prevent ice cream from melting.  Repeat layering with 2 cups ice cream, then 3/4 cup sauce.  Freeze until sauce is just set.  Spread remaining 2 cups ice cream over.  Cover and freeze cake overnight.  Refrigerate remaining Fudge Sauce.

Preheat broiler.  Warm remaining Fudge Sauce in small saucepan over low heat.  Remove from heat.  Place cake in pan on baking sheet.  Spread marshmallow creme over top of cake.  Sprinkle miniature marshmallows over in single layer.  Broil just until marshmallows are deep brown, watching closely to avoid burning, about 1 minute.

Run knife between pan sides and cake to loosen.  Remove pan sides.  Cut cake into wedges.  Serve cake immediately with warm Fudge Sauce.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  A decadent, impressive dessert that appeals to everyone's inner Boy Scout or Girl Scout.  Begin preparing this a day ahead.

Transfer to oven; bake until pork is tender, about 1 hour.  Maintain oven temperature.

Using slotted spoon, transfer 1 cup beans and vegetables from pot to processor and purÈe.  Return purÈe to pot.  Stir in wine.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Refrigerate uncovered until cool, then cover and refrigerate.  Bring cassoulet to simmer before continuing.)

Smooth top of cassoulet.  Mix breadcrumbs, Parmesan and oil in bowl.  Sprinkle half of crumb mixture over cassoulet.  Arrange bell pepper atop crumb mixture.  Sprinkle with remaining crumb mixture.  Bake cassoulet uncovered until pork and beans are very tender and topping is golden and crisp, about 45 minutes.

Garnish cassoulet with parsley.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  To begin, offer a bowl of brine-cured green and black olives, another of marinated artichoke hearts, and some p‚tÈ and toast.  The cassoulet needs only red wine and a loaf of good French bread as accompaniments.  A pear or apple tart would add an appropriate French country flourish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  black beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained well
  1                can  golden hominy - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained well
  1                     avocado -- peeled, pitted,
                        and diced
  1                cup  diced yellow bell pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped red onion
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced seeded jalapeÒo chili
     1/2           cup  salsa verde -- or more if needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2                     sheets phyllo pastry
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1 1/2           cups  water -- plus
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
  2 3/4         pounds  tart green apples -- peeled, cored
                        and sliced 1/3" thick
     1/4           cup  bourbon
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  pomegranate molasses -- see * Note

* Note:  A thick pomegranate syrup, available at Middle Eastern markets and some supermarkets.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Mix 2 tablespoons sugar and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon in small bowl.  Place 1 phyllo sheet on work surface.  Brush with half of melted butter.  Sprinkle with half of cinnamon sugar.  Top with second phyllo sheet.  Brush with remaining butter.  Sprinkle with remaining cinnamon sugar.

Cut phyllo lengthwise in half; place 1 half atop other.  Cut phyllo crosswise into 3 squares.  Cut each square into 4 triangles for a total of 12 triangles.  Place triangles on large baking sheet.  Bake until deep golden, about 8 minutes.  Cool on sheet.

Stir 1/2 cup sugar, 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 cup water and allspice in large saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and bring to boil.  Add apples; reduce heat and simmer until tender, stirring often, about 15 minutes.  Mix in bourbon.

Mix cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water in small bowl; add to apple mixture and stir until liquid thickens slightly and mixture boils, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  (Phyllo triangles and apple mixture can be prepared 4 hours ahead.  Cover separately.  Let stand at room temperature.  Rewarm apple mixture over low heat before using.)

Stir 1/2 cup water and brown sugar in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil until slightly reduced, about 6 minutes.  Add pomegranate molasses and boil until syrupy, about 4 minutes.  Cool.  Place 1 phyllo triangle on each of 6 plates.  Top each with warm apple mixture.  Top each with another phyllo triangle.  Drizzle pomegranate sauce over.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  20                    uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- pressed
     1/2      teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
  20             large  snow peas -- stringed
  1           teaspoon  oriental sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame seeds -- toasted
  2        tablespoons  reduced-sodium soy sauce

Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shrimp mixture and sautÈ 3 minutes.  Add soy sauce; stir until shrimp are just opaque in center and liquid evaporates, about 1 minute.  Transfer to plate and cool completely.

Wrap 1 snow pea lengthwise around each shrimp from head to tail.  Secure with skewers.  (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)  Serve slightly chilled or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 20.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  3        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
  2             pounds  firm but ripe pears - (abt 5 med) -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 3/4" pieces
  9        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  orange juice
  1              pinch  salt
  2 1/4           cups  frozen blueberries
  6        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        Walnut-Streusel Topping -- (see recipe)

For Crust:  Blend all-purpose flour, sugar and salt in processor.  Add chilled butter pieces and cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 3 tablespoons ice water and process until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 30 minutes.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Let soften slightly at room temperature before rolling out.)

Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Fold edges under, forming high-standing rim 3/4 inch above dish sides; crimp edges decoratively.  Freeze crust 25 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake crust until light golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Cool while preparing filling.  Maintain oven temperature.

For Filling:  Combine pear pieces, 3 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons orange juice and salt in large nonstick skillet.  Cook over medium heat until pears are tender but still hold their shape, stirring often, about 6 minutes.  Transfer pear mixture to large bowl; cool to room temperature.

Add blueberries, flour and remaining 6 tablespoons sugar to pears; toss gently to blend.  Transfer filling to cooled pie crust, mounding filling slightly in center.  Sprinkle with Walnut-Streusel Topping.  Bake pie until juices bubble thickly, fruit is tender and streusel topping is golden brown, about 1 hour 5 minutes.  Cool pie on rack until lukewarm.  Cut pie into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Serve this slightly warm or at room temperature.  Either way, it's fantastic with a dollop of sweetened whipped cream.

                Tagliatelle With Mussels, Clams And Pesto

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    littleneck clams -- scrubbed
  12                    mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
  1                cup  dry white wine
  8             ounces  tagliatelle or linguine
  6        tablespoons  purchased pesto
     1/4           cup  sliced drained oil-packed sun-dried
                        tomatoes
     1/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine clams, mussels and wine in heavy large pot; bring to boil over medium-high heat.  Cover pot; cook until shellfish open, about 7 minutes (discard any that do not open).  Using tongs, transfer shellfish to bowl; cover with foil to keep warm.  Reserve shellfish juices.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in medium pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.

Drain pasta; return to same pot.  Add reserved shellfish juices, pesto, sun-dried tomatoes and crushed red pepper.  Toss over medium heat just until sauce coats pasta.  Season with salt and pepper.

Divide pasta between 2 bowls; top with shellfish and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Crusty Italian bread and mixed greens with a red wine vinaigrette are good with the pasta.  Afterward, put out big strawberries and bowls of mascarpone cheese (or sour cream) and brown sugar for dipping.

Categories    : Desserts                        Ice Cream


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === NOUGAT FLAVOR ===
  5        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/3           cup  whole almonds -- toasted
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
                        === HONEY-SAFFRON FLAVOR ===
  3        tablespoons  water
     1/4      teaspoon  saffron threads - (scant)
  6        tablespoons  honey
                        === LAVENDER FLAVOR ===
     1/4           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  fresh or dried lavender blossoms
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  honey
                        === ICE CREAM BASE ===
  4               cups  whipping cream
  2               cups  whole milk
  10             large  egg yolks
                        === FOR ASSEMBLY ===
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar - (packed)
  1              pinch  salt

For Nougat Flavor:  Butter baking sheet.  Stir first 3 ingredients in heavy small saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; boil without stirring until syrup turns amber, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat; stir in nuts and peel.  Immediately pour onto prepared sheet.  Cool completely.  Chop nougat.

For Honey-Saffron Flavor:  Simmer 3 tablespoons water and saffron in small saucepan until reduced by half, about 1 minute.  Stir in honey.  Set aside.

For Lavender Flavor:  Simmer 1/4 cup water and lavender in small saucepan until reduced by half, 1 minute.  Add sugar; stir to dissolve.  Simmer 2 minutes to thicken syrup slightly.  Stir in honey.  Set aside.

For Ice Cream Base:  Bring cream and milk to simmer in heavy large saucepan.  Whisk yolks to blend in large bowl.  Gradually whisk hot cream mixture into yolks.  Return mixture to same saucepan Stir constantly over medium-low heat until custard thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 10 minutes (do not boil).  Divide custard among 3 bowls (about 2 cups custard in each bowl).

For Assembly:  Stir nougat, brown sugar and pinch of salt into 1 bowl of hot custard.  Whisk honey-saffron mixture into custard in second bowl.  Whisk lavender mixture into custard in third bowl.  Cool mixtures completely, stirring occasionally (nougat will dissolve).  Chill nougat and honey-saffron custards until cold.  Chill lavender custard at least 4 hours or overnight.  Strain; discard lavender in strainer.

Process ice cream custards separately in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.  Freeze in covered containers.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  These lavender, honey-saffron and nougat ice creams show off true ProvenÁal flavors.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pot Pies
                Poultry                         Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry - (half of 17.3-o -- thawed
  1                     turkey thigh - (14 to 16 oz) -- skinned, boned,
                        and diced
  1           teaspoon  poultry seasoning
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1                cup  small broccoli florets
     3/4           cup  chopped red bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/4           cups  canned low-salt chicken broth

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Unroll pastry sheet on work surface.  Cut out two 3 1/2-inch squares (reserve remaining sheet for another use).  Place squares on small baking sheet; pierce squares several times with fork.  Bake until puffed and golden, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, sprinkle turkey with poultry seasoning, salt and pepper.  Melt butter in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add turkey and sautÈ until brown, about 5 minutes.  Add broccoli and bell pepper.  SautÈ until broccoli is crisp but tender, about 2 minutes.  Sprinkle turkey and broccoli with flour; stir 1 minute.

Add broth; bring to boil, stirring up browned bits.  Simmer until sauce thickens and turkey is cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Divide turkey mixture between two 1 1/4- to 2-cup soufflÈ dishes or custard cups.  Top each with pastry square.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Have your butcher skin and bone the turkey thigh.  Toss curly endive and radicchio with apple slices and cider vinaigrette for a salad.  Orange sorbet with warm chocolate sauce and toasted pecans is a simple ending.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR FILLING ===
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  1 1/2           cups  chopped dried Calimyrna figs
  12            ounces  frozen sweetened raspberries not
                        packed in syrup - (1 pkg) -- thawed, and
                        juice reserved
  1                cup  Muscat wine
  1                cup  water
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2          teaspoons  orange peel
                        === FOR CREPES ===
  1                cup  whole milk -- or more if needed
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  3              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  chopped walnuts
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- melted
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR ASSEMBLY ===
                        Additional melted butter
                        Additional sugar
  1                     container crËme fraÓche - (8 oz) -- see * Note
  2        tablespoons  honey

* Note:  Available at some supermarkets.  If unavailable, heat 1 cup whipping cream to lukewarm (85 degrees).  Remove from heat; mix in 2 tablespoons buttermilk.  Cover; let stand in warm draft-free area until slightly thickened, 24 to 48 hours, depending on temperature of room.  Chill until ready to use.

Make Filling:  Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into heavy medium saucepan; add bean.  Add figs, raspberries with juices and all remaining ingredients.  Bring to simmer, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Simmer over medium heat until figs are tender, about 30 minutes.  Cool.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Make Crepes:  Combine 1 cup milk and next 7 ingredients in blender.  Blend until smooth, occasionally scraping down sides of blender.  Cover; chill crepe batter in blender container 2 hours.  Re-blend batter 15 seconds.  If necessary, thin batter with additional milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, to consistency of heavy cream.

Heat nonstick skillet with 7-inch-diameter bottom over medium-high heat.  Brush skillet with additional melted butter.  Pour scant 1/4 cup crepe batter into skillet, tilting skillet quickly to coat bottom.  Cook until top of crepe appears dry and bottom is golden, loosening sides of crepe with spatula, about 35 seconds.  Turn crepe over; cook until brown spots appear on bottom, about 20 seconds.  Turn crepe out onto plate.  Repeat with remaining batter.  Stack crepes on plate.

Brush 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish with additional melted butter.  Spoon generous 2 tablespoons filling onto center of spotted side of 1 crepe.  Spread filling to within 1 inch of edge of crepe.  Fold crepe in half, then fold in half again, forming wedge shape.  Place filled crepe in prepared dish.  Repeat with remaining crepes and filling, overlapping crepes slightly in dish.  Brush crepes lightly with melted butter.  Sprinkle lightly with additional sugar.  Cover dish with foil.  Stir crËme fraÓche and honey in small bowl to blend.  (Crepes and honey crËme fraÓche can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and chill.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake crepes, covered, until heated through, about 20 minutes.  Place 2 crepes on each of 6 plates.  Top with dollop of honey crËme fraÓche and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  In Provence, crepes are often served simply, embellished with sugar, jam or liqueur.  Here, they get dressed up a bit more.
