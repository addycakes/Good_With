Place an oven rack 8 inches from broiler and preheat broiler to high.

Heat 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 turn of the pan, with a tablespoon of butter in a medium skillet over medium to medium high heat.

Place chops in oven under hot broiler and cook 8 to 10 minutes for medium rare.  Place a tiny pan on the stove over medium heat.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and shallots to the pan.  Cook shallots 2 minutes then add the preserves and whisk them together with balsamic vinegar and black pepper.  Heat to a bubble then remove from heat and add remaining pat of butter.  Whisk butter into sauce.

Season the risotto with salt to taste.  Place a generous serving of risotto into shallow dinner plates.  Arrange 2 chops on each plate alongside the risotto and drizzle the black cherry pepper glaze over the chops and garnish plates with extra sprigs of mint.

             BLT And P (Bacon, Leek, Tomato And Potato) Soup

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
  6             slices  lean smoky good-quality bacon -- chopped 1/2" pieces
  3              small  celery ribs from the heart of the stalk -- finely chopped
  2              small  to medium carrots
  3                     leeks -- trimmed of
                        rough tops and roots
  1                     bay leaf
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3             medium  starchy potatoes, such as Idaho -- peeled
  2             quarts  chicken stock
  1                can  petite diced tomatoes - (15 oz) -- drained
  1                     handful flat-leaf parsley -- finely chopped
                        Crusty bread -- for dunking and
                        mopping

Heat a medium soup pot or deep sided skillet over medium-high heat.  To the hot pan add a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and the bacon.  Cook bacon until brown and crisp.  Add the chopped celery.  Take peeled carrots and lay flat on cutting board.  Hold each carrot at root end and use the vegetable peeler to make long, thin strips of the carrot.  Chop the thin slices into small carrot bits or carrot chips, 1/2-inch wide.  Add the chips to celery and stir.  Cut leeks lengthwise and then into 1/2-inch half-moons.  Place the leeks into a colander and run under rushing cold water, separating the layers to wash away all the trapped grit.  When the leeks are separated and clean, shake off water and add to celery and carrots.  Stir veggies together, add a bay leaf and season with salt and pepper.  While the leeks cook to wilt, 3 to 4 minutes, slice the potatoes.

Cut each potato across into thirds.  Stand each piece of potato upright and thinly slice it.  The pieces will look like raw potato chips.

Add stock to vegetables and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and add potatoes and tomatoes.  Cook 8 to 10 minutes until potatoes are tender and starting to break up a bit.  Add bacon and parsley and stir.  Adjust seasonings.  Serve immediately with crusty bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Bacon, Leek and Tomato Soup is a soup for any season!  It is surprisingly light and colorful and full of vegetables.  It makes a simple, flavorful, special lunch or supper that warms you up, soul and stomach.  It is especially delicious on rainy days or nights!  I first made this for my mom because she and I both LOVE Oscar's bacon and we wanted a whole pot full of soup that tasted like it!  We ate a pot of it while watching movies curled up in the living room of the cabin.

  4        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  4                     plum tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
  2                     scallions -- finely chopped

  4                     thick-cut slices sweet whole-grain bread
                        = (such as oat-nut bread)
  8             slices  Canadian bacon
                        A drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil
  4              large  eggs
  8             ounces  sharp Canadian cheddar -- shredded

Melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat in a small pan.  Add tomatoes and scallions and season with salt and pepper.  Saute 2 minutes then stir in cream and let it reduce 10 minutes over low heat, stirring occasionally.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet and melt it.  Add bread and cook 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Transfer to a platter.  Cook bacon in the same pan in a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.  Cook Canadian bacon 2 to 3 minutes on each side.  Place the bacon on the bread and add 1 more tablespoon butter to the pan.  Melt butter then add eggs, careful to give each room to cook.  Fry until soft or hard, as you like.  Cover eggs with mounds of cheese.  Foil tent the pan and melt the cheese.  Place cheesy eggs on bacon.  Ladle tomato cream sauce down over the entire egg stack.  Eggcellent, eh?

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Recently I went with friends to Nova Scotia.  There's a lot more than lox going on up there!  This is my version of the favorite breakfast item at the Normaway Inn.  It's good for B, L or D ó Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner!

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  crusty bread from a good-sized loaf/ 1/2"
                        thick, at least 5" across and 3" wide
     1/3         pound  thinly-sliced serrano ham
     1/3         pound  manchego - (to 1/3) -- thinly sliced with
                        sharp knife or cheese plane
  1                cup  hot pickled vegetable salad of
                        cauliflower, carrots, celery and hot
                        peppers (giardiniera) -- drained
     1/2           cup  sweet pickled red pepper relish or
                        sweet pickle relish
  2               cups  mixed good quality olives
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  cumin seeds
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling

Layer serrano and cheese in equal amounts on 4 slices of bread.  Grind the hot pickled vegetables and the sweet pickle relish in food processor and pulse chop to make a relish.  Spread the relish evenly on sandwich tops and set into place.

Place olives in a foil pouch and season with thyme, lemon zest, cumin seeds and red pepper flakes.  Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and seal the pouch.  Place pouch on grill and cook a few minutes on each side to heat the olives, herb and spices.

Preheat grill or grill pan to medium high.

Place sandwiches on grill and weight down with heavy skillet or a brick covered in foil.  Char and heat the sandwiches through, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side.

Cut sammies in half and serve with "Hot" Olives alongside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Serrano ham is similar to prosciutto and available at deli counter or in pre-sliced packages near the deli.  If you can't find it, go for the prosciutto.  Preheat grill pan or outdoor grill to medium-high.  Manchego is the most commonly found Spanish import cheese in markets today.  Look for it with the imported cheeses offered in your market.  Look for giardiniera (hot veggies salad) at the salad bar station in your market or, in jars on international foods aisle.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cut into pieces
  2                     starchy potatoes -- skin left on,

  2                     celery ribs with leafy green tops -- finely chopped
  2                     carrots -- peeled, diced
  1                     fresh or dried bay leaf
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  poultry seasoning
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  dry white wine
  5               cups  chicken stock
  1 1/2         pounds  chicken tenders -- chopped
  1                     small bunch pencil asparagus -- trimmed of woody
                        ends, and cut into 2" pieces
  1                cup  frozen peas
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon - (to 3)
                        Crusty whole-grain bread -- for serving

Heat a large, deep skillet or a medium soup pot over medium-high heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil and butter.  Melt butter into oil then add the potatoes, onions, celery and carrots, adding them to the pot as you chop them.  Add bay leaf and season veggies with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning, cook 5 to 6 minutes to soften them a bit.

Add flour and cook another minute then whisk in wine and cook off a minute more.  Add stock and put a lid on the pan or pot and raise heat to bring to a quick boil.  Slide in chicken and cook 5 minutes.  Stir in asparagus and cook 3 minutes more.

Turn off heat and add the peas and tarragon.  Stir to combine and adjust salt and pepper, to your taste.  Ladle into bowls and serve with crusty whole-grain bread for mopping - a lot easier than making pastry!.

            Chicken Sausage, Pepper And Onion Pasta Fake-Bake

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  rigatoni
                        Salt -- as needed
  1              pound  cooked chicken sausages
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1                     green or red bell pepper -- seeded, sliced
  1                     cubanelle pepper -- seeded, sliced
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4) -- chopped
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  dry white wine or chicken stock
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
                        = (San Marzano recommended)
  1                     handful chopped flat-leaf parsley
     1/2           cup  fresh basil - (10 leaves) -- torn or shredded
  1                cup  ricotta cheese
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus
                        some to pass at table

Place a pot of water on the stove to boil for pasta.  When the water boils, salt it and cook pasta to al dente, with a bite to it.

Prick sausages with a fork.  Place chicken sausages in a large skillet and add 1 inch of water.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil to the skillet, 1 turn of the pan.  Bring water to a boil then reduce heat a little.  Allow all the liquid to cook away then brown and crisp the casings, 5 to 6 minutes.

Preheat broiler.

While pasta and sausage cook, heat a deep skillet over medium heat with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan.  Add the peppers, onions and garlic and season with salt and pepper.  When the sausages are cooked through, slice them on an angle and add them to the peppers and onions.  Cook together until peppers and onions are tender and sliced sausages are crisp at edges then deglaze the pan with white wine or chicken stock.  Stir in crushed tomatoes and bring to a bubble, reduce heat to low.

Drain rigatoni and return to warm pot.  Add ricotta cheese, salt and pepper, parsley and basil and half of the Parmigiano, a couple of handfuls, stir to combine.

To assemble the "fake bake," place half the sausage, peppers, onions and sauce in the bottom of a baking dish.  Top with all of the pasta and then the remaining sausage and sauce.  Cover the top of the dish with the grated Parmigiano and place under broiler 2 minutes to brown cheese and set pasta.

Prick sausages with a fork.  Place chicken sausages in a large skillet and add 1 inch of water.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil to the skillet, 1 turn of the pan.  Bring water to a boil then reduce heat a little.  Allow all the liquid to cook away then brown and crisp the casings, 5 to 6 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat broiler.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While pasta and sausage cook, heat a deep skillet over medium heat with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan.  Add the peppers, onions and garlic and season with salt and pepper.  When the sausages are cooked through, slice them on an angle and add them to the peppers and onions.  Cook together until peppers and onions are tender and sliced sausages are crisp at edges then deglaze the pan with white wine or chicken stock.  Stir in crushed tomatoes and bring to a bubble, reduce heat to low.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain rigatoni and return to warm pot.  Add ricotta cheese, salt and pepper, parsley and basil and half of the Parmigiano, a couple of handfuls, stir to combine.

<DirT>
To assemble the &quot;fake bake,&quot; place half the sausage, peppers, onions and sauce in the bottom of a baking dish.  Top with all of the pasta and then the remaining sausage and sauce.  Cover the top of the dish with the grated Parmigiano and place under broiler 2 minutes to brown cheese and set pasta.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Salt -- as needed
     1/2         pound  orzo pasta
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts - -- (6 oz ea)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter
  12                    cremini or baby portobello mushrooms -- sliced
  12                    shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        and sliced
  12                    white mushrooms -- sliced
  2              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  thyme leaves -- chopped
  2              large  shallots -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  3        tablespoons  heavy cream or half-and-half
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley

Heat a large pot of water to a boil.  Salt the water and add orzo pasta.  Cook to al dente.

Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan.  Season chicken liberally with salt and pepper and add to the hot skillet.  Cook the chicken for 5 to 6 minutes on each side.  Remove the chicken from the pan and cover with foil to keep warm.

Return the skillet to the heat, turn heat back a bit, and add the butter.  Once the butter melts add the mushrooms and brown stirring occasionally for about 4 to 5 minutes.  Once the mushrooms are brown season with salt and pepper then add the garlic, thyme and shallots.  Cook stirring occasionally for about 2 minutes or until the shallots are wilted.  Sprinkle the flour into the pan and cook 2 minutes more.  Whisk in the stock, balsamic vinegar and the cream.  Turn the heat up to high and simmer for about 2 minutes or until thickened.  Slice the chicken on an angle.  Add the parsley and the chicken back to the skillet to heat up, about 1 minute.

To serve, pile orzo on dinner plates and top with the sliced chicken and sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe is a modern take on the ol' Cream of Mushroom Chicken.  This one is more healthful and almost as easy as pouring that condensed, salty mass out of a can.  It will heal a long day!

                 Chipotle Cashew Chicken With Brown Rice

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1              large  onion -- 1/4 onion finely
                        chopped, 3/4 thinly sliced
  2               cups  quick-cooking brown rice
  4               cups  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2             pounds  chicken meat -- cut into 2" pieces
                        = (tenders, boneless skinless breasts or
                        boneless skinless thighs)
  2        tablespoons  grill seasoning blend
                        = (Montreal Steak Seasoning blend by
                        McCormick recommended)
  2        tablespoons  tamari dark soy sauce - (to 3)
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, sliced thin
  10                    water chestnuts - (to 12) -- whole
  1                cup  frozen green peas
  3        tablespoons  chipotle in adobo - (2 peppers and sauce)
                        = (or substitute 1 1/2 tbspns ground
                        chipotle powder)
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  honey - (to 3)
     1/4           cup  real maple syrup - (to 1/3)
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro or
                        parsley leaves - (to 3) -- your preference
  1                cup  raw cashews

In a medium pot over medium heat combine 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, and 1 tablespoon butter.  When butter melts into oil, add in the chopped onion, cook 2 minutes, then add rice and cook 3 minutes more.  Add stock and cover the pot.  Raise heat to bring stock to a rapid boil.  Once the stock boils, reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender, 17 to 18 minutes.

While rice cooks, make the chicken.  Heat a large skillet over high heat.  Add vegetable oil, 2 turns of the pan, then the chicken.  Season the chicken with grill seasoning.  Brown the chicken on both sides, season with soy sauce then move off to one side of the pan.  Add the remaining onions, garlic and peppers.  Cook 2 to 3 minutes then add water chestnuts and green peas and mix vegetables and meat together.  Add the chipotles and cumin.  Toss to coat.  Glaze the mixture with honey and maple syrup and turn off the heat.  Add in the chopped cilantro or parsley and the cashew nuts.

Top rice with cashew chicken and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  I was in a Park City, Utah Albertson's grocery store and picked up a sack of nuts: chipotle coated raw cashews.  They were gone before I made it to the check-out.  I paid for the empty bag and immediately wrote this recipe based on the ingredients of those nuts.  This may look like Chinese Take-Out but the maple, chipotle flavor makes for a North-Western American surprise!  Leave the nuts raw ó they taste buttery and extra sweet.  Toasting will develop a deeper flavor, but the sweet butter nuts have a unique texture when eaten raw.

In a medium pot over medium heat combine 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, and 1 tablespoon butter.  When butter melts into oil, add in the chopped onion, cook 2 minutes, then add rice and cook 3 minutes more.  Add stock and cover the pot.  Raise heat to bring stock to a rapid boil.  Once the stock boils, reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender, 17 to 18 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While rice cooks, make the chicken.  Heat a large skillet over high heat.  Add vegetable oil, 2 turns of the pan, then the chicken.  Season the chicken with grill seasoning.  Brown the chicken on both sides, season with soy sauce then move off to one side of the pan.  Add the remaining onions, garlic and peppers.  Cook 2 to 3 minutes then add water chestnuts and green peas and mix vegetables and meat together.  Add the chipotles and cumin.  Toss to coat.  Glaze the mixture with honey and maple syrup and turn off the heat.  Add in the chopped cilantro or parsley and the cashew nuts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Top rice with cashew chicken and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  I was in a Park City, Utah Albertson&apos;s grocery store and picked up a sack of nuts: chipotle coated raw cashews.  They were gone before I made it to the check-out.  I paid for the empty bag and immediately wrote this recipe based on the ingredients of those nuts.  This may look like Chinese Take-Out but the maple, chipotle flavor makes for a North-Western American surprise!  Leave the nuts raw ó they taste buttery and extra sweet.  Toasting will develop a deeper flavor, but the sweet butter nuts have a unique texture when eaten raw.

Place a small sauce pot over medium low heat and melt 2 tablespoons butter in it.  Whisk in a rounded tablespoon of flour and cook 1 minute or so.  Whisk in milk and bring to a bubble then drop heat to low.  Season the sauce with salt, pepper, nutmeg and Dijon.  When sauce coats back of a spoon, turn off heat.

Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in each of 2 medium nonstick skillets, both over medium-low heat.  When butter melts add 2 large eggs to the first skillet, keeping the whites separate from each other.  To the second skillet add 2 slices bread and toast lightly on first side then turn the bread.  Top turned bread liberally with sauce and 2 slices of the ham and the Swiss cheese on each slice of bread.  Use a spatula to transfer the eggs to the tops of the open faced sandwiches.  Cover the pan with foil and turn off heat.  Let pan stand 5 minutes to melt cheese and set sauce and eggs.

Top sandwiches with chopped herb or herbs of choice and serve.  Spoon any leftover sauce over top of the eggs before garnishing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  sliced almonds
  1              quart  chicken stock
  1                     lemon -- zested
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme - (to 3)
  4        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  1 1/2           cups  white rice
  1 1/2         pounds  chicken breast cutlets - (to 1 3/4) -- 8 cutlets
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  poultry seasoning
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour -- plus about
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- divided
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/3         pounds  asparagus spears - (a large bunch) -- tough ends trimmed
  6              large  button mushrooms - (to 7) -- sliced
     1/3           cup  half-and-half
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard - (rounded)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon
  2                     scallions -- chopped

Toast almonds in a small skillet until golden.  Set aside.

Bring 2 3/4 cups chicken stock, the zest of 1 lemon, thyme sprigs and a tablespoon of butter to a boil in a medium pot with a tight fitting lid.  Add rice to water, stir.  Return the water to a boil then reduce heat to simmer and cove the pot.  Cook 18 minutes or until tender, remove from heat.  Remove the thyme sprigs, the leaves will have fallen off in the rice.

While the rice cooks, season chicken with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning.  Dredge chicken in about half cup of flour then discard the rest.  Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, and 1 tablespoon butter to the large skillet.  To the hot butter and oil, add the cutlets and cook 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Remove the meat to a large platter and cover with foil to keep warm.

Bring an inch or 2 of water to a simmer in a shallow pan and season with salt.  Add asparagus and cook 4 minutes until just tender but green.  Remove and add to chicken platter to keep warm.

Return chicken skillet to the heat and add 2 tablespoons butter.  Melt butter, add the mushrooms and saute for a couple of minutes.  Whisk in 2 rounded tablespoons flour.  Cook the flour 1 minute then whisk in 1/3 cup white wine, a couple of glugs.  Cook off wine, 30 seconds, then whisk in 1 1/4 cups of chicken stock (remainder of the quart) then the half-and-half.  When sauce bubbles, stir in mustard and tarragon and let sauce simmer and thicken 2 to 3 minutes.

Stir scallions into rice and fluff with fork.  Make a bed of rice on each dinner plate.  Top with a serving of steamed asparagus then 2 cutlets of chicken.  Cover the chicken with the tarragon sauce, allowing the gravy to spill over edges into asparagus and rice.  Sprinkle the plates with toasted nuts.  Wow!  Can you believe you made this?

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             sticks  butter
  3              large  onions -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  chicken livers -- rinsed, dried,
                        and trimmed of any connective tissues
  8             slices  sprouted wheat bread
                        = (or pumpernickel bread)
  1           teaspoon  salt - (about)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground thyme
  1                     small jar cornichons
                        = (or baby sweet gherkins)
  2                     shallots -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  grainy Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  capers -- drained

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat.  Add onions and sweat them 15 minutes; do not let brown.  Once the onions are sweet and tender, add livers and raise heat just a bit.  Cook until livers are firm and cooked through, another 5 to 6 minutes.

While livers cook, place bread on a cookie sheet and bake in oven to dry out and toast, 5 to 6 minutes.  Cut toasted bread slices corner to corner.  Pile toast triangles into a bread basket.

Combine salt, pepper and thyme and sprinkle over the livers and onions.  Place mixture in food processor in batches and grind into smooth spread.  Transfer to a serving bowl.

Fill ramekins or other small dishes with cornichons, shallots, mustard, and capers and arrange around the warm spread and toast basket.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Tip:  Rachel builds her toast like this: mustard, liver spread, shallots, capers and a pickle on top! YUM-O!

Leftover spread can be chilled for several days.

           Grilled Halibut With Fennel, Red Onions And Oregano

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     halibut filets - (6 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        some for drizzling
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Crusty bread -- cut thick slices
  1                     orange
  1                     fennel bulb -- quartered, core
                        removed, thinly sliced
  1                     red onion -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1                     handful flat-leaf parsley -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh oregano leaves

Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill over high heat.

Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil over the fish and season with salt and pepper.  Grill 4 minutes on each side until fish is firm but not tough and cooked through.  Grill bread alongside or char under broiler then dress with extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper as well.

Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat.

While fish cooks, peel the orange as you would a melon: cut off ends, stand it upright and cut off skin and pith in thin strips from top to bottom.  Cut orange across into thin slices.

To preheated skillet add extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, the fennel and onions, season with salt and pepper and cook 3 to 5 minutes until seared and beginning to soften.  Add vinegar to the pan and give it a shake.  Remove from heat and toss in the oranges, the parsley and oregano.  Adjust seasoning and serve salad on dinner plates topped with fish, and seasoned bread alongside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This dish is fast, healthy and combines a Sicilian favorite combo of mine: oranges, red onions and oregano.  Fennel is a winter favorite, but in most markets it is available year round and in my family we used it as a digestive during big meals throughout the year.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Oil or cooking spray -- to prepare surface
                        of grill or grill pan
  6             pieces  stone fruit; plums, peaches or
                        nectarines, apricots -- cut around pit,
                        and separated in halves
     1/2           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1              small  peeled 1/2" chunk ginger root
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper

Heat grill or grill pan to high.  Coat the surface of the grill with oil or spray to avoid sticking.  Place fruits cut-side down on grill and cook 3 to 4 minutes until warmed through and evenly marked.

Heat the remaining ingredients (for the glaze) in small pot over medium-high heat or place on grill next to fruit.  When the sauce reduces, it will become syrup-like in no time ó less than a minute.  If you burn food often or get distracted easily, cook it over lower heat.  Otherwise, let it rip.  When the balsamic sauce coats the back of a spoon and reduces by half, remove the pan from the heat and discard the ginger chunk.

Arrange fruits on a platter and drizzle liberally with the glaze.

This recipe yields 4 servings, 3 pieces each.

                        roasted red peppers -- quartered
                        lengthwise, thinly sliced
  6                     scallions -- cut 2" pieces, then
                        shredded into thin sticks
  1                     handful fresh dill -- finely chopped,
                        = (abt 3 tbspns)

Heat stock to a boil and reduce heat to simmer.

Mix the chicken with egg, bread crumbs, nutmeg, smoked sweet paprika, parsley, salt and pepper.  Roll the meat into 1-inch dumplings and add to simmering stock.  Wash up and let the dumplings cook 3 to 4 minutes alone.

Add the egg noodles, peppers and scallions and stir.  Cook another 4 to 5 minutes until noodles are just tender.  Stir in dill.  Season soup with salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This soup is so light yet hearty it really is great in any season for any reason, but it is especially delish on cold, snowy days.  Plus, it's made from many items you can keep on hand.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  chopped hazelnuts -- toasted
  2               cups  whipping cream
  2                     round tablespoons sugar
  24                    store-bought prepared meringue cookies

                        = (Nutella recommended)
     1/2          pint  raspberries

Toast nuts in a small pan then cool.

Beat whipping cream and sugar until it forms soft peaks.  Crush half of the meringues in a large food storage bag with the hazelnuts and then divide evenly among 4 small dessert cups.  Place hazelnut chocolate spread in a medium bowl.  Warm the spread in the microwave until loosened and smooth, test after 40 seconds on high.  Stir and repeat, if necessary, until loose.

Divide berries evenly among dessert cups.  Fold a small amount of whipped cream into hazelnut chocolate spread mixture until well combined.  Fold in the remaining whipped cream.  Divide the completed mixture among the cups and top each dessert cup with whole remaining meringues, 3 per cup.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Salt -- as needed
  1              pound  penne rigate -- pasta with lines
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2         pound  andouille sausage -- casing removed,
                        and diced
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     poblano pepper -- seeded, chopped or

  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
  2                     celery ribs from the heart with greens -- chopped
  1                     onion -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  beer
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (14 oz)
  2        tablespoons  hot sauce
                        = (Franks Red Hot or Tabasco recommended)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
     1/2         pound  chicken breast -- diced small pieces
     1/2         pound  medium shrimp -- cleaned, tails
                        removed
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  2                     scallions -- sliced

Heat a pot of water to a boil for pasta and add salt to it then pasta.  Cook to al dente and drain.

While pasta works, heat a deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, butter and andouille.  Brown the sausage 2 to 3 minutes to render the fat.  Remove with a slotted spoon.  Add garlic, peppers, celery and onions.  Saute the veggies for 5 to 6minutes.  Season the mixture with salt and pepper and add flour to the pan.  Cook flour with veggies 2 minutes more then whisk in beer.  Cook beer out, 2 minutes.  Add chicken stock, tomatoes, hot sauce and thyme.  Bring liquid to a bubble and add chicken and shrimp.  Cook 6 to 7 minutes until chicken is firm and shrimp are opaque and firm.  Stir to mix in cooking juices then add in cream.

Drain the pasta and add it to the sauce.  Ladle up the jambasta and top with chopped scallions and reserved crispy andouille.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  My dad is from Louisiana, originally.  This is a combination of jambalaya, a native favorite, and pasta, something he developed a love for by having Italians in the house!  It can turn Wednesday, Monday or Sunday into Fat Tuesday!

Heat a pot of water to a boil for pasta and add salt to it then pasta.  Cook to al dente and drain.

While pasta works, heat a deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, butter and andouille.  Brown the sausage 2 to 3 minutes to render the fat.  Remove with a slotted spoon.  Add garlic, peppers, celery and onions.  Saute the veggies for 5 to 6minutes.  Season the mixture with salt and pepper and add flour to the pan.  Cook flour with veggies 2 minutes more then whisk in beer.  Cook beer out, 2 minutes.  Add chicken stock, tomatoes, hot sauce and thyme.  Bring liquid to a bubble and add chicken and shrimp.  Cook 6 to 7 minutes until chicken is firm and shrimp are opaque and firm.  Stir to mix in cooking juices then add in cream.

Comments:  My dad is from Louisiana, originally.  This is a combination of jambalaya, a native favorite, and pasta, something he developed a love for by having Italians in the house!  It can turn Wednesday, Monday or Sunday into Fat Tuesday!

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided, plus
                        extra for drizzling
  3        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  1              small  savoy cabbage - (1 1/4 lbs) -- quartered, shredded
  2               cups  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     grapefruits or 4 oranges
                        Grated zest from 1 grapefruit or 2 oranges
  4                     red snapper fillets - (8 oz ea) -- skin scored
  1              large  shallot -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1 1/2           cups  couscous
  1                cup  green peas
  2        tablespoons  chopped or snipped fresh chives - -- (10 to 12 blades)

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan and 1 tablespoon butter.  When butter melts into oil, add the cabbage and cook 2 to 3 minutes to wilt it down a bit.  Season with salt and pepper and add 1/2 cup chicken stock to the skillet.  Reduce heat to medium-low and cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Cut ends off citrus, either grapefruit or oranges.  Stand the citrus upright and trim away peel in strips with a small sharp knife cutting from top to bottom, spinning the citrus around as you work.  Once cleaned of skins, cut the sections of the fruit away from the membranes.

Season the fish with salt and pepper and grapefruit or orange zest.  Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan.  When oil ripples, add fish.  Cook fish 3 to 4 minutes on each side, skin-side down first.  Skin should be crisp and flesh should be opaque.  Remove fish to a platter and cover with foil to keep warm.  Return pan to stove top and add another tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, and the shallots.  Cook shallots 2 minutes then add the citrus to the pan and warm through a minute.  Add white wine and reduce 1 minute then add a tablespoon of butter.  Turn off heat.  Shake pan to combine butter with citrus.

While the sauce is working, bring 1 1/2 cups chicken stock, 1 tablespoon butter and a drizzle of olive oil to a boil in a medium pot with a tight fitting lid.  When stock boils, add couscous, peas and chives to pot.  Turn off heat, stir and set lid in place.  Let stand 5 minutes then uncover and fluff with a fork.  Transfer to a serving dish.

Place cabbage in a serving dish.  Uncover fish.  Pour citrus and sauce over fish and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatloaf

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef, pork and veal mix - (to 2)
                        = (or ground sirloin ñ your choice)
  1              small  onion -- peeled, halved
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh sage - (abt 4 sprigs)
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  2                     handfuls bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard - (rounded)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1                cup  chicken broth
  1                     large head cauliflower
     1/3           cup  Boursin  - (abt 3 oz)
                        = (or other garlic and herb soft cheese)
                        A handful grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or
                        Romano
     1/8      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  3        tablespoons  chopped or snipped chives - -- (abt 12 blades)
  20                    crimini or baby portobello mushrooms
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour - (rounded)
  1               shot  Scotch or dry sherry -- (optional)
  1                cup  beef stock
     1/4           cup  half-and-half or cream

Place meat in a bowl.  Grate onion using a box or handheld grater directly over the meat bowl.  Add sage, egg, bread crumbs, Worcestershire and mustard, salt and pepper then mix meat to combine.  Score meat into 4 sections and form 4 oval shaped loaves, 1 to 1/2 inches thick.

Preheat 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the meatloaves and cook 6 to 7 minutes on each side.  Remove to a platter and cover with foil to keep warm.

While meatloaf cooks, add chicken stock and 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, to a deep pot.  Trim away greens and stems from the base of cauliflower.  Cut away the core with a sharp paring knife.  Set cored head into pot with broth.  Cover pot and bring liquid to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium low and cook cauliflower, covered, until tender, 8 to 10 minutes.  Uncover the pot and mash the cauliflower.  Let some liquid cook off as you smash the cheeses into the cauliflower.  As the mixture thickens, turn off heat and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Stir in chives and transfer cauliflower to a serving dish.

Once meatloaves are removed, place the skillet back over medium heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, and the mushrooms.  Cover the skillet with foil and nest the foil into pan with a second smaller skillet, smothering the mushrooms.  Cook until deep brown and tender, 7 to 8 minutes.  Remove the foil, add flour and cook a minute longer.  Add in a shot of Scotch or sherry, if you have either on hand, then whisk in the beef stock.  Stir in half-and-half or cream and bring to a bubble.  Season the mushroom gravy with salt and pepper, to taste.

Place the meatloaves on dinner plates and douse with hot, smothered mushroom gravy, spoon the cauliflower alongside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  20                    leaves fresh basil -- divided
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        some to drizzle
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped

Bring a pot of water to boil for gnocchi.  Season the water with salt, add gnocchi and cook according to package directions.

Place chicken in a medium bowl with grill seasoning and add the fennel seeds.  Pile sun-dried tomatoes on top of each other in small stacks then slice into thin strips.  Coarsely chop the thin strips and add to bowl.  Stack 10 basil leaves together then roll them up into a log.  Shred the basil by thinly slicing the log.  Add basil to the bowl.  Drizzle some extra-virgin olive oil over the chicken, mix meat together and roll into mini balls, 1 1/2 inches across, and arrange on a nonstick cookie sheet.  Bake at 400 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes or until firm and lightly golden.

Preheat a large skillet over medium heat.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, the onions and crushed red pepper flakes.  Cook 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Stir in the tomatoes and sauce and season with salt and pepper.  Simmer over low heat.  Stir in the remaining 10 leaves of basil, whole or torn.

Drain gnocchi and remove balls from oven.  Toss gnocchi and meat balls with sauce and serve with grated cheese to pass at table.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     dried bay leaves
     1/3           cup  cider vinegar
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  grill seasoning
                        = (Montreal Steak Seasoning recommended)
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2 1/4         pounds  flank steak - (to 2 1/2)
  2             medium  onions
  4        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  1              large  green apple
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-grated or ground nutmeg
  3             pounds  red skin potatoes -- quartered
  1                cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  prepared horseradish
  3        tablespoons  chopped or snipped chives
  1                jar  cooked red cabbage - (18 oz)
                        = (available on specialty foods aisle)
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  1 1/2           cups  beef stock
  1                     rounded tablespoon Dijon mustard
  6                     gingersnaps -- finely crumbled

* (Flank Steak with Sauerbraten Style Sauce)

Mix bay, cider, sugar, grill seasoning and vegetable oil in the bottom of a large food storage bag, squish it all together until evenly combined.  Drop the meat into the bag and move it around to evenly coat it.  Let stand 10 to 12 minutes.  Preheat a grill pan or indoor/outdoor grill to high.

Thinly slice 1 1/2 onions and reserve 1/2 onion whole but peeled.  Heat a medium skillet over medium heat.  Add 2 tablespoons butter and melt it.  Add the sliced onions to the pan.  Peel, core and slice the apple and add it to the onions.  Season the apples and onions with salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Cook the apples and onions 5 or 6 minutes, then add cooked red cabbage and combine then reduce heat to low.  Set aside and keep warm.

Place meat on grill and let a bay leaf remain stuck on each steak.  As the meat cooks, the heat will infuse the flavor throughout the meat.  Cook steaks about 6 minutes on each side.  Then, let meat rest.  Discard leaves.

While meat cooks, place potatoes in a pot and cover with water, bring water to a boil then salt it.  Cook potatoes 10 to 12 minutes or until tender.  Drain potatoes and return to the hot pot.  Mash them with sour cream, horseradish and chives and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Potatoes will be thick and spicy.  If you like looser mashed potatoes, add a little milk or stock, continue to smash.

While potatoes cook, remove the red cabbage to a serving bowl and cover with foil.  In the same skillet that the cabbage was cooked in, add 2 tablespoons butter.  Melt butter then grate the reserved 1/2 onion with a hand held grater into the butter.  Cook the grated onions 2 minutes then add flour and cook a minute more.  Whisk in red wine and cook off a minute then whisk in stock and bring to a simmer.  Stir in mustard and gingersnaps and season the sauce with salt and pepper.  Let sauce thicken a couple of minutes.

Thinly slice the flank steak on an angle against the grain.  Place a mound of potatoes on each dinner plate.  Lay out some sliced flank steak along the edge of potatoes and dress with a ladle of sauer-sauce.  Serve red cabbage, apples and onions alongside or in small side dishes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

         Montalcino Chicken With Figs, Buttered Gnocchi, Pancetta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/3         pound  thick-cut (1/4") pancetta -- cut into sticks
  2             pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts and
                        thighs combined -- cut large chunks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Flour -- for dredging
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  14                    dried figs - (to 16) -- halved
                        = (look for plump, tender dried fig
                        varieties in bulk section of market)
     1/3        bottle  dry red wine**
                        = (Rosso di Montalcino recommended)
  1                cup  chicken stock - (to 1 1/2)
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1                     lemon -- zested
  1         tablespoon  chopped thyme
  1            package  fresh or frozen store-bought gnocchi - -- (12 to 16 oz)
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives - (to 3)

** This dish uses Rosso di Montalcino wine (an affordable, younger version of Brunello ó I call it "Baby Brunello") but you can substitute any dry red wine you like.

Heat a deep skillet over medium high heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, 4 turns of the pan, and the cut pancetta.  Brown the pancetta, 3 to 4 minutes then remove with a slotted spoon and reserve.

Place a pot of water on the stove to boil for the gnocchi.

While pancetta browns, season the chicken chunks with salt and pepper and dredge in a little flour then add to the hot pan.  Brown the pieces a few minutes on each side over high heat, then scoot the meat to the edges of the pan and add the onions, garlic and chopped figs.  Saute 5 minutes, combine chicken with onions and figs then add the wine and cook it down 5 minutes or so until only about 1/3 cup remains.  Add chicken stock, parsley, lemon zest and thyme to the chicken and stir to combine.  Reduce heat to simmer cook another 10 minutes, while you make the gnocchi.

Add salt and gnocchi to boiling water and cook to package directions, drain, 4 minutes for fresh gnocchi, 6 minutes for frozen.  Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.  Melt butter and brown it.  Drain gnocchi and add to skillet.  Raise heat to medium-high and lightly brown the dumplings.  Season gnocchi with salt, pepper and nutmeg, turn to coat and add chives, toss and remove from heat.

Adjust the seasonings on the chicken with figs.  If you would like a little more sauce, shake another half cup of stock into the pan.  Serve the chicken and figs in shallow dishes, the gnocchi piled in the center of the bowl on top of the chicken.  Garnish with crisp pancetta sticks.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Montalcino is the city I married in.  I will make this dish for John every September 24, for our wedding anniversary.  The way to anyone's heart, forever and ever, is through their stomach!  THIS is NOT your average chicken dinner!

** This dish uses Rosso di Montalcino wine (an affordable, younger version of Brunello ó I call it &quot;Baby Brunello&quot;) but you can substitute any dry red wine you like.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a deep skillet over medium high heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, 4 turns of the pan, and the cut pancetta.  Brown the pancetta, 3 to 4 minutes then remove with a slotted spoon and reserve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a pot of water on the stove to boil for the gnocchi.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While pancetta browns, season the chicken chunks with salt and pepper and dredge in a little flour then add to the hot pan.  Brown the pieces a few minutes on each side over high heat, then scoot the meat to the edges of the pan and add the onions, garlic and chopped figs.  Saute 5 minutes, combine chicken with onions and figs then add the wine and cook it down 5 minutes or so until only about 1/3 cup remains.  Add chicken stock, parsley, lemon zest and thyme to the chicken and stir to combine.  Reduce heat to simmer cook another 10 minutes, while you make the gnocchi.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add salt and gnocchi to boiling water and cook to package directions, drain, 4 minutes for fresh gnocchi, 6 minutes for frozen.  Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.  Melt butter and brown it.  Drain gnocchi and add to skillet.  Raise heat to medium-high and lightly brown the dumplings.  Season gnocchi with salt, pepper and nutmeg, turn to coat and add chives, toss and remove from heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Adjust the seasonings on the chicken with figs.  If you would like a little more sauce, shake another half cup of stock into the pan.  Serve the chicken and figs in shallow dishes, the gnocchi piled in the center of the bowl on top of the chicken.  Garnish with crisp pancetta sticks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Montalcino is the city I married in.  I will make this dish for John every September 24, for our wedding anniversary.  The way to anyone&apos;s heart, forever and ever, is through their stomach!  THIS is NOT your average chicken dinner!

                   Mushroom Lovers' French Bread Pizzas

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Mushrooms
                Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  portobello mushroom caps
  1              pound  button mushrooms
     1/2         pound  shiitake mushrooms
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cut into pieces
  1                     bay leaf
  4              large  garlic cloves -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
                        = (4 sprigs stripped and chopped)
  1                     loaf crusty French bread - (24" long)
  3               cups  shredded Gruyere or Swiss cheese

Wipe mushrooms clean with a damp towel.  Slice the mushrooms.  Heat a deep skillet with extra-virgin olive oil and butter over medium heat.  When butter melts into oil, add bay, garlic and mushrooms.  Cook until mushrooms are dark and tender, 12 to 15 minutes.  Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper and add wine.  Deglaze the pan with wine, eyeball the amount.  Shake the pan and add the Worcestershire and thyme.  Turn off heat.

Preheat broiler and split the loaf lengthwise and across.  Hollow out a bit of the soft insides.  Toast the bread lightly under broiler.  Fill bread with mushrooms evenly then top with cheese liberally.  Melt cheese until it browns and bubbles then remove the pizzas from the oven and turn off the broiler.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 4 (12-inch) French bread pizzas.

Comments:  Mushrooms are so beefy and delicious.  This is a great quick supper for meat-free-ers and meat eaters alike because it is hearty.  To round out the meal, serve with simple green salad dressed with Dijon dressing or, sliced apples or pears.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     loaf baguette or semolina bread -- day old is fine
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     jalapeÒo -- seeded and chopped
                        = (or 1 pickled hot pepper of any kind,
                        chopped)
  1                can  black beans - (15 oz)
  2          teaspoons  hot sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chili powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  prepared salsa -- any variety
  2               cups  shredded Cheddar, smoked Cheddar,
                        Monterey Jack or pepper Jack
  1                     heart romaine or 1/2 iceberg head -- shredded
     1/2           cup  green olives with or without pimiento -- chopped
     1/4                red onion or 2 to 3 scallions -- chopped
  2                     plum or vine tomatoes -- seeded, diced

Split bread lengthwise.  Hollow the bread out and cut each half in half across, making 4 boats.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add oil, 1 turn of the pan, garlic and hot peppers.  Drain beans.  Add half of the beans then mash the remainder of the beans in the can using a fork.  Add mashed beans to the pan and combine with whole beans.  Season beans with hot sauce, chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper.  When the spicy beans are hot through, spread them evenly across all of the bread.  Top with salsa and liberally sprinkle with cheese, covering bread to all edges.  The boats will only be half-full.  Melt cheese in the oven until it bubbles and begins to brown.

Top Nacho Bread Pizzas with lettuce, olives, onions and tomatoes and serve.  You can pick it up with your hands, but eat over the plate (or the kitchen sink, like me).

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  curly short cut pasta
                        = (campanelle by Barilla, fusilli or
                        cavatappi recommended)
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oi
  1              pound  ground sirloin
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  allspice
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
     1/2           cup  beef stock
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  part-skim ricotta cheese
  1                cup  fresh basil - (abt 20 leaves)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus
                        some to pass at table

Heat a large pot of water to boil for pasta.  Salt water and cook pasta to al dente.  Heads up: you will need a ladle of the starchy cooking water to help form sauce before draining.

Heat a deep nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan.  Add the meat and break it up into small bits as it caramelizes.  Once meat has good color to it, 4 to 5 minutes, add garlic, onions and red pepper flakes and season with salt, pepper, allspice and Worcestershire sauce.  Cook another 5 minutes, deglaze the meat and onions with red wine, cook off a minute, then combine about 1/2 cup of stock into the meat.  Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a bubble.  Reduce heat to medium low and simmer 5 minutes.

Place ricotta cheese in the bottom of a shallow bowl.  Add a ladleful of boiling, starchy pasta water to the ricotta and stir to combine.  Add a couple of handfuls of grated Parmesan to the ricotta and mix it in.

Drain pasta.  Toss hot pasta with cheeses.  Add half the thick meat sauce to the pasta bowl and combine.  Tear or shred the basil and add to the meat and pasta, toss again.  Taste to adjust salt and pepper.  Serve bowlfuls of Not-sagna with extra sauce on top and more grated Parmesan to pass at the table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Easier than lasagna, because it's not, this pasta, meat sauce and ricotta toss-up is just as hearty and comforting as the layered Italian fave, but it's ready in a fraction of the time and with much less effort.

                          Ribollita Con Verdure

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        some for drizzling
  4                     thick slices pancetta (not smoked) or baco -- chopped
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary -- leaves chopped fine
  4                     garlic cloves - (to 6) -- chopped
  1             medium  to large onion -- finely chopped
  2             medium  carrots -- diced
  1             medium  skinny zucchini -- cut thin slices
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  1                can  petite-diced or chunky-style
                        crushed tomatoes - (15 oz)
  6               cups  beef stock
                        = (Kitchen Basics brand recommended)
  4               cups  chopped or torn stale bread
  2               cans  small white beans - (15 oz ea)
                        = (Goya brand recommended; smaller than
                        cannellini beans)
  4               cups  chopped kale or chard
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- to pass at table

Heat a soup pot over medium-high heat.  Add oil and the the pancetta or bacon and render 4 minutes.  Add rosemary, the garlic, 3/4 of the onions, carrots and zucchini and season with salt and pepper.  Saute the veggies 7 to 8 minutes, then add wine and deglaze the pot.  Stir in the tomatoes and stock and bring up the heat.

When soup boils, reduce to a simmer and stir in bread and beans.  Pile the greens into the pot and wilt them into the soup.  Simmer the ribollita 5 to 10 minutes, stirring soup as it simmers until it thickens to a dense stew-like consistency.  A wooden spoon should be able to stand upright in the pot.

Turn off heat, adjust seasonings and ladle into shallow bowls.  Top with grated cheese, an additional drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, and a spoonful of reserved finely chopped raw onions.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This soup is a staple in Tuscany, my favorite place to eat because the food goes back so many generations and remains so simple and not-fussed-with.  This bread soup has some vegetable in it, but it is made with beef stock.  For a vegetarian version, use all vegetable or wild mushroom stock and skip the pancetta or bacon.

            Spaghetti With Pancetta, Escarole And Garlic Chips

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  dried spaghetti
                        Salt -- as needed
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  thickly-sliced pancetta -- chopped
  6                     garlic cloves - (to 8) -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2                     large heads escarole -- washed, drained,
                        and roughly chopped
     3/4           cup  chicken stock or broth
  1                     lemon -- zested and juiced
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus
                        some to pass at table

Fill a large pot with water, bring to a boil and salt the water.  Add the pasta and cook to al dente, with a bite to it.

While the pasta is working, heat a large skillet over medium heat with the extra-virgin olive oil, 3 turns of the pan.  Add the pancetta and cook until crisp, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the pancetta from the skillet with a slotted spoon to a paper towel lined plate to drain.  Set aside.  Turn the heat on the pan back to low then add the sliced garlic and cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove the garlic chips from the pan to drain alongside the crispy pancetta, reserve.  Turn the heat up to medium again, add the crushed red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the roughly chopped escarole, tossing to wilt it in the flavored oil and wilting it into the pan in stages.  Once all the escarole has fit into the pan, add the chicken stock, lemon juice, salt and pepper and cook for 2 minutes.

Drain the hot pasta well and add it to the escarole pan.  Add lemon zest and toss to distribute.  Turn the heat off and add the butter and cheese, toss to melt.  Toss in the crispy pancetta and garlic chips.  Serve the spaghetti with more cheese to pass at the table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

While the pizza dough bakes, heat a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil (1 turn of the pan) in a large nonstick skillet over medium to medium-high heat.  Add butter to the warm oil, then the chicken or turkey.  Lightly brown the meat 3 to 4 minutes, then add the chopped red onion, garlic and grill seasoning and cook 5 minutes more.  Wring the defrosted spinach dry by twisting it in a clean kitchen towel over your sink.  Add it to the meat, separating it with your fingers.  Add in feta crumbles.

Once the pizza has cooked 10 minutes, remove dough and top evenly with meat and spinach mixture.  Cover the pizza with shredded mozzarella or provolone, roasted peppers and olives.  Bake pizza another 13 to 15 minutes until cheese is bubbly and crust is crisp.

Remove pizza from oven, top with chopped parsley or arugula, cucumbers and hot peppers and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     thick boneless center-cut pork chops - -- (abt 2 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  rioja or other dry red wine
     1/2           cup  black cherry preserves or all-fruit spread
  2               cups  beef stock -- divided
     1/2         pound  linguica or chorizo -- chopped
  2                     celery ribs -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1              small  red bell pepper -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  4                     corn muffins -- crumbled
  1           teaspoon  smoked paprika
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1                     handful flat-leaf parsley -- chopped

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Heat a skillet over medium-high heat.  Season pork chops with salt and pepper.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil to the pan, 2 turns around the pan.  Add the chops and caramelize the meat, 2 minutes on each side.  Transfer meat to a sheet pan and place in the oven to finish cooking through, 12 to 15 minutes.  Return pan to stove, reduce heat a bit and add butter to the skillet.  Add flour to butter and cook 1 minute.  Whisk wine into pan and reduce 1 minute then whisk in preserves and 1 cup of stock.  Season with salt and coarse black pepper and let gravy thicken over low heat.

Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan.  When oil smokes, add linguica or chorizo and brown, 2 minutes.  Add the celery, onions, peppers, garlic and season with salt and pepper.  Cook 5 minutes then crumble muffins into the skillet and combine with vegetables.  Dampen the stuffing with remaining 1 cup of stock and season with smoked paprika and thyme.  Reduce heat to low and keep warm until ready to serve.

Remove meat from oven and whisk the drippings into your gravy.  Pile stuffing on plates, chops alongside and ladle gravy over both.  Scatter parsley over meat and stuffing.

     3/4           cup  Italian or plain bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano or Romano
     1/8         pound  pancetta - (4 slices) -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
                        Splash red wine
     1/2           cup  beef stock
  1                can  petite diced tomatoes or stewed tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2          teaspoons  hot sauce
                        === SERVING SUGGESTION ===
                        Green salad

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Heat a small skillet over medium heat with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil.  When the oil is hot, saute the red pepper, half the onions, celery and carrots together, 5 minutes, season with salt and pepper then remove to a plate to cool.

Mix ground beef and sausages with egg, bread crumbs, cheese, and cooled vegetables.  Form 4 large oval shaped patties no more than 1 1/4 inches thick then drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil.  Place in the oven on a cookie sheet and bake 17 to 18 minutes, until cooked through.

Heat a medium sauce pot over medium high heat.  Add a drizzle of EVOO to the pan and the pancetta.  Let the pancetta crisp up a bit and render fat, then add onions and garlic and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes.  Add a splash of red wine to deglaze the pan.  Stir in the beef stock and tomatoes and season sauce heavily with coarse black pepper.  Add Worcestershire and hot sauce and reduce heat to warm.

Serve meatloaves with Italian barbecue sauce on top and green salad alongside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I was making my annual Christmas Pasta for the holiday and my mom and I bought duplicate meats so we had lots of leftover hot and sweet sausage and ground beef.  Well, the next day, this recipe was born.

  4             slices  bacon -- chopped 1" pieces
                        Salt -- as needed
  1              pound  spaghetti
  4                     New York strip steaks - (8 oz ea)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  5        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced, divided
  2                     shallots -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  cream or half-and-half - (to 1/3)
  8             ounces  blue cheese crumbles
  2        tablespoons  chopped sage leaves - (to 3)
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives
  2               cups  arugula - (a small bunch) -- cleaned, trimmed,
                        and shredded

Put a large pot of water on the stove to bring to a boil for pasta.

Preheat broiler to high with rack on top shelf.

Preheat medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chopped bacon and cook until crisp.

Salt water for pasta and add spaghetti to the pot.  Cook to al dente, with a bite to it.

Season the steaks with salt and pepper on both sides and arrange on slotted broiler pan.

Remove bacon to paper towel lined plate with a slotted spoon and drain off most of the fat, return pan to heat and reduce heat to medium.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan and 1 tablespoon butter.  When butter melts into extra-virgin olive oil, add in 2 cloves garlic and the shallots, saute for 3 minutes.

Arrange steaks on the broiler pan.  Place under broiler ó leave door to oven cracked ajar to limit flare ups and smoke.  Cook 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare, up to 5 to 6 minutes on each side for medium-well doneness.

To the garlic and shallots, add in flour and cook a minute more.  Whisk in stock, bring to a bubble, about 30 seconds then stir in the cream.  When cream comes to a bubble, add in blue cheese and sage and a few grinds of black pepper.  Stir until cheese melts.  Reduce heat to lowest setting.

Soften 4 tablespoons butter in microwave on high for 15 seconds.  Mix in chives and 2 cloves minced garlic and reserve.

Remove steaks from oven and let rest 5 minutes.  Place 1/4 of the chive and garlic butter mixture on each steak to melt down over the meat as they rest.

Drain pasta and toss with sauce to coat and combine evenly.  Taste to adjust seasoning.

Serve steaks with pasta alongside.  Scatter the arugula and bacon bits across the top of the pasta.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1              small  savoy cabbage - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  1              bunch  scallions
  1                cup  snow peas
     1/4           cup  honey
  3        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  3        tablespoons  pickled ginger -- drained, sliced
                        thin found on Asian foods aisle
  1            package  store-bought shredded/julienne cut
                        carrots - (10 oz)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large plastic food storage bag, combine chicken cutlets with teriyaki sauce, 2 tablespoons oil and grill seasoning.  Close bag and combine to coat evenly.  Let stand 15 minutes.

Preheat an outdoor or indoor grill or grill pan to medium-high.

Cut cabbage into quarters and cut away core.  Shred the cabbage and set aside.  Cut clean, trimmed scallions into 3 inch lengths.  Pile scallions lengthwise and julienne them into thin strips.  Pull the threads from the ends of snow peas and julienne into thin strips, lengthwise, like the scallions.

Drizzle honey into a small bowl.  Add vinegar and combine with a fork.

Place chicken cutlets on grill or into hot pan and cook 3 minutes on each side.

Heat a nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons oil, 2 turns of the pan.  Add pickled ginger and cut carrots and stir-fry 2 minutes.  Add cabbage and stir-fry 2 minutes more.  Fluff and toss veggies with tongs so they stay dry and crisp while cooking.  Add scallions and snow peas and stir-fry another minute.  Add honey and vinegar combination, pouring it all around the pan in a slow stream.  Cook the liquids down 30 seconds more then turn off heat.  Continue to toss the slaw and season it up with salt and pepper to your taste.

Slice the chicken meat thinly on an angle.  Mound up 1/4 of the slaw on each plate and place the sliced chicken along side, edging its way up the slaw salad.  Serve immediately.

  1              quart  chicken stock
  2               cups  beef or vegetable stock
     1/3         pound  orecchiette or ditalini
  1              pound  ground veal
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano or Romano -- plus

                        Crusty bread -- for mopping

Bring a couple of inches of water to a boil in a medium skillet.  Add salt to boiling water and the broccoli rabe and cook 7 to 8 minutes.  Drain rabe and reserve.

While rabe cooks, heat a medium soup pot over medium to medium high heat with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil.  Add 3 cloves chopped garlic, carrots and onions.  Cook 5 to 6 minutes, add white beans and heat through, a minute.  Season veggies and beans with salt and pepper.  Add drained rabe and the stocks and cover pot to bring to a quick boil.  Add orecchiette and stir.  Reduce heat and simmer soup to a low-roll, uncovered.

Mix veal with egg, bread crumbs, cheese, sage and salt and pepper.  Roll into 1-inch balls and drop into stoup.  Cook 5 minutes.  Adjust seasonings and serve stoup in shallow bowls with crusty bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "Stoup" is thicker than soup and thinner than stew.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  curly pasta
                        = (campanelle or cavatappi by Barilla
                        recommended)
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
  1                     box frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1             medium  zucchini
  12                    cremini or baby portobello mushrooms -- sliced
  1             medium  onion -- thinly sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     roasted red pepper -- drained, pat dry,
                        quartered lengthwise then thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour - (rounded)
  1                cup  vegetable or chicken stock
  1                cup  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  grated fresh nutmeg
  1 1/2           cups  part skim ricotta cheese
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan -- plus
                        some to pass at the table
  1                cup  fresh basil leaves - (abt 20 leaves)

Heat a pot of water to a boil for pasta.  Salt boiling water and cook pasta to al dente.  Heads up: reserve a ladle of the hot cooking water just before you drain pasta.

Place the frozen spinach on a plate and microwave to defrost it according to your microwave's directions.  Place defrosted spinach in a clean kitchen towel and wring out the liquid.

Heat a deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil.  Halve the zucchini lengthwise then thinly slice into half moons and add to the pan along with the mushrooms.  Cook 2 to 3 minutes then add onions and garlic to the pan.  Season the vegetables with salt and pepper.  When the onions are tender, about 5 minutes, add defrosted spinach, separating into small bits as you handle it, and the roasted red peppers and toss to heat through.  Transfer veggies to a dish and return skillet to stove top.  Add remaining 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil and the butter.  When the butter melts into extra-virgin olive oil, add 2 rounded tablespoons of flour and cook a minute or so, then whisk in stock and milk.  Bring to a bubble and thicken the sauce, reducing it 2 to 3 minutes.  Season the sauce with salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Slide vegetables back into sauce.

Place the part-skim ricotta in a large shallow bowl and combine with a ladle of boiling, starchy pasta cooking water.  Stir to combine then add in a couple of handfuls of grated cheese.

Drain pasta and toss with cheeses.  Add half the vegetables and sauce to pasta and toss to combine.  Tear or shred basil and toss into pasta.  Adjust seasonings.  Top bowlfuls of Vegetable Not-sagna with remaining veggies in sauce and pass extra grated cheese at the table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
