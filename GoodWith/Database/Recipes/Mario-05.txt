Add garlic to pan with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and cook until light golden brown, about 2 to 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes, hot paprika and sherry and bring to a boil.

Place meatballs into sauce, lower heat and simmer about 20 minutes.  Serve either warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
  3               cups  Salsa Balsamella -- (see recipe)
                        === PESTO ONE ===

  3                     garlic cloves
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  3        tablespoons  freshly-grated Pecorino
  1                cup  Ligurian olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === PESTO TWO ===
  1                cup  pitted black ligurian olives
     1/4           cup  fresh basil leaves -- tightly packed
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
     3/4           cup  Ligurian extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino Sardo

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Roll the Basic Fresh Egg Pasta out to thinnest setting, cut into 3" squares, blanched 1 minute in boiling water and shocked in ice water.

On the bottom of 4 six-inch gratin dishes, place 2 tablespoons basil-bechamel mixture.  On top of that, lay one piece of pasta (in each dish).  On top of the pasta, place 2 tablespoons of Pesto Two.  Place a piece of pasta on top of the short stack.  Continue until all pasta and bechamel mixtures are used up (about 7 or 8 pieces high, topping with a dollop of basil bechamel).

Place in oven and bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until bubbly and slightly golden brown on top.  Serve immediately.

              Calamari With Olives And Mint, Adriatic Style

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh calamari, squid, or cuttlefish
  3             ounces  virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  mint leaves
     1/2           cup  small black olives
                        = (such as Nicoise)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To clean the calamari, wash and drain completely.  Pull the tentacles from each squid holding the sac part in one hand and the tentacles in the other.  The tentacles will remain attached to the inside flesh of the sac.  Cut the tentacles off just above the eyes.  Throw everything away from the eyes down.

Remove the hard beak part by squeezing the base of the tentacles and set the tentacles aside.  Leave the tentacles whole.  Remove the quill bone from the sac and any remaining innards and discard.  Peel off the reddish skin from the outside of the sac and rinse the inside and outside of sac under running water.  Cut sacs into 1/4-inch rounds.

In a 12- to 14-inch skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat and saute garlic until lightly browned, about 1 minute.  Add crushed red pepper and Basic Tomato Sauce, the cleaned calamari, mint leaves and black olives.

Lower the heat and simmer for 7 to 9 minutes until the calamari has turned opaque and yet is still tender.  Season with salt and pepper.  It may need more seasoning than you think.  Pour into heated serving dish and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  fryer chicken - (3 to 3 1/2 lbs) -- washed, patted dry
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             ounces  all-purpose flour
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1             medium  yellow onion -- chopped 1/2" dice
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped 1/2" dice
     1/2         pound  domestic mushrooms -- sliced in half
  10                    fresh sage leaves
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1              ounce  dry red wine
  3               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cut the chicken into 12 pieces.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.  Dredge chicken pieces lightly in flour, shaking off excess.

In a 12- to 14-inch heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the olive oil until just smoking.  Add 4 pieces of chicken at a time, skin-side down and cook until golden brown (about 5 minutes).  Turn the pieces over and brown the other side, also about 5 minutes.  Be careful not to burn the skin.  Remove from skillet, and place on a plate.  Repeat with the remaining chicken.

Add the onions, celery and domestic mushrooms to the oil and brown bits still in the pan and cook over medium heat until the onions are translucent and quite soft, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the sage, rosemary, red wine and Basic Tomato Sauce.  Bring to a boil.  Submerge the chicken pieces in the sauce, return to a boil and lower the heat.  Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes until the chicken is cooked through.

To check for doneness, insert a sharp knife into the thickest piece of chicken.  The juices should run clear and golden, not red or bloody.  Transfer to a heated serving dish.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     Cornish hens -- backbone removed,
                        split and flattened
  4        tablespoons  pomegranate molasses
  1         tablespoon  cumin seeds -- toasted, crushed
  1         tablespoon  coriander seeds -- toasted, crushed
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns -- crushed
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  4                     Russet potatoes -- peeled, halved
                        lengthwise, sliced into 1/4" half-moons
  1         tablespoon  hot paprika
  4        tablespoons  red wine vinegar

Check hens for quills and feathers and place breast-side up in a shallow dish.

In a small bowl, mix together pomegranate molasses, cumin, coriander, peppercorns and 4 tablespoons of the olive oil until blended and pour over hens.  Allow to marinate in refrigerator for 1/2 hour.  Turn hens over and marinate an additional half hour.

Preheat grill.

Meanwhile, remove hens from marinade and place on grill.  Cook until just pink at the leg bone, about 10 to 12 minutes per side.  Place potatoes on serving tray, place hens on top and serve.

                Green Strichetti With Porcini And Rosemary

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Mushrooms
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Green Pasta -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  salt
  2             ounces  unsalted butter
  2             ounces  virgin olive oil
     1/2        medium  red onion -- finely minced
  1              pound  porcini mushrooms -- sliced 1/8" slices
                        = (or use portobellos)
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan Reggiano cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the strichetti, roll out the pasta on your pasta machine to the thinnest setting.  Lay the sheet out on a cutting board and cut into 2-inch by 1-inch rectangles.  Pinch the center of each rectangle to form a bow tie shape.  Repeat this process until all the dough is used.  Set aside and cover.

Bring 6 quarts of water to boil add 2 tablespoons salt.

Heat the butter and olive oil in a 12- to 14-inch skillet or saute pan.  Saute the red onion over medium-high heat for 3 minutes, until softened but not browned.

Add the mushroom pieces and saute 5 minutes longer until light and golden brown.  Lower the heat to medium.  Add rosemary leaves and simmer 5 minutes.  Set aside.

Drop the pasta into the boiling water and cook 1 minute, or until al dente.  Cook longer if pasta had dried out.

Drain pasta in colander over sink and add hot pasta to skillet and toss to blend over medium heat, about 1 minute.  Add cheese and toss thoroughly to coat.

Season with salt and pepper.  Place in warm serving bowl and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

To make the strichetti, roll out the pasta on your pasta machine to the thinnest setting.  Lay the sheet out on a cutting board and cut into 2-inch by 1-inch rectangles.  Pinch the center of each rectangle to form a bow tie shape.  Repeat this process until all the dough is used.  Set aside and cover.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring 6 quarts of water to boil add 2 tablespoons salt.
</DirT>

Heat the butter and olive oil in a 12- to 14-inch skillet or saute pan.  Saute the red onion over medium-high heat for 3 minutes, until softened but not browned.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the mushroom pieces and saute 5 minutes longer until light and golden brown.  Lower the heat to medium.  Add rosemary leaves and simmer 5 minutes.  Set aside.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried Italian linguini or linguine fine
  1         tablespoon  Salt
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  crushed red chili flakes
  1              bunch  scallions - (abt 6) -- thinly sliced

Bring 6 quarts water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt.  Place linguini in boiling water.  The linguini should take 8 to 10 minutes to cook, more than enough time to assemble everything else you need to prepare if you are well organized.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan with angled sides, heat the Basic Tomato Sauce and crushed red chili flakes to a simmer.

When the pasta is al dente or cooked to your taste, drain the pasta in a colander over the sink.  Place the drained pasta into the saute pan with the sauce.  Carefully mix together by shaking the pan and minimally stirring the pasta with a pair of tongs.

Add the chopped scallions and bring heat to medium-high.  Saute and stir briefly for 30 seconds, just until the pasta is well coated and not soupy.  Pour into heated serving bowls.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings as a main course or 8 appetizers.

         Mezzalune Of Goat Ricotta Cheese With Green Onion Sauce

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Green Pasta -- (see recipe)
  8             ounces  fresh goat ricotta cheese -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- plus
  4        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley
  1              large  egg
                        Salt -- to taste, plus
  1         tablespoon  salt -- for cooking pasta
  1              pinch  ground nutmeg
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
  6             ounces  sweet butter

To make the filling:  Mix softened goat cheese with 1/4 cup of the grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, egg, pinch of salt, and a pinch of ground nutmeg until well blended with a moist, paste-like consistency.

Bring 4 quarts of water to a low boil and add the remaining 1 tablespoon salt.

Roll out all of the Green Pasta dough with pasta rolling machine until the dough is about 1/16-inch thick.  Using a large water glass or a wine glass that is about 3 inches in diameter, cut the pasta dough into rounds.  Cover the rounds with a damp dish towel.  Re-roll the remaining dough into a ball and pass through the pasta machine again until the pasta sheet is 1/16-inch thick.  Repeat cutting the dough into 3-inch rounds until all the dough is used.

Fill each round with 1/2 tablespoon of filling.  Fold each round in half and pinch closed, trying to remove any air pockets.  Continue this until all pasta rounds are completed.  Place the mezzalune in boiling water and slowly boil for 2 minutes, just until the pasta is tender.

Meanwhile place 6 tablespoons of butter in a large pan and melt until liquid.  Add scallions and saute until just soft, about 1 minute.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the mezzalune from the water and gently toss into the pan with the butter and scallion mixture.  Add the remaining 4 tablespoons Parmesan cheese and simmer for 30 seconds.  Place on a large warm serving platter and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  sugar -- divided
  1                cup  whipping cream
  3               cups  milk
                        Zest of 3 oranges
  4              whole  eggs
  9                     egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  dry red wine
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Orange segments
                        Freshly-chopped mint leaves

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

In a 2-quart saucepan, stir together 1 1/2 cups sugar and 3/4 cup water and place over medium heat until dissolved, about 1 minute.  Raise heat to medium-high and, watching carefully, cook until sugar turns to a deep golden-brown caramel, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Carefully divide the caramel into 8 six-ounce flan molds and allow to cool until firm.

Place cream and remaining cup of sugar into a non-reactive saucepan and place over low heat and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat and pour into a 4-quart mixing bowl.  Add milk, orange zest, eggs, yolks and red wine and whisk slowly until well blended, careful not to form a froth.

Ladle into the flan molds and place filled molds into a brownie pan.  Fill brownie pan to halfway up the sides of the molds with warm water and place into oven.  Cook 25 to 30 minutes until just set and remove.

Allow to cool, unmold carefully and serve with orange segments and freshly chopped mint leaves.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
     1/2        recipe  Green Pasta -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1              ounce  olive oil
  2                     shallots -- finely minced
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- cut 1/8" dice
     1/2           cup  freshly-shelled peas
                        = (frozen peas will do as well)
  4             ounces  sweet butter
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped lemon thyme leaves
  4             ounces  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley

Roll out each pasta in a pasta rolling machine, going all the way to the thinnest setting.  Cut each color pasta, with the pasta machine set at its widest cutting setting (about 1/2-inch wide).  Form into small nests and set aside until ready to cook.

In a large spaghetti pot, bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a large saute pan or skillet, heat one ounce of olive oil and over moderate heat saute the shallots until soft and translucent.  Add the prosciutto and peas, and continue cooking 1 minute more.  Add the butter and 4 ounces extra-virgin olive oil and heat until completely blended together.  Add the lemon thyme, remove from heat and let stand.

Combine the two color pastas together in the boiling water.  Cook until al dente (about 1 minute).  Drain the pasta in a colander over sink and pour the pasta into the saute pan with sauce.  Heat over moderate heat until the pasta is well coated and liquid has reduced.  The mixture should not be soupy.  Add the chopped parsley.  Place into heated serving bowl and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped rosemary leaves
  2                     anchovy fillets -- rinsed, patted dry,
                        and finely chopped
     1/2         pound  chicken livers -- rinsed, patted dry

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === POLVARONES ===
     1/2           cup  lard
     1/2           cup  butter
  2                     eggs
                        Zest of 1 orange
  3               cups  flour
  1                cup  ground almonds
                        === GLAZE ===
  6                     Dried figs
  2               cups  fresh orange juice
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        Zest of 3 oranges
                        Zest of 3 lemons
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

In a mixer, beat lard and butter to light ribbons, about 4 minutes.  Add eggs and orange zest and blend well, about 1 minute.  Add flour and almonds and just mix through, 1 to 2 minutes.  Place on floured work surface and roll to 1-inch thick.

Using a round pastry cutter, cut cookies 2 1/2 inches in diameter.  Grease a baking sheet and place cookies on sheet.  Place in oven and bake until light golden brown, about 20 to 22 minutes.  Remove and cool on rack.

Meanwhile, peel and stem figs and place flesh in small sauce pan with orange juice and sugar.  Reduce by 50 percent over medium heat, about 6 to 7 minutes.

Blend until smooth with submersion blender, adding more juice if necessary to achieve molasses-like texture.  Brush cookies with reduced orange juice mixture, sprinkle with zest, dust with powdered sugar and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Green Pasta -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  salt
                        === FILLING ===
  4              large  Russet potatoes -- baked until soft,
                        peeled and mashed
     1/2           cup  grated Pecorino-Romano cheese -- divided
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     extra-large egg -- lightly beaten
  4                     scallions -- sliced thinly
  1              pinch  grated nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SAUCE ===
  6             ounces  unsalted butter
  8                     perfect fresh sage leaves

To prepare the pasta:  Roll the Green Pasta dough into 4 sheets on the thinnest setting.  Take one sheet of pasta and place on a lightly-floured cutting board.  Cut each sheet into thirds lengthwise, then score each length in half and in half again yielding four 3-inch squares.  Cover with a towel.

To make the filling:  In a large mixing bowl, place the mashed potatoes, 1/4 cup of the Pecorino-Romano cheese, olive oil, egg, scallions, nutmeg and salt and pepper.  Mix together until well incorporated.  Set aside.

To assemble the ravioli:  Into each square place 1 scant tablespoon filling.  Fold opposing comers together to form a triangular pillow (remember to gently press out any air between the filling and the pasta dough).  If the pasta is a little dry, moisten the edges with a little water to help it adhere.  Be certain to seal the ravioli well on both flat sides or it will burst while cooking.

Repeat with the remaining sheets of green pasta.  Continue until pasta is all filled.  At the half way point, check to be sure that you're halfway in using the filling.  If not, adjust the quantity of filling for the remainder of pasta.

Bring 6 quarts water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

To make the sauce:  Melt the butter and sage at the same time over medium heat until just starting to bubble, set aside.  Gently drop the raviolis into boiling water and cook 3 to 4 minutes on a low boil, until the pasta is cooked through.

Remove from water with a slotted spoon and place into pan with butter and sage.  Simmer for 1 minute over low heat.  Sprinkle with remaining Pecorino cheese.  Place into a warm serving platter.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- for dusting
  4                     extra-large eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste

Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil and tomato paste.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs, oil and tomato paste and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when 1/2 of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands primarily.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits.

Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

This recipe yields 1 pound of pasta.

Comments:  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are essential for a light pasta.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  turkey breast -- raw, skin removed
  4               cups  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1                     white cabbage head - (1 1/2 to 2 lbs)
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped 1/2" dice
     1/4         pound  sliced bacon -- chopped 1/2" dice
     1/4         pound  porcini, oyster or portobello mushrooms
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped flat leaf parsley
  3            bunches  tarragon -- leaves removed
  1                cup  basil tomato sauce
                        = (store bought or homemade)

Cut turkey into quarters and place in 6-quart saucepan with chicken stock and vinegar.  Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer until very tender, about 45 to 50 minutes.  Remove turkey pieces carefully and set aside to cool, leaving stock still bubbling in the pot.

Remove cabbage leaves from core and cook 4 at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, until tender and flexible.  Remove, allow to cool in bowl or in cool water and continue until all the leaves are blanched.  Strain and save the cooking liquid.  In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat oil until just smoking.  Add onion and bacon and cook until soft and light golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Pull turkey apart into 2-inch long shredded pieces.  Slice mushrooms 1/4-inch thick and add to onion pan and cook until softened and fragrant.  Add turkey pieces and cook until heated through, about 5 to 6 minutes, and season with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.  Add parsley and two-thirds of the tarragon and stir through.

Place drained cabbage leaves on table and place 2 to 3 tablespoons of the turkey mixture in the lower center of each leaf.  Roll up like a burrito to form a package and place, folded side down, into another 12- to 14-inch saute pan.  Add 3 cups of cool cooking liquid and the tomato sauce and shake sauce off of top.  Sprinkle with remaining tarragon.  Bake 35 minutes.  Remove and serve, 2 pieces per plate.

     1/2        medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  dry white wine
  4             ounces  sweet butter
  2                     radicchio heads -- core removed,
                        cut into 1/2" ribbons
