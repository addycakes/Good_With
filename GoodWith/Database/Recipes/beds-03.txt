  1                can  pork and beans - (10 lbs)
     1/2           cup  Worcestershire Sauce
  1                cup  shredded pork barbecue

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This group of recipes creates an incredible menu of Southern Barbecue as it was prepared several generations ago.  It was passed down to me from my Aunt Dora Simmons (we're all from Memphis, TN), who had received it from her family.  This is the same Barbecue as it was prepared by Leonard's Barbecue on Old Highway 51 South in Memphis.  As a former schoolmate and neighbor of Elvis Presley, we enjoyed this type of food often.  ...Peggy Mosley

Comments:  This group of recipes creates an incredible menu of Southern Barbecue as it was prepared several generations ago.  It was passed down to me from my Aunt Dora Simmons (we&apos;re all from Memphis, TN), who had received it from her family.  This is the same Barbecue as it was prepared by Leonard&apos;s Barbecue on Old Highway 51 South in Memphis.  As a former schoolmate and neighbor of Elvis Presley, we enjoyed this type of food often.  ...Peggy Mosley

                             Berries Chicken

Recipe By     :Submitted by The Combes Family Inn, Ludlow, VT
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     chicken boneless skinless breasts
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  chopped onions
  3        tablespoons  raspberry jelly
     1/2           cup  fresh blackberries
  3        tablespoons  apple-cider vinegar
     1/4           cup  heavy cream

Cut chicken breasts in half.  Saute in butter for about 5 minutes over medium heat, then turn chicken.  Add onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes more.  Remove chicken and keep warm.

Add jelly, blackberries, and vinegar.  Scrape pan and stir.  Boil 1 minute to slightly reduce liquid.  Add cream and heat.  Pour sauce over chicken.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Both blackberries and red raspberries are very abundant in our area.  Bushes line East Lake Road and Red Bridge Road by our backyard.  I freeze the berries whole to use year round.  I've used frozen berries when I forget to thaw them out.  You can easily substitute fresh raspberries or frozen thawed berries.

     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  water
  2             pounds  tzukini
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
     1/4           cup  chopped ginger
                        === SKIN ===
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  cold water
     1/2           cup  flour -- to prevent
                        sticking during kneading

  1                     bowl for mixing the filling
  1                     bowl for mixing the skin
  1                     big board for kneading the skin

                   Chicken And Sun-Dried Tomato Sausage

Recipe By     :Submitted by The Gaslight Inn, Gettysburg, PA
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Sausage

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  boneless chicken thighs with skin
  12            ounces  onions -- peeled, quartered
  7             ounces  red or yellow sun-dried tomatoes -- soaked in hot water
                        to soften (15 minutes), then drained
  2        tablespoons  coriander seed -- plus
  2        tablespoons  fennel seed -- plus
  2        tablespoons  rosemary -- plus
  2        tablespoons  oregano -- all ground together
  1         tablespoon  celery seed
  1         tablespoon  thyme
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt

Grind the chicken and skins through a 1/4-inch plate, then grind the sun-dried tomatoes and onions.  Mix all this into a large bowl along with the spices and salt, kneading and squeezing until all ingredients are well blended.

For links, stuff the meat into hog casings and twist or tie at desired intervals; or shape into patties.  Will keep refrigerated for 3 days or frozen for 2 months.

When cooking a batch for a houseful of guests, the hosts at the Gaslight Inn bake the links on a cookie sheet, pricking the skins of the links and draining once or twice, until the sausage is cooked through.  Alternatively, the sausage can be browned in a skillet.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This tender and savory sausage is a hit with guests as a treat for breakfast, hors d'oeuvres, or part of a bistro charcuterie plate.  It is time-consuming and messy to make, so it's best to do a big batch and freeze it to have it on hand.

                        === SAUCE ===
  4                     ripe peaches
  2               cups  white wine
     1/4           cup  sugar

  1 1/2            cup  hazelnuts -- ground fine
  1                cup  crackermeal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
  1                     egg white
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch

  1           teaspoon  minced gingerroot
  3          teaspoons  minced fresh garlic
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
  2                     canned chipoltes
  1              bunch  cilantro
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  honey
                        === PORK ===
  2                     pork tenderloins - (abt 3 lbs)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  rum
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  half-and-half
                        === APPLE TOMATILLO SAUCE ===
  15                    tomatillos -- paper skins removed
  1             medium  onion -- large diced
  3                     garlic cloves
  1              large  apple -- cored, sliced
  1         tablespoon  oil
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  calvados -- (optional)

Marinade:  Combine all of the marinade ingredients in the bowl of the food processor or blender.  (May be made 24 hours ahead and refrigerated until needed.)

Pork:  Two hours before cooking, spread marinade over both tenderloins, cover, and refrigerate.

Preheat oven broiler.  Saute the onions in olive oil until they are tender.  Transfer pork to a shallow roasting pan and add the broth, rum, and vinegar.  Place in oven on second rack and broil ten minutes, turning once.  Turn the oven to 375 degrees and cook an additional 20 minutes, until center is barely pink.  Remove the tenderloins from the pan and cover loosely with foil.

Meanwhile, return the onions to medium-high burner and add half-and-half, stirring to combine.  Slice the tenderloins and top with onions.  Serve with warm Apple Tomatillo Sauce.

Apple Tomatillo Sauce:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  In a small roasting pan or cast-iron skillet, toss the tomatoes, onion, garlic, and apple, first with the olive oil to coat, then with the sugar.  Place in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes until the tomatillos break their skins, but are still green, and onions are translucent.  Remove and add calvados to hot pan, if desired, tossing with the vegetables.  Puree with a food processor or a blender.  This can be made the day before and reheated.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Cooking for guests at the lodge is always tricky when it comes to spices; however, I have found this recipe to satisfy both spice lovers and jalapeÃ’o haters.  While chipolte marinade adds a little kick to the pork itself, the onions and cooking liquid temper it, and the apple tomatillo sauce is the perfect cooling compliment.  ... Elizabeth Turney

Comments:  This group of recipes creates an incredible menu of Southern Barbecue as it was prepared several generations ago.  It was passed down to me from my Aunt Dora Simmons (we're all from Memphis, TN), who had received it from her family.  This is the same Barbecue as it was prepared by Leonard's Barbecue on Old Highway 51 South in Memphis.  As a former schoolmate and neighbor of Elvis Presley, we enjoyed this type of food often.  ...Peggy Mosley

  2             pounds  Jimmy Dean sausage

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  soldier beans
  1              small  onion
     1/2         pound  salt pork
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Put beans in a colander.  Rinse thoroughly, clean, and pick out bad beans.  Soak beans overnight, covering well with water.

Peel onion and place in the bottom of the pot.  Drain beans and fill pot approximately half full of beans.  Slash the salt pork and place in the center of the pot.  Put in the remainder of the beans until the pot is almost full.  Add salt, sugar, and dry mustard, one at a time in this order.  Fill the pot with water to cover the salt, sugar, and mustard, leaving a little room for expansion.

Cover the pot and put in a preheated 350 degree oven for 2 hours.  Check from time to time for water level; add more water as required.  Take cover off pot after 2 hours and add the pepper.  Leave uncovered and continue to cook approximately another hour until beans are soft but not mushy.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Elwin, who is no longer with us, dreamed up this recipe as a result of his wife refusing to accommodate his mother's New England tradition for beans and franks on any given Saturday night.  We think he did a great job!

Comments:  My mother, Mary Friederike Steigmeyer, was born in 1892 in the small village of Attica, Ohio.  Her second cousin, Verena Hall, also born in Attica, was a few years younger.  Neither woman had siblings, so they became like sisters.  Upon my mother's marriage to my father, Don Armitage, my parents settled in Bucyrus, Ohio, and her cousin, upon her marriage to Paul Schwemley, settled in Marion, Ohio.  These towns are only 17 miles apart, so we often visited each other.  I looked forward to visiting the Schwemleys.  Verena was an excellent cook, Paul liked to tell jokes, and they had the game of Pick-up-Sticks.  My mother, too, was known as an excellent cook.  For my sixteenth birthday, I remember requesting ham loaf and corn bread. ... Barbara Mahony

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pork loin - (abt 5 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  18             small  new potatoes
  3        tablespoons  red currant jelly
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh rosemary
                        (or 3/4 tspn dried rosemary)
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard - (to 3 tspns)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Sprinkle pork loin with salt and pepper and place on rack in shallow roasting pan.  Bake in the center of the oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours (about 25 to 30 minutes per pound) or until meat thermometer reads 165 degrees.

Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil.  If potatoes are small, leave them in the juices to coat well.  Turn potatoes occasionally so they brown evenly.

In a small saucepan, combine jelly, rosemary and two tablespoons of wine and warm over low heat until the jelly melts.  Stir in mustard.  About 1/2 hour before pork is done cooking, brush with the glaze.  Brush with glaze about every thirty minutes.

About ten minutes before the roast is done, sprinkle garlic over potatoes.  When meat has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees, remove meat to a cutting board, cover lightly with foil, and let rest 15 minutes.  Remove potatoes from pan and keep warm.

Skim fat from juices in pan.  Stir in remaining wine and boil sauce on top of stove for 2 to 3 minutes.  Carve meat and arrange slices on serving platter.  Surround with potatoes and garnish with sprigs of rosemary.  Turn sauce into sauce boat and pass with the pork.

For Sauce:  Melt 1 stick butter in saucepan, add salt, flour, sour cream, and Parmesan cheese, cooking over low heat until thickened.  Set aside.

Place one square puff pastry on lightly floured board.  Place 1 tablespoon cheese sauce in the center of pastry.  Place sauteed chicken breast in center and wrap pastry around it, sealing the edges with water on your fingertips; wrap all four breasts.

Place chicken seam-side down in baking pan sprayed with cooking spray.  They should not touch each other or sides of pan.  Just before baking, brush pastry top with a little egg wash (beat one egg with a little water).  Bake at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes or until golden brown.

Meanwhile, thin cheese sauce in the saucepan by adding 2 to 3 tablespoons white wine, and warm.  Just before serving, pour small amount of warmed sauce over baked chicken, and sprinkle with chopped, fresh parsley to garnish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              small  to medium size peaches
  4                     boneless chicken breast halves -- with or without
                        skin
  2        tablespoons  flour -- seasoned with

  1              pinch  dried tarragon or sprig fresh tarragon
  3             ounces  peach brandy
     1/3           cup  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream

                        Portabello Breakfast Caps

Recipe By     :Submitted by Kangaroo House Bed & Breakfast, Eastsound, WA
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast                       Mushrooms
                Pork                            Sausage


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  red bell pepper
  2             medium  Portabello mushrooms - (abt 5" dia)
  6                     fresh spinach leaves -- washed
  4             ounces  Jones All Natural Roll Sausage
  4              large  eggs
  1               dash  Tabasco hot pepper sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  snipped fresh chives
     1/2           cup  shredded cheddar cheese -- divided
  1           teaspoon  butter
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Over a gas flame, char the red bell pepper, then place in a plastic food bag.  Seal and allow to stand about 10 minutes, then peel away charred skin.  Cut open pepper and remove stem, ribs, and seeds, reserving the flesh.  If prepared in advance, refrigerate until needed.

Remove the stems and gills from the Portabello mushrooms and reserve for other uses.  Place prepared mushroom caps on baking sheet and roast in oven for approximately 20 minutes.

While the mushroom caps are roasting, briefly steam spinach just to wilt in a separate pan or microwave on High for approximately 1 minute; set aside.  Saute sausage until brown.  Drain and set aside.

In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, hot pepper sauce, salt and pepper, and chives.  In a non-stick skillet or omelet pan, melt butter, then add egg mixture and scramble to moist scramble stage.  Add browned sausage and 1/4 cup grated cheddar to eggs and combine just to melt cheese.  Avoid letting eggs get too dry.

Assembly:  Line each mushroom cap with a layer of the wilted spinach leaves, then a layer of roasted red pepper.  Divide the scrambled egg/sausage mixture evenly on top of the mushrooms.  Sprinkle with remaining cheddar and Parmesan cheeses and return to oven long enough to melt cheese, approximately 1 to 2 minutes.

To serve:  With a serrated knife, slice each mushroom cap in half and separate slightly to display layers to good advantage.  Garnish with fresh, vine-ripened tomato slices and fresh herbs.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  A treat to the eye as well as the palate, multi-colored vegetable layers cradle scrambled eggs and sausage in a roasted mushroom cap, topped with melted cheeses.  Helen won First Prize for the Northwest Region in the Jones Dairy Farm cooking contest with this recipe created in the Kangaroo House kitchen.

Categories    : Accompaniment                   Pancakes
                Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  vegetable oil
  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  paprika -- plus a bit more
                        for sprinkling
  1 3/4         pounds  baking potatoes -- peeled
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  applesauce

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Heat 1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil in a heavy non-stick skillet.  Add the onions and saute over medium-low heat until softened, about 10 minutes; if pan becomes dry during sauteing, add 1/2 tablespoon water.  Add 1 teaspoon paprika; stir to blend and remove from the heat.  Let cool.

Coarsely grate the potatoes using the large grater of a food processor or a hand grater.  Put the grated potatoes in a large strainer and squeeze out excess liquid.  Transfer the potatoes to a bowl.  Add the sauteed onions, eggs, salt, and pepper.

Oil 12 non-stick muffin pans (one 12-cup pan), making sure to oil edges of bases.  Using a 1/3 cup measure, add scant 1/3 cup potato mixture to each muffin pan.  Smooth tops lightly.  Spoon 1/4 teaspoon oil over each, then shake a little paprika on top.

Bake about 45 minutes or until brown at edges and firm.  Remove from oven and run a small, sturdy rubber spatula around the edges of the muffins to release them.  You can then leave them in the pan 15 to 30 minutes to keep hot.

Serve hot, accompanied by applesauce if desired, or serve with "Andouille Hash" (see recipe).

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  These savory latkes are baked instead of fried to save quite a bit of fat.  If you are serving them in a meatless meal, you can substitute a small dollop of nonfat sour cream and a pinch of snipped chives for the applesauce.

     1/2           cup  butter or margarine -- (butter preferred)
  2        tablespoons  dried rosemary
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced

                              Sausage Bread

Recipe By     :Submitted by Betsy's Bed & Breakfast, Montpelier, VT
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  all-purpose flour - (approximate)
  1            package  dry yeast - (1 tbspn)
  2               cups  hot water
     1/3           cup  butter or margarine -- melted
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1                     sweet Italian sausage link
  1                     hot Italian sausage link
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        dried oregano -- to taste
                        dried basil -- to taste
                        dried tarragon -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  chopped green bell pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped red bell pepper
  1 1/2           cups  grated Mozzarella cheese
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water

In a large bowl or in a food processor, combine 3 cups of flour and the yeast.  In a separate bowl, combine the water, butter or margarine, sugar, and salt and add to the dry ingredients, mixing well.  Add 1 cup of the flour and blend well.  Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough leaves the sides of the bowl.  (At this point, you will have used about 5 cups flour.

Remove the dough from the bowl and knead by hand on a lightly floured surface, adding flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic.  (If you mixed the dough by hand, the kneading will take about 5 to 8 minutes.  If you mixed the dough in a food processor, only a brief kneading is necessary.)

Altogether you will use about 6 cups flour, but each loaf is different, so don't rely too heavily on the measurements.  Add just enough flour to take out the stickiness.  Let the dough rest under a clean towel while you prepare the filling for at least 15 minutes.

Remove the casings from the sausages and brown the meat in a skillet with the onion and garlic.  Season to taste with oregano, basil, tarragon, salt, and pepper, if desired.  (Since the sausage is already seasoned, you may not want to add more.)  Drain the sausage on several layers of paper towels or a clean cloth.

Combine the green and red bell pepper and cheese in a medium-sized bowl and toss with the 3 tablespoons of flour.  Add the drained sausage mixture an toss again.

Knead the dough briefly in a little more flour and divide it into 2 pieces.  Roll each piece into a rectangle approximately 15 by 12 inches.  Sprinkle each rectangle with half the sausage mixture, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides.  Starting with a long side near you, roll each rectangle tightly into a jelly roll.  Pinch the seams and both ends to seal.  Place the loaves in an ungreased French bread pan or on a cookie sheet.  Cover with a clean towel and let rise for about 1 hour.

Brush the loaves with the egg white-water mixture and bake in a preheated 425 degree oven until they are light and shiny brown, approximately 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and place on wire racks to cool.  Note: Be sure to keep refrigerated because it has meat in it.

This recipe yields 2 loaves.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ham                             Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  sweet potato or yam -- peeled, chunked
  1         tablespoon  oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled, diced
  2                     shallots -- peeled, diced
     3/4      teaspoon  dried basil
  1                cup  sliced mushrooms
     1/2           cup  chopped red pepper
  1              small  tomato -- chopped, seeded,
                        and drained
     1/2      teaspoon  celery salt
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry dough -- thawed
  6             slices  Jones Dairy Farm ham
     1/2           cup  grated Monterey Jack cheese with
                        jalapeÃ’o peppers
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISH ===
                        Diced red, orange, and yellow peppers
                        Minced parsley

In a saucepan, cover sweet potatoes with water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and cook until tender (about 15 minutes).  Drain, transfer to a mixing bowl, and mash coarsely.

Heat oil in saute pan over medium heat.  Add onion, garlic, shallots, and basil and saute for 2 minutes.  Add mushrooms and red pepper and cook for about 7 minutes or until mushroom liquid has evaporated.  Add sauteed vegetables to the sweet potatoes along with the tomato, celery salt, and lemon juice, and combine gently.  (Filling may be prepared to this point and covered and refrigerated overnight.  Remove from refrigerator and allow to warm slightly before proceeding.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lay sheet of pastry dough on floured surface and cut into thirds lengthwise, then cut each third in half crosswise.  Roll into six 6-inch squares.  Center one slice of ham on each of six squares.  Spoon 1/6 of filling onto each square, top with a generous tablespoon of cheese, then pull up the corners of each square, twisting to secure.  Flare out corners to resemble a purse.

Brush egg wash over purses and place on ungreased baking pan.  Bake for 30 minutes until golden.

Serve immediately garnished with pepper "jewels" and parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  chickens
                        Finely-chopped fresh herbs such as
                        thyme, oregano, parsley, and sage
  2                     onions - (1 for each chicken) -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
                        Salt and pepper (6 to 1 mix)
     1/2         bunch  flat leaf parsley
                        Kkosher salt -- to taste

When all the chicken if off the bone add the parsley leaves, the pan liquid, and kosher salt to taste, pack into a plastic lined terrine mold.  Using a "press" the size of the top of the mold press the chicken over night in the refrigerator.  (Use cans to weigh the press down).

Roast the skin until crisp and cut or break for use as cracklings on the terrine.  Serve the sliced terrine with the cracklings and mayonaise on a bed of lettuce.

                        Spicy Sausage And Potatoes

Recipe By     :Submitted by Durbin Street Inn Bed & Breakfast, Casper, WY
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork
                Sausage

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  mild Italian Sausage - (6 links)
  10             small  new red potatoes -- quartered
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme leaves
  1                cup  red onion in 1/8" thick slices
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  1                     green pepper -- cut into 1" pieces
  1                     garlic clove -- minced

Cut sausage into 1-inch pieces, and marinate overnight in 1/2 cup Chianti.  In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet combine sausage, potatoes, pepper, thyme, and garlic.  Cook over medium to high heat, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are browned (10 to 12 minutes).

Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover; cook until potatoes are tender (8 to 19 minutes).  Stir in remaining ingredients.  Continue cooking, uncovered, until vegetables are crispy tender (4 to 5 minutes).  Serve from skillet.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Use Johnsonville Italianti Sausage with Chianti wine, or just add up to 1/2 cup Chianti wine to any good Italian Sausage before cooking.  I usually serve with scrambled eggs, fresh garden tomatoes in summer, and wheat scones or cornbread.

  3                     shallots -- minced
     1/2           cup  minced onions
  1                     celery stalk -- finely chopped
  1                cup  finely-chopped peeled cored apple
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  cassis liquor

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     eggs
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  apple cider
  2               cups  coarse fresh bread crumbs
  2               cups  ground hazelnuts

For the Apple Cider Sauce:  Boil sparkling cider to reduce to 1 cup.  In another saucepan, boil vinegar and cassis to reduce to 1/4 cup.  Combine reduced cider, reduced vinegar mixture, brandy, and chicken stock and boil to reduce to 3/4 cup.

Add cream and simmer briskly to reduce until mixture thickens and coats a wooden spoon, about 20 minutes.  Salt and pepper to taste.

For Chicken Beasts:  Between sheets of waxed paper, pound chicken breasts to flatten.

Saute garlic, shallots, celery, and apple in butter over medium-low heat until soft, but not brown (about 10 minutes).  Allow to cool.  Mix in 2 eggs, cream, and cider.  Mix in bread crumbs.  Season with salt and pepper.

Spread stuffing over chicken breasts.  Place a teaspoon of cream cheese on top of stuffing.  Beginning with widest part, roll up breasts firmly.  Beat 2 eggs; mix hazelnuts and crackermeal.  Dip stuffed chicken breasts in eggs, then in hazelnut crackermeal mixture.

Heat oil.  When hot, brown chicken breasts.  Place on cookie sheet.  Bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until thermometer reaches internal temperature of 165 degrees.  Place on serving dish.  Spoon apple cider sauce over top.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        Stuffed Whole Loin Of Pork

Recipe By     :Submitted by Casa del Granjero, Albuquerque, NM
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  5               cups  dried bread crumbs
  1                cup  chopped fresh parsley
  1              stick  butter
  1              large  white onion -- minced
  1                cup  minced celery
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth
  1              pound  lean ground sausage -- browned, drained,
                        and crumbled
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  1              whole  boneless loin of pork -- deep pockets
                        cut every 2" or so
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  apricot jam

In a large bowl, place the Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, and parsley.  Mix the ingredients together and set them aside.

In a large skillet, place the stick of butter and heat it on medium until it is melted and hot.  Add the onions and celery, cook them for 5 minutes, or until the onions are translucent.  Reduce the heat to low.  Add the chicken broth and sausage, and cook them for 10 minutes on low heat.  Add the contents of the skillet to the bread crumb mixture and mix them together well.  Add the eggs and blend them in well.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate the dressing for 1 hour, or until it is cool.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Loosely stuff several tablespoons of the dressing in each pocket of the pork loin (do not overstuff because the stuffing will expand as it cooks).  On a rack in a large baking pan, place the stuffed pork loin.  Add 1 inch of water to the bottom of the pan.  On the dull side of the aluminum foil, rub on the 2 tablespoons of butter.  With the buttered side next to the meat, make a tent of the foil and place it over the pork, being careful not to let the foil touch the meat.

Roast the pork loin for 1 1/2 hours or until it is done.  Remove the foil and discard it.  Brush the pork loin with the apricot jam.  Return the roast to the oven and cook it for 10 minutes more or until the jam is bubbly.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  This is a wonderful special occasion dish, because not only does it taste delicious, but the presentation is spectacular.  The stuffing puffs up out of the pork and the whole thing looks like a golden crown.  Bake any remaining stuffing in a small casserole dish and serve it on the side.  ...Victoria Farmer

                        Teal Lake Pork Tenderloin

Recipe By     :Submitted by Ross' Teal Lake Lodge, Hayward, WI
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     juniper berries -- crushed
     1/2           cup  brandy
  1                cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2                     bay leaves
  3                     tenderloins of pork

Combine all ingredients except pork to make marinade.  The marinade can be saved and reused; it improves with keeping.  Marinate pork for two days before serving.

Broil on charbroiler or under strong broiler until 50 percent blackened.  (The stripes of a charbroiler are preferable, but for appearance only.)  Bake further 10 minutes at 400 degrees, or microwave for 3 minutes.

Slice on diagonal, about 1/2-inch thick.  Garnish and serve with apple rings, apple sauce, baked apples, etc.

This recipe yields 6 servings.  This recipe can be doubled, tripled etc. depending on serving needs.

Comments:  Our recipe for pork tenderloin, used in the resort season, derives from an old Venison recipe used by Thomas Jefferson at Monticello.  It marinates for 2 days, so think ahead!  The herbal flavor of the juniper berries is perky -- but a bottle of juniper berries will last a lifetime!  ...Prudence Ross

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3             pounds  pork (shoulder is best) -- cut into cubes
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2              large  sweet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into cubes
  1                cup  dry wine (can substitute beer)
  2               cups  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar -- see * Note 1
  3               cups  coarsely-chopped onions
     1/4           cup  Italian parsley
  6                     garlic cloves -- finely minced, (more
                        if your partner can stand it)
  2        tablespoons  cumin
     1/2           cup  fresh corn
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped cilantro
  3                     finely-chopped chile peppers - (to 4) -- see * Note 2

* Note 1:  Vary amount of vinegar by your taste preference, but if you decrease the amount of any liquid, make up for it in another liquid.

* Note 2:  Vary number of chiles by taste and tolerance -- I like JalapeÃ’os or SerraÃ’os

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Heat olive oil in skillet or wok and brown pork.  Add the chopped onions, garlic and chili peppers toward the end of the browning just to get them warmed up.

Place the whole mixture in a flameproof casserole.  Coat the mixture with the flour, warming it under low heat for 2 to 3 minutes and remove it from heat.  Add the sweet potatoes, wine, chicken stock and corn.  Mix well and bake in the oven for about 1 hour.

Remove from the oven and add black pepper and cumin.  This is also a good time to adjust for taste in terms of relative spicy-ness, adding more chilies!  Bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, adding more liquid (beer) if necessary.  The consistency should be that of a thick stew.  If it is too loose, heat uncovered for 10 minutes.

After cooking, add the cilantro, retaining a little for garnish.  If you find you've overdone it on the chilies, try adding a dollop of sour cream when you serve it.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Suggestions:  The recipe will make about 6 medium-sized portions, which is not enough if you are having folks over, because people will go back for more.  Like most chili dishes, the flavors improve ("proof") with age so I freeze a batch and save it for a rainy day.  In Santa Fe, they serve this with puffy bread, but I like it best with corn bread and several cold beers!  The flavors are robust, so a lager or pilzner beer goes best with this, or perhaps a light-tasting white wine.

Comments:  Many people think of chili in the context of Tex Mex food.  In fact, chili peppers play a major role in food preparation practices around the world.  There are tens of thousands of recipes for "Chili" using a wide variety of ingredients and combinations.  Often these variants are adapted to locally available ingredients and preferences.  This recipe is adapted from my experiences in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  It is unusual in that unlike most American chili recipes that are based on beef and beans, it uses pork and sweet potatoes.  This unusual combination results in a wonderful flavor that is both sweet and hot -- hence the reason I have named it "Two Spirits."  ...Michael Clatts

                 Whole Roasted Chicken With Cherry Sauce

Recipe By     :Submitted by Jeronimo Resort & Conference Center, Walker Val
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  chicken - (2 1/2 to 3 1/2 lbs)
  1                cup  oleo/margarine
                        Salt -- as needed
  2               cups  seasoned bread stuffing
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Paprika -- to taste
                        Sage -- to taste
     1/2           cup  apple sauce
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped
                        === CHERRY SAUCE ===
  1                cup  cran-cherry juice
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  6             ounces  canned black cherries

Melt oleo or margarine in saucepan.  Salt inside of chicken.  Saute onions with margarine in skillet.  Add chopped celery, apple sauce, salt, pepper, sage, and sauteed onions to bread stuffing.

Put foil in baking pan and place stuffed chicken in pan with melted margarine.  Rub margarine over entire chicken.  Liberally sprinkle paprika over chicken.  Place raw chicken fat atop breast bone -- this aids in assuring that top of chicken will not overcook and in basting.  Place in oven at 350 degrees for approximately 2 hours.

For the Cherry Sauce:  Mix cornstarch with juice; cook until thick.  Add canned cherries and serve over chicken.

Serve with glazed carrots, home-made apple sauce, and salad.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.
