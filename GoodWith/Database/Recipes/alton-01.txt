                          'Instant' Pancake Mix

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
                        = (check expiration date first)
  3          teaspoons  baking powder
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        === 'INSTANT' PANCAKES ===
  2                     eggs -- separated
  2               cups  buttermilk
  4        tablespoons  melted butter
  2               cups  'Instant' Pancake Mix -- (listed above)
  1              stick  butter -- for greasing pan
  2               cups  fresh fruit such as blueberries -- if desired

For the Mix:  Combine all of the ingredients in a lidded container.  Shake to mix.  Use the mix within 3 months.  (Makes mix for 3 batches of pancakes)

For the Pancakes:  Heat an electric griddle or frying pan to 350 degrees.  Heat oven to 200 degrees.

Whisk together the egg whites and the buttermilk in a small bowl.  In another bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the melted butter.

Combine the buttermilk mixture with the egg yolk mixture in a large mixing bowl and whisk together until thoroughly combined.  Pour the liquid ingredients on top of the pancake mix.  Using a whisk, mix the batter just enough to bring it together.  Don't try to work all the lumps out.

Check to see that the griddle is hot by placing a few drops of water onto to the griddle.  The griddle is ready if the water dances across the surface.

Lightly butter the griddle.  Wipe off thoroughly with a paper towel.  (No butter should be visible.)

Gently ladle the pancake batter onto the griddle and sprinkle on fruit if desired.  When bubbles begin to set around the edges of the pancake and the griddle-side of the cake is golden, gently flip the pancakes.  Continue to cook 2 to 3 minutes or until the pancake is set.

Serve immediately or remove to a towel-lined baking sheet and cover with a towel.  Hold in a warm place for 20 to 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 12 pancakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3             pounds  combined beef shank and oxtail pieces
  2                     onions -- quartered
  2                     celery ribs -- halved
  2                     carrots -- halved
  3                     garlic cloves
  1              bunch  parsley
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns
  2             quarts  water

Place pressure cooker over high heat.  Oil and salt the oxtail and shank pieces then sear in batches.  Add remaining ingredients and cover with water, being careful not to fill above the cooker's "maximum fill" line.  (If your pressure cooker does not have a water line, fill the pot 2/3 full).  Bring to a boil and skim off any foam that gathers at the surface.  Cover and lock lid.  Once pressure builds up inside the cooker, reduce the heat so that you barely hear hissing from the pot.  Cook for 50 minutes.

Release pressure using your cookers release device (read that manual) or cool the cooker by running cold water over the lid for 5 minutes.  Carefully open the lid and strain squeezing the solids before feeding to the compost pile, or the dogs.  Strain through a fine sieve or several layers of cheesecloth.  Season and serve or use as a base for other soup recipes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Place pressure cooker over high heat.  Oil and salt the oxtail and shank pieces then sear in batches.  Add remaining ingredients and cover with water, being careful not to fill above the cooker's &quot;maximum fill&quot; line.  (If your pressure cooker does not have a water line, fill the pot 2/3 full).  Bring to a boil and skim off any foam that gathers at the surface.  Cover and lock lid.  Once pressure builds up inside the cooker, reduce the heat so that you barely hear hissing from the pot.  Cook for 50 minutes.

<DirT>
Release pressure using your cookers release device (read that manual) or cool the cooker by running cold water over the lid for 5 minutes.  Carefully open the lid and strain squeezing the solids before feeding to the compost pile, or the dogs.  Strain through a fine sieve or several layers of cheesecloth.  Season and serve or use as a base for other soup recipes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  oats
     3/4           cup  flour
     2/3           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
  1              pinch  kosher salt
  1              stick  cold unsalted butter -- diced
  4                     Braeburn apples
                        = (Fuji will substitute)
  4          teaspoons  honey

In a bowl combine all the dry ingredients and diced butter.  Rub mixture briskly between finger tips until it forms small moist clumps in a loose sandy mixture.  Refrigerate while preparing the apples.

Cut a small layer off the bottom of each apple to create a flat, stable bottom surface.  With a small paring knife, cut a cylindrical cone out of the top of the apple, moving about 1-inch outside of the core, similar to removing the top of a pumpkin when carving a Jack O'Lantern.  Remove the top and discard.  With a melon baller or a teaspoon, remove the remaining core and seeds taking care not to puncture the base of the apple.

Place apples on a baking sheet or pie dish and fill each center with a teaspoon of honey.  Spoon in mixture, packing lightly until heaped and overflowing over sides of the apples.

Bake in oven at 350 degrees on the top or middle rack for 40 minutes or until filling is golden brown and the tip of a paring knife can be inserted into the side of the apple with little or no resistance.  Let apples stand for 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BASIC CARAMEL SOFTWARE ===
  2               cups  sugar
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup

  1              batch  caramel
  2               cups  heavy cream
                        === BANANA BRULEE SOFTWARE ===
  4                     bananas
                        Sugar for coating
                        === ADDITIONAL SPLITSVILLE SOFTWARE ===
                        Ice cream of your choice -- for serving
                        === HARDWARE ===
  1              Small  heavy saucepan
                        Clean soup spoon
                        Candy thermometer
                        = (technically optional, but we suggest
                        you use one until you get the hang of
                        things)
                        Parchment paper
  2                     sheet pans
                        = (or other heatproof surface)
                        Aluminum foil
                        Cooling rack
                        Butane torch
                        = (available at most hardware stores/
                        darned handy)
                        Safety goggles
                        = (available at most hardware stores)
                        Plastic squirt bottle
                        = (available at most grocery stores)

Combine the sugar, water, and corn syrup in a small, heavy saucepan and place over high heat.  As soon as the sugar has dissolved, heat your thermometer under warm tap water (to prevent thermal shock) and attach to side of pan, making sure that the bulb is completely submerged.  Do not stir the mixture or agitate the pan at this stage.

When the mixture reaches 230 degrees, reduce the heat to medium and allow the sugar to color gradually.  As the temperature approaches 300 degrees the color will start to turn to amber.  At this point, it's safe to swirl the pan gently to help distribute the heat evenly.  As the caramel heads towards 340 degrees, it will reach a deep amber color.

Remove the pan from the heat and slowly stir with a metal spoon, allowing it to cool until the caramel falls from the spoon in a solid stream, like a string.  When it does, it's doodad time.

Form doodads by holding the spoon 12 to 16 inches over the caramel and drizzling the patterns on the parchment.  (Hint: allow the spoon to unload into the pan for a few seconds before attempting doodad.  This will allow a narrower stream.)  Quick back and forth motions or side to side movements are best.  It's all in the wrist.  Allow doodads to cool for 15 minutes then peel the paper off (not the other way around).  Stack in an airtight container with wax paper between each piece.

After making 15 to 20 doodads, you should have sufficient caramel remaining to move on to the sauce phase.  So, return the remaining caramel to medium-high heat and continue cooking until you see the first sign of smoke.  Immediately remove from the heat, and add the cream, all at once, at arms length.  (It will boil furiously.)  Once the mixture calms down, return to medium heat and boil 3 more minutes, stirring occasionally.  Cool to room temperature, move to squirt bottle and refrigerate for up to a week.

To make the bananas brulee, quarter the bananas (peel on) and rub into sugar to coat thoroughly.  Remove peel and place on cooling rack over several layers of foil.  (Don't try this on your dining room table.)  Don your safety goggles and fire up your torch.  Hold the torch so that the very tip of the flame barely touches the banana, and move quickly back and forth until the sugar melts, turns brown, and bubbles.  As soon as it looks like caramel, move on.  You know you've got it down when a solid, glasslike sheet of gold (no graininess) has formed on the banana.

To do the split (so to speak), squirt a pattern of caramel sauce on a chilled plate, top with 4 banana pieces (Lincoln log style), top with the ice cream of your choice (we like our Peachy Vanilla, see recipe), and finally, a doodad.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2                onion -- diced
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2            pinches  kosher salt
  8               ears  fresh corn
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary -- bruised
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  turmeric
  2        tablespoons  yellow cornmeal
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a saucepan over medium heat, sweat the onion in butter and salt until translucent.

In a large mixing bowl, place a paper bowl in the middle of the bowl.  Resting the cob on the bowl in a vertical position remove only the tops of the kernel with a knife, using long smooth downward strokes and rotating the cob as you go.  After the cob has been stripped, use the dull backside of your knife to scrape any remaining pulp and milk off the cob.

Add the corn and pulp mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium high until the juice from the corn has tightened.  Add the rosemary.  Sprinkle the corn with the sugar and turmeric.  Stir constantly for about 2 minutes.

Sprinkle the cornmeal onto the corn, using a whisk to combine well.  Add the heavy cream and cook until the corn has softened, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the rosemary.  Season with freshly ground black pepper.

This recipe yields 3 cups.

                        semi-soft combo like smoked gouda and
                        Gruyere or Fontina with a young Asiago.
                        If you're a purist, go for the Cheddar,
                        but make it sharp and aged if possible.)
                        Good quality olive oil -- for spritzing

Find 2 heavy skillets that will nest together.  Two (10-inch) cast-iron skillets are ideal.  Heat them over high heat.

Meanwhile, spread mustard on one slice of bread.  Distribute the cheese evenly over the mustard, season with fresh black pepper and top with second piece of bread.

Spritz the bread surface that's staring up at you with olive oil using either a Misto or a pump sprayer.  A light coat will do, don't soak.

When the pans are hot enough to vigorously sizzle a drop of water, remove them from the heat and place the sandwich, top-side down in the middle of one pan.  (If your pans are a different size, this would be the smaller one.)  Spritz the slice now facing you, as well as the bottom of the other skillet.  Lay the skillet right on top of the sandwich.  If the top pan isn't cast-iron, weigh it down with a brick, can, or something of similar heft.

Wait patiently, crack a beer.  When you hear the first bit of cheese run out and sizzle on the pan, it's done.  This will take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes.

Carefully remove the top skillet, (you may need to coax it off with a spatula, but I doubt it).  Just look at it.  It's perfect...better than mom's (no reason to tell her).

Remove to a plate, count to 10 and slice it in half.  Take a bite.  Take another.  So they lost... there's always next year.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dried black beans
     1/2                celery stalk
     1/2                carrot
                        A few sprigs fresh thyme
                        A few sprigs fresh parsley
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2                onion
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/3           cup  lime juice
  1                     red onion -- minced
                        A handful fresh cilantro -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Tie the celery, carrot, thyme, parsley, and bay leaf into a bundle using cotton butcher's twine.  Place the beans, bundle, and onion into a pot.  Add just enough water to barely cover the beans.  Bring to a simmer, partially cover, and cook for 1 to 2 hours until beans are barely tender.

After 30 minutes, add the salt to the beans.  Occasionally check on the beans and add water to cover the beans, if needed.

When beans are just barely tender, drain them and remove the carrot bundle.  Toss the beans while hot with the olive oil, lime juice, onion, cilantro, cumin, and chili powder.  Chill thoroughly and season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  black peppercorns
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1                     lemon -- zested
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Onions -- cut 3" to 4" pieces
                        Carrots -- cut 3" to 4" pieces
                        Celery -- cut 3" to 4" pieces
  1                     broiler/fryer chicken - (3 to 4 lbs)
  1                cup  red wine
  8             ounces  chicken stock
  2             sprigs  thyme - (to 3)
                        Canola oil -- as needed

Position the oven rack 8 inches from the flame/coil and turn broiler to high.  Crack peppercorns with a mortar and pestle until coarsely ground.  Add garlic and salt and work well.  Add lemon zest and work just until you can smell lemon.  Add just enough oil to form a paste.

Check out your refrigerator for onions, carrots and celery that are a little past their prime.  Cut vegetables into pieces and place in a deep roasting pan.

Place chicken on a plastic cutting board breast-side down.  Using kitchen shears, cut ribs down one side of back bone and then the other and remove.  Open chicken like a book and remove the keel bone separating the breast halves by slicing through the thin membrane covering it, then by placing two fingers underneath the bone and levering it out.

Turn chicken breast-side up and spread out like a butterfly by pressing down on the breast and pulling the legs towards you.  Loosen the skin at the neck and the edges of the thighs.  Evenly distribute the garlic mixture under the skin, saving 2 teaspoons for the jus.  Drizzle the skin with oil and rub in, being sure to cover the bird evenly.  Drizzle oil on bone side of chicken as well.

Arrange bird in roasting pan, breast up, atop vegetables.

Place pan in oven being sure to leave the oven door ajar.  Check bird in 10 minutes.  If the skin is a dark mahogany, hold the drumstick ends with paper towels and flip bone-side up.  Cook 12 to 15 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.  Juices must run clear.  Remove and place chicken into a deep bowl and cover loosely with foil.

Tilt pan so that any fat will pool at corner.  Siphon this off with a bulb baster.  (This fat is great in vinaigrettes).  Set pan over 2 burners set on high.  Deglaze pan with a few shots of red wine and scrape brown bits from bottom using a carrot chunk held with tongs.  Add chicken stock, thyme, the remaining garlic paste and reduce briefly to make a jus.  Strain out vegetables and discard.  Slice chicken onto plates or serve in quarters.  Sauce lightly with jus and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Position the oven rack 8 inches from the flame/coil and turn broiler to high.  Crack peppercorns with a mortar and pestle until coarsely ground.  Add garlic and salt and work well.  Add lemon zest and work just until you can smell lemon.  Add just enough oil to form a paste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Check out your refrigerator for onions, carrots and celery that are a little past their prime.  Cut vegetables into pieces and place in a deep roasting pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place chicken on a plastic cutting board breast-side down.  Using kitchen shears, cut ribs down one side of back bone and then the other and remove.  Open chicken like a book and remove the keel bone separating the breast halves by slicing through the thin membrane covering it, then by placing two fingers underneath the bone and levering it out.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn chicken breast-side up and spread out like a butterfly by pressing down on the breast and pulling the legs towards you.  Loosen the skin at the neck and the edges of the thighs.  Evenly distribute the garlic mixture under the skin, saving 2 teaspoons for the jus.  Drizzle the skin with oil and rub in, being sure to cover the bird evenly.  Drizzle oil on bone side of chicken as well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange bird in roasting pan, breast up, atop vegetables.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place pan in oven being sure to leave the oven door ajar.  Check bird in 10 minutes.  If the skin is a dark mahogany, hold the drumstick ends with paper towels and flip bone-side up.  Cook 12 to 15 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.  Juices must run clear.  Remove and place chicken into a deep bowl and cover loosely with foil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tilt pan so that any fat will pool at corner.  Siphon this off with a bulb baster.  (This fat is great in vinaigrettes).  Set pan over 2 burners set on high.  Deglaze pan with a few shots of red wine and scrape brown bits from bottom using a carrot chunk held with tongs.  Add chicken stock, thyme, the remaining garlic paste and reduce briefly to make a jus.  Strain out vegetables and discard.  Slice chicken onto plates or serve in quarters.  Sauce lightly with jus and serve.
</DirT>

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Desserts                        Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  half-and-half
  1                cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  peach preserves (not jelly)
  1                     vanilla bean -- split and scraped
  1              pinch  kosher salt
  4             medium  peaches -- halved, seeded,
                        and grilled or broiled until brown

Combine all ingredients (including the bean and its pulp), except peaches, in a large saucepan and place over medium heat.  Attach a frying or candy thermometer to inside of pan (see comments below).  Stirring occasionally, bring the mixture to 170 degrees.  Remove from heat and strain into a lidded container.  Cool mixture, then refrigerate mixture overnight to mellow flavors and texture.

Freeze mixture in ice cream freezer according to unit's instructions.  The mixture will not freeze hard in the machine.  Meanwhile, chop peaches roughly.  Once the volume has increased by 1/2 and reached a soft serve consistency, add the peaches and continue turning to incorporate.  Spoon the mixture back into a lidded container and harden in the freezer at least 1 hour before serving.

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 quarts.

Comments:  If you do not have a thermometer, bring the mixture just barely to a simmer.  As soon as you see a bubble on the surface, remove it from the heat.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE FRIES ===
  1             gallon  safflower oil
  4              large  Russet potatoes
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        === FOR THE BATTER ===
  2               cups  flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1               dash  Old Bay Seasoning
  1             bottle  brown beer -- cold
                        === FOR THE FISH ===
  1 1/2         pounds  firm-fleshed whitefish -- cut 1-oz strips
                        = (tilapia, pollock, cod)
                        Cornstarch -- for dredging

Heat oven to 200 degrees.

Heat the safflower oil in a 5-quart Dutch oven over high heat until it reaches 320 degrees.

Using a V-slicer with a wide blade, slice the potatoes with the skin on.  Place in a large bowl with cold water.

In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, cayenne pepper, and Old Bay seasoning.  Whisk in the beer until the batter is completely smooth and free of any lumps.  Refrigerate for 15 minutes.  Note: The batter can be made up to 1 hour ahead of time.

Drain potatoes thoroughly, removing any excess water.  When oil reaches 320 degrees, submerge the potatoes in the oil.  Working in small batches, fry for 2 to 3 minutes until they are pale and floppy.  Remove from oil, drain, and cool to room temperature.

Increase the temperature of the oil to 375 degrees.  Re-immerse fries and cook until crisp and golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on roasting rack.  Season with kosher salt while hot and hold in the oven.

Allow oil to return to 350 degrees.  Lightly dredge fish strips in cornstarch.  Working in small batches, dip the fish into batter and immerse into hot oil.  When the batter is set, turn the pieces of fish over and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Drain the fish on the roasting rack.  Serve with malt vinegar.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate chips
  1              stick  butter
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4                     eggs
                        Butter -- to coat muffin tin
  1         tablespoon  cocoa powder
  1                cup  vanilla ice cream
  1           teaspoon  espresso powder

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  whipping cream
  12            ounces  quality semi-sweet chocolate chips
  3             ounces  espresso or strong coffee
  1         tablespoon  dark rum
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1           teaspoon  flavorless granulated gelatin

Chill 1 1/2 cups whipping cream in refrigerator.  Chill metal mixing bowl and mixer beaters in freezer.

In top of a double boiler, combine chocolate chips, coffee, rum and butter.  Melt over barely simmering water, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat while a couple of chunks are still visible.  Cool, stirring occasionally to just above body temperature.

Pour remaining 1/4 cup whipping cream into a metal measuring cup and sprinkle in the gelatin.  Allow gelatin to "bloom" for 10 minutes.  Then carefully heat by swirling the measuring cup over a low gas flame or candle.  Do not boil or gelatin will be damaged.  Stir mixture into the cooled chocolate and set aside.

In the chilled mixing bowl, beat cream to medium peaks.  Stir 1/4 of the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture to lighten it.  Fold in the remaining whipped cream in two doses.  There may be streaks of whipped cream in the chocolate and that is fine.  Do not over work the mousse.

Spoon into bowls or martini glasses and chill for at least 1 hour.  Garnish with fruit and serve.  (If mousses are to be refrigerated overnight, chill for one hour and then cover each with plastic wrap)

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  24             large  shrimp - (15/20 ct) -- peeled, deviened,
                        and butterflied
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  4                     egg whites
  2 1/2           cups  sweetened shredded coconut
                        = (or 2 1/2 cups shredded fresh coconut)
                        Canola or peanut oil -- for frying
                        === PEANUT SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  chicken stock
  3             ounces  unsweetened coconut milk
  1              ounce  lime juice
  1              ounce  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
                        = (or 2 to 3 anchovies, ground)
  1         tablespoon  hot sauce
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped ginger
  1 1/2           cups  creamy peanut butter
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro

Pat the shrimp dry with a paper towel.  In a small bowl combine cornstarch, salt, pepper, and cayenne.  In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until foamy.  In another bowl, place the coconut.  Coat the shrimp with the cornstarch and shake off any excess.  Dip into the egg white and then press into the coconut to get full coverage.  Try to keep 1 hand dry, this will keep things a little cleaner.

In a large pan, heat the oil to 350 degrees and gently submerge the shrimp, 6 at a time.  Fry for about 3 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove them to a rack to drain.  Serve with Peanut Sauce.

Peanut Sauce:  In a food processor, puree the chicken stock, coconut milk, lime juice, soy sauce, fish sauce, hot sauce, chopped garlic, and ginger.  Add the peanut butter and pulse to combine.  Fold in the cilantro and keep refrigerated until ready to serve.

Bring sauce to room temperature and serve with coconut shrimp.  (Makes approximately 2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  lukewarm espresso
                        = (or strong black coffee)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  coffee flavored liqueur
  1           teaspoon  orange or lemon zest

Combine all ingredients and stir until sugar melts.  Pour mixture into 9- by 13-inch metal pan and place on level shelf in freezer for half an hour.  (Mixture should only come about 1/4-inch up the side of the pan.)

Remove and use a dinner fork to scrape any ice crystals that have formed on the side or bottom of the pan.  Return to freezer and repeat scraping every 20 to 30 minutes for 3 to 4 hours.

Once mixture is thoroughly frozen, fluff with a fork and allow flakes to "dry" in freezer another half hour before serving.  When served, the granita should look like a fluffy pile of dry brown crystals.

Scoop into goblets and top with barely sweetened whipped cream, add additional citrus zest if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
  1                cup  half-and- half
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        An assortment of jams, preserves, or
                        dessert sauces such as:
                        Blueberry jam
                        Apricot preserves
                        Butterscotch ice cream topping
                        Hot fudge ice cream topping
  6                     eggs

Heat oven to 350 degrees.

In the saucepan, combine the milk, half-and-half, vanilla, and sugar.  Bring to a bare simmer over medium-low heat.

Next, place 1 to 2 tablespoons of each topping into each of 8 custard cups.  The topping should come a few millimeters up the side of the custard cup.

Separate 3 of the eggs using a slotted spoon.  Reserve the whites.  (Note: Freeze the whites in ice trays.  After the whites are frozen, place the frozen cubes into zip-top freezer bags.  The frozen whites can be frozen up to a year.)

Place a mixing bowl on a rubber pad or a wet towel to prevent the bowl from spinning out of control.  In a mixing bowl, combine the remaining whole eggs and the yolks.  Whip the eggs with a whisk until slightly thickened and lightened in color.  While whisking the eggs, drizzle in about a quarter of the hot milk.  Now whisk the tempered eggs back into the saucepan with the remaining milk mixture.

Place a fine mesh strainer over a glass or stainless steel bowl with a spout.  Pour the egg mixture through the strainer in order to catch any curdled egg bits or particles that may be in the mixture.

Place the custard cups into a roasting pan large enough to accommodate the 8 custard cups with at least 1 inch to spare around.  Evenly distribute the custard into the custard cups, going short on the first pass.  Place the pan on the middle rack of the oven and pour boiling water into the pan just under the level of the custard.

Cook the flans for about 40 minutes, or until they wobble slightly when the pan is wiggled, about 40 minutes.  You can also insert a paring knife midway between the edge and the center.  If it comes out clean, the flans are done.  Using tongs, remove the cups from the pan to a towel-lined sheet pan.  Allow the water in the roasting pan to cool before discarding.  Cool, cover and chill.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                               Fondue Vudu

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Fondue

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     garlic clove -- halved
  1             bottle  hard apple cider - (12 oz)
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  brandy
  1              pinch  kosher salt
  5             ounces  Gruyere -- grated (2 cups)
  5             ounces  Smoked Gouda -- rind removed,
                        and grated (2 cups)
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- plus
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  curry powder
                        Several grinds fresh-ground black pepper

Rub inside of fondue pot or heavy small saucepan with garlic.  Pour cider into pot.  Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, the brandy and salt and bring to a simmer over medium heat.

Meanwhile, grate the cheese and toss well with the cornstarch in a large bowl.  When the cider just begins to simmer, gradually add the cheese a handful at a time, allowing each addition to melt completely before adding the next.  Continue adding cheese and stirring until all cheese is incorporated, about 3 minutes.  If mixture starts to bubble, reduce heat to low.

The mixture is ready when creamy and easily coats the back of a spoon.  Stir in curry powder and pepper.  If cheese seems stringy, add some or all of the remaining lemon juice.  Move fondue pot to alcohol warmer, and keep stirring during service.

A variety of breads, from pumpernickel to rye to bagel chunks can be skewered and dipped as can cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms and potatoes.  (Soften all vegetables by blanching briefly in boiling water then chilling.)  Crisp fruits such as apples make great fondue fodder, as do cooked meats and sausages.  Even soft pretzels make for good dipping.  If any fondue is left over, cover with ice water and refrigerate, pour off water and reheat over low heat.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  golden raisins
  1                cup  currants
     1/2           cup  sun-dried cranberries
     1/2           cup  sun-dried blueberries
     1/2           cup  sun-dried cherries
     1/2           cup  dried apricots -- chopped
                        Zest of one lemon -- chopped coarsely
                        Zest of one orange -- chopped coarsely
     1/4           cup  candied ginger -- chopped
  1                cup  gold rum
  1                cup  sugar
  5             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks)
  1                cup  unfiltered apple juice
  4                     whole cloves -- ground
  6                     allspice berries -- ground
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  2                     eggs
     1/4           cup  toasted pecans - (to 1/2) -- broken
                        Brandy for basting and/or spritzing

Combine dried fruits, candied ginger and both zests.  Add rum and macerate overnight, or microwave for 5 minutes to re-hydrate fruit.

Place fruit and liquid in a non-reactive pot with the sugar, butter, apple juice and spices.  Bring mixture to a boil stirring often, then reduce heat and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool for at least 15 minutes.  (Batter can be completed up to this point, then covered and refrigerated for up to 2 days.  Bring to room temperature before completing cake.)

Heat oven to 325 degrees.

Combine dry ingredients and sift into fruit mixture.  Quickly bring batter together with a large wooden spoon, then stir in eggs one at a time until completely integrated, then fold in nuts.  Spoon into a 10-inch non-stick loaf pan and bake for 1 hour.  Check for doneness by inserting toothpick into the middle of the cake.  If it comes out clean, it's done.  If not, bake another 10 minutes, and check again.

Remove cake from oven and place on cooling rack or trivet.  Baste or spritz top with brandy and allow to cool completely before turning out from pan.

When cake is completely cooled, seal in a tight sealing, food safe container.  Every 2 to 3 days, feel the cake and if dry, spritz with brandy.  The cake's flavor will enhance considerably over the next two weeks.  If you decide to give the cake as a gift, be sure to tell the recipient that they are very lucky indeed.

This recipe yields 10 slices.

                            French Onion Soup

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10                    sweet onions (like Vidalias)
                        = (or a combination of
                        sweet and red onions)
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  white wine
  10            ounces  canned beef consume
  10            ounces  chicken broth
  10            ounces  apple cider
                        = (unfiltered is best)
  1                     bouquet garni
                        = (thyme sprigs, bay leaf and parsley)
  1                     loaf country-style bread
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        A splash of Cognac -- (optional)
  1                cup  grated Fontina or Gruyere cheese

Trim the ends off each onion then slice from end to end.  Remove peel and finely slice into half-moon shapes.

Set electric skillet to 300 degrees and add butter.  Once butter has melted add a layer of onions and sprinkle with a little salt.  Repeat layering onions and salt until all onions are in the skillet.  Do not try stirring until onions have sweated down for 15 to 20 minutes.  After that, stir occasionally until onions are dark mahogany and reduced to approximately 2 cups.  This should take 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Do not worry about burning.

Add enough wine to cover the onions and turn heat to high, reducing the wine to a syrup consistency.  Add consume, chicken broth, apple cider and bouquet garni.  Reduce heat and simmer 15 to 20 minutes.

Place oven rack in top 1/3 of oven and heat broiler.

Cut country bread in rounds large enough to fit mouth of oven safe soup crocks.  Place the slices on a baking sheet and place under broiler for 1 minute.

Season soup mixture with salt, pepper and cognac.  Ladle soup into crocks leaving one inch to the lip.  Place bread round, toasted side down, on top of soup and top with grated cheese.  Broil until cheese is bubbly and golden, 1 to 2 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     broiler/fryer chicken -- cut into 8 pieces
  2               cups  low fat buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  Hungarian paprika
  2          teaspoons  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        Flour -- for dredging
                        Vegetable shortening -- for frying

Place chicken pieces into a plastic container and cover with buttermilk.  Cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.

Melt enough shortening (over low heat) to come just 1/8-inch up the side of a 12-inch cast-iron skillet or heavy fry pan.  Once shortening liquefies raise heat to 325 degrees.  Do not allow oil to go over 325 degrees.

Drain chicken in a colander.  Combine salt, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper.  Liberally season chicken with this mixture.  Dredge chicken in flour and shake off excess.

Place chicken skin-side down into the pan.  Put thighs in the center, and breast and legs around the edge of the pan.  The oil should come half way up the pan.  Cook chicken until golden brown on each side, approximately 10 to 12 minutes per side.  More importantly, the internal temperature should be right around 180 degrees.  (Be careful to monitor shortening temperature every few minutes.)

Drain chicken on a rack over a sheet pan.  Don't drain by setting chicken directly on paper towels or brown paper bags.  If you need to hold the chicken before serving, cover loosely with foil but avoid holding in a warm oven, especially if it's a gas oven.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Place chicken pieces into a plastic container and cover with buttermilk.  Cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt enough shortening (over low heat) to come just 1/8-inch up the side of a 12-inch cast-iron skillet or heavy fry pan.  Once shortening liquefies raise heat to 325 degrees.  Do not allow oil to go over 325 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain chicken in a colander.  Combine salt, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper.  Liberally season chicken with this mixture.  Dredge chicken in flour and shake off excess.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place chicken skin-side down into the pan.  Put thighs in the center, and breast and legs around the edge of the pan.  The oil should come half way up the pan.  Cook chicken until golden brown on each side, approximately 10 to 12 minutes per side.  More importantly, the internal temperature should be right around 180 degrees.  (Be careful to monitor shortening temperature every few minutes.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain chicken on a rack over a sheet pan.  Don't drain by setting chicken directly on paper towels or brown paper bags.  If you need to hold the chicken before serving, cover loosely with foil but avoid holding in a warm oven, especially if it's a gas oven.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

                Meatloaf

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  garlic-flavored croutons
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2                onion -- roughly chopped
  1                     carrot -- peeled and broken
  3              whole  garlic cloves
     1/2                red bell pepper
  18            ounces  ground chuck
  18            ounces  ground sirloin
  1 1/2       teaspoon  kosher salt
  1                     egg
                        === FOR THE GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  catsup
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1               dash  Worcestershire sauce
  1               dash  hot pepper sauce
  1         tablespoon  honey

Heat oven to 325 degrees.

In a food processor bowl, combine croutons, black pepper, cayenne pepper, chili powder, and thyme.  Pulse until the mixture is of a fine texture.  Place this mixture into a large bowl.

Combine the onion, carrot, garlic, and red pepper in the food processor bowl.  Pulse until the mixture is finely chopped, but not pureed.

Combine the vegetable mixture, ground sirloin, and ground chuck with the bread crumb mixture.  Season the meat mixture with the kosher salt.  Add the egg and combine thoroughly, but avoid squeezing the meat.

Pack this mixture into a 10-inch loaf pan to mold the shape of the meatloaf.  Onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, turn the meatloaf out of the pan onto the center of the tray.  Insert a temperature probe at a 45 degree angle into the top of the meatloaf.  Avoid touching the bottom of the tray with the probe.  Set the probe for 155 degrees.

Combine the catsup, cumin, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce and honey.  Brush the glaze onto the meatloaf after it has been cooking for about 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     frozen young turkey - (14 to 16 lbs)
                        === FOR THE BRINE ===
  1                cup  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
  1             gallon  vegetable stock
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns
     1/2    tablespoon  allspice berries
     1/2    tablespoon  candied ginger
  1             gallon  iced water
                        === FOR THE AROMATICS ===
  1                     red apple -- sliced
     1/2                onion -- sliced
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1                cup  water
  4                     rosemary sprigs
  6                     sage leaves
                        Canola oil -- as needed

Combine all brine ingredients, except ice water, in a stockpot, and bring to a boil.  Stir to dissolve solids, then remove from heat, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.

Early on the day of cooking, (or late the night before) combine the brine and ice water in a clean 5-gallon bucket.  Place thawed turkey breast-side down in brine, cover, and refrigerate or set in cool area (like a basement) for 6 hours.  Turn turkey over once, half way through brining.

A few minutes before roasting, heat oven to 500 degrees.  Combine the apple, onion, cinnamon stick, and cup of water in a microwave safe dish and microwave on high for 5 minutes.

Remove bird from brine and rinse inside and out with cold water.  Discard brine.

Place bird on roasting rack inside wide, low pan and pat dry with paper towels.  Add steeped aromatics to cavity along with rosemary and sage.  Tuck back wings and coat whole bird liberally with canola (or other neutral) oil.

Roast on lowest level of the oven at 500 degrees for 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and cover breast with double layer of aluminum foil, insert probe thermometer into thickest part of the breast and return to oven, reducing temperature to 350 degrees.  Set thermometer alarm (if available) to 161 degrees.  A 14 to 16 pound bird should require a total of 2 to 2 1/2 hours of roasting.

Let turkey rest, loosely covered for 15 minutes before carving.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Categories    : Condiments                      Gravies
                Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  red wine
  2               cups  beef, chicken, or vegetable broth
  1                     bay leaf
  5                     black peppercorns - (to 6)
  2        tablespoons  White Roux -- (see recipe)

Remove roast from pan and pour off any fat.  Place over high heat (use 2 burners if necessary) and deglaze pan with wine and broth, scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula.  Once these solids are dissolved, pour liquid into a saucepan and add the bay leaf and peppercorns.  Reduce for 5 minutes over high heat or until reduced by 1/3.

At this point you basically have a jus which could be used to sauce your roast.  To create a gravy, reduce the heat to medium and whisk in 2 tablespoons of white roux.  Return to a simmer, whisking constantly.  Continuing to cook once a simmer has been reached will result in a smoother sauce, but not a thicker one.

Since all starch thickened sauces thicken as they cool, it's a good idea to make your gravy a little on the loose side.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

Remove roast from pan and pour off any fat.  Place over high heat (use 2 burners if necessary) and deglaze pan with wine and broth, scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula.  Once these solids are dissolved, pour liquid into a saucepan and add the bay leaf and peppercorns.  Reduce for 5 minutes over high heat or until reduced by 1/3.
</DirT>
<DirT>
At this point you basically have a jus which could be used to sauce your roast.  To create a gravy, reduce the heat to medium and whisk in 2 tablespoons of white roux.  Return to a simmer, whisking constantly.  Continuing to cook once a simmer has been reached will result in a smoother sauce, but not a thicker one.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Since all starch thickened sauces thicken as they cool, it's a good idea to make your gravy a little on the loose side.

                          Grilled Salmon Steaks

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon steaks, 1" thick
  1           teaspoon  whole cumin seed
  1           teaspoon  whole coriander seed
     1/2      teaspoon  whole fennel seed
  1           teaspoon  dry green peppercorns
                        Sea salt or kosher salt -- to taste
                        Canola or olive oil -- to coat steaks

Prepare grill by lighting 4 quarts of charcoal (1 starter chimney's worth), or turning gas grill to medium-high.

Examine steaks for pin bones by rubbing fingers over surface of meat.  If found, remove with bone tweezers or pliers reserved for culinary uses.

Using a sharp paring or boning knife, trim bones from the cavity side of the steak.  Trim the stomach flaps so that 1 side is missing about 2 inches of skin and the other, 1 inch of meat.  Roll the skinless section up into the hollow of the cavity, then wrap the other around the outside to form a round resembling a filet mignon.  Tie in place with 2 passes of butcher's twine.  (Do not tie it too tight or fish will pop out during cooking.)

Combine cumin, coriander, fennel and peppercorns on a double thick piece of aluminum foil and toast over grill, shaking gently until seeds become fragrant.  Crush seeds in mortar and pestle or pour into spare pepper grinder.  Coat steaks lightly with oil, season with salt, then liberally grind toasted seeds on both sides of steaks.

Quickly wipe hot grill grate with a rag or towel dipped in a little Canola oil, then grill fish to medium-rare, about 3 minutes per side.  (Fish should be well colored on the outside and barely translucent at the center.

Serve steaks alongside simple salad dressed with "Veni, Vedi, Vinaigrette" (see recipe).

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                     loaf day old Italian bread
  3                     garlic cloves -- mashed
  9        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt -- plus

Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  pompano fillets
                        = (or other firm white fish fillet)
     1/2         pound  bay scallops
                        Vegetable oil -- for coating
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3             ounces  fresh lime juice - (abt 3 limes)
  1             medium  solo papaya -- halved and seeded
  1                cup  finely-diced Vidalia onion
  4                     serrano peppers -- seeded and diced
  1              small  jalapeÒo -- seeded and diced
  2                     plum tomatoes -- seeded and diced
     1/2           cup  chopped cilantro
  2             ounces  tomato juice
  1         tablespoon  white wine Worcestershire sauce
     1/2    tablespoon  capers
  1         tablespoon  Mexican-style hot sauce
                        Tortilla Chips -- as accompaniment
                        === PINK PICKLED ONIONS ===
  8             ounces  champagne vinegar
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2                     serrano chiles -- seeded
  2             medium  red onions -- thinly sliced

Cut the fish into pieces resembling the size of the scallops.  Separately toss the seafood with a little oil and season with salt and pepper.

In a saute pan over high heat, sear the fish and scallops, about 30 seconds on each side.  The middle should still be raw.  Work in batches so you don't overcrowd the pan.  Place seafood into a glass dish and coat with lime juice.  Glass is best, as it won't react with the acid in the juice.  Marinate, refrigerated, overnight.

Remove the flesh from 1/2 a papaya and cut into medium dice.  Slice the remaining 1/2 into long strips.  Next day, pour off the lime juice and gently fold the drained fish and scallop mixture together with remaining ingredients and diced papaya.  Serve with tortilla chips, sliced papaya, and Pink Pickled Onions.

Pink Pickled Onions:  In a small saucepan, bring the vinegar, sugar, and chiles to a boil.  Stir until sugar is dissolved.  Remove from heat.  In a plastic container, place the sliced onions and pour the liquid over them.  Place the container in an ice bath to cool.  Serve chilled with meats and seafood.  These are also great on sandwiches.  (Makes about 2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  key lime preserves
  1                     lemon -- zested and juiced
  1                     lime -- zested and juiced
  4               cups  lime flavored club soda
                        = (or seltzer)

Combine sugar, preserves and 1 cup of the soda in a medium saucepan and stir over low heat until sugar and preserves are melted.  Add citrus juice and zest.  Stir in the remaining soda, move to a clean, lidded container and chill thoroughly, 2 to 3 hours.

Turn mixture in ice cream maker per maker's instructions or until mixture reaches the consistency of a firm slush.  Return mixture to lidded container and harden in freezer 1 hour before serving.

If sorbet is to be held frozen for longer than 2 hours, move from freezer to refrigerator for about half an hour before serving.  If you'd like a more assertive sorbet, double the amount of citrus zest.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 quarts.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     egg yolks
  1                cup  sugar
  4                     lemons -- zested and juiced
  1              stick  butter -- cut into pats and
                        chilled

Add enough water to a medium saucepan to come about 1-inch up the side.  Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.

Meanwhile, combine egg yolks and sugar in a medium-size metal bowl and whisk until smooth, about 1 minute.  Measure citrus juice and if needed, add enough cold water to reach 1/3 cup.  Add juice and zest to egg mixture and whisk smooth.

Once water reaches a simmer, reduce heat to low and place bowl on top of saucepan.  (Bowl should be large enough to fit on top of saucepan without touching the water.)  Whisk until thickened, approximately 8 minutes, or until mixture is light yellow and coats the back of a spoon.

Remove promptly from heat and stir in butter a piece at a time, allowing each addition to melt before adding the next.  Remove to a clean container and cover by laying a layer of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the curd.  Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.

This recipe yields 1 pint.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  fresh mangos -- peeled
                        = (ripe but not too soft)
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  chile flakes
  2 1/2           cups  medium-diced red onion
     1/4           cup  minced fresh ginger
  1                cup  small-diced red bell pepper
  8             ounces  unsweetened pineapple juice
  4             ounces  cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  curry powder
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  raisins or golden raisins
     1/2           cup  toasted roughly-chopped macadamia nuts

Cut the mango flesh away from the pit.  The pit is shaped similar to an obelisk, so you'll end up with 2 large pieces and 2 smaller pieces from each mango.  Roughly chop the flesh.

In a saute pan heat the oil and add the chile flakes.  Be careful not to burn the chile, just toast to flavor the oil.  Add the onions and sweat until soft.  Add the ginger and bell pepper and saute for 1 to 2 minutes.  Finally add the mango and cook for 1 more minute.

In a separate bowl, combine the pineapple juice, vinegar, sugar, and curry powder.  (I used a mild yellow curry powder, but if you want it hotter go for red).  Add this mixture to the pan.  Stir to combine.  Bring the mixture to a bare simmer and reduce for about 30 minutes, stirring frequently.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the raisins and the nuts and transfer to another container over an ice bath.

This recipe yields 4 cups.

  4                     russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  8                     red potatoes -- cut into chunks
                        roughly the same size as the russet chunks
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt - (to 2)
     3/4           cup  low fat buttermilk (not skim)
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  6                     garlic cloves - (to 8) -- peeled

Combine potatoes in a large pot and just cover with cold tap water.  Place over high heat and season water with 1 to 2 teaspoons of salt, (it should taste like sea water).  Cover the pot and bring to a boil.

Meanwhile, combine dairy and garlic in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat.  Keep this mixture barely simmering until the potatoes are done.

As soon as the water comes to a boil, remove the lid and reduce the heat to a simmer.  Cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until a potato chunk can easily be crushed with a pair of tongs.  Drain, then return potatoes to the pan, return pot to heat and shake for 30 seconds so the surface water can evaporate.  Remove pot and set on a towel or hot pads.

Pour about half the garlic mixture into the potatoes and mash with an old-fashioned potato masher.  Start tasting and looking at the consistency right away.  If mashers seem dry or bland, add more of the garlic mixture.  Avoid over mashing or you'll end up with gluey instead of fluffy.

Serve straight or garnish with any of the following: parsley, chopped scallions, crumbled bacon, sun dried tomatoes, (If you have the dry ones, make sure you re-hydrate them.) grated horseradish, horseradish sauce, pesto, more bacon, sauteed mushrooms...use your imagination.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1                     frozen Long Island Duck - (5 1/2 to 6 lbs) -- thawed
  2                     handfuls shredded chard
  2                     shallots -- minced
  1               dash  sherry
                        = (or balsamic vinegar)

Combine all brine ingredients in a plastic container with a lid.  Place the lid on the container and shake to dissolve the salt.

Remove the pop-up thermometer, liver, gizzards, and heart.  Cut off the wings.

Using kitchen shears, locate the spine at the base of the neck.  Cut up the line of the backbone towards the neck cavity.  Turn the duck and cut straight towards the rear cavity.  Remove the backbone.

Turn the duck over and cut straight down the middle of the breast bone, leaving 2 equal duck halves.  To separate the legs from the breast, flip your halves over so the flesh side is facing up at you.  Using a knife, make a crescent shape cut between the leg and the breast.  Lay your knife flat against the skin and make 3 marks in one direction and then in the other, making an X.  Make sure that you are cutting through the skin and not the meat.

Line the inside of a plastic lexan or a pot with a zip-top bag. Place the duck quarters inside the bag, and pour the brine over the duck. Seal the bag, ensuring that all air is removed from the bag. Brine the duck for 2 to 2 1/2 hours in the refrigerator.

Bring 1 1/2 inches to 2 inches of water to a boil in a large pot.  Place a colander into the pot and line the sides of the colander with the duck.  Do not stack the duck quarters on each other.  Cover and turn the heat to medium-low.  Steam the duck for 45 minutes.  Set oven to 475 degrees.  Place a large cast iron skillet into the oven.

Remove duck pieces from steamer and place legs, skin-side down, into the hot skillet.  Place the skillet into the hot oven immediately and cook the leg quarters for 10 minutes.  Add the breasts, skin-side down, and cook for 7 more minutes or until the duck takes on a deep mahogany color and the skin is very crisp.

Remove the duck from the skillet and rest under foil.  Add the chard and the shallots to the skillet.  Toss the chard in the fat until it barely wilts.  Season with the sherry or balsamic vinegar.

Serve the duck with the chard.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1              large  leek -- cleaned, trimmed,
                        and chopped
  1              pinch  kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  20                    mussels
  1                     ripe tomato -- seeded and chopped
  1 1/2           cups  white wine
                        Chopped parsley -- for garnish

In an 8-quart nonreactive, stainless steel stockpot, sweat the garlic, leeks, and salt in the olive oil until softened over medium-low heat.

Place the mussels in a metal colander or steamer insert and spray them with cold water to remove any excess dirt or grit.  Remove any beards with a pair of needle-nose pliers.

Add the chopped tomato and the wine to the stockpot and turn the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer.  Insert the colander of mussels into the stockpot and cover.  After 3 minutes, check to see if the mussels have opened.  If some are still closed, cover the pot, and cook for an additional 30 seconds.  Discard any unopened mussels.

Place the mussels in a serving bowl.  Remove 10 mussels from their shells and add them to the stockpot.  Using a stick blender or a bar blender, puree the mussels until the liquid is of a sauce-like consistency.

Pour the sauce over the mussels and garnish with chopped parsley.  Serve with a loaf of crusty bread.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE DOUGH ===
  2 1/2           cups  flour
     1/2           cup  stone-ground cornmeal
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  8             ounces  unsalted butter -- diced
  3        tablespoons  apple juice concentrate
  2        tablespoons  cold water
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  2                     Anjou pears -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  grated nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  blueberries
  1           teaspoon  flour
  1 1/2           cups  cubed pound cake
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar

Heat oven to 400 degrees.

In a food processor, combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, and salt.  Pulse to combine.  Place dry ingredients in a mixing bowl and put the bowl into the refrigerator.

Remove 1/2 stick of butter from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature.

In a food processor, add the 1/2 stick of butter to the flour mixture.  Pulse until the fat completely disappears.  Add the remaining butter in separate batches.  Pulse until flour mixture resembles the size of a pea.

Combine the apple juice concentrate and the cold water.  Using a spray bottle, spritz the dough with the apple juice mixture while folding the mixture with a spatula.  After about three tablespoons of the liquid, check the dough for consistency.  It should hold together when compressed but remain relatively dry to the touch.  If it does not bind, add a little more water.  Remove from the processor and form the dough into a ball.  Wrap the dough in wax paper or parchment paper and rest in refrigerator for 20 minutes.

Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat.  Add pears to the pan and toss for 2 minutes.  Add the balsamic vinegar and continue to toss for 30 seconds.  Add sugar and cook until the pears have softened.  Add the nutmeg, cinnamon, and the butter and melt slowly.  Fold in the blueberries.  Remove from heat.  Sprinkle on the flour and combine well.  Allow to cool to room temperature.

Place dough on a floured piece of parchment and roll out to a 1/4-inch thick disk.  Transfer to a baking sheet.  Place cubed pound cake in the middle of the dough, leaving a 3-inch margin of crust on all sides.  Spoon filling over the cake cubes and top the pears with 1 ounce of cubed butter.

Lift excess crust onto filling and repeat in a clockwise fashion until a top lip has formed around the edge of the whole tart.  Brush the tart with the egg wash and sprinkle the crust with the sugar.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the filling begins to bubble and the crust is golden brown.  Remove from the sheet pan immediately and cool on pie rack.

This recipe yields 1 tart.

Heat oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a food processor, combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, and salt.  Pulse to combine.  Place dry ingredients in a mixing bowl and put the bowl into the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove 1/2 stick of butter from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a food processor, add the 1/2 stick of butter to the flour mixture.  Pulse until the fat completely disappears.  Add the remaining butter in separate batches.  Pulse until flour mixture resembles the size of a pea.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the apple juice concentrate and the cold water.  Using a spray bottle, spritz the dough with the apple juice mixture while folding the mixture with a spatula.  After about three tablespoons of the liquid, check the dough for consistency.  It should hold together when compressed but remain relatively dry to the touch.  If it does not bind, add a little more water.  Remove from the processor and form the dough into a ball.  Wrap the dough in wax paper or parchment paper and rest in refrigerator for 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat.  Add pears to the pan and toss for 2 minutes.  Add the balsamic vinegar and continue to toss for 30 seconds.  Add sugar and cook until the pears have softened.  Add the nutmeg, cinnamon, and the butter and melt slowly.  Fold in the blueberries.  Remove from heat.  Sprinkle on the flour and combine well.  Allow to cool to room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place dough on a floured piece of parchment and roll out to a 1/4-inch thick disk.  Transfer to a baking sheet.  Place cubed pound cake in the middle of the dough, leaving a 3-inch margin of crust on all sides.  Spoon filling over the cake cubes and top the pears with 1 ounce of cubed butter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lift excess crust onto filling and repeat in a clockwise fashion until a top lip has formed around the edge of the whole tart.  Brush the tart with the egg wash and sprinkle the crust with the sugar.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the filling begins to bubble and the crust is golden brown.  Remove from the sheet pan immediately and cool on pie rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 1 tart.

                       Pantry Friendly Tomato Sauce

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cans  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz ea)
     1/4           cup  sherry vinegar
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  1                     onion
  1                     carrot
  1                     celery stalk
  2             ounces  olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  capers -- rinsed, drained
     1/2           cup  white wine
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a sieve over a medium non-reactive saucepot, strain the tomatoes of their juice into the sauce pot.  Add the sherry vinegar, sugar, red pepper flakes, oregano, and basil to the tomato juice.  Stir and cook over high heat.  Once bubbles begin to form on the surface, reduce to a simmer.  Allow liquid to reduce by 1/2 or until liquid has thickened to a loose syrup consistency.

Squeeze each tomato thoroughly to ensure most seeds are removed.  Set the tomatoes aside.

Cut carrot, onion, and celery into uniform sizes and combine with olive oil and garlic in a non-reactive roasting pan over low heat.  Sweat the mirepoix until the carrots are tender and the onion becomes translucent, 15 to 20 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and capers to the roasting pan.

Place roasting pan on the middle rack of the oven and broil for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes.  Tomatoes should start to brown slightly on edges with light caramelization.  Remove the pan from the broiler.  Place the pan over 2 burners on the stove.  Add the white wine to the tomatoes and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes over medium heat.

Put the tomatoes into a deep pot or bowl and add the reduced tomato liquid to the tomatoes.  Blend to desired consistency and adjust seasoning.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 quarts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             quarts  water
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  16            ounces  dried spaghetti noodles
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves - (to 3) -- minced fine
                        === OPTIONAL TOPPINGS ===
                        Capers
                        Sun dried tomatoes
                        Red pepper
                        Olives
                        Walnuts
                        Hard cheeses
                        = (like Asiago and Parmesan)
                        Soft or veined cheeses
                        = (like gorgonzola or chevre)
                        Canned Artichokes
                        Smoked oysters
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place water in large lidded pot, add salt and bring to a rolling boil.  Add spaghetti, fanning it into the water so that each strand makes contact.  Using a wooden spoon or tongs, gently bend noodles to submerge.  Cover pot and return to a rolling boil, reducing heat to medium-high.  Stir occasionally.

Pour 3 tablespoons of good quality extra virgin olive oil into the bottom of a wide serving bowl along with garlic.

In 4 minutes, start tasting.  When done, a string of spaghetti should be springy when pulled on.  To the tooth, there should be some resistance but not so much that the pasta sticks in the teeth.  As soon as pasta is done, drain immediately in a large colander (lidded models are the best).  Shake pasta to stop cooking but don't shake dry.  And no rinsing!

Add pasta to serving bowl and toss to coat.  Quickly divide into individual bowls and toss.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt -- (see comments)
  1         tablespoon  pure olive oil
     3/4           cup  warm water
  2               cups  bread flour (for bread machines)
  1           teaspoon  instant yeast
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
                        Olive oil -- for the pizza crust
                        Flour -- for dusting peel
                        === TOPPINGS ===
  1 1/2         ounces  pizza sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh herbs
                        = (such as thyme, oregano, red pepper
                        flakes, for example)
                        A combination of 3 grated cheeses
                        = (such as mozzarella, Monterey Jack, and
                        provolone)

Place the sugar, salt, olive oil, water, 1 cup of flour, yeast, and remaining cup of flour into the mixer's work bowl.

Using the paddle attachment, start the mixer on low and mix until the dough just comes together, forming a ball.  Lube the hook attachment with cooking spray.  Attach the hook to the mixer and knead for 15 minutes on medium speed.

Tear off a small piece of dough and flatten into a disc.  Stretch the dough until thin.  Hold it up to the light and look to see if the baker's windowpane, or taut membrane, has formed.  If the dough tears before it forms, knead the dough for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.

Roll the pizza dough into a smooth ball on the countertop.  Place into a stainless steel or glass bowl.  Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil to the bowl and toss to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 18 to 24 hours.

Place the pizza stone or tile onto the bottom of a cold oven and turn the oven to its highest temperature, about 500 degrees.  If the oven has coils on the oven floor, place the tile onto the lowest rack of the oven.  Split the pizza dough into 2 equal parts using a knife or a dough scraper.  Flatten into a disk onto the countertop and then fold the dough into a ball.

Wet hands barely with water and rub them onto the countertop to dampen the surface.  Roll the dough on the surface until it tightens.  Cover one ball with a tea towel and rest for 30 minutes.

Repeat the steps with the other piece of dough.  If not baking the remaining pizza immediately, spray the inside of a ziptop bag with cooking spray and place the dough ball into the bag.  Refrigerate for up to 6 days.

Sprinkle the flour onto the peel and place the dough onto the peel.  Using your hands, form a lip around the edges of the pizza.  Stretch the dough into a round disc, rotating after each stretch.  Toss the dough in the air if you dare.  Shake the pizza on the peel to be sure that it will slide onto the pizza stone or tile.  (Dress and bake the pizza immediately for a crisp crust or rest the dough for 30 minutes if you want a chewy texture.)

Brush the rim of the pizza with olive oil.  Spread the pizza sauce evenly onto the pizza.  Sprinkle the herbs onto the pizza and top with the cheese.

Slide the pizza onto the tile and bake for 7 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown.  Rest for 3 minutes before slicing.

This recipe yields 2 pizzas.

Comments:  This recipe's been on the web for some time now and although most of the reactions have been darned positive, some of you have commented that the dough was way too salty.  At first we chalked this up to personal preference; some folks are just not as sensitive as others to this basic flavor.  And of course salty toppings would definitley change the dynamic.  Still, we didn't want to leave it at that.  We went back to the lab and found that the flake size of kosher salt differs quite a bit from brand to brand.  This could easily result in a too salty crust.  So unless you've had success with the recipe in the past, we suggest you cut the salt by one teaspoon, from a tablespoon to two teaspoons.  So that the yeast doesn't go crazy, you should also cut back on the sugar by half a teaspoon. --Thanks, AB

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  good quality popcorn
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  popcorn salt
                        = (or kosher salt)
                        A sprinkle jalapeÒo seasoning mix
                        Paper lunch bag
                        Stapler

Toss the popcorn with the olive oil, salt, and jalapeÒo seasoning mix in the paper bag.  Fold the top of the bag over and staple the bag twice to close.  Place the bag in the microwave and microwave on high for 2 minutes to 3 minutes, or until there are about 5 seconds between pops.

Comments:  Popcorn salt is a super-fine salt that is designed especially for sticking to food such as popcorn.  It has the taste of regular table salt, but its granules are much finer.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat oven to 400 degrees and butter a 9- by 13-inch baking dish and set aside.

Using a mandolin, V-slicer or the slicing attachment on a food processor, slice the potatoes approximately 1/8-inch thick.  (If you don't want to slice all the potatoes at once, slice them one at a time and build the gratin as you go.)

Create the first layer by laying the slices in overlapping rows.  Once the first layer is down, season lightly with salt and pepper, then scatter with mushroom slices and a couple tablespoons of the cheese.  (Don't over-do it on these layers, if you create a barrier between the adjoining potato layers, the gratin won't set.)

Continue building layers until you're out of potatoes or out of room to build, but be sure to save 1/2 cup of the cheese for the top.

Pour 2/3 cup of the half-and-half over the gratin then spread both hands over the surface and push down to work the air out from the layers.  Add remaining liquid only if half-and-half does not come to the surface when you push down.

Sprinkle the gratin with cheese, cover loosely with foil and place in middle of oven for 1 hour.  Check for doneness by inserting the point of a paring knife straight into the gratin.  If it goes through smoothly, remove the foil, return to oven, and turn on the broiler just long enough to turn the top golden-brown.  Remove, and allow to sit at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        = (or half-and-half)
  2                     eggs
  2            pinches  kosher salt
                        Freshly-grated nutmeg -- to taste
  1                     frozen 9" pie crust
                        === FILLING SUGGESTIONS ===
                        Any one of the following combinations:
                        Cooked spinach, cheddar cheese, and
                        cubed cooked ham
                        Bacon, sauteed leeks, and Gruyere cheese
                        Cooked spinach, canned artichoke hearts,
                        and Parmesan cheese
                        Roasted chicken, goat cheese, and
                        sun-dried tomatoes
                        Blanched asparagus and smoked salmon
                        Port Salut and Spam

In a nonreactive, stainless steel bowl, combine the cream or half-and-half and the eggs.  Whisk until combined thoroughly.  Add the salt and the nutmeg.  Whisk to combine.

Refrigerator Pie Rules:  Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Evenly distribute the pie fillings in the pie crust.  Do not overfill the crust with the filling ingredients.  Do not pour too much royale into the crust.  The eggs will expand upon cooking.  Bake the pie until it is firm to the touch like set Jell-O, about 45 minutes.  Cool the pie for at least 15 minutes before slicing.

This recipe yields 1 refrigerator pie.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  bulk breakfast sausage
     1/4           cup  flour
  2               cups  milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cook sausage in a cast-iron skillet.  When done, remove sausage from pan and pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat.  Whisk flour into the fat and cook over low heat for 5 minutes.

Remove pan from heat and whisk in milk a little at a time.  Return to medium-high heat and stir occasionally while the gravy comes to a simmer and thickens.  (Be sure to scrape up any brown bits that might be stuck to the bottom of the pan, that's where the flavor is.)

Check seasoning, add crumbled sausage and serve over toast or biscuits.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 cups.

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     eggs
  5        tablespoons  milk
  1                     pat of butter
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chives or parsley -- to garnish

In a small mixing bowl, combine eggs and milk with a fork.  In a non-stick skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat until it bubbles.  Stir a pinch of kosher salt into egg mixture then pour into pan, stirring slowly with a heat resistant rubber spatula.

As soon as curds begin to form, increase heat to high and instead of stirring, use the spatula to fold the eggs over themselves while gently shaking the pan with your other hand.

As soon as no more liquid is running around the bottom of the pan, remove from the heat and serve.  Season with fresh black pepper and garnish with fresh chives or parsley.  Remember: if they look done in the pan, they'll be over-done on the plate.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  half-and-half
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1                cup  minus 2 tbspns sugar
  2        tablespoons  peach preserves (not jelly)
  1                     vanilla bean -- split and scraped

Combine all ingredients (including the bean and its pulp) in a large saucepan and place over medium heat.  Attach a frying or candy thermometer to inside of pan (see comments below).  Stirring occasionally, bring the mixture to 170 degrees.  Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.  Remove the hull of the vanilla bean, pour mixture into lidded container and refrigerate mixture overnight to mellow flavors and texture.

Freeze mixture in ice cream freezer according to unit's instructions.  The mixture will not freeze hard in the machine.  Once the volume has increased by 1/2 to 3/4 times, and reached a soft serve consistency, spoon the mixture back into a lidded container and harden in the freezer at least 1 hour before serving.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

Comments:  If you do not have a thermometer, bring the mixture just barely to a simmer.  As soon as you see a bubble hit the surface, remove it from the heat.  Do not let it boil.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  pulverized seasoned croutons
  2            pinches  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  caraway seeds

  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar

Fill your largest pot 3/4 full with water and bring to a boil on high heat.

Melt the butter and croutons in a skillet.  Add the mustard and caraway seeds and stir over medium heat until the butter browns and smells nutty.  Remove the skillet from the heat, but leave dressing in the pan.

Add the salt and sugar to the boiling water and cook until dissolved.  Place the cabbage in the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes exactly.

Drain the cabbage in the bowl of the salad spinner or colander.  Spin the cabbage to remove any excess water.  Add the cabbage to the butter-crumb dressing and toss to coat thoroughly.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sirloin end leg of lamb -- boned, and trussed
                        === PASTE ===
  4                     garlic cloves
  8                     fresh mint leaves
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  5        tablespoons  strong mustard
                        = (such as Dijon)
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary

Roughly chop the garlic cloves in the food processor.  Add the mint and repeat.  Add the brown sugar, salt, pepper, mustard, and oil and blend to a paste.  Spread the paste evenly on the meat side of the roast.  Roll the leg into a roast shape and tie with cotton butcher's twine.

Fire 2 quarts (1 chimney's worth) of charcoal (natural chunk is best).  When charcoal is lightly covered with gray ash, split the coals into 2 piles and move them to the far sides of the cooker.  Close the lid and allow the grate to heat.  Then, place the lamb, skin-side up, on the middle of the hot grate.  Add the rosemary sprigs to the charcoal briquettes and close the lid and grill.

After 20 minutes, flip the roast and rotate it 180 degrees.  Insert the probe thermometer into the roast and continue to grill until it reaches an internal temperature of 135 degrees, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Remove the roast at 135 degrees.  Remove the butcher's twine from the roast.  Cover with foil and rest it for 15 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  flour
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  shortening
  1                cup  buttermilk -- chilled

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  Using your fingertips, rub butter and shortening into dry ingredients until mixture looks like crumbs.  (The faster the better, you don't want the fats to melt.)  Make a well in the center and pour in the chilled buttermilk.  Stir just until the dough comes together.  The dough will be very sticky.

Turn dough onto floured surface, dust top with flour and gently fold dough over on itself 5 or 6 times.  Press into a 1-inch thick round.  Cut out biscuits with a 2-inch cutter, being sure to push straight down through the dough.

Place biscuits on baking sheet so that they just touch.  Reform scrap dough, working it as little as possible and continue cutting.  (Biscuits from the second pass will not be quite as light as those from the first, but hey, that's life.)

Bake until biscuits are tall and light gold on top, 15 to 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 1 dozen.

I don't have much use for recipes but the one you get on a bag of White LilyÆ self-rising flour is hard to beat.  And it's a lot easier than the one my crazy grandson dreamed up.

                         Spiced Blueberry Jammin'

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Canning                         Jams/Jellies

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     bags frozen blueberries - (12 oz ea) -- (12-ounce)
  1             packet  dry pectin - (1 3/4 oz)
     1/4      teaspoon  star anise -- ground fine
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        = (or 10 to 20 grinds fresh nutmeg)
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  5        tablespoons  cider vinegar - (2 1/2 oz)
  3               cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  water

For the jam:  Place blueberries in saucepan over medium-low heat.  Sprinkle with pectin followed by the anise, nutmeg, lemon juice and vinegar.  Once liquid starts to gather in bottom of pan, increase the heat to high and bring to a boil.  Lower heat slightly and boil gently for five minutes occasionally mashing mixture.  Mash in sugar, add the water and return to a boil for 1 minute.  You just made jam.  Cool, jar, refrigerate and enjoy within 2 weeks.  Or, move to the preserving phase.

Preserving the jam:  Thoroughly wash all hardware in hot soapy water.  Then pile everything (excluding the jar lids) into the pot.  Cover with hot water by at least 1-inch and bring to a boil and maintain for 10 full minutes to sterilize.  Turn off the heat, wait 5 minutes then add the lids (waiting will insure that the sealing compound does not melt).  Leave all hardware in the pot until you're ready to can.

Remove the ladle, tongs, funnel and other tools from the pot, (careful please, it's hot in there) to a clean towel or paper towels.  Using the jar tongs, remove and drain the jars, placing them on the towel/paper towel surface.  (Avoid rock or metal surfaces which could result in thermal shock and breakage.)

Place the funnel in the first jar (pick it up by the ring, avoiding the sterile interior.)  Use the ladle to fill each jar just to the bottom of the funnel, about 1/3-inch from the bottom of the jar threads.  This "headspace" is necessary for the jars to seal during processing.

Wipe the jar rims with a moist paper towel, checking for any cracks or irregularities as you go.  Use the magnetized device of your choice to position lids on each jar.  Screw the rings on finger tight.  (Remember, the rings don't seal the jars they only hold the lids in place.  Heat will drive out the headspace air, which when cooled will create a vacuum, thus sealing the jars)

Return the jars to the pot being certain that they don't touch the bottom of the pot or each other.  (If you don't have a jar rack, try a round cake rack, or metal mesh basket.  Even a folded kitchen towel on the pot bottom will do in a pinch.)  Add additional water if necessary to cover the jars by at least an inch, and bring to a hard boil over high heat according to the table below.  (Be sure not to start your timer until a true boil is reached.  The headroom air may bubble out of the jars before a boil is reached.  Don't be fooled.)

Processing times: Within 1,000 feet of sea level: 5 minutes 1,000 - 3,000 feet above sea level: 10 minutes 3,001- 6,000 feet above sea level: 15 minutes 6,000 - 8,000 feet above sea level: 20 minutes Above 8,000 feet: wait until you're back down at base camp.

This recipe yields 6 half-pints.

                        Striped Bass In Salt Dome

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     striped bass - (5 to 6 lbs) -- gills removed,
                        and fins trimmed
  4                     egg whites
     1/2           cup  water
  2                     boxes kosher salt - (3 lbs ea)
  1                     handful parsley
  1                     fennel bulb (with stem) -- quartered
                        Several thyme sprigs
  1                     lemon -- sliced thin
     1/2                orange -- sliced thin
                        Olive oil -- as needed

Heat oven to 450 degrees.  Cover the bottom of a baking sheet large enough to hold the fish with parchment paper.

Rinse fish inside and out with cold water and drain.  Dry with paper towels.  Stuff body cavity with herbs and citrus, saving a few lemon slices for garnish.  Set aside.

Pour 1 box of salt into a large bowl, add egg whites and water, then the second box of salt.  Use your hands to work mixture to a mortar-like consistency.  Lay down a 1/2-inch thick bed for the fish to lay on with a 1-inch clearance on all sides.  Lay the fish on this bed and pile the remainder of the salt mortar on top.  Work into a smooth dome completely encasing the fish.  (Don't worry if the head or tail poke out a little.)

Cook approximately 35 minutes.  Check for doneness by pushing the probe of an instant read thermometer through the salt into the fish.  When temperature reaches 130 degrees, remove from oven, and rest at room temperature for 5 minutes.

Open the fish at the table by hitting the dome several times with a small hammer and lifting off the slabs of salt.  Brush away any stray salt.  Gently pull out dorsal (back) fin.  Using a fish knife or serrated pie server, make a single incision all the way down the back of the fish and around the gill plate.  Then lift the skin off working from the head to the tail.  Remove meat from top side of fish, going down one side of the spine then the other.  Grasp the tail and remove the skeleton, (it should come up intact).  The meat revealed below will slide right off the skin.

Sprinkle meat with a little virgin oil and lemon juice.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lobsters - (1 1/2 lbs ea)
                        Fresh herbs -- to taste
                        = (parsley, rosemary, thyme)
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/2                onion -- diced
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
  2        tablespoons  sliced scallions
  2                     handfuls crumbled buttery crackers
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for brushing and
                        drizzling

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Place lobsters in pan and chill in freezer for 15 to 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, place 1 layer of river rocks* in the bottom of a wide pot and fill with 1-inch of water.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Spread herbs across rocks, then quickly place lobsters on top.  Cover and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove and place in ice bath to halt cooking.

Lay paper towels across a cutting board.  Bring one lobster to the board and using your chef's knife, cut the lobster straight down the center, from head to tail.  Remove tomalley and discard.  Remove legs and claws.  Using a rolling pin, roll over legs to extract the meat.  Roughly chop the meat.

Move claws to pan and roast for 4 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat.  Add the onions and stir to coat.  Follow with the lemon zest and scallions.  Once onions are translucent add the leg meat.  Then add the crackers and toss, off the heat, until all the liquid has been absorbed.

Spoon filling into the open body cavities.  Brush tail meat with olive oil and place upright on the pan along with the claws.  Roast 10 to 14 minutes or until the stuffing browns and tail meat becomes opaque.

Crack claws and remove the meat.  Serve on top of stuffed lobster with extra-virgin olive oil on the side for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/3           cup  large-diced celery
     1/3           cup  bias-sliced (1/4") carrots
     1/3           cup  large-diced red bell pepper
     1/3           cup  large-diced green bell pepper
  1                cup  cubed (1") fresh pineapple

In a large non-reactive bowl, combine soy, garlic, ginger, flour, and cornstarch.  Season the pork generously with salt and pepper.  Place the pork in the bowl and toss to cover.  Marinate in the refrigerator overnight.

Drain off any excess marinade and dredge the pork in flour seasoned with salt and pepper.  In a large frying pan heat 1-inch of oil to 350 degrees.  Fry the pork in batches, until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels.  Reserve on a warm plate.

In a separate bowl, combine the ketchup, sugar, vinegar, and honey.  Whisk to blend.

In a small roasting pan heat the canola and sesame oils.  Place the pork and vegetables into the pan and cover with the ketchup mixture.  Bring to a simmer and cook until the pork is tender.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Alton Brown
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Mushrooms

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  1              batch  sauteed mushrooms
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  shredded Parmesan
  1           teaspoon  dried tarragon
  1         tablespoon  bread crumbs - (to 2)
                        === FOR THE MUSHROOM CAPS ===
  10             large  white mushroom caps
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
                        Bread crumbs -- as needed

Heat oven to 350 degrees.

In a large bowl, toss the mushroom caps with enough olive oil to coat the caps.  Add the rosemary, thyme, and garlic and combine thoroughly.

Place a roasting rack on a baking sheet.  On the baking sheet, turn the mushroom caps upside down, stem side facing up.  Roast the mushroom caps up to 10 minutes, or until the tip of a paring knife can be inserted into the side of the mushroom with little or no resistance.

Heat broiler to high and move the oven rack up 1 level.  Mound 1 tablespoon of filling into each mushroom cap, avoiding overstuffing the caps.  Top each cap with enough bread crumbs to cover the filling.  Broil the mushroom caps on high for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the filling bubbles and the tops have browned.

This recipe yields 5 servings.

In a large bowl, toss the mushroom caps with enough olive oil to coat the caps.  Add the rosemary, thyme, and garlic and combine thoroughly.

Place a roasting rack on a baking sheet.  On the baking sheet, turn the mushroom caps upside down, stem side facing up.  Roast the mushroom caps up to 10 minutes, or until the tip of a paring knife can be inserted into the side of the mushroom with little or no resistance.

Heat broiler to high and move the oven rack up 1 level.  Mound 1 tablespoon of filling into each mushroom cap, avoiding overstuffing the caps.  Top each cap with enough bread crumbs to cover the filling.  Broil the mushroom caps on high for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the filling bubbles and the tops have browned.

                             The Baked Potato

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  russet potato
                        = (if it looks like Mr. Potato HeadÆ,
                        you've got the right one)
                        Canola oil -- to coat
                        Kosher salt -- as needed

Heat oven to 350 degrees and position racks in top and bottom thirds.

Wash potato (or potatoes) thoroughly with a stiff brush and cold running water.  Dry, then using a standard fork poke 8 to 12 deep holes all over the spud so that moisture can escape during cooking.  Place in a bowl and coat lightly with oil.  Sprinkle with kosher salt and place potato directly on rack in middle of oven.  Place a baking sheet on the lower rack to catch any drippings.

Bake 1 hour or until skin feels crisp but flesh beneath feels soft.  Serve by creating a dotted line from end to end with your fork, then crack the spud open by squeezing the ends towards one another.  It will pop right open.  But watch out, there will be some steam.

This recipe yields 1 potato per person.

Comments:  If you're cooking more than 4 potatoes, you'll need to extend the cooking time by up to 15 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             sticks  unsalted butter
  2 1/4           cups  bread flour
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/4           cups  brown sugar
  1                     egg
  1                     egg yolk
  2        tablespoons  milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2               cups  semisweet chocolate chips

Heat oven to 375 degrees.

Melt the butter in a heavy-bottom medium saucepan over low heat.  Sift together the flour, salt, and baking soda and set aside.

Pour the melted butter in the mixer's work bowl.  Add the sugar and brown sugar.  Cream the butter and sugars on medium speed.  Add the egg, yolk, 2 tablespoons milk and vanilla extract and mix until well combined.  Slowly incorporate the flour mixture until thoroughly combined.  Stir in the chocolate chips.

Chill the dough, then using an ice cream scooper (#20 disher, to be exact), scoop onto parchment-lined baking sheets, 6 cookies per sheet.  Bake for 14 minutes or until golden brown, checking the cookies after 5 minutes.  Rotate the baking sheet for even browning.  Cool completely and store in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 dozen cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried Great Northern beans
  1              pound  bacon -- chopped
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     jalapeÒos -- chopped
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar
     1/4           cup  molasses
                        Vegetable broth -- as needed
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt

Heat oven to 250 degrees.

Soak beans in a plastic container overnight in just enough cold water to submerge them completely.

Place a cast-iron Dutch oven over medium heat and stir in the bacon, onion, and jalapeÒos until enough fat has rendered from the bacon to soften the onions, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the tomato paste, dark brown sugar, and molasses.

Drain the beans and reserve the soaking liquid.  Add the drained beans to the Dutch oven.  Place the soaking liquid in a measuring cup and add enough vegetable broth to equal 4 cups of liquid.  Add the liquid to the Dutch oven and bring to a boil over high heat.  Add in cayenne, black pepper and salt.  Give them a stir and cover with the lid.  Place the Dutch oven in the oven for 6 to 8 hours, or until the beans are tender.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  butter-flavored shortening
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  brown sugar
  2 1/4           cups  cake flour
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  2                     eggs
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2               cups  semisweet chocolate chips

Heat oven to 375 degrees.

Combine the shortening, sugar, and brown sugar in the mixer's work bowl, and cream until light and fluffy.  In the meantime, sift together the cake flour, salt, and baking powder and set aside.

Add the eggs 1 at a time to the creamed mixture.  Then add vanilla.  Increase the speed until thoroughly incorporated.

With the mixer set to low, slowly add the dry ingredients to the shortening and combine well.  Stir in the chocolate chips.  Chill the dough.

Using an ice cream scooper (#20 disher, to be exact), scoop onto parchment-lined baking sheets, 6 per sheet.  Bake for 13 minutes or until golden brown and puffy, checking the cookies after 5 minutes.  Rotate the baking sheet for even browning.  Cool and store in an airtight-container.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 dozen cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  32                    shell-on tiger shrimp - (21/25 count)
                        === FOR THE BRINE ===
     1/4           cup  kosher salt
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  water
  2               cups  ice
                        === FOR THE COCKTAIL SAUCE ===
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz) -- drained
     1/2           cup  prepared chili sauce
  4        tablespoons  prepared horseradish
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        A few grinds fresh black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        === FOR BROILING ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        A sprinkle of Old Bay seasoning

Using a pair of scissors or a serrated knife, make an incision down the backside of the shrimp, following the intestinal track.  Eviscerate shrimp and rinse under cool water leaving shells intact.

Place cleaned shrimp into a bowl with brine and refrigerate mixture for 20 to 25 minutes.  While shrimp are brining, place tomatoes, chili sauce, horseradish, sugar, pepper, and salt in food processor and blend until smooth.  Refrigerate cocktail sauce until ready to serve.

Place a baking sheet or broiler pan under oven broiler and preheat for 5 minutes.  Remove shrimp from brine and drain thoroughly.  Rinse the shrimp under cold water and dry on paper towels.  In a large bowl, toss shrimp with olive oil and sprinkle with Old Bay seasoning, if desired.

Place shrimp onto a sizzling sheet pan and return to broiler immediately.  After 2 minutes, turn the shrimp with a pair of tongs.  Return the shrimp to broiler for 1 minute.  Transfer to a cold cookie sheet.  Refrigerate immediately.

Once shrimp have chilled, arrange with cocktail sauce in a martini glass or as desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1              pinch  baking soda
  1                     egg
  2             ounces  milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2             sticks  unsalted butter
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  2               cups  semisweet chocolate chips

Heat oven to 375 degrees.

Sift together the flour, salt, and baking soda in a mixing bowl.  Combine the egg, milk, and vanilla and bring to room temperature in another bowl.

Cream the butter in the mixer's work bowl, starting on low speed to soften the butter.  Add the sugars.  Increase the speed, and cream the mixture until light and fluffy.  Reduce the speed and add the egg mixture slowly.  Increase the speed and mix until well combined.

Slowly add the flour mixture, scraping the sides of the bowl until thoroughly combined.  Stir in the chocolate chips.  Using an ice cream scooper (#20 disher, to be exact), scoop onto parchment-lined baking sheets, 6 cookies per sheet.  Bake for 13 to 15 minutes, checking the cookies after 5 minutes.  Rotate the baking sheet for more even browning.

Remove the cookies from the pans immediately.  Once cooled, store in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 dozen cookies.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  slabs pork baby back ribs
                        === DRY RUB ===
  8        tablespoons  light brown sugar - (tightly packed)
  3        tablespoons  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  jalapeÒo seasoning
     1/2      teaspoon  Old Bay Seasoning
     1/2      teaspoon  rubbed thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
                        === BRAISING LIQUID ===
  1                cup  white wine
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  honey
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped

Preheat oven to 250 degrees.

In a bowl, combine all dry ingredients and mix well.  Place each slab of baby back ribs on a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, shiny-side down.  Sprinkle each side generously with the dry rub.  Pat the dry rub into the meat.  Refrigerate the ribs for a minimum of 1 hour.

In a microwavable container, combine all ingredients for the braising liquid.  Microwave on high for 1 minute.

Place the ribs on a baking sheet.  Open one end of the foil on each slab and pour half of the braising liquid into each foil packet.  Tilt the baking sheet in order to equally distribute the braising liquid.  Braise the ribs in the oven for 2 1/2 hours.

Transfer the braising liquid into a medium saucepot.  Bring the liquid to a simmer and reduce by half or until of a thick syrup consistency.

Brush the glaze onto the ribs.  Place under the broiler just until the glaze caramelizes lightly.  Slice each slab into 2 rib bone portions.  Place the remaining hot glaze into a bowl and toss the rib portions in the glaze.

This recipe yields 2 slabs of ribs.

Comments:  This recipe makes several batches of dry rub.  If more rub is needed, it can be extended by any amount, as long as the ratio of 8:3:1:1 remains the same.
