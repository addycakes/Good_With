               Almond Cake With Strawberry-Rhubarb Compote

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COMPOTE ===
  1              pound  strawberries -- rinsed, hulled
  1              pound  rhubarb -- trimmed
  1                     lemon
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
                        === ALMOND CAKE ===
                        Butter and flour for the pan(s)
  7             ounces  almond paste
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  4             ounces  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces,
                        and chilled
  2        tablespoons  honey
  3              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  amaretto -- plus
                        additional for brushing
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour -- sifted
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
     1/3           cup  sliced almonds - (to 1/2) -- toasted
                        Confectioners' sugar -- as needed
     3/4           cup  crËme fraÓche -- whipped to soft
                        peaks

Make The Compote:  Select about 4 ounces of the smallest strawberries and cut lengthwise into quarters.  These will be added raw to the cooked compote; set aside.

Cut the remaining larger berries in halves or quarters so that the pieces are about the same size.  (You should have about 2 1/2 cups.)  Place them in a medium saucepan.

With a paring knife, pull away and discard the strings that run the length of the rhubarb stalks.  Cut the stalks into 3/4-inch pieces (you should have about 3 cups) and add to the saucepan.

Use a fine grater or a microplane to zest the lemon.  Add 1 teaspoon of the zest to the pan.  Squeeze 1 tablespoon of juice from the lemon and add to the pan.  Add the sugar and stir to coat the fruit.

Place the pan over medium-high heat and cook, stirring often to dissolve the sugar.  By the time the sugar has dissolved, the fruit will have released a lot of juice.  Boil for about 4 minutes to reduce the liquid somewhat, then reduce the heat and simmer for another 2 minutes, or until the rhubarb is soft.  Don't worry if some of the rhubarb falls apart.

Remove from the heat and stir in the reserved strawberries.  Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate in a covered container until cold.  (This makes about 4 cups of compote, but the extra will keep for a couple of weeks and is delicious for breakfast, especially with crËme fraÓche.)

Make The Cake:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour four 4- by 1 3/4-inch-high miniature springform pans or butter and flour the bottom and sides of an 8-inch round cake pan.  If using the 8-inch pan, line its bottom with a circle of parchment paper; this isn't necessary with the small pans.

Place the almond paste and sugar in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in another large bowl if using a handheld mixer.  Begin to cream the mixture on low speed to break up the almond paste, then increase the speed to medium for about 2 minutes, or until the paste is broken into fine particles.

Add the butter and mix for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the mixture is light in color and airy; stop the machine and scrape down the sides as necessary.  It is important to mix long enough or the cake will have a dense texture.

Mix in the honey, then add the eggs one at a time, beating until each one is fully incorporated before adding the next.  Add the amaretto, flour, and a pinch of salt and mix just to combine.

Scrape the batter into the prepared pan(s) and smooth the top.  Bake the small cakes for about 15 minutes, the large one for about 25 minutes, or until the cake is golden and springs back when pressed.  Transfer to a rack to cool.

Unmold the small cakes or invert the large cake onto the rack, remove the parchment paper, and invert the cake again so that the top is once again facing upward.  Brush the top of the cake(s) with amaretto and sprinkle with the toasted almonds.  Dust with confectioners' sugar.  (The large and small cakes can be stored, well wrapped, at room temperature for up to 2 days.)  To serve, cut the small cakes in half or the large cake into wedges.  Serve with a dollop of whipped crËme fraÓche and the strawberry-rhubarb compote.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This delightful almond cake can be served with just about any kind of compote or fruit, depending on the season.  It can be made early in the day, then served simply sliced and garnished with the compote (also made ahead) and crËme fraÓche.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2         pound  dried apricots
     1/2         pound  dried unsweetened sour cherries
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        === CRUST ===
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1 1/2         sticks  unsalted butter -- softened
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  chopped pecans
  1                cup  sweetened shredded coconut
                        === FOR SERVING ===
                        Sweetened whipped cream -- (optional)

Make The Filling:  Combine the apricots, cherries, and 2 cups water in a heavy 2- to 3-quart saucepan.  Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture comes to a boil and then reduce the heat to low.  Cover the pan and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until the fruit is very tender, 40 to 45 minutes.  Strain over a bowl and reserve 1/4 cup juice.

Return the fruit to the pan.  With a potato masher, smash the fruit until it is almost smooth.  Stir in the reserved juice and 1 cup plus the 2 tablespoons sugar.  Bring the puree to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.  Then cook, stirring constantly for 5 minutes.  Transfer the puree to a plate and cool to room temperature.

Make The Crust:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Grease a 9- by 13-inch baking pan with butter or vegetable shortening.

In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg and whisk to combine.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed for 1 minute, or until smooth.  Add the sugar and beat on medium speed for 3 to 4 minutes, or until smooth and fluffy.  Reduce the speed to low, add the dry ingredients, and mix just to incorporate.

Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir in the pecans and coconut to make a crumbly mixture.  Press half onto the bottom of the prepared pan.  Bake for 10 minutes, or until the crust is lightly browned.  Remove from the oven, and spread the cooled fruit filling evenly over the hot crust.  Sprinkle the remaining crumb mixture over the fruit and gently pat the crumbs in place.  (Do not pack it down.)

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the top is golden brown.  Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool completely before cutting into bars.  For serving at home, place each bar on a small plate and top with a dollop of sweetened whipped cream.

This recipe yields one 9- by 13-inch pan or 15 bars.

Comments:  The sourness of the cherries and the sweetness of the coconut make this a spot-on foil for a spot of tea.  For an even more decadence treat, top with a dollop of sweetened whipped cream.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed for 1 minute, or until smooth.  Add the sugar and beat on medium speed for 3 to 4 minutes, or until smooth and fluffy.  Reduce the speed to low, add the dry ingredients, and mix just to incorporate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir in the pecans and coconut to make a crumbly mixture.  Press half onto the bottom of the prepared pan.  Bake for 10 minutes, or until the crust is lightly browned.  Remove from the oven, and spread the cooled fruit filling evenly over the hot crust.  Sprinkle the remaining crumb mixture over the fruit and gently pat the crumbs in place.  (Do not pack it down.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the top is golden brown.  Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool completely before cutting into bars.  For serving at home, place each bar on a small plate and top with a dollop of sweetened whipped cream.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields one 9- by 13-inch pan or 15 bars.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The sourness of the cherries and the sweetness of the coconut make this a spot-on foil for a spot of tea.  For an even more decadence treat, top with a dollop of sweetened whipped cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PESTO SAUCE ===
  2                     jalapeÒo chiles -- stemmed, seeded
  8                     garlic cloves
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger - (heaping)
  1                cup  roasted salted macadamia nuts
                        = (or roasted salted peanuts)
                        Zest of 2 lemons
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  fresh basil leaves - (packed)
  1                cup  fresh mint leaves - (packed)
     1/2           cup  fresh cilantro leaves - (packed)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SALAD ===
  2        tablespoons  grapeseed or canola oil -- if needed
  1 1/2           cups  uncooked orzo
  4                     boneless chicken breasts with skin
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/4           cups  Asian Pesto -- plus
                        additional for drizzling
  1               pint  cherry tomatoes -- halved
                        Juice of 2 lemons
     1/2         pound  baby spinach -- washed and dried

Make The Pesto Sauce:  In a blender or food processor, combine the chiles, garlic, sugar, ginger, nuts, zest, and 1 cup of the oil and blend until smooth.  Add the basil, mint, and cilantro and blend while slowly adding the remaining oil until a thick puree is formed.  Season with salt and pepper.  Store in a tightly covered jar and refrigerate.

Assemble The Salad:  Prepare an outdoor grill, heat to hot, and spray the grid with nonstick cooking oil.  Alternatively, heat a grill pan or heavy sautÈ pan over high heat, add the oil, and swirl to coat the pan.

Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil.  Cook the orzo until just tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain well.

Meanwhile, season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper.  Grill the chicken, turning once, until the juices run clear when the meat is pierced with the tip of a paring knife, about 10 minutes.  Alternatively, grill the breasts in a pan over medium-high heat, turning once, until cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Cut the chicken with its skin into 1/4-inch-wide slices.  Allow the chicken to come to room temperature if you prefer, or proceed with the warm chicken slices.

In a large bowl, combine the chicken with 1 cup of the pesto, the orzo, and the tomatoes.  Season with salt and pepper.  In a medium bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup of pesto with the lemon juice, then toss with the spinach.  Season with salt and pepper.

Divide the spinach mixture among 4 plates.  Mound the chicken salad on the spinach, drizzle with additional pesto, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  If ubiquity means anything, pasta salad with chicken ranks right up there in popularity with hamburgers.  But too often it can be bland or heavy.  This spicy grilled-chicken version gives you all the satisfaction of everyday pasta salads and more.  First, instead of the usual fusilli, it's made with orzo, whose small rice shapes coat beautifully.  Second, the salad's dairy free, so you can serve it at room temperature without worry.  Finally, it goes together really quickly ó good news when you want a delicious but unstressful party dish.

Make this with warm or room-temperature chicken, as you prefer ó and, for best texture, avoid tossing the ingredients together until the last minute.

                  Basmati Rice With Cinnamon And Saffron

Recipe By     :Madjur Jaffrey
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  saffron threads
  3        tablespoons  hot milk
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
  2               cups  basmati rice
  2        tablespoons  corn, peanut, or olive oil
                        = (or ghee)
  2                     medium stick cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  salt

Place the saffron on a piece of foil.  Fold some of the foil over the saffron and crush it with a rolling pin or a wooden potato masher.  Put the crushed saffron in a small cup.  Add the hot milk cardamom, and sugar.  Mix with a toothpick or the handle of a small spoon and set aside for 3 hours.

Put the rice in a bowl and wash in several changes of water.  Drain, add fresh water to cover generously, and leave to soak for 30 minutes.  Drain.

Pour the oil into a heavy, lidded pan that will just hold the cooked rice comfortably and set over medium heat.  When the oil is hot, put in the cinnamon sticks.  Stir for 10 seconds, then add the rice.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir the rice around until all the grams look translucent, about 2 minutes.  Add 2 2/3 cups of water and the salt.  Bring to a boil.  Cover.

Reduce the heat to very, very low and cook for 25 minutes.  Turn off the heat.  Lift the lid and quickly dribble in the saffron milk in any haphazard pattern.  Quickly cover again and leave for 10 minutes.  Mix the rice very delicately with a slotted spoon before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a wonderful, fragrant rice for a formal dinner or party.  The quantities can easily be increased to suit your needs.  We suggest serving it along with Jaffrey's Moghlai Lamb With Spinach (Paalag Gosht) or as an accompaniment to her Gujarati Mango Soup.

                        === HERB OIL ===
                        Several sprigs flat parsley
                        Several sprigs thyme
                        Several sprigs sage
                        Several sprigs rosemary
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === BEETS ===
  1              pound  beets -- without the tops
                        = (or if available, golden beets)
  1                     bay leaf
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed
     1/2         bunch  thyme
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  1                     yellow onion -- diced
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  anise seed -- crushed with a
                        mortar and pestle
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     small bulb fennel -- sliced paper-thin
  2        tablespoons  Herb Oil -- (above)
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
  1              bunch  arugula -- tough stems removed

Make The Herb Oil:  Remove the herb leaves from their stems and chop finely.  Mix the herbs, garlic, and oil together, and let stand for at least 1 hour before using.  Store in an airtight container for up to a week.

Make The Beets:  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Combine the beets, bay leaf, garlic, thyme, peppercorns, and oil in a large bowl, season with salt, and toss together.  Place the coated beets in a roasting pan and cover with foil.  Roast until you can easily pierce the beets with a knife, about 1 hour.  Set aside to cool.

When the beets are cool enough to handle, slip off the skins and discard (If they don't slip off easily, the beets did not cook long enough.)  Cut into bite-sized wedges.

Make The Vinaigrette:  While the beets are cooling, prepare the vinaigrette.  Toss the onion and salt in a medium bowl and let stand for 10 minutes.  Whisk in the vinegar, anise seed, pepper, and sugar, and let stand for 30 minutes.  Slowly whisk in the oil.  Add to the beets and toss to coat evenly.

Assemble:  In a separate bowl, toss together the fennel, Herb Oil, lemon juice, and salt to taste.

To assemble the salad, arrange a small bed of arugula on individual plates and pile the dressed beets on top.  Top the beets with the dressed fennel and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Beets always seem to work best in a salad, with borscht perhaps the only exception.  They like to be dressed, and they are bold enough to stand up to a flavorful dressing such as our anise seed vinaigrette.  An advantage to this salad is that it is best at room temperature, and much of the work can be finished before the guests arrive.

Make The Herb Oil:  Remove the herb leaves from their stems and chop finely.  Mix the herbs, garlic, and oil together, and let stand for at least 1 hour before using.  Store in an airtight container for up to a week.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Beets:  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the beets, bay leaf, garlic, thyme, peppercorns, and oil in a large bowl, season with salt, and toss together.  Place the coated beets in a roasting pan and cover with foil.  Roast until you can easily pierce the beets with a knife, about 1 hour.  Set aside to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the beets are cool enough to handle, slip off the skins and discard (If they don&apos;t slip off easily, the beets did not cook long enough.)  Cut into bite-sized wedges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Vinaigrette:  While the beets are cooling, prepare the vinaigrette.  Toss the onion and salt in a medium bowl and let stand for 10 minutes.  Whisk in the vinegar, anise seed, pepper, and sugar, and let stand for 30 minutes.  Slowly whisk in the oil.  Add to the beets and toss to coat evenly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Assemble:  In a separate bowl, toss together the fennel, Herb Oil, lemon juice, and salt to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble the salad, arrange a small bed of arugula on individual plates and pile the dressed beets on top.  Top the beets with the dressed fennel and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Beets always seem to work best in a salad, with borscht perhaps the only exception.  They like to be dressed, and they are bold enough to stand up to a flavorful dressing such as our anise seed vinaigrette.  An advantage to this salad is that it is best at room temperature, and much of the work can be finished before the guests arrive.

                  Beet Salad With Feta, Orange, And Mint

Recipe By     :Alfred Portale
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  beets -- washed but not
                        peeled
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  2          teaspoons  balsamic vinegar
  4 1/2      teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     oranges -- peeled, and
                        separated into segments
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped mint leaves
  3          teaspoons  minced shallots
  4             ounces  French or Greek feta cheese - (about) -- crumbled into
                        large-size pieces (1 cup crumbled)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a bowl, toss the beets with the olive oil and season them with salt and pepper.  Put the beets on a roasting pan and cover them with foil.  Roast in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 1/2 hours.  (They are done when a sharp, thin-bladed knife can easily pierce through to their center.)

Remove the pan from the oven, remove the beets from the pan, and set them aside to cool.  While the beets are roasting, make the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk together the orange juice, balsamic vinegar, and extra virgin olive oil.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Set aside.

When they are cool enough to handle, peel the beets and cut them into 1/2-inch dice.  Put them in a bowl with 1 cup of the orange segments, the mint, and the shallots.  Add the vinaigrette, season with salt and pepper, and toss gently.

Transfer the salad to a platter.  Arrange the cheese and the remaining orange sections on top, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This simple, vibrant salad extracts everything beets have to offer by first roasting them to concentrate their flavor, then tossing them with orange segments, imbuing the beets with a crimson tint reminiscent of blood oranges.  If you think of feta cheese as dry, crumbly, and excessively salty, you've probably had the ubiquitous, mass-produced Greek variety that's sold in supermarkets.  Seek out a high-quality Greek or French feta, with moderate salinity and more creaminess.

Variations:  Using Minneolas or tangerines in place of the oranges will maintain the character of the salad while varying the degree of sweetness.  If you can find them, substitute blood oranges.  No high-quality feta available?  Replace it with goat cheese, Roquefort, or another blue cheese.

           Bread For Day Of The Dead - {Pan De DÌa De Muertos}

Recipe By     :Zarela M·rtinez
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          envelopes  dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all purpose flour - (to 4) -- or as needed
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  9        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature,
                        and cut into small pieces, plus extra for
                        greasing
  3              large  eggs - (2 for the dough, 1 for
                        glazing the loaves)
  3              large  egg yolks
     7/8           cup  condensed milk
  1         tablespoon  orange flower water
                        = (available in gourmet stores and
                        Italian and Middle Eastern markets)
                        Sugar or colored sugar crystals -- for sprinkling

In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water and let sit in a warm place for 5 minutes.  Make a sponge by stirring in 4 to 5 tablespoons of the flour.  Cover with a damp towel and let sit in a warm place until full of bubbles and about doubled in bulk, roughly 45 minutes.

Combine a scant 3 1/2 cups flour with the salt in a large bowl or on a pastry board or clean counter.  Cut or rub in the butter with a pastry blender or your fingers until the dough resembles the texture of coarse cornmeal.

Beat together 2 of the whole eggs and the 3 egg yolks.  Have ready the condensed milk and orange flower water.  Gradually add these ingredients to the dough, working them in with your fingertips.  Add the yeast sponge and work it in, adding flour as necessary to make a soft but kneadable dough.  Knead on a lightly floured work surface until smooth and silky about 10 minutes.  (Alternatively, use the dough hook of an electric mixer.)  Lightly grease a large bowl with butter and place the dough in it, turning to coat both sides with the butter.  Let sit in a warm place, covered with a damp cloth or piece of plastic wrap, until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Punch the dough down.  If not making decorated loaves, shape into 3 equal-size round loaves.  Or, to make 2 decorated loaves, proceed as follows: cut off about one fourth of the dough and set aside.  Divide the rest into 2 equal portions, shaping each into a ball.  Place side by side on a greased and floured baking sheet, remembering that the loaves will expand in baking.  With the remaining dough, shape skulls and crossbones.  First divide the dough into four parts.  Roll 2 pieces between your palms into long, narrow strips for crossbones and cut each in half.  Crisscross 2 strips over each loaf.  Shape the two remaining pieces into 2 small balls for skulls.  Lightly press them into the loaves above the crossbones.  (If you have difficulty in getting them to stick, make gashes in the loaves with a small, sharp knife and press the balls into the gashes.)  Cover lightly with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Beat the remaining egg and brush lightly over the loaves and decorations and bake 40 minutes.  When done, the loaves will be golden brown and sound hollow when tapped.  Sprinkle the loaves with sugar and return to the over for about 1 minute to melt it.

This recipe yields 3 (6-inch) plain loaves or 2 (7-inch) decorated loaves.

Comments:  During Mexico's Days of the Dead (Nov. 1 and 2), it was believed that the souls of the departed were allowed to return to earth.  Friends and relatives welcomed these spirits at their tombs with food, music, and small gifts.  Nowadays, according to M·rtinez, most families celebrate the holiday with a simple gathering graveside to pay respects followed by a celebration at home.

Natives of Mexico celebrate Days of the Dead with a rich, sweet yeast bread modeled after the altar breads that are special feast-day offerings in Europe.  The Mexican imagination put a new spin on the idea by shaping the loaves into different images.  The famous pan de muerto (bread of death) comes in the shape of human figures, alligators, lizards, and other animals ó but most often skulls and crossbones or teardrops and crosses, all gaily decorated with colored sugar crystals.

                       Brussels Sprouts With Bacon

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  canola or other vegetable oil
     1/2         pound  sliced bacon -- cut crosswise
                        into thin strips
     1/2           cup  minced onion
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2             pounds  Brussels sprouts -- ends trimmed
  5               cups  chicken stock, vegetable stock, or water

Warm the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot set over medium heat.  Add the bacon and sautÈ until it has rendered its fat and turned crisp, about 8 minutes.  Add the onion and garlic and sautÈ gently until softened but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes.

Add the wine, raise the heat to high, and bring to a boil, stirring to scrape up any flavorful bits of bacon stuck to the bottom of the pan.

When the wine has nearly evaporated, about 5 minutes, add the Brussels sprouts.  Add the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let the stock simmer until the sprouts are easily pierced with a knife, 12 to 15 minutes.

To serve, transfer the sprouts to a bowl and serve family style.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  There's a small club of misunderstood foods that have been stigmatized as unlikable for generations.  Its charter members include liver, broccoli, and the subject of this recipe: Brussels sprouts.

This recipe has converted more than a few sprout detractors, earning the vegetable their affection and respect.  The sprouts turn tender and sweet when stewed in stock complemented by rich, salty bacon.  Here the sprouts are kept whole, rather than breaking them up into leaves as many recipes do.

Warm the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot set over medium heat.  Add the bacon and sautÈ until it has rendered its fat and turned crisp, about 8 minutes.  Add the onion and garlic and sautÈ gently until softened but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the wine, raise the heat to high, and bring to a boil, stirring to scrape up any flavorful bits of bacon stuck to the bottom of the pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the wine has nearly evaporated, about 5 minutes, add the Brussels sprouts.  Add the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let the stock simmer until the sprouts are easily pierced with a knife, 12 to 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, transfer the sprouts to a bowl and serve family style.

Comments:  There&apos;s a small club of misunderstood foods that have been stigmatized as unlikable for generations.  Its charter members include liver, broccoli, and the subject of this recipe: Brussels sprouts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe has converted more than a few sprout detractors, earning the vegetable their affection and respect.  The sprouts turn tender and sweet when stewed in stock complemented by rich, salty bacon.  Here the sprouts are kept whole, rather than breaking them up into leaves as many recipes do.

                           Caramelized Shallots

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2             pounds  fresh shallots -- peeled, with
                        roots intact (see Note)
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  good red wine vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Melt the butter in a 12-inch ovenproof sautÈ pan, add the shallots and sugar, and toss to coat.  Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, tossing occasionally, until the shallots start to brown.

Add the vinegar, salt, and pepper and toss well.  Place the sautÈ pan in the oven and roast for 15 to 50 minutes, depending on the size of the shallots, until they are tender.

Season to taste, sprinkle with parsley, and serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  You might not usually think about serving shallots as a vegetable, but they're more flavorful and delicate than boiling onions.  It's a perfect accompaniment for an everyday roast chicken, but special enough to serve on a holiday with a standing rib roast.

Note:  To peel shallots easily, drop them into a pot of boiling water for less than 1 minute.  Drain, then remove the skins.  You can peel the shallots in advance and then just give them a quick sautÈ and throw them into the oven before dinner.

                      Carrots With Garlic And Yogurt

Recipe By     :Nur Ilkin
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1              pound  carrots -- peeled, and
                        coarsely grated
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  drained yogurt
                        = (start with 3 cups of yogurt/ place in
                        a cheesecloth-lined colander and let sit
                        at room temperature for about 4 hours)
  2          teaspoons  Aleppo pepper
                        = (or paprika)
                        Olives -- (optional)

In a 3-quart pot, heat 5 tablespoons of the oil and sautÈ the onions, stirring over medium heat for 5 minutes.  Do not let them brown or burn.

Add the carrots, stirring to mix well, and continue cooking for 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and let cool.

Crush the garlic and salt in a mortar and pestle.  Place the cooled carrots in a large bowl and add the drained yogurt and the garlic mixture.  Mix well and place in a serving dish.

Combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the paprika and drizzle in a design over the top of the carrots, decorate with olives if desired.  Serve at room temperature or chilled.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  You'll never feel the same way about carrots after you've tried this dish.  Turkish zucchini can be used instead of the carrots, but a teaspoon of dried mint needs to be added to the dish.

                       Cinnamon Raisin Walnut Bread

Recipe By     :Peter Reinhart
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached bread flour - (16 oz)
  4          teaspoons  granulated sugar
  1 1/4       teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  instant yeast - (.22 oz)
  1 1/4      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1              large  egg -- slightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  shortening -- melted, or at
                        room temperature
     1/2           cup  buttermilk or whole milk -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  water -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  raisins - (9 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  1                cup  chopped walnuts - (4 oz)

Stir together the flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and cinnamon in a mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer).  Add the egg, shortening, buttermilk, and water.  Stir together with a large spoon (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) until the ingredients come together and form a ball.  Adjust with flour or water if the dough seems too sticky or too dry and stiff.

Sprinkle flour on a counter, transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mixing on medium speed, switching to the dough hook).  The dough should be soft and pliable, tacky but not sticky.  Add flour as you knead (or mix), if necessary, to achieve this texture.  Knead by hand for approximately 10 minutes (or by machine for 6 to 8 minutes).  Sprinkle in the raisins and walnuts during the final 2 minutes of kneading (or mixing) to distribute them evenly and to avoid crushing them too much.  (If you are mixing by machine, you may have to finish kneading by hand to distribute the raisins and walnuts evenly.)  The dough should register 77 to 81 degrees.  Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with oil.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

Ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size.

Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and form them into loaves.  Place each loaf in a lightly oiled 8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch pan, mist the tops with spray oil, and cover loosely with plastic wrap.

Proof at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes, or until the dough crests above the lips of the pans and is nearly doubled in size.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees with the oven rack on the middle shelf.  Place the loaf pans on a sheet pan, making sure they are not touching each other.

Bake the loaves for 20 minutes.  Rotate the pan 180 degrees for even baking and continue baking for another 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the oven.  The finished breads should register 190 degrees in the center and be golden brown on top and lightly golden on the sides and bottom.  They should make a hollow sound when thumped on the bottom.

Immediately remove the breads from their pans and cool on a rack for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before slicing or serving.

This recipe yields two 1 1/2-pound loaves.

Comments:  In Brother Juniper's Bread Book, I included a recipe for a variation of this bread, but I believe this version is even better, encompassing all the qualities one want from a raisin bread.  It is light, flavorful, loaded with raisins, and it has a wonderful finish, filling your mouth with the satisfying aftertaste of roasted walnuts.  If you prefer not to use nuts, eliminate them from the formula without any further changes (you may also substitute other nuts, such as pecans or hazelnuts).

An alternative to the method described here is to add a cinnamon swirl.  To make cinnamon sugar, stir together 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon.  When shaping the dough, roll out each piece with a rolling pin to a rectangle 5 inches wide by 8 inches long and approximately 1/3-inch thick.  Sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the surface of the rectangles and then roll up the dough into a tight sandwich-style loaf, pinching the seam closed with your fingers.  When you slice the baked bread, there will be a cinnamon swirl that not only looks pretty, but will also add additional cinnamon-sugar flavor.

Another trick that adds flavor is to brush the tops of the baked loaves with melted butter as soon as they come out of the bread pans, and then roll them in the cinnamon sugar.  When the bread cools, the top will have an additional sweet and crunchy flavor burst.

                        and cut into 2" lengths
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the croutons, slice two of the garlic cloves and put them in a large bowl with the 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Toss in the bread and coat with the oil.  Place the bread on a baking sheet in a 350 degree oven, and stir from time to time, until the bread is golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Return the croutons to the bowl and throw away the garlic slices.

To make the salad, finely mince the remaining garlic clove with the anchovy fillets.  Put these in the bottom of a large salad bowl with the dry mustard and mash with a fork.  Mix in the 1/4 cup olive oil.  Break the egg into the center of the mixture.  Squeeze the lemon juice directly onto the uncooked egg.  Mix together the lemon juice and egg with a fork before incorporating the other ingredients.

Put the lettuce on top of the dressing and toss with salad servers until the lettuce is coated with the dressing.  Add the Parmesan and lots of freshly ground black pepper and toss again.  Add the croutons and toss a third time.  Add lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste.  Serve on salad plates.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This famous salad, which used to be served table side in fancy restaurants in the '60s, faded out of fashion in the '70s, and came back in the '80s.  Whether in or out of fashion, Caesar salad is easy and fun to make for a supper by itself or to precede a light dish.  You can toast the bread rather than make croutons, but be sure to rub a cut clove of garlic over the bread.  If you don't like anchovies, you can substitute a teaspoon of bottled Worcestershire sauce.  Be sure to grate additional cheese on each salad.

Romaine lettuce is a must for this salad because it can withstand being tossed with dressing three times.

Note:  The best way to wash lettuce is to separate each leaf, run it under cold water, tear it into pieces, dry it in a salad spinner, and store it in a towel until ready to use.  You must look at each piece to check for browning, dirt, or bugs.

Some people prefer to cook the egg for a minute before proceeding with the recipe.  I find this an unnecessary extra step because I think the lemon juice essentially "cooks" the egg.  However, it is very important that a recipe calling for raw eggs be served only at home.  In professional kitchens, pasteurized eggs must be used to prevent any chance of contamination.

Categories    : Desserts                        Pastry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             sticks  unsalted butter
  2 1/2           cups  unsifted all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla

Place the dry ingredients into the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and process with 2 or 3 short on/off bursts to blend.

Mix the egg and vanilla in a small bowl just to combine.

Cut the chilled, firm butter into 12 to 16 pieces and scatter them over the dry ingredients.  Process the butter and dry ingredients until the mixture resembles bread crumbs (about 15 to 20 seconds).

Then, with processor running, pour the egg mixture down the feed tube in a steady stream and continue to process just until the ingredients come together.

Remove the dough from the bowl and place it on a clean, dry work surface.  Then, with the heel of your hand, smear a small amount on your work surface by pushing it away from you.  Repeat with small amounts of the remaining dough.  When you've worked all the dough in this manner, give it a couple more strokes to bring it together into a smooth, homogeneous unit.

Chilling The Dough:  At this point, you may divide the dough into thirds (8 ounces each, a scant 1 cup).  Flatten each third into a round disk 4 to 5 inches each and wrap each in plastic.

Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or until the dough is chilled and slightly firm.  (Chilling reduces the strength of the gluten in the flour when the dough is rolled.  It also makes it easier to roll without sticking.)

Rolling The Dough:  If the dough is cold and firm, remove it from the refrigerator to room temperature for 1 hour, or until it is still cool (room temperature, 70 degrees) and feels malleable, though it may crack at the edges slightly when pinched.  These doughs may be pressed with the fingertips into pans, rather than rolled.  However, rolling is faster, gives a more even thickness and requires less manipulation than pressing.

Dust the work surface lightly with flour.  Position the rolling pin across the center of the disk and push the pin away from you in one stroke; use just enough pressure to extend the dough about 2 inches.  Let up on the pressure as you near the edge.  If any tearing or cracking occurs as you roll, press the edges together, sprinkle with a little flour and continue to roll.  (If the dough cracks too much, it is too cold; if it is soft and sticky, it is too warm.  Should it crumble into pieces as you begin to roll, repeat the kneading process; this will not overwork it.)

Gently lift the dough and rotate it a one-eighth turn in one direction.  Repeat rolling procedure, working from the center out, always rotating dough a one-eighth turn in the same direction.  Lightly flour the surface when necessary to prevent sticking.  If the dough does stick, carefully slide a metal spatula under that portion, lift and dust with flour.  Rub off any particles adhering to the rolling pin; they could puncture the dough.

Continue rolling and rotating until the circle of dough is 1/8 inch thick and measures the diameter you need.  The most important guideline for lining the pans is an 1/8-inch thickness; any thicker, and it will not serve as a container for the filling.

Fitting The Dough In The Pan:  Lay the rolling pin across the upper third of the circle of dough.  Lift the edge of that section on and fold it toward you, draping it over the pin.  (The ends of the rolling pin will remain exposed.)  Roll the pin toward you, wrapping the remaining dough loosely around the pin.

Lift the rolling pin, and suspend it 1 inch above the farthest edge of the tart pan.  Allowing for a 1-inch overhang, unroll the dough toward you, easing it into the pan's contours as you go.  (Unrolling the dough toward you, rather than away from you, is best since you can see the pan and guide the dough precisely.)  When the dough is completely unrolled, mold it into the pan's crevices, pressing down slightly with fingertips until it fits snugly against the sides and bottom.  If it tears, patching is easy: press the two torn edges together.

Rest the rolling pin on top of the pan, and roll across with enough pressure to cut off the overhang on all sides.  (The overhang can be as much as 1 ounce for an 8-inch quiche pan, but that is preferable to not having enough dough to fill the pan evenly and efficiently.)

Baking The Tart Shell:  At least 15 minutes before baking, position rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Bake in preheated oven for 17 to 22 minutes, or until the shell appears golden, looks done and contracts from the side.  After the initial 5 to 7 minutes in the oven, the shell may blister; if so, prick the bottom in 3 or 4 places with a metal skewer, allowing the steam to escape so that the dough will fit snugly in the pan again.  It is important to prick it before it bakes too long and sets its shape.

Cooling The Tart Shell:  Remove from oven to cooling rack.  After 5 minutes, place on top of a can smaller than the baking pan, releasing the pan's metal rim from the baked crust.

Fill and serve the day it is baked.

This recipe yields three 8-inch tart crusts (1 1/2 pounds dough).

Comments:  I've tried many recipes for sweetened pastry over the years, but this one still tastes and handles the best.  It is also known as p‚te sucrÈe.  The addition of egg and sugar makes the pastry shell richer and sweeter yet less flaky than an ordinary piecrust. óFlo Braker

Baker Braker's Notes:

A 9-ounce disk, measuring 1 cup dough, is enough to fit into a 9-inch quiche pan.

A 13-ounce disk, measuring a scant 1 1/2 cups, is enough to fit into an 11- by 8- by 1-inch rectangular quiche pan.

A 12-ounce disk, measuring 1 1/3 cups, is enough to fit into a 12- by 4- by 1-inch rectangular flan form.

In pastrymaking, it's best to work with your hands to keep in contact with the ingredients and to give you a sense of what is happening (Is the butter too soft, the dough too moist?)  Then, after you become accustomed to the feel of making the dough, you can use a machine.

Correct butter temperature is the key to making sweetened pastry by hand successfully.  It shouldn't be too firm (cold) or too soft (warm); the best description is cool and malleable.

Kneading the dough by smearing it with the heel of your hand is called fraisage.  It not only forms the dough into a smooth, cohesive unit, but it develops just enough structure so that the dough is less likely to tear or crack while being rolled and lifted.

            Compote Of Artichoke, Orange, Coriander, And Mint

Recipe By     :Paula Wolfert
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    parsley leaves
  3              large  artichokes
  1                     lemon -- halved
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, sliced
                        Juice of 1 fresh orange
  3          teaspoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground pepper
  2                     oranges -- peeled, white
                        membrane removed and sectioned (abt 1 cup)
  1              pinch  ground coriander
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             sprigs  fresh mint

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Fill a large bowl with cold water.  Crush the parsley leaves in your hand and add them to the bowl.  Trim the artichokes by first snapping off the tough outer leaves near the base.  Use a stainless steel knife to cut off the stems, then trim the crowns to within 1 1/2 inches of the base.  Use a melon baller to scoop out the hairy chokes and scrape around the inner sides to widen the cavity.  Use a small knife to carefully trim the leaves then pare any remaining hard green parts.  As you work with each artichoke, rub it with the one of the lemon halves to prevent discoloration.  Cut each bottom in half and keep submerged in the parsleyed water.

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a flameproof earthenware or stainless shallow saucepan, add the garlic and sautÈ gently for 1 minute.  Add the orange juice, juice of the remaining lemon half, sugar, and the salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring for an instant.  Drain the artichokes and add them to the pan along with 1/3 cup of the parsleyed water.  Stir to combine.  Cover with a circle of crumbled, wet parchment paper, and set the pan in the oven to bake for 1 hour.

Remove the dish from the oven and place it on the stove.  Discard the paper.  Add the orange sections and ground coriander, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the liquid turns a nutty brown and the artichokes and oranges are well glazed, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat, allow to cool to room temperature and correct the seasoning with salt, pepper, a few drops of lemon juice, and a drizzle of fresh oil.  Serve cool or chilled the following day decorated with fresh sprigs of mint.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This rich and bright combination of artichokes and oranges is one of the most delightful in the North African Jewish repertoire.  Similar to many vegetable compote type dishes in which lots of citric juice keep the outside of vegetable rigid, the inside has the soft and unctuous texture of bone marrow.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill a large bowl with cold water.  Crush the parsley leaves in your hand and add them to the bowl.  Trim the artichokes by first snapping off the tough outer leaves near the base.  Use a stainless steel knife to cut off the stems, then trim the crowns to within 1 1/2 inches of the base.  Use a melon baller to scoop out the hairy chokes and scrape around the inner sides to widen the cavity.  Use a small knife to carefully trim the leaves then pare any remaining hard green parts.  As you work with each artichoke, rub it with the one of the lemon halves to prevent discoloration.  Cut each bottom in half and keep submerged in the parsleyed water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a flameproof earthenware or stainless shallow saucepan, add the garlic and sautÈ gently for 1 minute.  Add the orange juice, juice of the remaining lemon half, sugar, and the salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring for an instant.  Drain the artichokes and add them to the pan along with 1/3 cup of the parsleyed water.  Stir to combine.  Cover with a circle of crumbled, wet parchment paper, and set the pan in the oven to bake for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the dish from the oven and place it on the stove.  Discard the paper.  Add the orange sections and ground coriander, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the liquid turns a nutty brown and the artichokes and oranges are well glazed, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat, allow to cool to room temperature and correct the seasoning with salt, pepper, a few drops of lemon juice, and a drizzle of fresh oil.  Serve cool or chilled the following day decorated with fresh sprigs of mint.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This rich and bright combination of artichokes and oranges is one of the most delightful in the North African Jewish repertoire.  Similar to many vegetable compote type dishes in which lots of citric juice keep the outside of vegetable rigid, the inside has the soft and unctuous texture of bone marrow.

          Cooked Carrot Salad With Pine Nuts And Golden Raisins

Recipe By     :Lidia Matticchio Bastianich
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  carrots
  1 1/2           cups  white vinegar
  2        tablespoons  honey
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
     1/4           cup  golden raisins
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 2)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  finely-shredded fresh mint leaves

Peel and trim the carrots, and cut them into 3-inch lengths.  Slice these lengthwise into wedges, all about 1/3-inch thick.

Pour 3 1/2 cups water and the vinegar into a 3- or 4-quart saucepan and set over high heat.  Stir in the honey.  When the water's boiling, drop in the carrot wedges and cook, uncovered, at a good bubbling boil for 25 minutes, until cooked through but with some texture to the bite.  Don't let them get mushy.

Meanwhile, toast the pine nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat tossing them frequently until light gold; spill them onto a plate to cool.

When the carrots are cooked, lift them out of the pan with a spider; let them cool and drain in a colander.  Keep the carrot-cooking liquid at the boil, and drop in the raisins; poach for about 5 minute until plump, then lift them out and let them cool and drain.

Boil the vinegar liquid vigorously now to reduce quickly ó it will take 5 minutes or more ó until only 1/4 cup or so of thick syrup remains in the pan.  Lower the heat as the liquid level nears the pan bottom, and pour it into a cup or small bowl before it burns.

Put the carrots in a mixing bowl, and toss with 2 tablespoons of the syrup and several pinches of salt.  Let them marinate briefly.  Before serving, toss the carrots with a tablespoon of olive oil, the pine nuts, the raisins, and the shredded mint leaves.  Taste, and season with more salt if needed; if you want more dressing, add more oil or any remaining syrup.  Arrange on a serving platter, or portion on salad plates.

This recipe yields 6 or more servings.

Comments:  Carrots are an unappreciated standby.  We tend to use them for everything, but rarely highlight them.  This dish brings out their sparkle.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  coarse cornmeal - (6 oz)
                        = (also packaged as "polenta")
  2               cups  buttermilk
  8             ounces  bacon - (abt 10 slices)
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (8 oz)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  3              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  2 1/2           cups  fresh or frozen corn kernels - (16 oz)
  2        tablespoons  bacon fat or vegetable oil

The night before baking the corn bread, soak the cornmeal in the buttermilk.  Cover and leave at room temperature overnight.

The next day, to prepare the bacon, preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lay out the bacon on 2 sheet pans.  Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the bacon is crisp.  Using tongs or a fork, remove the pieces to a pan lined with paper towels to cool.  Drain off the fat into a can or stainless-steel bowl and save for greasing the corn bread pan.  When the bacon has cooled, crumble it into coarse pieces.

Lower the oven setting to 350 degrees.  Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a mixing bowl.  Stir in the granulated sugar and brown sugar.  In another bowl, lightly beat the eggs.  Dissolve the honey in the melted butter and then stir the warm honey-butter mixture into the eggs.  Add this to the soaked cornmeal mixture.  Add the wet mixture to the flour mixture and stir with a large spoon or whisk until all the ingredients are evenly distributed and the batter is blended and smooth.  It should be the consistency of thick pancake batter.  Stir in the corn kernels until they are evenly distributed.

Place 2 tablespoons of the rendered bacon fat into a 10-inch round cake pan (you can also use a 9- by 13-inch baking pan or a 12-inch square pan).  Place the pan in the oven for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the fat gets very hot.  With good pot holders or oven mitts, remove the pan, tilt it to grease all the corners and sides, and pour in the batter, spreading it from the center of the pan to the edges.  Sprinkle the crumbled bacon pieces evenly over the top, gently pressing them into the batter.

Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the corn bread is firm and springy (the baking time will depend on the size of the pan) and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  The top will be a medium golden brown.  The internal temperature at the center of the corn bread should register at least 185 degrees.

Allow the bread to cool in the pan for at least 15 minutes before slicing it into squares or wedges.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields one 10-inch round bread.

Comments:  The single most vivid taste memory I associate with Thanksgiving is the flavor of crisp turkey skin.  I almost always get first dibs on the wing tips and sneak into the kitchen to peel off the crispiest pieces of golden, salt-and-peppery cracklins before the carvers go to work.  The intensity of flavor means it doesn't take a lot of skins to satisfy my craving, but by the end of the meal, I usually find myself yearning for just one more piece.

This corn bread is designed to take the pressure off that yearning, substituting the smoky, salty flavor of crackly bacon for the turkey skin.  However, I often make a variation of this, buying a half-pound of chicken or turkey skins from the butcher, laying them out on a sheet pan, seasoning them with salt and pepper, and baking at 350 degrees until they render their fat and become very crisp and crumbly, just like bacon.

The use of sugar, honey, buttermilk, lots of corn kernels, and polenta-grind cornmeal (rather than the usual finely ground cornmeal) gives this bread moisture, texture, and sweet yet tart flavor bursts.  The bacon (or cracklings) on the top is the final payoff, complementing any Thanksgiving dinner or re-creating Thanksgiving flavor memories throughout the year.

I have an ongoing love affair with good corn bread.  By good I mean moist and sweet, with crunch and texture.  This recipe is my favorite, and it is the best corn bread I have ever made or eaten.  I just don't think it gets any better than this.

As with all quick breads, this batter can be used to make muffins.  Fill the greased muffin cups to the top and bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes, or until the center of a muffin is springy and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Recipe By     :Carol Field
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- lightly crushed
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  2 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast - (1 pkg)
  1 1/3           cups  warm water -- (105 to 115 degrees)
  3 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sea salt
  20                    fresh sage leaves -- roughly chopped
                        = (or 2 tspns chopped fresh rosemary
                        leaves)
                        === TOPPING ===
  3                     red or yellow peppers
  3             medium  red onions -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3             medium  ripe tomatoes - (to 4) -- seeded, squeezed dry
                        A handful of fresh basil leaves -- torn in pieces
  1           teaspoon  sea salt - (to 1 1/2)

Make The Dough:  Warm the garlic cloves in the olive oil over very low heat just until the garlic begins to brown.  Discard the garlic and cool the oil to room temperature.  Meanwhile whisk the yeast into the warm water and leave until creamy, about 10 minutes.  Add the cooled olive oil.

Stir in the flour, salt, and herbs, and mix until the dough comes together; you may need to add 1 more tablespoon of water.  Knead by hand on a lightly floured work surface for 6 to 8 minutes, or if you are using a heavy-duty mixer, change to the dough hook and knead on medium speed for 3 minutes.  The dough will be silky and elastic.

Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled, 1 hour.

Set the dough in an oiled 10 1/2- by 15-inch pan.  Stretch the dough to cover as much of the bottom as possible; the dough will be very springy and cooperative.  Cover with a towel and let it relax for 15 minutes.  Then dimple and stretch the dough some more, until it covers the bottom in a very thin layer.  Leave to rise until puffy, about 50 minutes.

Make The Topping:  While the shaped dough is rising, toast, peel, and slice the peppers into thin strips.  Saute the onions in the 1/4 cup olive oil over very low heat for 25 to 30 minutes, until they are soft and limp.

Assemble The Focaccia:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  If you are using baking stones, set them in the oven and preheat for 30 minutes.  When the dough is ready, lightly dip your fingertips into the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and dimple the tops of the dough.  Distribute the vegetables over the surface of the focaccia; sprinkle with the basil and salt; and finish by drizzling the remaining oil over the tops.

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the dough is crispy at the edges and the vegetables are soft but still very slightly crisp.  Let cool briefly, then remove from the baking pan and let cool on a rack.  Serve tepid or at room temperature.

This recipe yields one 10 1/2- by 15-inch focaccia; 8 servings.

Comments:  A delicious focaccia that actually stays moist for a day or two.  By itself the red pepper topping makes a delicious antipasto, pasta sauce or vegetable dish.

Make The Dough:  Warm the garlic cloves in the olive oil over very low heat just until the garlic begins to brown.  Discard the garlic and cool the oil to room temperature.  Meanwhile whisk the yeast into the warm water and leave until creamy, about 10 minutes.  Add the cooled olive oil.

                         Double Chocolate Souffle

Recipe By     :David Lebovitz
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/4           cup  milk
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  whiskey
                        = (or 1 tspn vanilla extract)
  3              large  egg yolks
  4              large  egg whites
  1 1/2         ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- very coarsely
                        chopped
                        = (or 1/3 cup chocolate chips)

Butter six 4-ounce ramekins or 6-ounce custard cups.  Place them on a baking sheet.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a large heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, melt the chocolate with the milk.  Remove the pan from heat and whisk in 3 tablespoons of the sugar, the whiskey, and the egg yolks.  Let stand at room temperature.

In a clean, dry bowl, whip the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium speed until they are foamy and begin to hold their shape when the whisk is lifted.  Gradually whip in the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar, whipping until the whites hold soft, droopy peaks.

Fold the beaten egg whites into the chocolate mixture.  Fill the ramekins or custard cups halfway with the soufflÈ mixture.  Sprinkle in the pieces of chopped chocolate.  Add the remaining batter, filling the soufflÈ dishes almost to the top.

Bake for 14 minutes, or until the soufflÈs are firm, yet jiggly when nudged.  They should be very soft when you remove them from the oven.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 soufflÈs.

Comments:  I truly believe that I began my baking career the very same evening that my parents decided that I was old enough to stay home without a babysitter.  It was the era of TV dinners, so I was occasionally left with a rock-hard frozen aluminum rectangle for dinner.  One night, unsatisfied with the tiny square of dessert offered.  I opened my mother's favorite cookbook, and lo and behold.  I discovered a recipe for an exotic-sounding chocolate soufflÈ.  All the ingredients were in the house, and with a Pyrex measuring cup as a soufflÈ dish.  My career was born.  Serve the soufflÈs immediately with a drizzle of crËme anglaise or a dollop of whipped cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             bottle  Gewurztraminer or
                        Johannisberg Riesling wine
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  8             ounces  dried Calimyrna figs - (12 to 14 figs)
  2                     cinnamon sticks - (abt 3" ea) -- broken in half
  4             ounces  apricots - (abt 12 halves)
                        === OPTIONAL ===
     1/2           cup  crËme fraÓche, fromage blanc, or yogurt
  1         tablespoon  toasted sliced natural (unskinned) almonds

Combine the wine and sugar in a large saucepan.  Heat to a boil over medium heat, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved.  Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean; add the seeds and the bean to the syrup.  Add the figs and cinnamon sticks.  Cook, covered, over medium-low heat for 20 minutes; add the apricots and cook until the fruits are plumped and tender, about 25 minutes more.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fruit, cinnamon sticks, and vanilla bean to a heat-resistant bowl.  Boil the wine syrup, uncovered, until it is reduced to about 2 cups.  Pour the syrup over the figs and stir to blend.

Refrigerate until well chilled, about 4 hours.  Eat plain or with a spoonful of crËme fraÓche, yogurt, or fromage blanc on top.  Garnish with almonds if desired.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a simple desert to make ahead.  Keep it on hand for a quick fix of something sweet after dinner.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  haricots verts or green beans
                        Peanut oil -- as needed
  3             ounces  ground pork - (abt 2/3 cup)
  2          teaspoons  Shaoxing rice wine
                        = (or medium-dry sherry)
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  Sichuanese ya cai or
                        TianJin preserved vegetable -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil

Remove any strings from the edges of the beans and trim off the tops and tails.  Break them into short sections (about 2 inches long).

Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok, add the beans, and stir-fry over a medium flame for about 6 minutes, until they are tender and their skins are a little puckered.  Remove from the wok and set aside.  If you want to save time, deep-fry the beans at about 350 degrees until they are tender and puckered.

Heat another 2 tablespoons of oil in the wok over a high flame, add the pork, and stir-fry for 30 seconds or so until it's cooked, splashing in the Shaoxing rice wine and the soy sauce as you go.

Add the ya cai or Tianjin preserved vegetable and stir-fry briefly until hot, then toss in the beans, stir and toss, adding salt to taste (remember that the ya cai is already very salty).

Remove from the heat, stir in the sesame oil, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is one of Sichuan's most famous vegetable dishes.  The green beans are traditionally dry-fried over a medium heat until they are tender and slightly wrinkled, although these days most restaurants deep-fry them to reduce the cooking time.  If you want to minimize the oiliness, you can steam or boil the beans to cook them through instead of frying them, and then follow the rest of the recipe (from step 3) according to the instructions given above.  This method is not authentic, but the results are delicious, particularly for the vegetarian version of the dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CR»ME ANGLAISE ===
  2               cups  milk
  2              large  eggs -- plus
  1                     egg yolk
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === TRIFLE ===
  1                cup  dried tart cherries
  3                     Bartlett pears
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  2               cups  raspberry jam
     1/4           cup  warm water
  1                cup  slivered almonds -- toasted (see Note)
                        One 9" by 5" bakery pound cake
  1                cup  sherry (preferably amontillado or oloroso)
                        = (or Madeira or sweet Marsala)
  4               cups  CrËme Anglaise -- (above)
                        === WHIPPED CREAM ===
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  1 1/2    tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Make The CrËme Anglaise:  Rinse the inside of a non-aluminum saucepan with water and shake out the excess water.  Pour in the milk and place over medium-low heat until small bubbles form around the edges of the pan, about 5 minutes.  In a small bowl, combine the whole eggs, egg yolk, and granulated sugar and whisk just until blended.  Gradually whisk in half of the hot milk, then pour the egg mixture into the pan.  Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring constantly until thick enough to coat the back of spoon, leaving a clear trail when a finger is drawn through it, 6 to 8 minutes.  Do not allow to boil.

Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.  Stir in the vanilla.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming, and let cool.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or for up to 2 days.

Make The Trifle:  Put the dried cherries in a small bowl and add boiling water to cover.  Let stand for at least 30 minutes to plump the cherries.  Drain.  Reserve about 2 tablespoons of the cherries for garnish.

Peel the pears, halve lengthwise, core, and cut the pears crosswise into thin slices.  Put them in a bowl, add the lemon juice, and toss to coat.  In a small bowl, combine the jam with the warm water and stir.  Reserve about 2 tablespoons almonds for garnish.

Cut the sponge cake into slices 1/2-inch thick.  In a 2 1/2-quart trifle dish or deep glass bowl, make a layer of one-third of the cake slices, cutting and fitting them together as necessary.  Sprinkle the cake layer with one-third of the sherry.  Dollop one-third of the jam mixture over the cake.  Sprinkle the jam with one-third each of the pears, cherries, and almonds, in that order.

Pour 1 1/3 cups of the crËme anglaise over the top.  Repeat to make 2 more layers.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the trifle for at least 2 hours or for up to overnight.

Make The Whipped Cream:  About 30 minutes before serving, make the whipped cream: In a deep bowl, using a balloon whisk, beat the cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla until soft peaks form.  Spoon the cream over the top of the trifle.  Garnish with the reserved cherries and almonds.

Let stand at room temperature for about 30 minutes.  To serve, scoop out large spoonfuls, going down to the bottom layer.

Comments:  Trifle, a layered dessert of sponge or pound cake, crËme Anglaise, fruit, and fresh whipped cream have been showing up at elegant Christmas dinners for centuries.  This version by Carolyn Miller makes for a particularly festive dessert-table centerpiece.

Note:  To toast the slivered almonds, in a small, dry frying pan over medium-low heat, stir the almonds frequently until they are fragrant and begin to turn golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Immediately transfer to a bowl and let cool.

This recipe yields many servings for a large crowd.

         Espresso Cupcakes With Milk Chocolate Ganache, Frosting

Recipe By     :Emily Luchetti
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cupcakes                        Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CUPCAKES ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  instant espresso powder
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- softened
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  milk
                        === MILK CHOCOLATE GANACHE ===
     2/3           cup  heavy (whipping) cream
  5 1/2         ounces  milk chocolate -- finely chopped
                        === WHITE CHOCOLATE FROSTING ===
  4 1/2         ounces  white chocolate -- finely chopped
  1 3/4           cups  confectioners' sugar
     1/4           cup  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     3/4         stick  unsalted butter -- softened
  1              pinch  salt

Make The Cupcakes:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line 12 cupcake wells with paper liners.

Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.  Stir in the espresso powder.

Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter with the granulated sugar until light, 1 minute with a stand mixer or 2 minutes with a handheld mixer.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Continue to beat the mixture for 1 minute with a stand mixer or 2 minutes with a handheld mixer.  On low speed, alternately add the dry ingredients and the milk in 2 additions, stirring until incorporated after each addition.

Pour the batter into the paper-lined cupcake wells.  Bake until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 20 minutes.  Let cool to room temperature, then remove from the pans.

Make The Ganache:  Place the cream in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan and warm over medium-high heat until it begins to bubble around the edges, about 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the stove, add the chocolate, and whisk until smooth.  Transfer to a bowl and place plastic wrap directly over the ganache.  Refrigerate until cold.

Make The Frosting:  Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler (see note below).  Stir until smooth.  Let cool to room temperature.

Sift the confectioners' sugar into a medium bowl.  Stir in the milk and vanilla.  Add the butter and salt and beat until smooth.  Stir in the cooled white chocolate.  Refrigerate until firm enough to frost the cupcakes, about 30 minutes.

Cut out about one quarter of the inside of each cupcake with a small paring knife.  Fill the indent with the milk chocolate ganache.  Frost each cupcake with the white chocolate frosting.

This recipe yields 13 cupcakes.

Comments:  Decadent is the only way to describe these cupcakes.  The rich, mocha cake is filled with even richer chocolate ganache, then, as if that weren't enough, Luchetti tops it all off with white chocolate frosting.  These are so good, they'll last a day, if even that long.

Planning Ahead:  The cupcakes can be made a day in advance; wrap in plastic wrap and store at room temperature.  The ganache can be made several days ahead and kept refrigerated.  The frosting can be made a day ahead and stored at room temperature.  For maximum flavor and moistness, fill and frost the cupcakes the day you plan to serve them.

Note On Melting Chocolate:  Bring a pot one-third full of water to a boil.  Turn off the heat and place a stainless steel bowl over the water (you can also use a double boiler).  Make sure the bowl is sitting over, not in, the water, as chocolate will scorch if it gets too hot.  (To check this, place the bowl on the pot and then pick it up to see if there is any water on the bottom of the bowl).  The residual heat will melt the chocolate.  While the chocolate is melting, stir occasionally.  If you haven't stirred the chocolate while it was melting, it may look unmelted on top, but the rest of it could be melted.  This is especially important with milk and white chocolates since they scorch easily.

                   Espresso Granita With Whipped Cream

Recipe By     :Judy Rodgers
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRANITA ===
  1                cup  sugar -- or to taste
  2               cups  espresso -- room temperature
  3        tablespoons  water
                        === WHIPPED CREAM ===
     1/2           cup  cold heavy cream - (about)
  2          teaspoons  sugar - (about)

Make The Granita:  Dissolve all but 2 tablespoons of the sugar in the espresso and taste.  It should taste too sweet; if not, gradually add some or all of the remaining sugar, until it does.  Add the water.  Pour into a stainless steel pan or glass dish in which forms a pool about an inch deep.  Freeze until solid.  Due to the high concentration of sugar, this may take up to 8 hours.

Choose a glass, plastic or stainless storage vessel, about 3 cups capacity, with a tightly fitting lid.  Make sure it is dry, snap on the lid, and place in the freezer.

Place the pan of frozen espresso on a cool surface and chop according to the method below.

Ten to 15 minutes before serving, turn the container upside down in the freezer.  (The espresso syrup sometimes drains from the ice crystals, like syrup in a snow cone; turning it upside down will redistribute the syrup.)  Place 5- to 6-ounce serving bowls or glasses in the freezer to chill.  I like to use clear, narrow, fluted stemware to show off the layers and crystals.

Make The Cream & Serve:  Combine the cream and sugar and whip very stiffly.

To serve, layer the granita and whipped cream like a parfait in the chilled glasses.  There should be nearly as much whipped cream as granita.  The surface of the cream will freeze where it is in contact with the granita, and the succession of voluptuous chewy and slushy textures is delightful.

This recipe yields 5 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This granita is the sweetest thing we make at Zuni, and yet it is refreshing.  This effect requires fiercely rich espresso.  Weaker espresso will make an insipid, pale, sugary granita not worth the effort.  Our espresso is made with equal parts dark-roasted Costa Rican, Papua New Guinean, and Colombian beans.  Our machine doses 1/4 cup water per espresso; we use 1/4 ounce ground espresso beans (1 1/2 tablespoons, very tightly packed) per dose.  Don't use instant espresso, or any sort of brewed coffee.

Chopping Method:  I know of no mechanical chopping system that will produce a granita with the elegant texture of a hand-chopped one.  We chop with a pair of stainless steel pastry scrapers.  They are easy to maneuver, and the relatively dull edges tease the crystals apart without slicing them up.  (You can make do with one scraper; it will just take longer.)  A knife blade produces a finer, denser texture.

Once the juice or puree has set a very thick crust but has not quite frozen through, usually 1 to 2 hours, give it a preliminary round of chopping: Place the pan on a cool surface in a cool room.  Use the scraper to cut through and lift the layer of coarse-crystal ice, amalgamating it with the unfrozen core.  A few cuts and folds are usually sufficient.  Cover the pan and return to the freezer.  Check hourly, and when the whole is firm to the touch but still yields easily to a stab with the scraper, it is ready for the final chopping.

Set the pan on a cool surface and methodically chop the crystalline blocks into a regular flaky, granular mass.  This can be tedious, but is easy ó as long as you have not let the liquid freeze too solid.  If it is rock hard, it will take more brawn to cut through the chunks, and you may overwork some bits as you try to split the harder pebbles.  At the opposite extreme, in rare instances where the mixture is fairly sweet, or where the puree was thick, the liquid may never fully freeze hard, and it will chop to a rich, grainy-slushy texture.  Such "defective" granitas can be exquisite.  Transfer to the chilled container, snap on the lid, and place in the freezer.

<DirT>
Make The Granita:  Dissolve all but 2 tablespoons of the sugar in the espresso and taste.  It should taste too sweet; if not, gradually add some or all of the remaining sugar, until it does.  Add the water.  Pour into a stainless steel pan or glass dish in which forms a pool about an inch deep.  Freeze until solid.  Due to the high concentration of sugar, this may take up to 8 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Choose a glass, plastic or stainless storage vessel, about 3 cups capacity, with a tightly fitting lid.  Make sure it is dry, snap on the lid, and place in the freezer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the pan of frozen espresso on a cool surface and chop according to the method below.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Ten to 15 minutes before serving, turn the container upside down in the freezer.  (The espresso syrup sometimes drains from the ice crystals, like syrup in a snow cone; turning it upside down will redistribute the syrup.)  Place 5- to 6-ounce serving bowls or glasses in the freezer to chill.  I like to use clear, narrow, fluted stemware to show off the layers and crystals.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Cream &amp; Serve:  Combine the cream and sugar and whip very stiffly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, layer the granita and whipped cream like a parfait in the chilled glasses.  There should be nearly as much whipped cream as granita.  The surface of the cream will freeze where it is in contact with the granita, and the succession of voluptuous chewy and slushy textures is delightful.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 5 to 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This granita is the sweetest thing we make at Zuni, and yet it is refreshing.  This effect requires fiercely rich espresso.  Weaker espresso will make an insipid, pale, sugary granita not worth the effort.  Our espresso is made with equal parts dark-roasted Costa Rican, Papua New Guinean, and Colombian beans.  Our machine doses 1/4 cup water per espresso; we use 1/4 ounce ground espresso beans (1 1/2 tablespoons, very tightly packed) per dose.  Don&apos;t use instant espresso, or any sort of brewed coffee.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Chopping Method:  I know of no mechanical chopping system that will produce a granita with the elegant texture of a hand-chopped one.  We chop with a pair of stainless steel pastry scrapers.  They are easy to maneuver, and the relatively dull edges tease the crystals apart without slicing them up.  (You can make do with one scraper; it will just take longer.)  A knife blade produces a finer, denser texture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Once the juice or puree has set a very thick crust but has not quite frozen through, usually 1 to 2 hours, give it a preliminary round of chopping: Place the pan on a cool surface in a cool room.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/3         sticks  unsalted butter
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour -- spooned in,
                        and leveled
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  sliced blanched almonds
                        === TOPPING ===
     2/3           cup  superfine sugar
     2/3         stick  unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" slices
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped glacÈ cherries
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped candied orange peel
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped candied lemon peel
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated orange zest
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated lemon zest
  1                cup  sliced unblanched almonds
  2             ounces  fine-quality bittersweet or semisweet
                        chocolate (such as Lindt Bittersweet) -- coarsely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  vegetable or canola oil

Make The Crust:  Position the shelf in the center of the oven.  Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Tear a 15- by 18-inch sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil.  Invert the pan and center the foil over the pan, pressing it across the bottom and down the sides.  Remove the foil, turn the pan right side up, and place the foil shell into the pan, shaping it smoothly across the bottom and snugly against the sides.  Using a pastry brush, grease the bottom and sides with softened butter, taking care not to tear the foil.

Melt the butter in a medium saucepan.  Cool to tepid.

Place the flour, salt, and almonds in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade.  Pulse eight to ten times, then process for 60 seconds, until fine and cakey.  Using a fork, stir the mixture into the tepid melted butter and mix thoroughly.  Divide into eight portions and place in the pan, pressing it as evenly as you can.  Insert a dough scraper, small spatula, or the flat side of a plastic pastry comb between the dough and the sides of the pan to clean and even the edges.  Bake the crust for 15 to 16 minutes, or until lightly browned and set on top.  Let stand for 8 to 10 minutes to firm.

Make The Topping:  Place the sugar, butter, cream, honey, and salt in a heavy 2-quart saucepan.  Bring to a boil, stirring gently but constantly.  Brush the sides of the pot with water to be sure the sugar has dissolved, then simmer for 1 minute longer.

Mix in the candied fruits, zests, and nuts, blending well.  Cook the mixture over low heat for 6 to 8 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and the caramel starts to darken.  The thickness of the pot will determine the cooking time.  Watch the sides of the pot to see the first signs of thickening.

Immediately pour the filling onto the warm crust and spread evenly with a large buttered offset spatula, distributing the topping as best you can.  Bake for 13 to 15 minutes, until bubbly on top and the surface has begun to brown.  Do not overbake.  Cool on a wire rack.

Top With The Chocolate:  Melt the chocolate in a water bath (note below).  When the chocolate is almost melted, stir in the vegetable oil.  Do not let the chocolate mixture get too hot.  Keep the chocolate warm while you unmold the cookies, gently stirring occasionally.

Lift the bar from the pan, using the foil as an aid, and place on a cutting board or flat surface.  Before you web the bar with chocolate, cut the bar in half and slide each half off the foil.

Pour the warm chocolate into a plastic squeeze bottle or an 8-inch pastry bag fitted with a #2 standard writing tip.  Starting at an upper corner of one of the cookie bars, make very fine lines at an angle, moving the pastry bag back and forth to the opposite corner until the entire surface is covered; if you wish, reverse the pattern, going in the opposite direction.  Repeat with the remaining cookie bar.  Let stand until the chocolate is set, then cut into eighty 1- by 1 3/4-inch bars.

This recipe yields 80 {1 by 1 3/4-inch) cookies.

Comments:  Festive Florentines have a thin nut crust topped with chewy, honey-flavored caramel.  The golden caramel is covered with sliced unblanched almonds, which are traditional here, and colorful glace fruits.  The jewel-like filling sparkles through a web of chocolate zigzagged across the top.

STORAGE: Store in an airtight container, layered between strips of wax paper, for up to 5 days. These cookies may be frozen.

NOTE: A water bath, also referred to as a bain-marie, can be used for both hot and cold mixtures. By surrounding the food with water, the heat is cushioned and prevents the food from overcooking. In cookie baking, the hot water method is used most commonly for melting chocolate. It takes two pots or bowls to make a water bath, one large and the other smaller. For stovetop purposes, a small amount of hot water is placed in a shallow pan, such as a skillet, and heated to a simmer. Set a bowl holding the chocolate into the water. The level of the water should cover no more than one-fourth of the exterior of the inner bowl. Otherwise, the bowl may float or tip.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LEMON FILLING ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt
  1 3/8           cups  cold water
  4              large  egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  grated zest from 1 lemon
     1/2           cup  juice from 2 lemons
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        === CAKE ===
                        Softened unsalted butter -- for the pans
     1/2           cup  cake flour
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
  2        tablespoons  milk
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  5              large  eggs -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1             recipe  Rich Lemon Filling -- (above)
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting cake

Make The Filling:  Bring the sugar, cornstarch, salt, and water to a simmer in a large non-reactive saucepan over medium heat, whisking occasionally at the beginning of the process and more frequently as the mixture begins to thicken.  When the mixture starts simmer and turn translucent, whisk in the egg yolks, two at a time.  Whisk in the zest, then the lemon juice, and, finally, the butter.  Bring the mixture to a good simmer, whisking constantly.

Remove the pan from the heat.  Transfer the filling to another container to cool to room temperature, placing plastic wrap directly on the surface of the filling to prevent a skin from forming.  The filling will thicken as it cools.  To ensure that the filling does not thin out, do not stir it once it has set.  (The filling can be refrigerated overnight.)

Make The Cake:  Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease two 8- or 9-inch cake pans and cover pan bottoms with rounds of parchment paper.

Whisk the flours, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.  Heat the milk and butter in a small saucepan over low heat until the butter melts.  Off heat, add the vanilla; cover and keep warm.

Separate the eggs, placing the whites in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or a large mixing bowl if using a hand mixer or whisk) and reserving the yolks in another mixing bowl.  Beat the whites on high speed until foamy.  Gradually add 6 tablespoons of the sugar and the cream of tartar and continue to beat the whites to soft, moist peaks.  If using a standing mixer transfer the beaten egg whites to a large bowl and add the egg yolks to the standing mixer bowl (don't clean the bowl).

Beat the egg yolks with the remaining 6 tablespoons sugar on medium-high speed until the mixture is very thick and a pale lemon color, about 5 minutes.  Add the beaten egg whites to the yolks, but do not mix.

Sprinkle the flour mixture over the egg whites and mix on low speed for 10 seconds.  Remove the bowl from the mixer, make a well in one side of the batter and pour the melted butter mixture into the bowl.  Fold gently with a large rubber spatula until the batter shows no trace of flour and the whites and yolks are evenly mixed, about 8 strokes.

Immediately pour the batter into the prepared pans.  Bake until the cake tops are light brown and feel firm and spring back when touched, about 16 to 18 minutes for 9-inch cake pans and 20 to 22 minutes for 8-inch cake pans.

Cool completely on racks.  Run a thin knife around the inside of the cake pans and then invert them onto the racks (or onto cardboard rounds or tart pan bottoms) to release the cakes from the pans.  Remove the parchment paper.

Place one cake layer on a serving plate.  Carefully spoon the filling over the layer And spread evenly to the cake edge.  Place the second cake layer on top, making sure the layers line up properly.  Dust the cake with confectioners' sugar and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  For many home bakers, sponge cake is no longer a simple workhorse recipe.  The reason?  Many cookbooks direct them to make sponge cake using the French gÈnoise method, which is finicky and prone to disaster.  For a gÈnoise, whole are beaten with sugar and then flour is very gently folded in.  This folding process can be trying ó especially for an inexperienced baker ó because the delicate foam often collapses, and the result is a squat, lackluster cake.  I wanted to develop a better, more foolproof recipe.

If you like, simply bake the sponge cake and fill it with jam such as blackberry and top with a sifted sprinkling of confectioners' sugar.

Make The Filling:  Bring the sugar, cornstarch, salt, and water to a simmer in a large non-reactive saucepan over medium heat, whisking occasionally at the beginning of the process and more frequently as the mixture begins to thicken.  When the mixture starts simmer and turn translucent, whisk in the egg yolks, two at a time.  Whisk in the zest, then the lemon juice, and, finally, the butter.  Bring the mixture to a good simmer, whisking constantly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the pan from the heat.  Transfer the filling to another container to cool to room temperature, placing plastic wrap directly on the surface of the filling to prevent a skin from forming.  The filling will thicken as it cools.  To ensure that the filling does not thin out, do not stir it once it has set.  (The filling can be refrigerated overnight.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Cake:  Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease two 8- or 9-inch cake pans and cover pan bottoms with rounds of parchment paper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk the flours, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.  Heat the milk and butter in a small saucepan over low heat until the butter melts.  Off heat, add the vanilla; cover and keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Separate the eggs, placing the whites in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or a large mixing bowl if using a hand mixer or whisk) and reserving the yolks in another mixing bowl.  Beat the whites on high speed until foamy.  Gradually add 6 tablespoons of the sugar and the cream of tartar and continue to beat the whites to soft, moist peaks.  If using a standing mixer transfer the beaten egg whites to a large bowl and add the egg yolks to the standing mixer bowl (don&apos;t clean the bowl).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat the egg yolks with the remaining 6 tablespoons sugar on medium-high speed until the mixture is very thick and a pale lemon color, about 5 minutes.  Add the beaten egg whites to the yolks, but do not mix.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sprinkle the flour mixture over the egg whites and mix on low speed for 10 seconds.  Remove the bowl from the mixer, make a well in one side of the batter and pour the melted butter mixture into the bowl.  Fold gently with a large rubber spatula until the batter shows no trace of flour and the whites and yolks are evenly mixed, about 8 strokes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Immediately pour the batter into the prepared pans.  Bake until the cake tops are light brown and feel firm and spring back when touched, about 16 to 18 minutes for 9-inch cake pans and 20 to 22 minutes for 8-inch cake pans.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cool completely on racks.  Run a thin knife around the inside of the cake pans and then invert them onto the racks (or onto cardboard rounds or tart pan bottoms) to release the cakes from the pans.  Remove the parchment paper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place one cake layer on a serving plate.  Carefully spoon the filling over the layer And spread evenly to the cake edge.  Place the second cake layer on top, making sure the layers line up properly.  Dust the cake with confectioners&apos; sugar and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  For many home bakers, sponge cake is no longer a simple workhorse recipe.  The reason?  Many cookbooks direct them to make sponge cake using the French gÈnoise method, which is finicky and prone to disaster.  For a gÈnoise, whole are beaten with sugar and then flour is very gently folded in.  This folding process can be trying ó especially for an inexperienced baker ó because the delicate foam often collapses, and the result is a squat, lackluster cake.  I wanted to develop a better, more foolproof recipe.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you like, simply bake the sponge cake and fill it with jam such as blackberry and top with a sifted sprinkling of confectioners&apos; sugar.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COOKIES ===
     1/2           cup  blanched whole almonds
  1 3/4           cups  confectioners' sugar
  3        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
  3              large  egg whites
  1              pinch  salt
  2          teaspoons  granulated sugar
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  heavy (whipping) cream
  2        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
  5             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- room temperature

Make The Cookies:  Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.

Pulse the almonds with 1 cup of the confectioners' sugar in a food processor until finely ground.  Add the cocoa powder and the remaining 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar and pulse until well blended.

Beat the egg whites with the salt with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl just until the whites form soft peaks when the beaters are lifted.  Add the granulated sugar and beat just until the whites form stiff peaks when the beaters are lifted.  With a whisk or a rubber spatula, gently fold in the almond mixture.

Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip.  Pipe out 1-inch-diameter mounds about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.  Bake, one sheet at a time, for 6 to 8 minutes, until the tops are cracked and appear dry but the macaroons are still slightly soft to the touch.

Transfer the cookies, still on the parchment paper, to barely dampened kitchen towels and let cool for 5 minutes.  Carefully peel the paper off the macaroons and transfer to wire racks to cool completely.  (The macaroons can be made 1 day in advance and stored in layers separated by wax paper in an airtight container.)

Make The Filling:  Bring the cream just to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat.  Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the cocoa powder.  Add the chocolate and butter and whisk until smooth.  Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate covered, for at least 30 minutes, or until the filling is firm enough to hold its shape when spread.

Assemble The Macaroons:  If desired, transfer the filling to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip.  Pipe the filling, or spread it with a table knife, generously on the flat side of half of the macaroons.  Top with the remaining macaroons, flat-side down, pressing together gently to form sandwiches.  (The cookies can be stored in layers separated by wax paper in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.)

This recipe yields about 4 dozen cookies.

Comments:  First made by convent nuns during the eighteenth century, these are not at all like the macaroons most of us grew up with.  They are one of my most favorite things about being in Paris, and I love walking through the city nibbling on them.  Iusually get them from either Dalloyau or Laduree.

If you're not going to Paris soon, whip these up and make-believe.  You'll love the textural contrast between the crisp cookies and the luscious creamy ganache filling.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1                cup  light-brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable oil
  3              large  eggs
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  2          teaspoons  ground Ceylon cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  5                     fresh apples (Winesap or Granny Smith) -- peeled, and
                        diced into 1/2" pieces
  1 1/4           cups  not-too-finely chopped pecans
  2 1/4      teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  light-brown sugar
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  heavy cream

Make The Cake:  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Put the sugars and vegetable oil in a mixing bowl, and beat until very well blended.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt, and gradually add to the sugar and eggs, mixing just until well blended.

Stir in the apples, pecans, and vanilla, and pour into a buttered and 9- by 13-inch baking pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer or toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 1/4 hours (begin checking after 50 minutes).  Remove from the oven, and allow to cool in the pan while you prepare the caramel glaze.

Make The Glaze:  Melt the butter in a saucepan, and add both the sugars and the salt.  Stir until blended, and cook over medium-low heat for 2 minutes.  Stir in the heavy cream, and boil for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.

Use a skewer or toothpick to poke holes all over the top of the cake, and pour the warm glaze over the surface.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  When apples are in season, there's nothing finer than a simple apple cake.  Although easy to make, this cake is anything but ordinary.  It's bursting with fresh apple flavor and spices, while the crunch of pecan, which places the cake unmistakably in Southern territory, adds just the right bite.  And, well, the coat of rich caramel makes this an over-the-moon dessert.

                        chocolates
  2          teaspoons  store-bought hot chocolate mix
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  3               cups  ice
                        Whipped cream
                        Chocolate shavings

Make The Whipped Cream:  Combine the cream and vanilla and mix well.  With an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, start whipping the cream on medium speed.  Add the corn syrup slowly while beating.  Whip until the cream holds soft peaks.

Pour into a giant goblet and top with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.  Enjoy with a spoon or a straw ó or both!

This recipe yields 1 giant frozen drink.

Recipe By     :Phyllis Glazer
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  bittersweet chocolate
     1/2         stick  butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  cream cheese -- room temperature
  1                cup  turbinado sugar or granulated sugar
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  1           teaspoon  kosher for Passover vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  matzah cake flour
  2        tablespoons  potato starch
  1                cup  finely-chopped pecans

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Butter an 8- by 12-inch cake pan, or line it with parchment paper and butter the sides.

Break the chocolate into pieces and melt in top of a double boiler, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat and let cool slightly.  (Chocolate may also be softened in the microwave.)

In the bowl of a standing electric mixer, or using a wooden spoon or a whisk, cream the butter and cream cheese.  Beat in the sugar, eggs, and vanilla, mixing well.  Add the cake flour, potato starch, cooled chocolate, and nuts, and mix on low speed, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally with a rubber spatula.

Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes (an 8-inch round cake will take slightly more time), or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cut with a sharp knife while still warm.

This recipe yields 24 brownies (dairy).

Comments:  Rich and fudgy, these brownies will be devoured within minutes.

Note:  This recipe makes twenty-four 1/2-inch-high brownies.  The same recipe can be baked in an 8-inch round pan as a cake.  Save the nuts and sprinkle them on top, or use them in the cake and sprinkle confectioners' sugar over the top.

                  Ginger Br˚lÈe With Buried Blackberries

Recipe By     :Todd English
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2             ounces  sliced fresh gingerroot - (abt 1/4 cup)
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/3           cup  sugar -- plus
                        additional for caramelizing
  5              large  egg yolks
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Place the cream and gingerroot in a small pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Off heat, steep for 1 hour.

Place the vanilla, sugar, egg yolks, and salt in a bowl and mix to combine.  Reheat the cream over medium heat and bring back to a boil.  Pour the cream over the egg mixture in a steady stream, whisking all the while.  Pour through a strainer and discard the solids.  If desired, cool in an ice bath and refrigerate up to 2 days.

Pour the custard into eight 5-ounce ramekins.  Place the ramekins in a large baking pan and fill halfway with hot water.  Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the tops quiver but do not ripple, about 35 minutes if the mixture is hot when put in the oven, or 50 minutes if chilled.  Set aside to cool.  (You can cover and refrigerate the custards at this point up to 2 days.)

Sprinkle the tops with sugar and caramelize with a hand-held propane torch set on medium using short sweeping strokes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  We've jazzed up the classic French custard with a wallop of fresh ginger in addition to vanilla, topped with a brittle layer of sugar.  The thickness of the br˚lÈe sugar is a controversial topic.  Some like it really thick; we think the sugar should be like the first freeze on a puddle, so thin you can see the custard underneath.

We use a blowtorch to caramelize these, but if you don't have one, they can be prepared as above and broiled for a few minutes to caramelize the sugar!  The only drawback to this method is that you need to refrigerate the br˚lÈes for 1 hour after broiling to reset the custard or broil with molds in an ice bath.

                  Glazed Lemon Ginger Shortbread Wedges

Recipe By     :Tish Boyle
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LEMON GLAZE ===
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar -- sifted
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- softened
  3        tablespoons  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lemon zest
  1              pinch  salt
                        === SHORTBREAD ===
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  cake flour (not self-rising)
  9        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated lemon zest
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped crystallized ginger

Make The Glaze:  In the bowl of an electric mixer, using the paddle attachment, beat the confectioners' sugar, butter, heavy cream, lemon zest, and salt at medium speed just until combined, about 30 seconds.  Cover the surface of the glaze with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature until ready to use.

Make The Shortbread:  Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Have a 9-inch round cake pan at hand.

Sift the flours together into a medium bowl.  Gently whisk to combine; and set aside.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, using the paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar, ground ginger, salt, and lemon zest at medium-low speed until well blended (don't overheat; you don't want to incorporate a lot of air).  Add the crystallized ginger and mix until blended.  At low speed, add the flour in three additions, mixing just until the dough starts to come together and is no longer crumbly.

Press the dough evenly and firmly into the cake pan.  Press the back of the tines of a fork all around the edges.  Bake the shortbread for 35 to 40 minutes, until it is just barely colored a creamy beige; don't let it brown.  Place the pan on a wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes.

Glaze The Shortbread:  Remove the shortbread round from the pan and, using a sharp knife, cut it into 12 wedges.  Spread a generous amount of the glaze onto each wedge, letting it drip over the sides.  Transfer the triangles to the wire rack and cool completely.  Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.

This recipe yields about 12 cookies.

Comments:  Lemon and ginger are a personal favorite flavor combination of mine.  The lemon glaze with bits of lemon zest speckling the top makes for a pretty presentation.  Shortbread itself is a perfect neutral base for incorporating powerful flavors, particularly ginger. You will need something pungent if you're going to go for it, which is why I use ginger powder and bits of crystallized ginger.  It's sharp, so you get little bursts of flavor on the tongue, while the lemon rounds out the taste and gives a smooth finish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALAD ===
  10            ounces  log-shaped goat cheese -- the best
                        you can find
  6                     baguette slices
                        === DRESSING ===
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  1           teaspoon  grainy mustard such as Meux
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  8               cups  mixed salad greens (mesclun)
  4             ounces  black Nicoise olives -- pitted
     1/2           cup  walnuts

Heat the broiler.

Cut the goat cheese into six equal rounds and put one on top of each slice of baguette.  Put them on the broiler rack but do not broil yet.

Put the vinegar, mustards, and salt and pepper in a covered jar and shake vigorously until smooth.  Add the olive oil and shake again to blend.  Pour the dressing into a mixing bowl, add the greens, olives, and walnuts, and toss well.

Put the baguettes with cheese under the broiler and cook for 2 minutes until the cheese is coloring and bubbling.

Serve at once on a bed of dressed greens.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  There are different types of goat cheese, such as the delightfully named crottins de chËve, but for this recipe it's better to use the b˚che, or log-shaped cheeses.  There is a wonderfully earthy taste to good goat cheese, which mixes beautifully with really fresh salad leaves, crunchy walnuts, and good, spicy olives.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     vanilla bean
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  light corn syrup
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened, and
                        cut into 4 pieces
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        24-karat gold leaf

Line bottom and sides of a 9-inch square pan with parchment paper; set aside.

Split the vanilla bean in half with a small paring knife, and scrape out the seeds; discard the pod.  Add the seeds to the cream in a 1 1/2-quart saucepan; scald the cream and keep the saucepan near the stove so that if the cream cools too much when needed, you can reheat it briefly.

In a deep, heavy-bottomed 4-quart saucepan over low heat, blend the corn syrup and the sugar, stirring occasionally until the mixture becomes more fluid and most of the sugar appears dissolved.

Stop stirring, raise heat to medium-high, and gently boil until a candy thermometer registers 305 degrees (hard-crack stage), about 9 to 10 minutes.

Add the butter and salt to the sugar mixture, stirring constantly.  Pour in the warm vanilla-flavored cream in a slow but steady stream without letting the boiling stop (be carefulómixture foams up and is steamy).  Lower heat to medium and continue to boil gently until the thermometer registers about 248 degrees, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching, about 14 to 15 minutes.

Let the candy stand about 3 minutes to allow bubbling to subside, then pour into the prepared pan without scraping the saucepan; allow to cool at least 5 hours.

Invert onto a clean cutting board and cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips; then cut across the strips to form 1/2-inch squares.  To apply a patch of gold leaf to each square, use a small artist's brush.  With the brush, lift a tiny patch about the size of an oatmeal flake of gold leaf and deposit it on top of the caramels for decoration.

Cut caramels tend to stick together and not hold their shape unless individually wrapped, so for easiest storage wrap the block of caramel in aluminum foil and cut off portions as needed.  Store cut caramels in layers, separated by aluminum foil in an airtight metal or plastic container in a cool place for up to 3 weeks.

This recipe yields about 2 pounds 3 ounces.

Comments:  Golden Caramels ó literally, that's what these are in taste, color, and decoration.  Decorate each caramel square with a bit of 24-karat gold.  It's simple to make richly flavored Dark Chocolate Caramels from this same recipe: just add 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate (such as Valrhona, Scharffen Berger, or Callebaut), coarsely chopped, to the sugar and corn syrup in step 3.  Mmmmm, delicious!

Wrap caramels in clear cellophane or chocolate-coat them ó just dip them, one by one, into tempered chocolate, shake off excess, and transfer to a sheet of aluminum foil until the chocolate sets up.

              Grand Marnier Chocolate Cake With Shiny Icing

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  4             ounces  good-quality bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        Finely-chopped zest of 2 oranges
  3              large  eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
     3/8      teaspoon  cream of tartar -- (optional)
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  less 1 tbspn cake flour
     1/2           cup  grated bittersweet chocolate -- for decoration
                        === SHINY CHOCOLATE ICING ===
  7             ounces  good-quality bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped
     2/3           cup  heavy cream
  7        tablespoons  clarified butter

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees and place a rack in the lower third of the oven.  Cut a circle of parchment paper to the exact size of an 8-inch round cake pan, using the pan's base as a template.  Lightly butter the sides and bottom of the pan, place the parchment circle on the bottom, and butter the parchment.  Lightly flour the sides and bottom of the pan, and tap out the excess.

To make the cake batter, place the chocolate in a small saucepan over very low heat.  When the chocolate begins to look glossy and melted, remove from the heat and stir to be sure it's completely melted.  Return to the heat for a moment, if needed, to finish melting.  Let cool until barely warm before processing.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, 1/2 cup sugar, and zest on medium-low speed for 2 to 3 minutes, until softened and very fluffy.  Add and beat in the egg yolks and Grand Marnier for 30 seconds, until smooth.  Scoop the warm chocolate into the egg mixture and beat on medium-low speed until blended and smooth.

Is a separate clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or a clean copper bowl using a balloon whisk, whisk the whites until they are slightly foamy.  Add the cream of tartar (add only if not whisking in a copper bowl) and salt and continue beating until soft peaks form.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and continue to whisk for 20 to 30 seconds, until stiff, glossy peaks form.

Using a wide rubber spatula, fold a large spoonful of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it.  Put the flour into a fine-mesh strainer, sift a few tablespoons over the chocolate mixtures, and fold in.  Continue adding and folding the egg whites and flour into the batter, alternating between them.  Using a light hand, fold in each addition almost completely before adding the next.  The mixture should be completely smooth, but take care not to overmix the batter or it will loss precious air.  The batter should be light and somewhat fluffy.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and use an offset or flat spatula to gentle spread the batter evenly.  Bake for about 25 minutes, until the center of the cake is moist and leaves moist crumbs when pierced with a toothpick.  The edges will be dry 2 to 3 inches in from the rim of the pan.  Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for about 30 minutes before unmolding.  Loosen the edges with a small knife and gently invert and unmold the cake onto the cooling rack.  Carefully peel away and discard the parchment paper.  When the cake is completely cool, brush loose crumbs from the sides and top.

To prepare the icing, put the chocolate into a small saucepan.  Put the cream in another saucepan and heat over low heat, just until hand-hot; do not let it reach the simmering point.  Pour the cream over the chocolate (the pan of chocolate should not be over the heat).  Whisk the mixture gently, just enough to melting the chocolate.  (If there are any stubborn chunks of chocolate that that have not melted, place the pan over very low heat for a few moments to melt them.)  Add the clarified butter and whisk together until blended.

To glaze the cake with the icing, begin by pouring the icing onto the center of the cake.  Spread with an icing spatula so that the icing runs down the sides and covers the whole cake.  Press the grated chocolate into the icing on the sides of the cake while the icing is still soft.  In a cool room or in the refrigerator, let the cake stand until the icing is set, about 30 minutes.  (If refrigerated for too long, the icing will lose its shine.  To bring the shine back, place the cake in a warm 350 degree oven for 5 seconds, no more.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  It's very important to have all the ingredients for this cake at room temperature and the chocolate fluid but not too warm before mixing them with the egg whites: Barely warm ingredients blend together more easily.  Buy the best chocolate you can find for both the icing and the cake.  The French Valrhona is my favorite, but whatever chocolate you use, just make sure it's bittersweet, not unsweetened.

(If refrigerated for too long, the icing will lose its shine.  To bring the shine back, place the cake in a warm 350 degree oven for 5 seconds, no more.)

Comments:  It&apos;s very important to have all the ingredients for this cake at room temperature and the chocolate fluid but not too warm before mixing them with the egg whites: Barely warm ingredients blend together more easily.  Buy the best chocolate you can find for both the icing and the cake.  The French Valrhona is my favorite, but whatever chocolate you use, just make sure it&apos;s bittersweet, not unsweetened.

                       Green Bean And Potato Salad

Recipe By     :Susan Herrmann Loomis
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  best-quality red wine vinegar
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     shallots -- peeled, and
                        cut into paper-thin horizontal slices
  1 1/2         pounds  green beans -- snipped
  2             pounds  small new potatoes -- scrubbed

In a large bowl, whisk the vinegar with salt and pepper to taste.  Slowly add the oil, whisking until the dressing is emulsified.  Add the shallots, whisk briskly, and set aside.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (1 tablespoon sea salt per 2 quarts water) over high heat.  Prepare a large bowl of ice water.

Add the beans to the boiling water, return to a boil, and cook until the beans are tender but not mushy, 4 to 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beans to the ice water and leave them there until they are chilled through.  Drain the beans and spread them out on a tea towel to dry.

Bring the water back to a boil.  Add the potatoes and cook until they are just tender, 12 to 15 minutes.  Check the potatoes; depending on the variety and their freshness, they may take substantially longer to cook.  Drain the potatoes and set them aside to cool slightly.

Whisk the dressing again to be sure all the ingredients are well blended.

As soon as you can handle the potatoes (they should still be quite hot), cut them into bite-size pieces, dropping them right into the dressing.  Toss the potatoes and set them aside at room temperature.  About 20 minutes before serving the salad, toss in the beans.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  There is something about the soil in France that brings out the best in green beans.  Whatever the variety, haricots verts have a depth of flavor, a sweet and sophisticated nuttiness, that complements their inherent "green" flavor.

New potatoes are ready at the same time green beans come to market, and the combination is a natural ó particularly in this salad, which is showered with shallots.  This is delicious served while it's still warm, or at room temperature.

A Few Notes:  It may seem superfluous to call for "snipping" or "stringing" green beans, for it appears that contemporary varieties rarely have strings.  But strings are often a function of maturity.  The first couple of crops from a vine of "stringless" beans is usually just that ó without strings.  But subsequent crops often have strings.  So don't be cavalier about stringing your beans.  Always check them first.

Green beans have a tendency to turn yellow when left in contact with an acid.  For that reason I don't add the beans until about 20 minutes before serving this salad.  They have enough time to absorb the flavor of the dressing, yet retain their color.

                  Grilled Asparagus With Crab Mayonnaise

Recipe By     :Douglas Rodriguez
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  asparagus
  2        tablespoons  oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  mayonnaise
                        Zest and juice of 3 lemons
  2        tablespoons  adobo sauce (canned chipotles in adobo)
  1              pound  Alaskan crabmeat -- picked clean of
                        shells
     1/4           cup  finely-sliced chives
     1/2           cup  finely-diced red onion
  2        tablespoons  julienned cilantro
  4                     red jalapeÒos -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and diced

Blanch the asparagus in boiling salted water for 4 to 6 minutes, depending on the thickness of the stalks.  Plunge into ice water to stop the cooking.  Drain.  Peel away the tough outer skin.

Prepare a medium-low fire in the grill (or heat a grill pan over medium heat).

In a bowl, toss the asparagus with the oil and season with salt and pepper.  Arrange the asparagus crosswise on the hot grate to prevent them from falling through.  Grill for 1 or 2 minutes on both sides until lightly charred, and transfer to a serving dish.

In another bowl, combine the mayonnaise with the lemon zest, lemon juice, adobo sauce, and salt and pepper to taste.  Mix well.  Gently fold in the crabmeat, chives, red onion, cilantro, and jalapeÒos.

Scoop the crab mayonnaise over the asparagus and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This is an especially simple dish to prepare and serve.  It works well as an appetizer or as an accompaniment to fish, chicken or veal.

       Grilled Pineapple With Butter-Rum Glaze, Vanilla Mascarpone

Recipe By     :Bobby Flay
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dark rum
  1 1/2         sticks  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar
  1                     vanilla bean
  8             ounces  mascarpone
  1                     ripe pineapple -- peeled, and
                        sliced into 1/4"-thick rounds
     1/2           cup  fresh blueberries

Combine the rum, butter, and sugar in a small saucepan and simmer, whisking often, until the sugar has melted and the mixture is slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.  (The glaze can be made a few days in advance, cooled, covered, and kept refrigerated.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

Cut the vanilla bean lengthwise in half and scrape out the seeds with the tip of a sharp knife.  Whisk the mascarpone and vanilla seeds together.  (The mascarpone can be made a day in advance, covered, and kept refrigerated.)

Heat your grill to high.

Grill the pineapple slices, brushing frequently with the glaze, until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Remove the pineapple to a platter or serving plates and top each slice with a dollop of vanilla mascarpone.  Garnish with a few fresh blueberries.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings; can be doubled for 10 to 12 (no need to double the glaze).

Comments:  Ripe pineapple, with its plentiful natural sugars, is ideal for grilling, and it screams "tropical" like nothing else.  This makes a great dessert after spicy Latin, Indian, or Caribbean food.  Make sure to let the slices brown; you want lots of those caramelized, almost burnt edges.

Mascarpone is a smooth Italian dairy product with a texture somewhere between whipped cream and cream cheese.  It's used in tiramisu and available in many supermarkets and gourmet stores, but if you can't find it, good-quality vanilla ice cream will taste just fine.

Recipe By     :Nick Malgieri
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  skinned hazelnuts
  1                cup  blanched almonds
  1 1/4           cups  sugar -- divided
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  6              large  egg whites
  1              pinch  salt
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
     3/4           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  sugar
  4                     egg yolks
  3             sticks  unsalted butter -- softened
  3        tablespoons  instant espresso coffee powder -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  warm water
                        Confectioners' sugar

Line three jelly-roll pans with parchment paper and draw a 9-inch-diameter circle on each.  Set aside.  Set racks in the upper, middle and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.

Place the nuts in a food processor fitted with a metal blade and pulse until coarsely ground.  Spread the nuts in a jelly-roll pan and toast in the oven for about 10 to 13 minutes, stirring several times until golden.  Remove and let cool.  In a bowl, combine the cooled nuts with 1 cup of the sugar and the cornstarch.

Lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees.  In the bowl of an electric mixer, use the whisk attachment on medium-low speed to whip the egg whites and salt until white and frothy, about 2 minutes.  Increase the speed and slowly beat in 1/4 cup of sugar in a stream until the whites form firm peaks.  Beat in the extracts.  Slowly fold the nut mixture into the whites with a rubber spatula until thoroughly combined.  Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain round tip and pipe the meringue on the prepared pans into spirals starting at the center of each circle.  Bake the layers until they're golden and firm, about 60 to 75 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through baking.  Cool on racks.

While the layers are baking, combine the milk and sugar in a medium nonreactive saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat.  Put the egg yolks in a bowl and whisk to combine.  Slowly whisk some of the hot milk into the yolks, then return all of the egg yolk-milk mixture to the saucepan.  Cook briefly over low heat until thickened.  (Do not overcook or the eggs will scramble.)  Pour the mixture into the bowl of the electric mixer, and use the whisk attachment to whip on medium speed until cooled.  Add the butter, then the instant coffee dissolved in water, and whip until smooth and fluffy.

To assemble, place one of the cake layers on a platter and spread with one-third of the butter cream.  Place another layer on the butter cream and spread with another third of the butter cream.  Top with the last layer and spread the remaining butter cream on the sides of the cake, leaving the top bare.  Chill to set the butter cream.  The cake is best the next day, so cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.  To serve, bring to room temperature, dust with confectioners' sugar and cut with a serrated knife.

This recipe yields one 9-inch cake for 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  This recipe is a direct descendant of the dacquoise served at Windows.

Note:  For decorative effect, pulverize any bits of leftover cake layer in a food processor and press against the sides of the cake.  Chocolate ganache swirls, topped with nuts of your choice, can be piped on top.

Line three jelly-roll pans with parchment paper and draw a 9-inch-diameter circle on each.  Set aside.  Set racks in the upper, middle and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the nuts in a food processor fitted with a metal blade and pulse until coarsely ground.  Spread the nuts in a jelly-roll pan and toast in the oven for about 10 to 13 minutes, stirring several times until golden.  Remove and let cool.  In a bowl, combine the cooled nuts with 1 cup of the sugar and the cornstarch.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees.  In the bowl of an electric mixer, use the whisk attachment on medium-low speed to whip the egg whites and salt until white and frothy, about 2 minutes.  Increase the speed and slowly beat in 1/4 cup of sugar in a stream until the whites form firm peaks.  Beat in the extracts.  Slowly fold the nut mixture into the whites with a rubber spatula until thoroughly combined.  Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain round tip and pipe the meringue on the prepared pans into spirals starting at the center of each circle.  Bake the layers until they&apos;re golden and firm, about 60 to 75 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through baking.  Cool on racks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the layers are baking, combine the milk and sugar in a medium nonreactive saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat.  Put the egg yolks in a bowl and whisk to combine.  Slowly whisk some of the hot milk into the yolks, then return all of the egg yolk-milk mixture to the saucepan.  Cook briefly over low heat until thickened.  (Do not overcook or the eggs will scramble.)  Pour the mixture into the bowl of the electric mixer, and use the whisk attachment to whip on medium speed until cooled.  Add the butter, then the instant coffee dissolved in water, and whip until smooth and fluffy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble, place one of the cake layers on a platter and spread with one-third of the butter cream.  Place another layer on the butter cream and spread with another third of the butter cream.  Top with the last layer and spread the remaining butter cream on the sides of the cake, leaving the top bare.  Chill to set the butter cream.  The cake is best the next day, so cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.  To serve, bring to room temperature, dust with confectioners&apos; sugar and cut with a serrated knife.

                        Hazelnut Chocolate Tuiles

Recipe By     :Carole Bloom
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  1                cup  toasted skinned finely-ground hazelnuts

Halve 4 parchment paper sheets lengthwise and set aside.  Prepare a stencil using a piece of cardboard 6 inches long by 4 inches wide.  Draw a circle 2 1/2 inches in diameter in the upper half of the cardboard then cut out the circle.  The stencil is the cardboard with the circle removed.

Melt and temper the chocolate, then stir in the ground hazelnuts thoroughly.  Set the stencil over a strip of parchment paper and spread about a tablespoon of the mixture over the opening, using an offset spatula with a 4-inch blade.  The tuiles should be no more than 1/8-inch thick.

Lift the stencil off the parchment paper and scrape the excess chocolate mixture from the stencil back into the bowl.  You should be able to place 4 tuiles on each strip of parchment paper.

Let the tuiles set for 3 to 4 minutes, then carefully drape the parchment paper with the tuiles over a rolling pin that is set on a jelly roll pan.  Chill the tuiles in the refrigerator until firm (10 to 15 minutes).

Gently peel the parchment paper off the curved tuiles.  In a tightly covered container wrapped in several layers of aluminum foil, the tuiles will keep for 1 week at room temperature or 1 month in the refrigerator.  The tuiles are best served at room temperature.

This recipe yields 24 tuiles.

Comments:  Tuile is the French word for tile.  Here, a chocolate-nut mixture is draped over a rolling pin to give these confections a curve that resembles a roof tile.

                            Hazelnut Dacquoise

Recipe By     :Mary Risley
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MERINGUE ===
     3/4           cup  almonds - (4 oz) -- blanched
  2 1/2           cups  sugar
  6                     egg whites
                        Salt -- as needed
                        === BUTTERCREAM ===
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  sugar
  3             sticks  butter -- cut 1" pieces
  2        tablespoons  coffee extract
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped hazelnuts
                        === FINISH ===
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.  Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and on each sheet of paper trace a 10-inch circle.  Turn the paper over onto the pans.  Put the almonds and 3/4 cup sugar in a blender or food processor and finely grind.

Make The Meringues:  To make the meringues, put the egg whites with a few grains of salt in the bowl of an electric mixer and, with the whisk attachment, beat them until they are stiff and you can turn the bowl over your head without their falling out.  With the machine running, add the remaining 1 3/4 cups sugar, a tablespoon at a time.

Remove the bowl from the electric mixer and with a large rubber spatula loosely fold in the ground almond mixture.  (Thorough mixing is not necessary.)  Put the meringue mixture in a large pastry bag fitted with a 1-inch round tip.  Pipe two solid discs of meringue in a coil, starting on the outside of the outline.  It is important to let the meringue fall onto the paper ó do not press it down.

Bake until the meringues are almost firm, about an hour.  Switch the pans on the shelves halfway through the cooking time.  Remove the pans from the oven and let cool on racks for about 15 minutes before carefully peeling off the parchment.

To Make The Buttercream:  Put the eggs in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat with the whisk attachment for a minute.  Heat the sugar with enough water to make a paste in a small saucepan and stir to mix.  Cook, swirling from time to time, over low heat until the sugar is dissolved.  Turn up the heat and continue to boil, without stirring, until the sugar syrup reaches 242 degrees on a candy thermometer.

With the mixer running moderately-high, slowly pour the sugar syrup into the eggs.  Continue beating the mixture until the bowl is cool to the touch, at least 10 minutes.  Add the butter, one piece at a time.  As each one is absorbed, add another.  When all the butter is incorporated, beat in the coffee extract with a few grains of salt.  If the mixture begins to separate, stop adding the coffee extract and keep beating.

To Assemble:  Put the less attractive disc of meringue on a 9-inch round of cardboard.  (If the discs of meringue are uneven, you can saw the edges with a serrated knife to make them even.)  Spread all the coffee Buttercream over the meringue and place the other layer on top.  Smooth the Buttercream around the outside edge.

Lift the cake in one hand and press the chopped hazelnuts around the edge with the other hand.  Sieve a light layer of confectioners' sugar over the top.  Place the dacquoise on a round serving platter in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  In the 1980s all the famous food people stayed at San Francisco's Stanford Court Hotel.  It was a great time!  This is a dessert that was always served at the hotel's fine restaurant, Fournou's Ovens.  It's still a very special treat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  hazelnuts -- toasted, and
                        skins removed
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  2             ounces  cream cheese
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1              large  egg
  1              pinch  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     3/4           cup  Nutella or your favorite jam -- or as needed

In a food processor, finely grind the hazelnuts with 1/2 cup of the flour.

Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat together the butter, cream cheese, and sugar until light in color and smooth, 1 minute with a stand mixer or 2 minutes with a handheld mixer.  Add the egg and mix until combined.

On low speed, add the ground hazelnuts, the remaining flour, the salt, and the baking powder and mix until smooth.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Divide the dough into 4 pieces.  On a lightly sugared work surface, roll the dough into 4 logs, each 8 inches long.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour until firm.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

Slice the dough into 1/2-inch-thick rounds.  Place on the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart and bake until golden brown around the edges, about 8 minutes.  Let cool to room temperature.

Sandwich 2 cookies together using about 1 teaspoon of Nutella or jam for each.

This recipe yields about 32 cookies.

Comments:  Baking and decorating cookies signals the arrival of the winter season.  Once the cookie cutters, sprinkles, and royal icing are on the counter, the season is officially launched.  Here's a simple, luscious cookie to add to your cookie repertoire.

Planning Ahead:  The cookie dough can be made several days in advance and kept refrigerated.  It can also be frozen.  The cookies can be made several days in advance (without the filling).  Store at room temperature in an airtight container.  Sandwich the cookies the day you plan to serve them.

Comments:  Baking and decorating cookies signals the arrival of the winter season.  Once the cookie cutters, sprinkles, and royal icing are on the counter, the season is officially launched.  Here&apos;s a simple, luscious cookie to add to your cookie repertoire.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Planning Ahead:  The cookie dough can be made several days in advance and kept refrigerated.  It can also be frozen.  The cookies can be made several days in advance (without the filling).  Store at room temperature in an airtight container.  Sandwich the cookies the day you plan to serve them.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 3/4            cup  unsifted all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  unsifted cocoa powder
     1/4           cup  rice flour
  1 3/4         sticks  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  granulated sugar
                        === RUM SILK BUTTERCREAM FILLING ===
  4                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  dark rum
     1/2           cup  pine nuts
                        === DARK CHOCOLATE SATIN GLAZE ===
     1/4           cup  solid vegetable shortening
  1              pound  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        === ROYAL ICING ===
  1                cup  unsifted powdered sugar
  2        tablespoons  egg white - (1 large egg)
     1/8      teaspoon  cream of tartar

Make The Dough:  In a medium bowl, briefly blend the flour, cocoa powder and rice flour with a wire whisk; set aside.  In the large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter at medium-low speed until smooth about 1 minute.  Beat in the sugar at medium speed until fluffy scraping down the sides of the bowl.  Lower speed and gradually add the flour mixture, combining thoroughly.

Divide the dough in half; roll one portion at a time between two sheets of waxed paper to form a circle 10 inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick.  Leaving the dough between the waxed paper transfer the circles to a baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days; or freeze, well wrapped, up to 1 month.

Adjust rack to lower third of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line two large cool baking sheets with parchment paper.

Remove one dough circle at a time from the refrigerator.  Peel off top waxed paper sheet, replace it loosely on top, and flip the entire package over.  Peel off and discard the second sheet of waxed paper.

Pinch the wide end of a 1/2-inch plain decorating tip (such as Ateco #6) into an oval to make an oval cutter.  Using the cutter, cut out oval shapes in the dough, and space them 1/2 inch apart on baking sheets.  Bake, one sheet at a time, for 10 to 13 minutes, or until cookies appear dull brown and feel slightly firm (lightly touch a few).  Place baking sheet on a wire rack until the cookies are completely cool.  To store, stack in an airtight metal container at room temperature up to 1 week.

Make The Filling:  In the large bowl of an electric mixer, whip the egg yolks until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.  Remove bowl from mixer stand.  In a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the water and sugar over low heat.  Stir occasionally, washing down any sugar crystals clinging to the sides of the pan with a brush dipped in cold water, until sugar is dissolved.  Increase the heat and cook, without stirring, until the syrup reaches 238 degrees on a candy thermometer.  Pour into the center of the yolks and quickly whisk vigorously to combine.  Return bowl to mixer, and whip at medium speed until the egg yolk mixture thickens and cools to body temperature, about 5 minutes.  Maintaining medium speed, gradually add the butter to the cooled egg yolk mixture, a tablespoon at a time.  Continue mixing until all the butter has been incorporated and the buttercream is smooth and homogeneous.  Add the rum, whipping until thoroughly combined.

Set the cookies close together on one large clean baking sheet.  Using a 14-inch pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain decorating tip (such as Ateco #6), pipe an oval bulb of buttercream on each cookie.  Hold a cookie in one hand as you pipe with the other.  Then stick eight pine nuts into each buttercream oval as shown in the photo.  Refrigerate to firm the buttercream, at least 2 hours.

Make The Glaze:  Combine the shortening and chocolate in a 3-quart mixing bowl.  Place it over a saucepan filled with enough hot tap water (120 to 130 degrees) to reach the bottom of the bowl.  Stir the mixture occasionally until the glaze is liquid and smooth and registers close to 110 degrees on a candy thermometer.  If water begins to cool while melting the chocolate, maintain the 120 degrees temperature over very low heat.

Place the chilled Hedgehogs an inch apart on two wire racks set over shallow baking pans to catch drips.  Ladle about 2 tablespoons glaze over each Hedgehog, to cover completely.  After masking the pastries, gently move each one slightly on the rack with a small metal spatula while the glaze is liquid, to remove chocolate drippings from its underside.  This neat finish also keeps the pastries from sticking to the rack.

Pour the glaze from the baking pans back into the saucepan, and reheat.  Pour through a sieve in case any cookie crumbs have fallen into it.

The warm glaze sets up quickly after touching the cold, firm buttercream, leaving a gorgeous sheen.  Do not refrigerate the pastries after they have been glazed.

Make The Royal Icing:  When the glaze has set, mix the royal icing ingredients together in a 1 1/2-quart mixing bowl.  With a hand mixer on medium speed, whip until the mixture is thick and has a marshmallow-like consistency, about 5 minutes.  Fill a small handmade paper cone* with 2 tablespoons icing and pipe three tiny dots on each Hedgehog.  Then, dip a toothpick into some of the remaining liquid chocolate glaze, and place a dot of it on two of the icing dots, forming the Hedgehog's eyes.  Now their true personalities will be evident.

Gently lift each pastry with a small metal spatula, and arrange in a single layer in a foil-lined cardboard container, such as a cake box.  Cover and store at room temperature up to 2 days.

* Or, make a small pastry bag by placing the icing into one corner of a resealable plastic food bag.  Cut a very small tip off one corner and pipe three tiny dots on each Hedgehog.

This recipe yields 4 dozen 1 1/2-inch pets.

Comments:  These charming chocolate and rum buttercream creatures, each with its own personality, are known as Igels in Austria.  They captured my heart in Belgium and Germany, and I know you'll love them too.  Include them on an assorted miniature tray for a touch of delicious whimsy.

Decorative Note:  For an easier way to decorate these Hedgehogs is to omit the pine nuts.  Coat them with the chocolate glaze and, before it sets up, apply chocolate sprinkles over two-thirds of each pastry.  Pipe "eyes" on the uncovered portion with the royal icing.

                            Honey Walnut Cake

Recipe By     :Maria Helm Sinskey
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  walnut pieces
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        room temperature
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  10                    nice walnut halves -- for garnish
  2        tablespoons  honey -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour a 9-inch cake pan.

Spread the walnuts on a sheet pan and toast in the preheated oven for 6 minutes.  Cool and rub the nuts in a towel to remove the loose skins.

Grind the nuts in a food processor with 1/2 cup of the flour until very fine.  In a medium bowl, combine the ground nuts, remaining flour, baking powder, and salt.  Reserve.

In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment or with an electric hand mixer, beat the butter with the honey and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl.

In a small bowl, beat the eggs lightly with the orange zest and vanilla.  Add it in thirds to the butter mixture.  Beat well to incorporate after each addition.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Add the dry ingredients and mix until fully incorporated.

Spread the batter evenly in the prepared cake pan.  Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

While the cake is baking, toast the ten walnut halves on a sheet pan for 8 minutes.  While they are still warm rub the nuts in a towel to remove the excess skin and place them in a small bowl.  Add the 2 tablespoons of honey and stir until the walnuts are coated.  Reserve the walnut halves at room temperature to garnish the cake when it is finished.

Cool the cake in the pan for 5 minutes and then turn out onto a cake rack to cool.  Garnish the edge of the cake with the walnut halves.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Alsatians are fiercely proud of their honey.  It shows up in their cakes and pastries and gets drizzled on cheese.  Nothing expresses a region's character more than a spoonful of wildflower honey.  The flavor varies depending on what flowers are indigenous to the area.  A hive full of bees did a lot of hard work only to have their cache robbed so every spoonful consumed should be appreciated.  My Strasbourg-born grandmother would combine honey and walnuts in the fall to produce a cake similar to this one.  It is delicate and moist with the scent of honey, orange peel, and walnuts.  Serve it in wedges unadorned or with softly whipped cream.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour a 9-inch cake pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the walnuts on a sheet pan and toast in the preheated oven for 6 minutes.  Cool and rub the nuts in a towel to remove the loose skins.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grind the nuts in a food processor with 1/2 cup of the flour until very fine.  In a medium bowl, combine the ground nuts, remaining flour, baking powder, and salt.  Reserve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment or with an electric hand mixer, beat the butter with the honey and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, beat the eggs lightly with the orange zest and vanilla.  Add it in thirds to the butter mixture.  Beat well to incorporate after each addition.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Add the dry ingredients and mix until fully incorporated.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the batter evenly in the prepared cake pan.  Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the cake is baking, toast the ten walnut halves on a sheet pan for 8 minutes.  While they are still warm rub the nuts in a towel to remove the excess skin and place them in a small bowl.  Add the 2 tablespoons of honey and stir until the walnuts are coated.  Reserve the walnut halves at room temperature to garnish the cake when it is finished.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cool the cake in the pan for 5 minutes and then turn out onto a cake rack to cool.  Garnish the edge of the cake with the walnut halves.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Alsatians are fiercely proud of their honey.  It shows up in their cakes and pastries and gets drizzled on cheese.  Nothing expresses a region&apos;s character more than a spoonful of wildflower honey.  The flavor varies depending on what flowers are indigenous to the area.  A hive full of bees did a lot of hard work only to have their cache robbed so every spoonful consumed should be appreciated.  My Strasbourg-born grandmother would combine honey and walnuts in the fall to produce a cake similar to this one.  It is delicate and moist with the scent of honey, orange peel, and walnuts.  Serve it in wedges unadorned or with softly whipped cream.

                     Honey-And Lavender-Glazed Fruit

Recipe By     :Andrea Immer
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/2           cup  honey
  1                     small bunch lavender
  1              large  ripe pineapple -- peeled, quartered,
                        cored, and cut 1/2"-thick wedges
  3                     slightly under-ripe bananas -- peeled, and
                        sliced in half lengthwise
  3                     ripe but firm peaches -- peeled, halved,
                        pitted, and cut into 1"-thick wedges
  1               pint  vanilla ice cream -- (optional)

Combine the butter, honey, and lavender in a small saucepan and heat, whisking occasionally, until the butter is melted and the mixture is just coming to a simmer.  Remove from the heat and let sit in the pan for 30 minutes.  Remove the lavender and discard.  Pour the syrup through a fine strainer and into a bowl or measuring cup to remove any stray lavender leaves.

Preheat a gas grill to medium and lightly oil the grate.  Put all the fruits on a rimmed baking sheet and brush them with the honey glaze.  Grill, brushing once or twice with additional glaze, until the fruit is heated through, slightly tender, and caramelized, turning once, about 4 minutes total for the bananas, 6 minutes for the pineapple and peaches.  Serve immediately, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Infusing honey with lavender is a simple way to add some pretty exotic flavor to complement the smokiness of grilled, glazed fruit.  (If you can't find lavender at your market or farmer's market, try using lavender honey.  The flavor will be less distinct but still unique.)  Choose slightly under-ripe bananas, the ones that are still a little green, for this recipe.  They'll hold their shape on the grill, and the glaze and caramelization from grilling will give them plenty of sweetness.  The peaches, too, should be ripe but not soft, or they will fall apart during cooking.  This recipe is a snap if you've got a gas grill ready to fire up in the backyard, or if you've already made a charcoal fire to cook dinner, you can later use the cooling coals to caramelize the fruit.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MERINGUE ===
  8                     egg whites
  1              pinch  salt
  10            ounces  sugar
                        === SAUCE ===
  2               cups  milk
     1/2                vanilla bean -- halved lengthwise
  4                     egg yolks
  1              ounce  slivered almonds

Make The Meringue:  Place the egg whites in the bowl of the mixer and add the salt.  Using the whisk attachment, mix the whites slowly to break them up, then increase the speed and beat them until they hold soft peaks.  Reduce the speed and slowly add 6 ounces of the sugar.  Continue beating until the sugar is incorporated and the eggs once again hold soft peaks.

Place the milk in the large, shallow pan and bring it to a boil.  Reduce the heat to a simmer.  Using the two large spoons, scoop 12 "quenelles" from the egg whites and gently add them to the simmering milk to poach, 2 minutes per side.  Carefully remove the quenelles, place them on the plate lined with paper towels, and set aside to drain and cool.  Reserve the milk.

Make The Sauce (CrËme Anglaise):  Strain the milk into the small pot, adding more milk if necessary so that you have exactly 2 cups.  Add the vanilla bean and bring the milk back to a boil.  Turn off the heat and let the vanilla infuse into the milk.

Meanwhile, in the medium mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the remaining 4 ounces of sugar.  Bring the milk back to a boil and, while whisking the yolk mixture, add to it half the boiling milk.  Once this mixture is homogenous, add it back to the pot with the remaining milk, whisking constantly.  Switch to a wooden spoon and stir the mixture constantly, using a figure-eight motion and making sure to reach all edges of the pot.  Continue to stir over low heat until the mixture coats the back of the spoon.

Remove the sauce from the heat, discard the vanilla pod, and carefully place the pot into the ice-water bath, making sure that the water does not leak into the custard.

To Serve:  Place 3 quenelles in the center of each of the four soup bowls.  Ladle CrËme Anglaise into each bowl.  Garnish with slivered almonds and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  These clouds of meringue floating in caramel sauce are a classic French bistro dessert.

                   Indian Milk Fritters - {Gulab Jamun}

Recipe By     :Gil Marks
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1                cup  nonfat dry milk powder
     1/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, cooled
  3        tablespoons  milk - (to 4)
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
                        === SYRUP ===
  2               cups  granulated or brown sugar
  2               cups  water
  4                     cardamom pods - (to 5)
                        = (or 1/4 to 1/2 tspn ground cardamom)
  1           teaspoon  rose water -- (optional)

To Make The Dough:  Combine the milk powder, flour, and baking soda.  Drizzle with the butter and rub between your fingers until the mixture resembles fine crumbs.  Gradually stir in the milk until the dough just holds together.  Knead briefly until smooth.  Divide the dough into 20 equal balls, each about 1 1/2 teaspoons.

Heat at least 1 inch of oil over medium heat to 350 degrees.

Fry the balls in batches, turning frequently, until golden brown on all sides, about 4 minutes.  Remove with a wire mesh skimmer and place on a wire rack to drain.  Let cool.

To Make The Syrup:  Stir the sugar and water over low heat until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes.  Stop stirring, increase the heat to medium, and cook until the mixture is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes (it will register 225 degrees on a candy thermometer).  Meanwhile, discard the outer shell of the cardamom pods and crush the seeds.  Stir the cardamom and rose water, if using, into the syrup.

Drizzle the warm syrup over the cooled fritters and let stand for at least 3 hours.  Serve the fritters, chilled or at room temperature, in a little syrup.  The fritters can be covered and stored in the syrup in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.

This recipe yields about 20 balls.

Comments:  Although gulab means "rose water" in Hindi, some people omit it from the ingredients in this recipe.  Originally, this dish was made by cooking the milk over low heat for an extended period until thickened.  The invention of dry milk powder led to this easier version.  Gulab jamun is a traditional Hannukah treat among the Bene Israel of Bombay, combining the holiday's two primary food symbols ó dairy and fried.

                        Butter and flour for preparing the gratin
                        dishes
  1              pound  fresh cherries -- rinsed, stemmed,
                        and pitted
                        = (or substitute raspberries or
                        halved pitted apricots)
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  finely-ground hazelnuts - (2 oz)
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting gratins

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Butter and sugar the gratin dishes.  Arrange the dishes side-by-side on the baking sheets.

Divide the cherries among the gratin dishes.  Set aside.

In the bowl of the heavy-duty mixer, combine the eggs and sugar, and beat at the highest speed until thick and pale, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the hazelnuts and whisk until well blended.  Pour the batter over the cherries in the gratin dishes.

Place the baking sheets with the gratin dishes in the oven.  Bake until the gratins are firm and a deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove to a rack to cool.  Dust lightly with confectioners' sugar.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Whenever it seems fitting, I like to serve individual desserts: somehow a small gratin dish placed in front of a guest brings back childhood memories of having a dessert that is all your own.  It's also a good form of portion control!  These small gratins are baked with a nutty meringue like topping and can be served warm or at room temperature.  When cherries are not in season, I have prepared the same dessert with raspberries or apricots.

Equipment: Six 6-inch round porcelain gratin dishes; 2 baking sheets; a heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with a whisk.

Recipe By     :Dorie Greenspan
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  Dutch-processed cocoa powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- plus
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  fleur de sel
                        = (or 1/4 tspn fine sea salt)
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  5             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped small bits

Sift the flour, cocoa, and baking soda together and keep close at hand.  Put the butter in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until the butter is soft and creamy.  (Alternatively, you can do this and all subsequent steps by hand, working with a sturdy rubber spatula.)  Add both sugars, the salt, and vanilla extract and beat for another minute or two.  Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the sifted dry ingredients.  Mix only until the dry ingredients are incorporated ó the dough will look crumbly, and that's just right.  For the best texture, you want to work the dough as little as possible once the flour is added.  Toss in the chocolate pieces and mix only to incorporate.

Turn the dough out onto a smooth work surface and squeeze it so that it sticks together in large clumps.  Gather the dough into a ball, divide it in half, and working with one half at a time, shape the dough into logs that are 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  (Cookie-dough logs have a way of ending up with hollow centers, so as you're shaping each log, flatten it once or twice and roll it up from one long side to the other, just to make certain you haven't got an air channel.)  Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and chill them for at least 1 hour.  (Wrapped airtight, the logs can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for 1 month.)

Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and keep them close at hand.

Working with a sharp thin-bladed knife, slice the logs into rounds that are 1/2 inch thick.  (Don't be upset if the rounds break; just squeeze the broken-off bit back onto the cookie.)  Place the cookies on the parchment-lined sheets, leaving about 1 inch spread space between them.

Bake only one sheet of cookies at a time, and bake each sheet for 12 minutes.  The cookies will not look done, nor will they be firm, but that's just the way they should be.  Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let the cookies stand until they are only just warm or until they reach room temperature ó it's your call.  Repeat with the second sheet of cookies.

Note: The dough can be made ahead and chilled or frozen.  If you've frozen the dough, you needn't defrost it before baking ó just slice the logs and bake the cookies 1 minute longer.  Packed airtight, baked cookies will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days; they can be frozen for up to 1 month.

An American In Paris:  In moments of over-the-topness, I've added chopped toasted pecans, plumped currants, and a pinch of cinnamon to the dough and loved it.  And, I've been known to cheat on the chocolate bits.  On the sad (but fortunately seldom) occasions when my cupboard is bare of Valrhona Guanaja (Pierre's choice for these cookies, and one of my favorite chocolates), I've even used store-bought chocolate chips.

This recipe yields about 36 cookies.

Comments:  These easy-to-make, easy-to-eat, easy-to-love chocolate-chocolate chip cookies are from Pierre HermÈ, the man Vogue magazine called "The Picasso of Pastry."  They are cocoa dark, not very sweet, chock-full of chocolate bits, melt-on-your-tongue buttery, just crumbly enough to be true sablÈs, or sand cookies, and just salty enough to catch you off guard.  In fact, the combination of chocolate and salt (Pierre uses the somewhat exotic fleur de sel, sea salt from the GuÈrande) makes these cookies fatally appealing.  I don't trust myself not to finish the batch in a sitting, and I'll bet you'll find yourself in the same spot ó a warning to make these when you're certain not to be alone.  Indeed, these are the easiest cookies to make for company because, despite their trËs French flavor, they are essentially American slice-and-bake icebox cookies.  The dough is mixed in a flash, rolled into logs, and chilled, then cut into rounds and baked in minutes.

About the name:  Korova was the name of the milk bar in Stanley Kubrick's classic film A Clockwork Orange.  It was also the name of a restaurant off the Champs-…lysÈes for which Pierre HermÈ created these cookies.  The restaurant is gone, but the cookies are still a specialty at Pierre's patisserie as well as the house cookies at my house.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1 1/2         sticks  unsalted butter -- softened
  2 1/4           cups  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
  3               cups  self-rising flour
  6              large  egg whites
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  sweetened -- shredded coconut
     1/4           cup  apple-oatmeal cookie crumbs
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped toasted almonds -- (see Note)
     1/4           cup  quartered maraschino cherries
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
                        === FROSTING ===
  3              large  egg whites
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  cold water
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/4                cream of tartar -- plus
     1/8      teaspoon  cream of tartar
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Apple-oatmeal cookie crumbs
                        About 4 maraschino cherries -- halved

Make The Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and lightly flour three 9- by 2-inch round cake pans.  Line bottoms with waxed paper.

In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy, about 3 minutes.

Mix the milk and the vanilla and almond extracts together.  Add the flour in three parts, alternating with the milk and the vanilla and almond extracts mixture, beating well after each addition.

In a separate bowl, on the high speed of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Gently fold into batter, making sure no streaks of white are showing.  Divide the batter among the prepared pans.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until a cake tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cake cool in pans for 10 minutes.  Remove from pans and cool completely on wire rack.

Make The Filling:  In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk the milk with the sugar and flour until thoroughly combined.  Cook and stir constantly over medium-high heat (about 5 minutes) until thickened and bubbly.  Remove from heat and add the coconut, cookie crumbs, almonds, and cherries.  Stir in the vanilla and almond extracts.  Cover and cool to room temperature.

When cake has cooled, spread half the filling between the first two layers of cake, then the other half between the second and third layers.  The cake should be assembled so it can be iced as soon as the frosting is completed.

Make The Frosting:  In a standing mixer bowl, combine the egg whites and vanilla and set aside.  In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, over high heat, combine the water with the sugar and the cream of tartar.  As mixture begins to bubble at the edges, stir once to make sure the sugar is dissolved completely, then let come to a rolling boil (about 2 to 5 minutes) and remove immediately from heat.

Meanwhile, on medium speed, beat the egg whites and the vanilla extract with the whisk attachment until foamy, about 1 minute.  Without turning off the mixer, pour the sugar syrup into the beaten egg whites in a thin, steady stream.  Turn the mixer up to medium-high and continue beating constantly for about 5 minutes or until stiff peaks form but frosting is still creamy.  Frost top and sides of cake immediately.

Generously sprinkle top with cookie crumbs and place halved cherries on top in a decorative fashion.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  This is Buttercup's signature cake.  It's as stunning visually as it is decadently delicious, with its peaks of snow-white meringue topped with cherries and cookie crumble.  A perfect finish to an elegant dinner party, this cake is best served the day it is filled and frosted.

Note:  To toast almonds, place on a baking sheet in a 325 degree oven for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned and fragrant.

Make The Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and lightly flour three 9- by 2-inch round cake pans.  Line bottoms with waxed paper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy, about 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mix the milk and the vanilla and almond extracts together.  Add the flour in three parts, alternating with the milk and the vanilla and almond extracts mixture, beating well after each addition.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a separate bowl, on the high speed of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Gently fold into batter, making sure no streaks of white are showing.  Divide the batter among the prepared pans.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until a cake tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cake cool in pans for 10 minutes.  Remove from pans and cool completely on wire rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Filling:  In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk the milk with the sugar and flour until thoroughly combined.  Cook and stir constantly over medium-high heat (about 5 minutes) until thickened and bubbly.  Remove from heat and add the coconut, cookie crumbs, almonds, and cherries.  Stir in the vanilla and almond extracts.  Cover and cool to room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When cake has cooled, spread half the filling between the first two layers of cake, then the other half between the second and third layers.  The cake should be assembled so it can be iced as soon as the frosting is completed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Frosting:  In a standing mixer bowl, combine the egg whites and vanilla and set aside.  In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, over high heat, combine the water with the sugar and the cream of tartar.  As mixture begins to bubble at the edges, stir once to make sure the sugar is dissolved completely, then let come to a rolling boil (about 2 to 5 minutes) and remove immediately from heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, on medium speed, beat the egg whites and the vanilla extract with the whisk attachment until foamy, about 1 minute.  Without turning off the mixer, pour the sugar syrup into the beaten egg whites in a thin, steady stream.  Turn the mixer up to medium-high and continue beating constantly for about 5 minutes or until stiff peaks form but frosting is still creamy.  Frost top and sides of cake immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Generously sprinkle top with cookie crumbs and place halved cherries on top in a decorative fashion.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This is Buttercup&apos;s signature cake.  It&apos;s as stunning visually as it is decadently delicious, with its peaks of snow-white meringue topped with cherries and cookie crumble.  A perfect finish to an elegant dinner party, this cake is best served the day it is filled and frosted.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  To toast almonds, place on a baking sheet in a 325 degree oven for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned and fragrant.

                         Lavender Trust Cupcakes

Recipe By     :Nigella Lawson
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cupcakes                        Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  self-rising flour
     1/2           cup  very soft unsalted butter
  7        tablespoons  lavender sugar -- sifted
  2              large  eggs
  1              pinch  salt
                        Few tablespoons milk
                        === ICING ===
  9             ounces  instant royal icing
                        Violet icing color
  1                     Handful real lavender stalks

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners and get butter, eggs and milk out of the refrigerator in time to get to room temperature before you start.

Make the cupcakes as usual: put all the cake ingredients, bar the milk, into the food processor and combine, adding milk to bind.  Using spoon and rubber spatula fill the cake cups equally and bake for 20 minutes or so, until cooked.  Remember the cakes rise as they bake: there is enough mixture to fill each cup adequately even if you panic when you first look at it.  The cake should be cooked through and springy to the touch.  Remove from the oven, leave for 5 minutes or so and then arrange the cupcakes in their paper liners on a couple of wire racks to cool.

Cool the cupcakes as for the lemon cupcakes, and slice off any humped top.

Make up the icing according to package instructions, dyeing the mixture, faint lilac with a spot or two of food coloring: I like to use the solid pastes, for which you may have to go to a specialist cake decoration shop, I'm afraid; the color you'll want here is generally labeled "grape violet."  Go carefully, though: we want pastel serenity here, not seventies record-sleeve murk.

Top each pretty-pale cupcake with a little sprig of lavender before the icings set dry.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  There was a fashion, some time ago, for lavender-scented custards and creams.  I always resisted it.  But I made these a while ago, for auction to raise money for the Lavender Trust which is the British charity for young women with breast cancer, set up in memory of Ruth Picardie, and ó you know ó the lavender works: it immediately evokes the musky scent of summer without filling the mouth with soapy perfume.  Of course, in Provence lavender is routinely used in the most savory of cooking, much as rosemary is, but I have yet to embrace my inner Peter Mayle.  This, though, may be my first small step.  To make lavender sugar, just cut up a few lavender sprigs and keep them in a jar of granulated sugar for a few days.  Or you can buy it, in jars, ready concocted.

                                Lemon Bars

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar -- plus
                        more to decorate the finished bars
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- softened, but
                        still cool, cut into 1" pieces
                        === LEMON FILLING ===
  7              large  egg yolks -- plus
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     2/3           cup  lemon juice  - (4 or 5 medium lemons)
     1/4           cup  finely-grated lemon zest
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter -- cut into 4 pieces
  3        tablespoons  heavy cream

Make The Crust:  Spray a 9-inch square baking pan with nonstick cooking spray.  Fold two 16-inch pieces of foil or parchment paper lengthwise to measure 9 inches wide.  Fit 1 sheet in the bottom of the greased pan, pushing it into the corners and up the sides of the pan (overhang will help in removal of baked bars).  Fit the second sheet in the pan in the same manner, perpendicular to the first sheet.  Spray the sheets with nonstick cooking spray.

Place the flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt in a food processor and process briefly.  Add the butter and process to blend, 8 to 10 seconds, then process until the mixture is pale yellow and resembles coarse meal, about three 1-second pulses.  Sprinkle the mixture into the prepared pan and press firmly with your fingers into an even layer over the entire pan bottom.  Refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Bake the crust until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Make The Filling:  In a medium non-reactive bowl, whisk together the yolks and whole eggs until combined, about 5 seconds.  Add the granulated sugar and whisk until just combined, about 5 seconds.  Add the lemon juice, zest, and salt; whisk until combined, about 5 seconds.  Transfer the mixture to a medium non-reactive saucepan, add the butter pieces, and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the curd thickens to a thin sauce-like consistency and registers 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes.  Immediately pour the curd through a single-mesh stainless steel strainer set over a clean non-reactive bowl.  Stir in the heavy cream; pour the curd into the warm crust immediately.

Bake until the filling is shiny and opaque and the center 3 inches jiggle slightly when shaken, 10 to 15 minutes.  Cool on a wire rack to room temperature, about 45 minutes.  Remove the bars from the pan using the foil or parchment handles and transfer to a cutting board.  Cut into 2 1/2-inch squares, wiping the knife clean between cuts as necessary.  Sieve confectioners' sugar over the bars, if desired.

This recipe yields 16 bars.

Comments:  Lemon bars are pretty easy to make, but that doesn't mean it's easy to get them just the way you want them.  Whether from bakeries or home recipes, the crust is often quite soggy, and many versions are too sweet and lack true lemon flavor.  The warm filling must be added to a warm crust.  Start preparing the filling when the crust goes into the oven.  Be sure to cool the bars completely before cutting them.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  2 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  4                     extra-large eggs -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  grated lemon zest - (6 to 8 large lemons)
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     3/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     3/4           cup  buttermilk -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        === GLAZE ===
  2               cups  confectioners' sugar
  3 1/2    tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease two 8 1/2- by 4 1/2- by 2 1/2-inch loaf pans.

Cream the butter and 2 cups granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, for about 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy.  With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs, one at a time, and the lemon zest.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.  In another bowl, combine 1/4 cup lemon juice, the buttermilk, and vanilla.  Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately to the batter, beginning and ending with the flour.  Divide the batter evenly between the pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester comes out clean.

Combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar with 1/2 cup lemon juice in a small saucepan and cook over low heat until the sugar dissolves and makes a syrup.  When the cakes are done, let them cool for 10 minutes, then invert them onto a rack set over a tray, and spoon the lemon syrup over the cakes.  Allow the cakes to cool completely.

For the glaze, combine the confectioners' sugar and lemon juice in a bowl, mixing with a wire whisk until smooth.  Pour over the top of the cakes and allow the glaze to drizzle down the sides.

This recipe yields two 8-inch loaves.

Comments:  This is such a versatile cake.  I like to serve it with lemon curd and fresh raspberries, but a slice with a cup of tea in the afternoon is also fine just with me.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease two 8 1/2- by 4 1/2- by 2 1/2-inch loaf pans.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cream the butter and 2 cups granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, for about 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy.  With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs, one at a time, and the lemon zest.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.  In another bowl, combine 1/4 cup lemon juice, the buttermilk, and vanilla.  Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately to the batter, beginning and ending with the flour.  Divide the batter evenly between the pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester comes out clean.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar with 1/2 cup lemon juice in a small saucepan and cook over low heat until the sugar dissolves and makes a syrup.  When the cakes are done, let them cool for 10 minutes, then invert them onto a rack set over a tray, and spoon the lemon syrup over the cakes.  Allow the cakes to cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the glaze, combine the confectioners&apos; sugar and lemon juice in a bowl, mixing with a wire whisk until smooth.  Pour over the top of the cakes and allow the glaze to drizzle down the sides.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields two 8-inch loaves.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This is such a versatile cake.  I like to serve it with lemon curd and fresh raspberries, but a slice with a cup of tea in the afternoon is also fine just with me.

                          Lemon Steamed Pudding

Recipe By     :Tom Colicchio
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
                        additional for dusting ramekins
  2                     eggs -- separated
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour -- plus
  1           teaspoon  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  Kosher salt
     2/3           cup  buttermilk
  2 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Finely-chopped zest of 1 1/2 lemons

Heat the oven to 300 degrees.  Butter and lightly sugar six 4-ounce ramekins.

Beat the egg whites until they hold soft peaks, then set them aside.  Sift the sugar with the flour and salt.

In a mixer, using the whisk attachment, combine the buttermilk, lemon juice, egg yolks, and lemon zest.  Gradually add the flour mixture, then fold in the egg whites.  Divide the batter among the prepared ramekins.

Place the puddings in a water bath (set the ramekins in a larger pan; fill the pan with enough hot water to come halfway up the ramekins) and cover with aluminum foil.  Bake until the puddings rise and are almost firm, about 25 minutes, then uncover and continue baking until the tops are lightly golden and the puddings spring back when touched, about 15 minutes more.

Unmold and serve warm alone, with fresh berries, or with berry compote.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  These light, delicious puddings can be made ahead and then reheated in a water bath before unmolding and serving.  They've been popular since Craft opened, and they work particularly well with a side of fresh blueberries.

                       Lemon Tart With Blueberries

Recipe By     :Flo Braker
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Classic Sweet Pastry - 9 oz -- (see recipe)
                        === FILLING ===
  2              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  6        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice -- strained
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  2          teaspoons  lemon zest
                        === FRUIT ===
  3        tablespoons  strained apricot jam
  2               cups  fresh blueberries

Advance Preparation:  Prepare Classic Sweet Pastry as directed.  Wrap and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour.

Baking Preparations:  At least 15 minutes before baking, position rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Rolling And Baking The Crust:  See recipe for Classic Sweet Pastry.

Making The Filling:  Place eggs in a small bowl and whisk just to combine.  Pour in the sugar and whisk.  Add the lemon juice, again whisking to combine.  Add the cooled melted butter and lemon zest and blend.

Baking The Tart:  Pour the filling into the partially baked pastry shell.

Return to 375 degrees oven and bake for 16 to 18 minutes longer, or until the crust is golden and the filling is set.  (The filling bubbles toward the end of baking.)  Remove and cool on a rack for 10 minutes.

Set the pan on a narrower elevated surface (such as a tin can), so the bottom of the pan is released as the metal rim slips down.  Cool to room temperature.

Preparing The Fruit:  Heat the apricot jam just until melted but not bubbly hot.  Pour into a 2-quart mixing bowl.  Pour the blueberries into the warm preserves and toss gently with a rubber spatula briefly to coat most of them.  Spread over the tart, leaving a 3-inch center portion of lemon filling uncovered.  Serve the same day for best flavor.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  If you've never made one of Flo Braker's recipes, you're in for a treat.  Her simple, comprehensive directions never lead you astray.  And this recipe's no exception.  The fresh flavors of lemon and blueberry are at their best here in her easily assembled, elegant tart.

Baking Equipment: 9-inch quiche pan with a removable bottom.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                     lemon
  1                cup  unblanched whole almonds
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar -- plus
                        extra for dusting
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  3              large  egg yolks
  1 1/2           cups  raspberry jam
  1         tablespoon  whole milk

Sift the flour, cinnamon, cloves, and salt into a bowl.  Using the finest holes of a handheld grater, grate the zest from the lemon into the bowl.  Set aside.

In a food processor, process the almonds with the 1 cup confectioners' sugar until finely ground.  Set aside.

Using a stand mixer, beat the butter with the paddle on medium speed until creamy.  Beat in the almond mixture, then 2 of the egg yolks.  Reduce the speed to low, add the dry ingredients, and beat just until combined.  Flatten about a third of the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate.

Butter a 9- by 1-inch round fluted tart pan with a removable bottom.  Using your fingers, press the remaining dough into the bottom and sides of the pan, extending it 1/2 inch above the top.  If the dough is overly soft and sticky, refrigerate it until firm enough to continue.  Spread the dough with the jam.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the chilled dough into a rectangle about 9 inches long and 1/4 inch thick.  Using a fluted pastry cutter, cut into 6 strips, each 1 inch wide; 2 of them should be 9 inches long and the others slightly shorter.  Lay the strips on the torte, trimming the edges.  Fold the dough extending above the pan back over the filling and strips.  Crimp to seal the edges.  Place the torte in the freezer for 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining egg yolk and the milk.  Brush the dough with the yolk mixture.  Bake until the crust is browned and the jam is bubbling, 45 to 55 minutes.

Let cool on a wire rack until the torte is barely warm.  Remove the pan sides.  Run a thin-bladed knife between the torte and the pan bottom.  Transfer the torte to a serving plate and let cool completely.  Just before serving, dust the torte with confectioners' sugar, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Lattice Crust:  An eighteenth-century specialty of the Austrian town of Linz, the almond-rich Linzertorte is identifiable by its decorative latticework top.  To make the lattice, roll out the dough and cut into strips as directed in the recipe.  Lay a long strip across the center of the torte.  Set a shorter strip on each side of the center strip, equidistant from the center strip and the edge of the torte.  Place the second long strip diagonally across the first strips, again in the center of the torte.  Place the remaining shorter strips on either side, and then proceed as directed.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Unsalted butter -- for greasing
                        Cornstarch -- for dusting
  5                     egg whites - (abt 3/4 cup) -- room temperature
     1/8      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1 1/2           cups  superfine sugar
  1                cup  heavy cream -- chilled
  3        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar

Preheat the oven to 110 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Lightly rub the parchment sheets with unsalted butter, and then lightly dust with cornstarch.

In a large bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar until stiff, about 2 minutes.  Add the sugar slowly to the egg white mixture and continue beating until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 5 minutes.

Place half the mixture in a pastry bag with a 1/4 inch tip.  Pipe out 1-inch meringue rounds, 1/2-inch apart, onto the prepared baking sheets.

Place the meringues in the oven and bake until they're firm to the touch, lift off the parchment easily, and dry underneath, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Open the door of the oven for 10 seconds every 15 minutes while baking to release any built up moisture and help the meringues stay dry and crisp.

Remove the meringues from the oven.  Slide the meringues still on their parchment onto a wire rack to cool.  When the baking sheets are cool, line them with new parchment and repeat the process until all of the meringue mixture has been used.

In a medium bowl, whip the heavy cream and the confectioners' sugar until thick.

Peel all the meringues off the parchment sheets and place on a dry work surface.  Turn 24 meringue halves upside down and make 2 rows of 12.  Spoon the whipped cream into a pastry bag and pipe out approximately 1 teaspoon of whipped cream in the middle of each meringue.  To assemble, take the remaining meringues and place one on top of each meringue to make sandwiches.  Press each sandwich together gently.

Place each cookie in an individual paper pastry cup and refrigerate until serving.  The Little Clouds will keep refrigerated for up to 3 days in a tightly covered container.

This recipe yields 4 dozen cookies.

Comments:  Franco Martinetti is one of the great winemakers in the Piedmont.  His Barbera d'Asti, Montruc is justly famous.  When we met, I discovered that he is as passionate about food as he is about wine.  Franco took me to a local restaurant, Da Guido, to introduce me to classic regional dishes at their very best.  When the meal was over we were served a tray of small white cream-filled meringue cookies.  After such a big dinner I thought I could easily pass them by, but Franco insisted I try one.  It melted in my mouth, and I could not stop with one.  Franco's son, Sergio, had nicknamed them "Little Clouds" because they are so light.  What is more perfect than that?

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  eggs
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- melted, and
                        cooled slightly
                        Powdered sugar -- for dusting

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Generously butter and flour a pan for large madeleines (about 3 x 1 1/4 inches).*  Using an electric mixer, beat the eggs and the sugar in a large bowl just to blend.  Beat in the vanilla, lemon peel and salt.  Add the flour; beat just until blended.  Gradually add the cooled melted butter in a steady stream, beating just until blended.

Spoon 1 tablespoon of the batter into each indentation in the madeleine pan.  Bake until puffed and brown, about 16 minutes.  Cool 5 minutes.  Gently remove the cookies from the pan.  Repeat the process, buttering and flouring pan before each batch.  (The cookies can be made 1 day ahead.)

Dust cookies with powdered sugar just before serving.

This recipe yields 20 madeleines.

* For this recipe, you'll need a madeleine pan ó a metal mold with scallop-shaped indentations ó which you can find at any cookware store.

Comments:  This cookie launched a thousand memories ó and a literary masterpiece ó for Marcel Proust.  Enjoy these madeleines with tea, just as the narrator did in Swann's Way.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Candies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
     3/4           cup  pure maple syrup
  1 1/2           cups  half-and-half
  3               cups  sugar
  3        tablespoons  light corn syrup
  1              pinch  salt
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  roughly-chopped pecans

Line an 8-inch-square baking pan with aluminum foil that extends over the sides.  Coat the foil with 1 tablespoon of the butter.  Set aside.

In a 3-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat, cook the maple syrup, half-and-half, sugar, corn syrup, and salt until the sugar is dissolved (about 5 minutes), stirring constantly with a long-handled wooden spoon or heatproof spatula.  Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then brush down the sides of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in warm water to prevent the sugar from crystallizing.  Place a sugar thermometer in the pan and cook the mixture without stirring until it registers 238 degrees on the thermometer (about 15 minutes).

Remove the pan from the heat, remove the thermometer from the pan, and place the thermometer in warm water to cool.  Sprinkle a marble board or the back of a baking sheet with cold water and immediately pour the hot mixture onto the marble.  Do not scrape out the bottom of the pan.  Dot the surface of the mixture with the remaining 3 tablespoons butter.  Let the mixture cool on the marble until it registers 110 degrees on the thermometer (about 5 minutes).  If using a baking sheet instead of the marble, the cooling time will be about 15 minutes.

Beat the fudge using one of the following three methods: With a 5-inch-wide flexible-blade scraper, transfer the mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer, add the vanilla, and with the paddle attachment, beat the mixture until it thickens and loses its shine (5 to 10 minutes).  Or transfer the mixture to a 2-quart mixing bowl, add the vanilla, and beat the mixture with a long-handled wooden spoon until it thickens and loses its shine (10 to 15 minutes).  In both cases, add the chopped pecans after beating the fudge and mix until they are blended in (about 30 seconds).  Or, spread the mixture into a large rectangle on the marble board, sprinkle on the vanilla, then use the 5-inch-wide flexible-blade scraper to gather the mixture back to the center of the marble, folding in the edges.  Repeat this process until the mixture begins to thicken and lose its shine (5 to 10 minutes).  Sprinkle on the chopped pecans and continue to work the fudge to incorporate them (about 1 minute).

Turn the fudge into the prepared pan.  Use your fingertips to even the top and to press the fudge into the corners of the pan.  Place the pan of fudge on a cooling rack and let it set completely at room temperature (1 to 2 hours).

Remove the fudge from the pan by lifting out the aluminum foil.  Invert the fudge onto a cutting board, peel the foil off the back of the fudge, and reinvert the fudge.  With a large chef's knife, cut the fudge evenly into 1-inch squares.  Between layers of waxed paper in a tightly covered container, the fudge will keep for 10 days at room temperature or 1 month in the refrigerator.  The fudge is best served at room temperature.

This recipe yields 64 pieces.

Comments:  Maple and pecan are a fabulous flavor combination.  One caution: Make sure to use pure maple syrup for maximum flavor.

                Mascarpone Torte With Illy Espresso Sauce

Recipe By     :Tony and Cathy Mantuano
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  sugar
  6                     egg yolk
  2          envelopes  unflavored gelatin - (2 tbspns)
  2 1/4         pounds  mascarpone cheese
  2               cups  whipped cream -- (see Note)
  8                     thin slices pound cake
     1/4           cup  brewed espresso coffee -- cooled
  1         tablespoon  coffee liqueur such as Kahlua
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  8                     fresh mint leaves
  1               pint  fresh raspberries

Note:  Beat 2 cups chilled heavy cream until it begins to thicken.  Add 2 tablespoons of sugar in a steady stream and continue to beat until the cream forms medium to stiff peaks.  The whipped cream can be refrigerated for up to 2 hours.

In a large bowl set over (but not touching) a pan of barely simmering water, whisk together the sugar and egg yolks.  When warm, add the gelatin.  Whisk the mixture until pale in color, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Using an electric mixer, whip the mixture on high speed for 3 minutes.  Add the mascarpone cheese and whip until well combined, about 2 minutes longer.  Fold in the cream.  Reserve 2 1/2 cups of the mascarpone mixture for the espresso sauce.

Divide the remainder of the mixture among eight 4-inch individual molds (there may be a small amount left over).  Cut out a 3-inch round from each pound cake slice.  Place a cake round on top of each mold.  (This will prevent the dessert from sliding when served.)  Freeze overnight.

To unmold, dip the bottom of each mold in very hot water halfway up the sides for 5 seconds and invert immediately onto a plate.  Refrigerate for 1 hour before serving.

In a large bowl, stir together the espresso and liqueur.  Fold into the reserved mascarpone mixture and mix until well combined.  If it seems too thick, add a little heavy cream.

To serve, pool 1/4 cup of sauce in the center of each of 8 chilled plates.  Using a spatula, carefully pick up 1 torte and, over a separate plate, dust the top with cocoa powder.  Place the torte on top of the espresso sauce and garnish the plate with a mint leaf and a few raspberries.  Repeat to make the remaining 7 servings.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Mascarpone is a fresh cow's-milk cheese from northern Italy.  Creamy and rich, mascarpone, in the guise of tiramisu, has conquered America.  Our elegant rendition of tiramisu highlights the slight tang and voluptuous texture of the imported cheese.

Note:  Beat 2 cups chilled heavy cream until it begins to thicken.  Add 2 tablespoons of sugar in a steady stream and continue to beat until the cream forms medium to stiff peaks.  The whipped cream can be refrigerated for up to 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl set over (but not touching) a pan of barely simmering water, whisk together the sugar and egg yolks.  When warm, add the gelatin.  Whisk the mixture until pale in color, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using an electric mixer, whip the mixture on high speed for 3 minutes.  Add the mascarpone cheese and whip until well combined, about 2 minutes longer.  Fold in the cream.  Reserve 2 1/2 cups of the mascarpone mixture for the espresso sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the remainder of the mixture among eight 4-inch individual molds (there may be a small amount left over).  Cut out a 3-inch round from each pound cake slice.  Place a cake round on top of each mold.  (This will prevent the dessert from sliding when served.)  Freeze overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To unmold, dip the bottom of each mold in very hot water halfway up the sides for 5 seconds and invert immediately onto a plate.  Refrigerate for 1 hour before serving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, stir together the espresso and liqueur.  Fold into the reserved mascarpone mixture and mix until well combined.  If it seems too thick, add a little heavy cream.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, pool 1/4 cup of sauce in the center of each of 8 chilled plates.  Using a spatula, carefully pick up 1 torte and, over a separate plate, dust the top with cocoa powder.  Place the torte on top of the espresso sauce and garnish the plate with a mint leaf and a few raspberries.  Repeat to make the remaining 7 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Mascarpone is a fresh cow&apos;s-milk cheese from northern Italy.  Creamy and rich, mascarpone, in the guise of tiramisu, has conquered America.  Our elegant rendition of tiramisu highlights the slight tang and voluptuous texture of the imported cheese.

           Matchstick Zucchini Salad - {Zucchine A Fiammifero}

Recipe By     :Carol Field
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              small  fresh zucchini
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  finely-minced fresh rosemary
  1 1/2    tablespoons  finely-minced fresh sage leaves
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
                        = (or red wine vinegar)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring a deep pot of water to a boil.  Set the zucchini in a steamer basket, place it over the pot, cover, and steam for a very few minutes, so that the zucchini are cooked but still slightly crisp and al dente.  Remove, and allow to cool.

Warm the 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small sautÈ pan over very low heat, and add the garlic; let it sweat so that the flavor of garlic infuses the oil.  Add the minced rosemary and sage and let them wilt in the oil for a minute or two.

Cut the cooled zucchini into strips the size of kitchen matches, and place them in a salad bowl.  Whisk together the lemon juice or vinegar, 1/4 cup olive oil, salt, pepper, and the garlic-infused oil with the herbs.  Toss carefully with the zucchini because it is very fragile.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Choose firm, glossy zucchini for this light vegetable salad and steam them very briefly, so that they remain slightly crisp.  Overcooking makes them watery, something to avoid at all costs.  Toss them gently with the herbs, and serve forth a delicate and delicious dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  unsifted all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unsifted all-purpose flour
                        === MERINGUE ===
     1/4           cup  fresh egg whites - (abt 2 large)
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1 1/2         ounces  semisweet chocolate -- finely grated

Make The Dough:  In the large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter at medium speed just until smooth, about 1 minute.  Beat in the sugar and salt until well combined and slightly fluffy, scraping down the sides.  Lower speed, gradually add the flour, and mix just until thoroughly combined.

Divide the dough in half.  Roll out each portion of dough between two sheets of waxed paper to form a circle 6 inches in diameter and 1/4-inch thick.  Leaving the dough between the waxed paper, transfer circles to a baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days; or freeze, well wrapped, up to 1 month.

Adjust rack to the center of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line two large cool baking sheets with parchment paper.

Remove one dough package at a time from refrigerator.  Remove top waxed paper sheet, and lay it loosely back on the dough.  Turn the dough over and peel off and discard the second sheet of waxed paper.

Using the wide end of a 1/2-inch plain decorating tip (such as Ateco #6) as a cutter, cut out circles of dough.  It they stick to the decorating tip use a chopstick or wooden spoon handle to gently push through the decorating tip to release the circle, of dough.  Place the circles 1/2-inch apart on a baking sheet.  Partially bake the cookies one sheet at a time, for 6 to 8 minutes only, or until just set.  Set the baking sheet on a wire rack to cool.  Reduce the oven temperature to 225 degrees.  When the cookies are cool, place all of them on one baking sheet lined with parchment, leaving about 1/4 inch between cookies.

Make The Meringue:  Using an electric mixer, preferably with a whisk attachment, whip the egg whites in a large bowl on medium-low speed until surface is frothy.  Increase speed to medium, then pour in half the sugar and whip until soft white peaks form, about 30 seconds.  While continuing to whip, slowly add the remaining sugar and the vanilla and continue whipping until the egg whites form stiff, shiny peaks, about 1 1/2 minutes.

Using a rubber spatula, fold the grated chocolate into the meringue.  Immediately scoop all of the meringue into a 16-inch pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain decorating tip (such as Ateco #6).  Pipe a bulb of meringue onto each cookie in a candy "kiss" shape.  The bottom of the meringue "kiss" should be the diameter of the cookie circle.  Bake the Meringue Bubbles for an additional 60 minutes, until the meringue is firm to the touch.  Place the baking sheet on a wire rack to cool.  Lift cookies from parchment when cool.

These are best eaten the same day.  To store, place them in an airtight metal container for up to 1 week.

This recipe yields 4 dozen 1 1/4-inch cookies.

Comments:  You taste chocolate right away when you bite into these, but the appearance of a snowy white meringue "kiss" shape atop a short tender cookie gives no clue.  A creative baker can have fun with these cookies: Rather than a kiss, pipe the chocolate-flecked meringue into any shape on the cookie bases ó hearts, butterflies, rosebuds, leaves, latticework, even a family coat of arms.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  salted cashews
  2               cups  salted pistachios
  2               cups  slivered almonds
  6               cups  sugar
  12       tablespoons  salted butter

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Toast each type of nut separately by placing them in a single layer on a cookie sheet and baking until a little more than golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes for the cashews, 15 minutes for the pistachios, and 5 to 10 minutes for the almonds.  As they are finished, let them cool to room temperature.  Then gather them in a bowl and stir them together.

Put 2 cups of the sugar in a sautÈ pan and set it over medium-high heat.  Let the sugar melt and caramelize until golden brown, approximately 4 minutes.  Then add 4 tablespoons of the butter and whisk it with the sugar until it takes on an almost sauce-like consistency.

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in 2 cups of the nuts and stir until they are well coated in the caramel.  Pour the mixture out onto a foil-lined baking sheet, spreading it out with a baking spatula.  Repeat with the remaining sugar, butter, and nuts.

Put the baking sheets in the oven and bake until the nuts spread out into a flat sheet, approximately 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool.  Then break up by hand into desired-size pieces.

This recipe yields 3 pounds brittle.

Comments:  This glorified peanut brittle is made with cashews, slivered almonds, and pistachios, added to a freshly made caramel of butter and sugar.  You can, of course, adapt the recipe to make your own house version by varying the assortment of nuts, or by choosing just your favorite type.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- softened
  1                cup  brown sugar
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1              large  egg
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 3/4            cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  instant espresso coffee powder
  1 1/2           cups  semisweet chocolate chips

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Place the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar in the work bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment.  Beat on medium speed for about 30 seconds, until the mixture is fluffy.  Beat in the egg and vanilla for 30 seconds longer, until well combined.

In a mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Add to the mixer, while beating on slow speed.  Beat for about 15 seconds, stir in the chocolate chips and espresso powder, and mix for 15 seconds longer.

Prepare a cookie sheet with about 2 tablespoons of shortening (or use a non-stick spray).  Using a 1-ounce scoop, or using a 2-tablespoon measure, drop the cookie dough onto the cookie sheet in dollops about 3 inches apart.  Gently press down on the dough with the back of a spoon to spread out into 2-inch circles; there should be room on the sheet for six or eight cookies at a time.  Transfer to the oven in batches and bake for about 20 minutes or until the cookies are nicely browned around the edges.  Bake for a little longer for crisper cookies.

This recipe yields about 2 dozen cookies.

Comments:  Our chocolate chip cookie is the subject of a classic "urban myth."  Honestly, no one at Neiman Marcus has ever, ever, charged for this recipe.  My very first week on the job, I received a letter complaining about someone who knew someone who had been charged for the cookie recipe.  I took the note to our Public Relations Department and asked about it.  I was quickly brought up to speed about the infamous hoax regarding our chocolate chip cookie recipe.  It had started years ago as a kind of chain letter sent through the mail that circulated around the world.  I was assured that the rumor had been squelched, but back in the mid-1990s, the Internet was opening up in a big way.  Everyone was getting online, it seemed, and we witnessed the urban myth traveling the world again through cyberspace!  I suggested we come up with a real recipe for chocolate chip cookies, and after extensive testing and tasting, this is the result.  Next, we published it on the Neiman Marcus Web site for all to have for free.  So now, if the subject comes up, you'll know the inside scoop ó and own the authentic recipe.  And, by the way, it is a chocolate chip cookie without rival.

                        Old-Fashioned Tomato Salad

Recipe By     :Nigella Lawson
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4      teaspoon  reconstituted English mustard
                        = (or pinch mustard powder)
  1         tablespoon  pasta flour - (heaping)
                        = (or all-purpose flour)
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  whole milk -- plus
  2        tablespoons  whole milk
  1                     egg -- beaten
  4        tablespoons  tarragon vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sunflower oil
  18            ounces  good cherry tomatoes -- halved
                        Chives or green parts of scallions

Half fill a sink with cold water.

Combine the mustard, flour and sugar, with about a teaspoon of salt and a good grinding of pepper, in a heavy-based saucepan.  Add a little of the milk and stir to mix to a smooth paste, then put on a gentle heat and keep adding the milk, and stirring as you do so.  I find my immersion blender the best thing to banish lumpiness here, but it's not a difficult operation whatever you use.

When all the milk's in, add the beaten egg and vinegar and keep on whisking until it's beginning to thicken.  When the mixture's got the texture of light cream, whisk in the oil then plunge the pan in the sink of cold water and continue whisking for a while.

When it's cool (you can pour into a bowl then put the bowl over ice if you want speedy cooling), cut the tomatoes in half and arrange on one huge plate or two fairly large ones.  Drizzle a few spoonfuls over (don't drench: think Jackson Pollock) then add some chopped scallions or chives.  Unexpected heaven.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This tomato salad is all you need for a summer starter.  What I do is take the tomatoes out into the garden, uncut, on a flat plate or two, for an hour before I want to make the salad: it takes any chill off them and makes them taste somehow more tomatoey.  Cherry tomatoes perhaps sound newfangled rather than old-fashioned, but I'm coming to that.  For the dressing is, and I refuse to apologize for it, nothing more nor less than that great ó though, now that we live in the extra-virgin age, greatly discredited ó item from the English culinary canon, Salad Cream.  The recipe I give for it is by and large adapted from Margaret Costa: I have substituted tarragon vinegar, which I prefer here, but do use cider vinegar, as she stipulates, if you want.  Any leftover salad cream can be stored in the refrigerator in an old jam jar; indeed you may find you want to make double the amount above, so well will it go down.

It's hardly English, but I use pasta flour (available at supermarkets now) instead of all-purpose flour because it loses its flouriness with less cooking, but it's not worth losing sleep over.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  2               cups  sugar
  4                     extra-large eggs -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  grated orange zest - (4 large oranges)
  3               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4           cup  freshly squeezed orange juice
     3/4           cup  buttermilk -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2               cups  good semisweet chocolate chunks
                        === SYRUP ===
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  freshly squeezed orange juice
                        === GANACHE ===
  8             ounces  good semisweet chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  instant coffee granules

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt pan.

Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment for about 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, then the orange zest.

Sift together 3 cups flour, the baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.  In another bowl, combine the orange juice, buttermilk, and vanilla.  Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately in thirds to the creamed butter, beginning and ending with the flour.  Toss the chocolate chunks with 2 tablespoons flour and add to the batter.  Pour into the pan, smooth the top, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester comes out clean.  Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the syrup.  In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, cook the sugar with the orange juice until the sugar dissolves.  Remove the cake from the pan, set it on a rack over a tray, and spoon the orange syrup over the cake.  Allow the cake to cool completely.

For the ganache, melt the chocolate, heavy cream, and coffee in the top of a double boiler over simmering water until smooth and warm, stirring occasionally.  Drizzle over the top of the cake.

This recipe yields one 10-inch Bundt cake.

Comments:  For years Barefoot Contessa has been making a wonderful orange pound cake that is moist and flavorful.  When my friend Anna Pump at Loaves and Fishes added chocolate to her orange cake, I thought it was such a good idea that I borrowed it and added chocolate chunks to ours.  The combination of tart, citrusy orange with sweet chocolate has been a big hit.

                         Orange Marble Pound Cake

Recipe By     :Jennifer Appel
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             sticks  unsalted butter -- softened
  3               cups  sugar
  5              large  eggs -- room temperature
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  club soda (not seltzer)
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  grated orange zest
  3        tablespoons  orange liqueur
     1/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and lightly flour a 10-inch Bundt pan.

In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy, about 5 minutes.  Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.

Add the flour in thirds, alternating with the club soda, beating after each addition until smooth.  Add the vanilla, zest, and liqueur and mix well.

Pour two-thirds of the batter into the prepared pan.  In a small bowl, take the cocoa powder and a few tablespoons of the remaining batter and mix together until smooth.  Place this mixture into the pan pressing it down into the batter.  Cover with the remaining batter bake 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes until golden brown, or until a cake tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.

Let cake cool in pan for 20 minutes.  Remove from pan and cool completely on a wire rack.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  While it's hard to improve upon one of your mom's best cakes, I think this comes close as a very suitable equal.  (Yes, even she approves!)  The secret to a tender crumb is the addition of club soda ó the carbonation acts as a leavening agent.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  carrots -- peeled, and
                        halved crosswise
  2               cups  water
  3        tablespoons  butter or margarine
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon or 1 lime
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  orange or ginger marmalade
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Boil carrots in water in covered, large heavy saucepan over moderate heat 30 to 35 minutes until tender; drain well.

Return to heat and shake pan gently to drive excess moisture from carrots.

Add butter, lemon juice, brown sugar, marmalade, salt and pepper.  Simmer, uncovered, over lowest heat for 30 minutes, shaking pan often, until carrots are richly glazed.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In [early] days we liked carrots good and soft, so you may want to trim the cooking times.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1 1/4           cups  granulated sugar
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
                        Finely-grated zest of 1 orange
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1              pinch  salt
                        === GLAZE ===
  1                cup  powered sugar
  1               dash  pure vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  orange juice

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a sheet pan well and set aside.

Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of a mixer and beat on high speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl often, until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  With the mixer on low speed, add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix well.

Add the cream of tartar, flour, zest, spices, and salt, and mix on low speed until all of the ingredients are incorporated.  Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough is smooth.

Remove the dough from the mixer and form it into a ball.  If it's too soft to handle, cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate until it firms up a bit.  On a well-floured board, roll the dough out to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.  Cut into shapes with the cookie cutters of your choice.  Place on the prepared pan and bake 8 to 10 minutes.

While the cookies are baking, prepare the glaze by mixing the powered sugar, vanilla, and orange juice until smooth.  Remove the cookies from the oven and immediately brush each one with a good amount of glaze, then place them back in the oven and bake until the glaze starts to crackle and the cookies are a golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes more.  Remove the cookies and let cool for about 5 minutes on the pan, then transfer to a rack or to paper towels and let cool completely.

This recipe yields about 30 medium-size cookies.

Comments:  While working on this recipe, I aimed for cookies with a rich butter flavor, heady scent of spices, and a tangy, slightly sweet glaze.  Baking the glaze for a few minutes gives it an almost crackly texture in your mouth.

                        and sliced 1/2" thick
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
     1/2                red onion -- cut in half, and
                        thinly sliced
  20             large  basil leaves -- coarsely chopped
  3        tablespoons  capers -- drained
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  1           teaspoon  finely-minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  champagne vinegar
     1/2           cup  good olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Heat the oil in a large sautÈ pan.  Add the bread and salt; cook over low to medium heat, tossing frequently, for 10 minutes, or until nicely browned.  Add more oil as needed.

For the vinaigrette, whisk together the ingredients.

In a large bowl, mix the tomatoes, cucumber, red pepper, yellow pepper, red onion, basil, and capers.  Add the bread cubes and toss with the vinaigrette.  Season liberally with salt and pepper.  Serve, or allow the salad to sit for about half an hour for the flavors to blend.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  This salad was invented by Italians to use up leftover bread, but I make it because I love the warm croutons soaking up the vinaigrette.

                      Peanut Butter Ganache Cookies

Recipe By     :Marian Burros
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  smooth natural peanut butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  smooth natural peanut butter
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- softened
  1 1/2           cups  minus 1 tbspn sugar -- plus
                        additional sugar for sprinkling
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2 1/3           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  6             ounces  dry-roasted unsalted peanuts
                        === GANACHE ===
  1              pound  bittersweet chocolate
  1               pint  heavy cream

Make The Cookies:  Place racks near the middle of the oven.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Using an electric mixer, cream together the peanut butter and butter.  Add the 1 1/2 cups minus 1 tablespoon sugar and cream for 20 seconds on medium speed.  Scrape the bowl and mix 30 seconds more.  Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat well after each addition.  Beat in the vanilla.  Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt and add the flour mixture all at once.  Mix until the flour is incorporated and stir in the peanuts.

Scoop the dough, about 1/4 cup for each, onto ungreased baking sheets; there should be no more than nine cookies per sheet.  You will need three sheets.  Press down lightly with a large fork in two directions to make a cross, flattening the dough slightly.  Sprinkle each cookie with 1/2 teaspoon sugar.  Bake for 7 to 9 minutes.

Remove from the oven and cool on the baking sheets.  The cookies will be very soft, but as they cool they will firm up somewhat, though they will still be soft.  Remove the cookies and let cool.

Make The Ganache:  Break up the chocolate into small pieces and process in a food processor until it is very fine.

Heat the cream to the boiling point.  With the food processor on, pour the hot cream through the feed tube and process only until well blended.  Remove to another bowl and cool.  Refrigerate only long enough so that the ganache can be spread thickly between two cookies.  Spread equally on 12 cookies; top with the remaining cookies.

Put in a cool place, covered, for several hours or overnight.  The ganache will seep into the cookies and keep them soft.

Help Note:  The ganache can also be made ahead and refrigerated, tightly covered.  It will keep several days.  To use, heat the container of ganache in a bowl of warm water.

This recipe yields 24 cookies; 12 cookie sandwiches.

Comments:  This is a recipe that's fairly easy to make.  I had these cookies made for me all over the country while I was touring with the book.  They're incredible luxuriousness, comfort, and sinfulness all rolled into one.  I like peanut butter and I like really good chocolate ó these flavors are meant to go together.

And the fun is in the size of these cookies: one is the entire dessert plus.  They're very dangerous in your house unless you have enormous willpower.  Readers beware!

Categories    : Desserts                        Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  boiled pureed peanuts
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  whole milk
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2                     vanilla beans -- split
                        = (or 2 tspns pure vanilla extract)
  4              large  egg yolks

Soak the blanched raw peanuts in warm water for 2 to 3 hours, or overnight.  The peanuts will swell and turn white.  Drain and discard the soaking water.  Place the nuts in a large heavy pot.  Cover the nuts with 4 cups of water plus 1 teaspoon of baking soda.  Bring the water to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pot and simmer for 1 1/2 to 3 hours, or until they soft.  Drain.  Place the nuts in a food processor fitted with a metal blade and purÈe until smooth.  Set aside.

Heat the cream, milk, sugar and vanilla beans, if using, in a medium heavy saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is hot.

Place the egg yolks in a medium bowl and whisk them together.  Slowly whisk in 1 cup of the hot liquid.  Return this mixture to the saucepan, whisking constantly.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens a little and coats the back of a spoon, 7 to 8 minutes.  Do not allow the mixture to boil, or it will curdle.  Strain through a fine sieve into a clean bowl, stir in the vanilla extract, if using, and mix in the purÈed nuts.  Chill until cold, then pour into an ice-cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's directions.

This recipe yields about 1 quart.

Comments:  Using the fresh milk and cream from its dairy farm, Taiwan University made its own ice cream and popsicles.  One of the most popular flavors, and my own favorite, was peanut.  The nuts had been boiled until they were very soft ó almost, but not quite, a purÈe.

                        Pear And Goat Cheese Tart

Recipe By     :Laura Werlin
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1                cup  flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  3        tablespoons  cold water - (to 4)
                        === FILLING ===
  6             ounces  goat cheese -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                     egg
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
  2             medium  pears - (abt 1 lb) -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced 1/8" thick - (preferably
                        Cornice or very ripe Bosc)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1 1/2      teaspoons  large-granule decorative sugar
                        = (or use regular sugar)

Make The Dough:  In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, and salt.  Pulse twice.  Add the butter and process just until the mixture looks a little like cornmeal, 8 to 10 seconds.  Don't over-process or your crust will turn out tough.  Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing between additions.  The dough should begin to hold together, but you do not want it to form a ball.  This will mean there's too much water.

Turn the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap.  Pat it into a flattened disk, wrap with the plastic, and chill for at least 1 hour or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place the rack in the bottom third of the oven.  Have a fluted 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom ready.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit for 10 minutes.  Roll out a 13-inch circle of dough and carefully place it in the tart pan.  Gently push the dough into the crevices of the pan, leaving some overhang.  Roll the rolling pin over the edges of the tart pan to remove the extra dough.  (It is fun to roll out the scraps and dot them with jam.  Bake them alongside the tart but only for a few minutes.  They will burn easily.)  Line the bottom and sides of the dough with foil and fill the tart pan with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake for 30 minutes.  Remove the foil and weights and let the crust cool.

Make The Filling:  In a medium bowl beat together the cheese, sugar, egg, and vanilla.  Stir in the pine nuts.

Spread a thin layer evenly over the prepared tart shell.  Lay the pear slices over the filling, close to the edges, slightly overlapping, in a circular pattern, continuing in toward the middle of the tart.  Brush the pears with the melted butter and sprinkle with the sugar.

Place the tart pan on a baking sheet and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the edges of the tart are golden-brown and the pears have softened and turned brown around the edges.  Remove from the oven and let cool completely before serving.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Although this may be a dessert, it is not terribly sweet.  Because of that, you want to choose pears that are very ripe, as they will provide the necessary sweetness.  Peggy Smith, co-owner of Cowgirl Creamery in California and long-time chef at Chez Panisse restaurant gave this recipe a subtle but powerful boost by suggesting the addition of pine nuts.

Make The Dough:  In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, and salt.  Pulse twice.  Add the butter and process just until the mixture looks a little like cornmeal, 8 to 10 seconds.  Don&apos;t over-process or your crust will turn out tough.  Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing between additions.  The dough should begin to hold together, but you do not want it to form a ball.  This will mean there&apos;s too much water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap.  Pat it into a flattened disk, wrap with the plastic, and chill for at least 1 hour or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place the rack in the bottom third of the oven.  Have a fluted 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom ready.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit for 10 minutes.  Roll out a 13-inch circle of dough and carefully place it in the tart pan.  Gently push the dough into the crevices of the pan, leaving some overhang.  Roll the rolling pin over the edges of the tart pan to remove the extra dough.  (It is fun to roll out the scraps and dot them with jam.  Bake them alongside the tart but only for a few minutes.  They will burn easily.)  Line the bottom and sides of the dough with foil and fill the tart pan with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake for 30 minutes.  Remove the foil and weights and let the crust cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Filling:  In a medium bowl beat together the cheese, sugar, egg, and vanilla.  Stir in the pine nuts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread a thin layer evenly over the prepared tart shell.  Lay the pear slices over the filling, close to the edges, slightly overlapping, in a circular pattern, continuing in toward the middle of the tart.  Brush the pears with the melted butter and sprinkle with the sugar.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the tart pan on a baking sheet and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the edges of the tart are golden-brown and the pears have softened and turned brown around the edges.  Remove from the oven and let cool completely before serving.
</DirT>
<DirT>

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHOCOLATE PASTRY ===
  2 3/4    tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1                cup  very fine flour, ideally 00 (Italian
                        doppio zero) -- plus more for
                        dusting the pan - (see Note)
  1              pinch  salt
     1/3           cup  confectioners' sugar -- plus
                        more for dusting
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- roughly cubed, plus
                        more for greasing the pan
  1              large  egg yolk
                        === FILLING ===
  2              large  eggs -- separated
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/4           cups  milk
  1                     vanilla bean
  10            ounces  dark chocolate -- finely chopped in
                        food processor until the consistency of
                        bread crumbs and just beginning to melt
  3              large  or 4 small ripe but firm pears -- preferably Bartlett
                        === TO DECORATE AND SERVE ===
                        Cape gooseberries -- (optional)
                        Whipping cream, crËme fraÓche, or
                        vanilla ice cream

Note:  Italian 00 (doppio zero) flour is used in making fresh pasta and is available from Italian and specialty-food stores.  If unavailable, use any fine flour or all-purpose flour.

To make the pastry dough, sift together the cocoa powder, flour, salt, and confectioners' sugar.  Place in a food processor with the butter and, using the metal blade, mix until fine crumbs form.  Add the egg yolk and pulse gently until you have a lump of dough.  Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for an hour or so.

When the dough is firm, heat the oven to 350 degrees and generously butter and flour the bottom and side of a round, removable-bottomed 10-inch tart pan that's 1 1/2 inches deep.  Roll the dough out and then line the bottom of the pan.  Don't worry if the dough breaks; it can easily be repaired.  Roll out the trimmings of the dough and use them to line the side, pressing the dough into the corners.  The top edge of the dough can be very thin and left with a rough finish; it will have an attractive lacy look when baked.  Prick all over with a fork and bake 15 minutes; set aside to cool on a wire rack.

To make the filling, first prepare a custard: Beat the egg yolks and sugar in a heatproof bowl.  In a separate pan, bring the milk with the vanilla bean to a boil, then whisk the boiling milk into the egg mixture with a large whisk.  Keep whisking until the mixture thickens.  If the mixture is not hot enough to thicken, return it briefly to low heat, but be very careful or you'll end up with scrambled eggs!  When you have a light custard (it doesn't need to be too thick), pour it little by little onto the chocolate to make the ganache, as described here.  Set aside.

Peel the pears, cut them in half, and scoop out the cores and stems.  Arrange the pear halves on the baked tart shell.

Whisk the reserved egg whites in a clean bowl until forming soft peaks.  Beat 1/4 of the whites into the custard, then fold the remainder in gently.  Pour the filling into the pan, leaving a bit of the pears showing.

Bake about 30 minutes, or until risen and set to your taste.  You can decide whether you want a soft filling or a firmer one, depending on how long you bake the tart; soft is best if serving cold, and a firmer set is better for serving hot.

Decorate with cape gooseberries and dust with confectioners' sugar.  Serve with whipping cream, crËme fraÓche, or vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  This is an old favorite in our house.  It has been through many incarnations and can be adapted to suit your mood.  Sometimes I bake it for much longer than indicated below (it's better firmer if it's to be served warm), and sometimes I put a layer of Seville orange marmalade on the crust before adding the pears.  This version uses a variation on the ganache theme, substituting custard sauce for cream in the ganache.  The whites of the eggs are whipped and added at the end to give an even airier effect.  The whole thing is much lighter than the cream-based ganache version.  The dough can be made the day before, or a larger quantity can be prepared well in advance and frozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUMBLE TOPPING ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  old-fashioned (not quick cooking) oatmeal
     1/2           cup  brown sugar - (packed) -- plus
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar - (packed)
  1              pinch  kosher salt
  13       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces,
                        and well chilled
                        === FILLING ===
  5               cups  sliced peeled ripe pears
     3/4           cup  dried cranberries -- plumped in hot water
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg -- preferably freshly
                        grated
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1              pinch  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

Make The Crumble Topping:  In a stand mixer using the paddle attachment, combine the flour, oatmeal, brown sugar, and salt.  Add the cold butter and mix on low speed until the topping just begins to come together and resembles large bits of chunky dough.  (Do not mix so long that it comes together completely.)

Transfer the topping to a shallow container, breaking it up a bit.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.

Make The Filling:  Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Combine the pears, cranberries, lemon juice, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar, salt, and flour.  Toss the ingredients lightly to coat evenly and pour into a 1 1/2 quart baking dish.  Top with the crumble topping, breaking up any large clumps with your fingers and spreading it evenly.  At this point, there may be areas that aren't completely covered with topping, but don't worry because it will spread a bit as it bakes.

Bake until the topping begins to brown and the filling is bubbling, about 40 minutes.  Remove the crumble from the oven and let it cool somewhat before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  You could also make the crumble in individual ramekins; just check on it sooner, as it will likely cook more quickly in the ramekins.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TORTE ===
  1 3/4           cups  pecans
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6              large  eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
     2/3           cup  granulated sugar
                        === WHIPPED CREAM ===
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- (see note below)
  1           teaspoon  confectioners' sugar
  2          teaspoons  bourbon
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Line the bottom of a 9- by 3-inch round cake pan with parchment paper.

In a food processor, process the pecans, flour, and salt until finely ground; do not overprocess.  Set aside.

Using a stand mixer, beat the egg yolks and 1/3 cup of the granulated sugar with the whisk on medium-high speed until pale and thick, 3 to 5 minutes.  Using a large rubber spatula, fold in the pecan mixture.  Transfer to a large bowl.

Thoroughly wash and dry the mixer bowl and whisk.  Beat the egg whites with the whisk on medium speed until they start to foam.  Add a third of the remaining 1/3 cup granulated sugar and beat until the whites are opaque, then add another third of the sugar.  When the whites start to increase in volume and become firm, add the remaining sugar and increase the speed to high.  Beat until the whites form soft peaks but still look wet (note below).  Using the spatula, carefully fold a third of the whites into the pecan mixture, then fold in the remaining whites.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.  Bake until lightly browned and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.  Let cool completely on a wire rack.

Run a table knife around the edge of the pan and invert the torte onto a serving plate.  Peel off the parchment paper.  Put it right side up on the serving plate.

Just before serving, make the whipped cream:  Whip the cream, confectioners' sugar, bourbon, and vanilla until the cream just holds its shape.  Cut the torte into wedges and place a dollop of whipped cream alongside each serving.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Whipping Egg Whites:  For successful whipping, the bowl and beaters must be perfectly clean, because even a trace of fat prevents good loft, it is also important to start with room-temperature whites.  Sugar and/or cream of tartar are often added during whipping to help stabilize the whites.  To test if the whites are whipped to the desired finish, left the beaters, soft peaks should droop over gently and look wet; medium firm peaks should stand upright but still appear moist and satiny.

Whipping Cream:  Beating air into cream stiffens it for use as a filling, frosting, or garnish.  Always take cream for whipping straight from the refrigerator; cream allowed to stand at room temperature is more likely to separate as it is being whipped.  Also chill the bowl and beaters (or whisk) on warm days or in a warm kitchen, if you have over whipped the cream, and it is too stiff, try folding in a few tablespoons of cream, one at a time, from the carton.

Keep in mind that cream labeled "ultra pasteurized" will not rise to the same billowing heights as regular pasteurized cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  raw pistachios
                        === G…NOISE ===
  3             ounces  semisweet chocolate
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  unsifted cake flour
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature
  2                     egg yolks -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
                        === PISTACHIO BAVARIAN CREAM ===
  4             ounces  pistachio nuts -- (from above)
  2               cups  milk
  3        tablespoons  water
  2          teaspoons  gelatin
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  cocoa powder -- optional

Prepare The Pistachios:  Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil, pour in the pistachio nuts (4 ounces from the recipe for Bavarian cream and 4 ounces from the ingredients for the decoration), and bring just to the boil.  Immediately pour the nuts into a sieve and shake to remove as much moisture as possible.  The skins slip off easily while the nuts are moist and warm.  Set aside half the nuts.

Place half the blanched nuts on a baking sheet and allow them to air-dry for 3 hours or as long as overnight.  Then place in a preheated 300 degree oven to roast them slightly, enhancing their flavor but without coloring them (about 5 to 10 minutes).  Remove from oven.  When the nuts are cool, grind them to the consistency of cornmeal.  Set aside until time to decorate the dessert.

Make The GÈnoise:  Position rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Using a paper towel, grease the bottom and sides of the springform pan with solid shortening.  Dust generously with all-purpose flour, tilt to coat, tap out the excess, and insert a parchment or waxed paper liner.

Chop the chocolate into matchstick-size pieces and place them with the butter in a 1 1/2-quart mixing bowl that fits snugly over another bowl half-filled with hot (140 degrees) water.  (The water temperature can be this high because the addition of butter reduces the risk that the chocolate will scorch.)  Stir occasionally until the mixture is melted and smooth; remove from the water; set aside to cool slightly.

Pour the flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, and baking powder in that order into a triple sifter.  Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper to distribute the ingredients evenly; set aside.

Place the eggs and egg yolks in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer.  Add the 1/4 cup sugar and whisk ingredients by hand to combine.  Rest the bowl in a shallow pan, such as a 10-inch skillet, filled with 1 inch of hot tap water (120 degrees).  To prevent the eggs from setting, whisk them continuously for about 30 seconds, or until the mixture has warmed to body temperature, taking care that the temperature doesn't exceed 110 degrees.  Rub a little of the mixture between your thumb and forefinger; it should feel smooth, not granular.

Place the bowl on the mixer, and with the whisk attachment, whip the mixture on medium speed (#5) until it has cooled and thickened, appears paler in color and resembles a whole-egg meringue, and has tripled or more in volume (about 3 minutes).  Add the vanilla toward the end of whipping.  Test if it's time to fold in the flour by lifting the whisk.  If some of the mixture falls back into the bowl in ribbons and remains on the surface, proceed.  But if it sinks back into the batter right away, continue whipping for a few more minutes, or until the desired consistency is achieved.  Remove the whisk and bowl from the mixer.

With the aid of a flexible metal icing spatula, scoop one-third of the flour mixture and sprinkle it over the top.  Using a rubber spatula, fold into the batter just until incorporated.  Fold in the remaining flour in two more additions.  With the aid of a rubber spatula, gently pour one-third of the batter onto the chocolate mixture, and fold until combined.  Now pour the rest of the batter onto the chocolate mixture and fold together until combined.

Gently pour the batter into the prepared pan, taking care not to deflate the foam structure you've created.  With the rubber spatula, level and smooth the surface.  Bake for 20 to 23 minutes, or until the top springs back slightly when lightly touched and the sides begin to contract from the pan.  Do not overbake.

Place the cake on a rack to cool for 5 to 10 minutes.  With mitts, tilt the pan, and gently tap it to see that it has contracted from the sides.  If not, or if in doubt, run a small metal spatula or the thin blade of a table knife between the outside cake edge and the metal rim, freeing the sides and allowing air to get under the layer as it is rotated.  Then release and remove the outside of the springform pan.  Allow to cool completely on rack.

When the cake is cool, cover it with another cooling rack, invert it onto the rack, and carefully remove the springform bottom from the cake.  Slowly peel off parchment liner, turn it over so that the sticky side faces up, and reposition it on top of the cake.  Cover with the first rack, invert the layer right side up, and remove the top rack.

Make The Bavarian Cream:  Rest a sieve on top of a 3-quart mixing bowl to strain the filling after it has been cooked.

Combine the milk and ground pistachios in a 1 1/2-quart saucepan and bring just to a boil over medium heat.  Remove from the heat and let steep for 10 to 15 minutes.  Pour through a second sieve to strain; extract milk from the nuts by pressing them against the sides of the sieve with a rubber spatula.  Discard the nuts (their flavor is now in the milk) and measure the flavored milk, adding more milk if needed to make 1 1/2 cups.

Pour the water into a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over it, and set aside until softened.

Pour the cream and almond extract into a 1 1/2-quart deep mixing bowl, and with an electric hand mixer, whip the cream on medium to high speed (#8 to #10) until peaks barely form.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

Whisk the egg yolks in a 1-quart mixing bowl to combine, add half the sugar, and whisk until completely incorporated.

Return the pistachio-flavored milk with the other half of sugar to medium heat and bring just to a boil.  Remove from heat and pour about half into the egg mixture, whisking until blended.  Pour mixture back into saucepan, whisk, and return to medium-low heat.  Cook the mixture, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it registers 165 to 170 degrees on the candy thermometer and is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon (about 45 to 60 seconds).

Immediately remove from the heat and pour the mixture through the sieve into the mixing bowl.  Add the gelatin; stir to dissolve; then set over a larger bowl of ice water.  Stir the mixture occasionally to distribute the cold and prevent any lumpiness.  When the mixture is syrupy and cooler than room temperature (about 8 to 10 minutes), fold in the chilled, lightly whipped cream with a rubber spatula until combined.  If it goes beyond the syrupy stage and develops more body than desired, remove from the cold-water bath and whisk partially setting mixture until smooth.  Then fold in the cream.

Pour into a container refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until cold and set.

Assemble The Cake:  Lightly oil the inside rim of the springform pan to facilitate the dessert's removal.  Trim 1/2 inch from the cake's edge, using a small paring knife.  Place a round of parchment or waxed paper inside the pan and center the gÈnoise on it (this will make it possible to remove the dessert from the metal disk to a serving plate later).

The springform pan may leak, so place it on a baking sheet.  (Once assembled, the dessert will go into the freezer for a short time to hasten the setting of the cream, so be certain the baking sheet fits in your freezer.)

Pour Pistachio Bavarian Cream into the springform pan, being certain that the gap between the trimmed cake and pan is filled, thus completely covering the gÈnoise.  The filling will come 1 inch below the springform's top rim.  Place the dessert in the freezer for 30 minutes to hasten the chilling and setting of the Bavarian cream.  Cover the top of the pan with foil.  Then refrigerate for at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.

Serving The Cake:  Up to 6 hours before serving, remove the dessert from the refrigerator and pat a damp sponge all around the outside of the pan.  The moisture from the sponge will begin to loosen the Bavarian cream from the inside of the pan.  Carefully and slowly release the springs on the pan to unmold.  If the springs are stubborn, coax them with a thin-bladed knife around the edges.

Place the reserved ground dried pistachios on a baking sheet.  Hold the dessert in one hand directly over the nuts.  Tilt the cake slightly.  With the other hand, pick up the ground nuts, and gently press them onto the sides and top of the Bavarian cream.  Rotate the cake as you work until all the cream is covered.  Press lightly with the side of a clean flexible metal icing spatula to ensure that the nuts adhere neatly.  Alternately, coat only the sides of the Bavarian Cream with the ground nuts.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Optional Decoration Preparation:  (If desired, make a template for a finishing touch: Buy acetate from an art supply store.  (The joy of an acetate template is that it is reusable.  To clean, run under water and pat dry.)  Trace the letter P from an art book, newspaper, etc., with a pencil or felt pen.  Cut it out, using a utility knife.  The thinner the acetate, the easier it is to cut.  The thicker it is, the easier it is to lift it from the cake after using.)

If using the P template, center it on top of the cake.  Pour the cocoa into a sieve.  Using the palm of your hand for better control of the powder's flow, gently tap the sieve to sprinkle it evenly over the P.  Carefully lift the template.  Then slip under the paper a large, wide spatula and transfer the dessert onto a serving plate.  Refrigerate until 15 to 30 minutes before serving.

Discard the nuts (their flavor is now in the milk) and measure the flavored milk, adding more milk if needed to make 1 1/2 cups.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the water into a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over it, and set aside until softened.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the cream and almond extract into a 1 1/2-quart deep mixing bowl, and with an electric hand mixer, whip the cream on medium to high speed (#8 to #10) until peaks barely form.  Refrigerate until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk the egg yolks in a 1-quart mixing bowl to combine, add half the sugar, and whisk until completely incorporated.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the pistachio-flavored milk with the other half of sugar to medium heat and bring just to a boil.  Remove from heat and pour about half into the egg mixture, whisking until blended.  Pour mixture back into saucepan, whisk, and return to medium-low heat.  Cook the mixture, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it registers 165 to 170 degrees on the candy thermometer and is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon (about 45 to 60 seconds).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Immediately remove from the heat and pour the mixture through the sieve into the mixing bowl.  Add the gelatin; stir to dissolve; then set over a larger bowl of ice water.  Stir the mixture occasionally to distribute the cold and prevent any lumpiness.  When the mixture is syrupy and cooler than room temperature (about 8 to 10 minutes), fold in the chilled, lightly whipped cream with a rubber spatula until combined.  If it goes beyond the syrupy stage and develops more body than desired, remove from the cold-water bath and whisk partially setting mixture until smooth.  Then fold in the cream.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour into a container refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until cold and set.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Assemble The Cake:  Lightly oil the inside rim of the springform pan to facilitate the dessert&apos;s removal.  Trim 1/2 inch from the cake&apos;s edge, using a small paring knife.  Place a round of parchment or waxed paper inside the pan and center the gÈnoise on it (this will make it possible to remove the dessert from the metal disk to a serving plate later).
</DirT>
<DirT>
The springform pan may leak, so place it on a baking sheet.  (Once assembled, the dessert will go into the freezer for a short time to hasten the setting of the cream, so be certain the baking sheet fits in your freezer.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour Pistachio Bavarian Cream into the springform pan, being certain that the gap between the trimmed cake and pan is filled, thus completely covering the gÈnoise.  The filling will come 1 inch below the springform&apos;s top rim.  Place the dessert in the freezer for 30 minutes to hasten the chilling and setting of the Bavarian cream.  Cover the top of the pan with foil.  Then refrigerate for at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serving The Cake:  Up to 6 hours before serving, remove the dessert from the refrigerator and pat a damp sponge all around the outside of the pan.  The moisture from the sponge will begin to loosen the Bavarian cream from the inside of the pan.  Carefully and slowly release the springs on the pan to unmold.  If the springs are stubborn, coax them with a thin-bladed knife around the edges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the reserved ground dried pistachios on a baking sheet.  Hold the dessert in one hand directly over the nuts.  Tilt the cake slightly.  With the other hand, pick up the ground nuts, and gently press them onto the sides and top of the Bavarian cream.  Rotate the cake as you work until all the cream is covered.  Press lightly with the side of a clean flexible metal icing spatula to ensure that the nuts adhere neatly.  Alternately, coat only the sides of the Bavarian Cream with the ground nuts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Optional Decoration Preparation:  (If desired, make a template for a finishing touch: Buy acetate from an art supply store.  (The joy of an acetate template is that it is reusable.  To clean, run under water and pat dry.)  Trace the letter P from an art book, newspaper, etc., with a pencil or felt pen.  Cut it out, using a utility knife.  The thinner the acetate, the easier it is to cut.  The thicker it is, the easier it is to lift it from the cake after using.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
If using the P template, center it on top of the cake.  Pour the cocoa into a sieve.  Using the palm of your hand for better control of the powder&apos;s flow, gently tap the sieve to sprinkle it evenly over the P.  Carefully lift the template.  Then slip under the paper a large, wide spatula and transfer the dessert onto a serving plate.  Refrigerate until 15 to 30 minutes before serving.

                             Pistachio Gelato

Recipe By     :Pamela Sheldon Johns
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  shelled pistachios - (6 oz)
                        = (abt 12 oz in the shell)
  3               cups  whole milk
     3/4           cup  sugar

In a food processor or coffee grinder, grind the pistachios to a fine powder, reserving a few whole nuts for garnish.

In a medium saucepan, combine the milk and sugar.  Cook over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved and bubbles form around the edges of the pan.  Remove from heat, add the pistachio powder, cool, cover and refrigerate overnight.

Strain the milk mixture through a fine-meshed sieve, pressing on the nut meat with the back of a large spoon to get as much liquid from the nuts as possible.  Transfer liquid to an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

Comments:  Pistachio gelato is the benchmark by which many gelaterie are judged.  You can tell at a glance if an artificial base has been used, just by the color.  If the gelato maker is using real pistachio nuts, the color will be almost drab green.  If the bin flashes a neon green, keep walking!

                             Poppy Seed Cake

Recipe By     :David Bouley
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Unsalted butter -- for the cake pans
  2               cups  confectioners' sugar
  1                cup  poppy seeds -- plus
  1         tablespoon  poppy seeds
  1 1/3           cups  roughly-chopped walnuts
  5        tablespoons  all-purpose flour -- plus
  1           teaspoon  all-purpose flour
  2 1/4      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1 1/4      teaspoons  baking powder
  1              small  Granny Smith apple -- peeled, cored
                        = (or other tart green apple)
  6              large  egg yolks
  7              large  egg whites
  2        tablespoons  honey -- plus
  1           teaspoon  honey
  1              pinch  salt

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter two 8-inch cake pans and line them with parchment paper.

Place 1 tablespoon of the confectioners' sugar in a coffee grinder or spice mill with one quarter of the poppy seeds.  Pulse until the poppy seeds are finely ground and the texture of sand, about 20 seconds (avoid over-processing, they should not become a paste).  Transfer the ground poppy seeds to a bowl.  Repeat this three more times with the remaining poppy seeds and 3 more tablespoons of the sugar.

Place the walnuts in a food processor (using the smallest work bowl you have).  Add 1/4 cup of the confectioners' sugar and pulse until the nuts are airy, with the consistency of fine bread crumbs, about 40 seconds.  Whisk the ground nuts into the poppy seed mixture and set aside.

In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, and baking powder, and set it aside.  Using a hand grater or a food processor, grate the apple and set it aside.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the egg yolks with the remaining 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, and beat until light and very fluffy, about 2 minutes.

In a clean bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on high speed until they are very foamy, about 2 minutes.  Add the honey and salt.  Continue to beat on high speed until the whites are stiff (but not dry) and form glossy peaks.  Add a little of the white mixture to the yolk mixture and stir to combine.  Gently fold the remaining whites into the yolk mixture.

Working slowly so the batter does not deflate, fold the flour mixture and then the nuts and poppy seeds into the batter.  Combine gently until the mixture is almost smooth.  Fold in the grated apple.  Divide the batter between the prepared pans, and using a wide spatula, gently scrape the batter from the center to the edges of the pans, so that the cakes look slightly concave (this will prevent them from rising too much in the center).

Bake until a cake tester inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean and the tops are golden, about 30 minutes.  When the cakes are done, run a knife around the sides of the pan to loosen them.  Invert the pans over a wire cooling rack and peel the parchment paper off the bottoms.  Let cool thoroughly.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  This is a simple, homey, plain cake that can be dressed up in myriad ways.  You can split the layers and sandwich them with a thick filling of apricot or raspberry jam.  You can fill and ice the cake with whipped cream or chocolate frosting.  You can toast slices and serve them with a pat of melting butter on the top.  But even eaten on its own with a cup of tea or coffee, this is a fine-textured, moist cake with excellent flavor.

Poppy seeds are ubiquitous in Austria.  They are sprinkled on top of buns and pastries, used ground in sweetened fillings, and tossed into pasta, potato, and egg dishes.  Poppy seed oil is used for cooking and dressing salads.

Since they contain a high percentage of oil, poppy seeds can go rancid if they are not used fairly soon after purchase.  If you can, taste a seed when buying them to make sure it isn't bitter or stale.  Don't buy much more than you plan to use, and store extra poppy seeds in the refrigerator or freezer to keep them fresh.

Poppy seeds are ubiquitous in Austria.  They are sprinkled on top of buns and pastries, used ground in sweetened fillings, and tossed into pasta, potato, and egg dishes.  Poppy seed oil is used for cooking and dressing salads.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Since they contain a high percentage of oil, poppy seeds can go rancid if they are not used fairly soon after purchase.  If you can, taste a seed when buying them to make sure it isn&apos;t bitter or stale.  Don&apos;t buy much more than you plan to use, and store extra poppy seeds in the refrigerator or freezer to keep them fresh.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  5 3/4           cups  unbleached bread flour
  2          teaspoons  table salt
                        = (or 3 1/2 tspns kosher salt)
  2 1/2      teaspoons  instant yeast
  2 1/2           cups  ice-cold water -- (40 degrees)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        === HERB OIL ===
  2               cups  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  dried basil
  2        tablespoons  dried parsley
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  1         tablespoon  fresh rosemary leaves
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  2        tablespoons  granulated garlic powder
                        = (or 10 cloves fresh garlic, pressed and
                        lightly sautÈed in 1/2 cup of the above
                        olive oil)
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt or coarse sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  chile flakes -- (optional)
  1           teaspoon  sweet or hot paprika -- (optional)
                        === FOCACCIA ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  8                     new potatoes or 1 1/2 lbs Yukon Gold
                        potatoes
  1              large  white or yellow onion -- (optional),
                        cut thin strips
                        Leaves from 1 rosemary sprig
  1                cup  Herb Oil -- (above)
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse sea salt or kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste

Make The Dough:  With a large metal spoon, stir together the flour, salt, yeast, and water in a 4-quart bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer until combined.  If mixing with an electric mixer, fit it with the paddle attachment and mix on low speed for about 2 minutes, or until all the ingredients are hydrated and begin to form a wet ball of dough.  Let the dough rest for 5 minutes.  Switch to the dough hook, add the olive oil, and resume mixing on medium-low speed for 3 to 4 minutes, or until all of the oil is incorporated and the dough is sticky, supple, and smooth; it should clear the sides of the bowl and stick just a little to the bottom.  If the dough seems like a batter and does not have sufficient structure to hold itself together, mix in more flour by the tablespoonful.  Even though it is sticky, the dough should still pass the windowpane test.  If mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the spoon into cold water and use it much like a dough hook, working the dough vigorously as you rotate the bowl with your other hand.  As all the flour is incorporated and the dough becomes a wet ball, about 3 minutes, stop mixing and let the dough rest for 5 minutes.

Then add the olive oil, dip your hand or spoon again in water, and continue to work the dough for another 3 to 4 minutes.  The dough should be very sticky, but it should also have some texture and structure.  If the dough seems like a batter and does not have sufficient structure to hold itself together, mix in more flour by the tablespoonful.  Even though it is sticky, the dough should till pass the windowpane test.

Form the dough into a ball and place it in a bowl brushed with olive oil.  Turn the dough to coat it with the oil, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and immediately refrigerate it overnight.  The next day the dough should have nearly doubled in size.  Allow it to sit at room temperature for about 2 hours before making the focaccia.

Make The Herb Oil:  In a bowl, whisk together all the ingredients.  Let sit at room temperature for 2 hours before using.  (Makes 2 cups)

Make The Focaccia:  Shape and dimple the dough in a 12- by 17-inch sheet pan using the 2 tablespoons olive oil for preparing the pan and the 1/4 cup olive oil for dimpling the dough.  Let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours, or until it fills the pan.

While the dough is rising in the pan, prepare the potatoes.  If using new potatoes, place them in a saucepan with water to cover, bring to a boil, and boil for about 10 minutes, or until they can be easily pierced with a fork.  Drain, let cool (or plunge them in cold water to speed the process), and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  If using regular-sized Yukon Gold potatoes, slice them paper-thin using a food processor, a mandoline, or a chefs knife.  In a bowl, combine the sliced potatoes, onion, and rosemary.  Pour in the Herb Oil and toss gently to coat.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.  When the focaccia is fully risen and ready to bake, remove the potatoes from the oil, shaking off the excess oil, and spread the slices over the surface of the dough, either randomly or stacked like dominoes.  Place the sheet pan on the middle shelf of the oven, bake for 5 minutes, and then lower the temperature to 400 degrees.  Bake for 15 minutes, then rotate the pan 180 degrees.  Continue to bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer or until the dough and the potatoes are golden around the edges.

Remove the finished focaccia from the oven and immediately transfer it to a cooling rack.  Drizzle any oil remaining in the pan, as well as any remaining Herb Oil, to taste, over the potatoes.  Season with the salt and pepper, then let cool for at least 20 minutes before cutting and serving.

This recipe yields one 12- by 17-inch focaccia.

Comments:  This focaccia variation, which goes under the name focaccia con patate e rosmarino in Tuscany and "potato pizza" in New York City, is beginning to emerge as the most popular topping among the new generation of focaccia fanciers.  It is their benchmark in much the same way that the pizza Margherita is the benchmark for pizza and the baguette is for bread.  When you make it, you'll understand why.  This dough recipe makes the best-tasting all-purpose focaccia dough that I've ever had and is also the easiest to make.  Like many of the dough recipes in this book, it utilizes a delayed fermentation technique, a method so perfectly suited to focaccia that I now use this recipe in place of most of the previous focaccia recipes that I've learned or developed.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     lemons
     1/4           cup  salt -- more if desired
                        Freshly-squeezed lemon juice -- if necessary

Quarter the lemons starting at the top to within 1/2-inch of the bottom, sprinkle salt on the exposed flesh, and then reshape the fruit.  Place 1 tablespoon salt on the bottom of a sterilized one-pint mason jar.

Pack in the lemons and push them down, adding more salt, and lemon juice, if needed.  Press down the lemons to release their juices and to make room for the remaining lemons.  (If the juice released from the squashed fruit does not cover them, add freshly squeezed lemon juice ó not chemically produced lemon juice or water.)  Leave some air space at the top of the jar before sealing.

Let the lemons ripen for 30 days in a warm place, shaking the jar often to distribute the salt and juice.

To use, rinse the lemons as needed under running water, removing and discarding the pulp, if desired.

This recipe yields 5 preserved lemons.

Comments:  Preserved lemons, sold loose in the souks, or markets, are one of the indispensable ingredients of Moroccan cooking used in fragrant lamb and vegetables tagines, recipes for chicken with lemons and olives, and salads.  Their unique pickled taste and special silken texture cannot be duplicated with fresh lemon or lime juice, despite what some food writers have said.  In Morocco they are made with a mixture of fragrant-skinned doqq and tart boussera lemons, but I have had excellent luck with American lemons from Florida and California.  If available, use Meyer lemons.

The important thing in preserving lemons is to be certain they are completely covered with salted lemon juice.  With my recipe you can use the lemon juice over and over again.  (As a matter of fact, I keep a jar of used pickling juice in the kitchen, and when I make Bloody Marys or salad dressings and have a half lemon left over, I toss it into the jar and let it marinate with the rest.)  Sometimes you will see a sort of lacy, white substance clinging to preserved lemons in their jar; it is perfectly harmless, but should be rinsed off for aesthetic reasons just before the lemons are used.  Preserved lemons are rinsed, in any case, to rid them of their salty taste.  Cook with the thick peels; marinate with the pulp, if desired.  Thin-skinned lemon peels are best as a garnish.

If using lemons with a thick peel, soften it by soaking in lukewarm water for 3 days, changing the water daily.

Note: There is no need to refrigerate after opening.  Preserved lemons will keep up to a year, and the pickling juice can be used two or three times over the course of a year.

One Caveat:  Don't put your fingers into the brine.  Use a wooden spoon to remove lemons as needed.

Transfer the dough into the bowl of a standing mixer.  Stir at low speed for a few minutes to lower the temperature of the dough.  Increase the speed to medium and then add the eggs, one at a time.  Mix until a smooth, cool dough forms, about 4 minutes.

Fill a pastry bag, fitted with a #9 tip, with the dough, or use a soup spoon to form small puffs, about 2 inches in diameter, on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Brush the puffs with the beaten egg yolk and transfer to the oven.

Bake for 45 minutes, or until golden brown.  Cool the puffs on a wire rack and then slice them, as if they were hamburger buns, with a serrated knife.

Make The Chocolate Sauce:  Heat the heavy cream in a saucepan until it foams.  Reduce the flame to low and add the chopped chocolate.  Whisk until all the chocolate has melted and the sauce is smooth and shiny.  Keep warm over a pan of simmering water.

Serve:  Fill the puffs with a scant scoop of ice cream and serve on small plates or in shallow bowls.  Pass a pitcher of warm chocolate sauce at the table.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  At Balthazar, profiteroles are served by a food runner who pours a warm chocolate sauce over the ice-cream-filled puffs, adding the finishing touch at the table.  One runner began making a terrific show of all this, starting with a reserved drizzle, then gradually hoisting the little metal pitcher high above his head.  Still pouring, he miraculously hits the ice cream target with no resulting splash.  He began a trend among the food runners, all of whom now amaze and frighten the guests with their wild chocolate pouring.

              Pumpkin Cheesecake With Gingersnap Pecan Crust

Categories    : Cheesecake                      Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1 1/2           cups  gingersnap cookie crumbs
     1/2           cup  chopped toasted pecans -- (see note)
                        === FILLING ===
     3/4         pound  cream cheese -- softened
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     3/4           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  5              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  canned pumpkin puree
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
                        === SWEET VANILLA WHIPPED CREAM ===
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Sweet Vanilla Whipped Cream
                        Toasted pecan halves

Make The Crust:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

In a small bowl, combine the butter with the gingersnap cookie crumbs and pecans.  Press into the bottom of a buttered 10-inch springform pan.

Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack.

Make The Filling:  In a large bowl, on the low speed of an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until very smooth.  Gradually add the sugars.  Add the eggs, one at a time.  Add the pumpkin puree and mix until just blended.  To ensure that the batter has no lumps and that no ingredients are stuck to the bottom of the bowl, stop the mixer several times and scrape down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula.  Stir in the heavy cream and cinnamon.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and set the pan on a baking sheet.  Bake until the edges are set and the center moves only slightly when the pan is shaken, about 1 hour.

At the end of the baking time, turn off the heat and, using a wooden spoon to keep the oven door slightly ajar, cool the cake in the oven for 1 hour before removing.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or overnight.

Make The Vanilla Whipped Cream:  Place all the ingredients in a medium-size bowl and whip with an eggbeater or a whisk until soft peaks form. Serve immediately or cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 4 hours.

To Serve:  Remove the cake from the refrigerator 15 to 30 minutes before cutting and serving.  Garnish with the sweetened whipped cream and toasted pecan halves.

This recipe yields one 10-inch cheesecake.

Comments:  This cheesecake has been a huge success at the bakery since its introduction.  It is a lovely dessert for an autumn dinner party.  I love to make cheesecakes when I'm entertaining because they can be made one to two days in advance, before guests even arrive.

Note:  To toast the pecans, place on a baking sheet in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes, or until lightly browned and fragrant.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  almond paste - (1-1/2 8-oz cans)
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- slightly firm
  1                cup  sugar
  4              large  eggs -- separated
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- spooned in,
                        and leveled
                        = (or 1 1/2 cups sifted matzo cake meal,
                        spooned in and leveled)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6              drops  green food color - (to 8)
  8              drops  red food color - (to 10)
     1/4           cup  seedless raspberry preserves
  1                cup  apricot preserves
  10            ounces  semisweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped

Make The Layers:  Position the shelves in the upper and lower thirds of the oven.  Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly butter the bottom of the three 12 1/4- by 8 1/4-inch disposible aluminum baking pans.  Line the bottoms with the baking parchment, then butter the parchment and the sides of each pan.

Break the almond paste into pieces and place it in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade.  Process for 10 to 15 seconds, or until finely chopped.  Alternatively, shred the almond paste on a box grater.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter on medium-low speed just until smooth.  Increase the speed to medium, add the grated almond paste, and beat until lightened in color, about 2 minutes.  Pour in the sugar in a steady stream, beating for 1 minute longer.  Then add the egg yolks and the vanilla, beating well to combine.  Scrape down the bowl as needed.

Combine salt and flour, and at low speed blend in three additions, just until incorporated.

In a clean mixer bowl, using the whip attachment, beat the egg whites on medium speed until frothy.  Increase the speed to medium-high and continue beating until firm peaks form.  Using a large rubber spatula, gently fold one-third of the egg whites into the batter to lighten the mixture, then fold in the remaining egg whites in two more additions.

Divide the batter into thirds (each measuring approximately 1 2/3 cups) and place into three separate bowls.  Tint one portion with the green food coloring, blending until evenly colored.  Tint another portion with the red food coloring, again blending until evenly colored.  The remaining batter is not colored.  Spread the batters in the pans, smoothing the tops with a small offset spatula.  Be sure the batter is evenly distributed, especially into the corners of the pans.

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the tops are firm to the touch and slightly brown.  Let stand on wire racks until cool enough to handle, then invert each pan and peel off the parchment.

Assemble The Layers:  Have ready a large sheet of plastic wrap placed on a cookie sheet.  Invert the green layer onto the plastic, top-side down.  Using a small offset spatula, spread the surface evenly with 2 tablespoons of the raspberry preserves.  Place the plain layer, again top-side down, on top of the raspberry preserves.  Align the two layers and press them together.  Spread 2 tablespoons of the raspberry preserves over the plain layer, again using a small offset spatula.  Then place the pink layer, top-side up, on top of the raspberry preserves.  Be sure that the three layers are evenly aligned, then press them together again.

Wrap the layered stack tightly with plastic, sealing the ends securely, and place it on a clean cookie sheet.  Place another cookie sheet on top of the wrapped stack and weight it with two or three heavy cookbooks to compress the layers.  Let the stack rest at room temperature for at least 24 hours, turning it over once or twice during the weighting period.

Glaze The Layers:  Unwrap the stack and set it on a cutting board.  Using a large serrated knife, trim 1/4 inch from all sides.  Then cut the stack into five equal strips, each measuring approximately 1 1/4 inches wide.  Separate the strips and place them on a large wire rack set over a cookie sheet.

To make the apricot glaze place the apricot preserves and 2 tablespoons water in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then simmer for 1 minute.  Pass through a fine strainer into a bowl and discard the pulp.  This can be made ahead and reheated just before using.  Brush a thin layer of the warm glaze on the top and sides of each strip to seal the surface.  Let stand for 1/2 hour or longer.

When ready to coat the strips, fill a medium pot with 1 inch of water and bring it to a simmer.  Place the chocolate in a large bowl and set it over the simmering water to melt, gently stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula.  Watch carefully!  The chocolate should not become too hot.  When the chocolate is almost melted, remove it from the heat and allow it to stand until it is completely melted.  Gently stir occasionally.  It is ready to apply when it is smooth, tepid, and the consistency of chocolate syrup.  (Note: If the chocolate becomes too thick, warm it over simmering water until it reaches the correct consistency.)

Working one strip at a time, spoon about one-fifth of the melted chocolate down the length of the strip.  Using a small offset spatula, spread the chocolate evenly over the top and sides, taking care to smooth all surfaces.  Repeat with the remaining strips.  Let the strips stand at room temperature until the chocolate hardens.  This can take several hours depending on the temperature of the room and climate conditions.  Cut each strip into 5/8-inch slices.

Storage:  Store in an airtight container, layered between strips of wax paper, for up to 3 weeks.  (Note: These cookies may be frozen, preferably before slicing.)  This cookie improves with age.

This recipe yields 80 1 1/4- by 5/8-inch cookies.

Comments:  Rainbow Cookies are popular at Christmas, when they are called Neapolitan or Venetian cookies, perhaps to denote the colors of the flag of Italy.  They are sometimes associated with the Passover holidays (when made with matzo cake meal instead of flour).  The classic Rainbow Cookie is made with tinted layers of an almond-paste flavored cookie dough that, after baking, is spread with seedless raspberry preserves and then weighted to seal the layers.  The cookies are then divided into long strips, coated with melted dark chocolate, and cut into slices.

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the tops are firm to the touch and slightly brown.  Let stand on wire racks until cool enough to handle, then invert each pan and peel off the parchment.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Assemble The Layers:  Have ready a large sheet of plastic wrap placed on a cookie sheet.  Invert the green layer onto the plastic, top-side down.  Using a small offset spatula, spread the surface evenly with 2 tablespoons of the raspberry preserves.  Place the plain layer, again top-side down, on top of the raspberry preserves.  Align the two layers and press them together.  Spread 2 tablespoons of the raspberry preserves over the plain layer, again using a small offset spatula.  Then place the pink layer, top-side up, on top of the raspberry preserves.  Be sure that the three layers are evenly aligned, then press them together again.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wrap the layered stack tightly with plastic, sealing the ends securely, and place it on a clean cookie sheet.  Place another cookie sheet on top of the wrapped stack and weight it with two or three heavy cookbooks to compress the layers.  Let the stack rest at room temperature for at least 24 hours, turning it over once or twice during the weighting period.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Glaze The Layers:  Unwrap the stack and set it on a cutting board.  Using a large serrated knife, trim 1/4 inch from all sides.  Then cut the stack into five equal strips, each measuring approximately 1 1/4 inches wide.  Separate the strips and place them on a large wire rack set over a cookie sheet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the apricot glaze place the apricot preserves and 2 tablespoons water in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then simmer for 1 minute.  Pass through a fine strainer into a bowl and discard the pulp.  This can be made ahead and reheated just before using.  Brush a thin layer of the warm glaze on the top and sides of each strip to seal the surface.  Let stand for 1/2 hour or longer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to coat the strips, fill a medium pot with 1 inch of water and bring it to a simmer.  Place the chocolate in a large bowl and set it over the simmering water to melt, gently stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula.  Watch carefully!  The chocolate should not become too hot.  When the chocolate is almost melted, remove it from the heat and allow it to stand until it is completely melted.  Gently stir occasionally.  It is ready to apply when it is smooth, tepid, and the consistency of chocolate syrup.  (Note: If the chocolate becomes too thick, warm it over simmering water until it reaches the correct consistency.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Working one strip at a time, spoon about one-fifth of the melted chocolate down the length of the strip.  Using a small offset spatula, spread the chocolate evenly over the top and sides, taking care to smooth all surfaces.  Repeat with the remaining strips.  Let the strips stand at room temperature until the chocolate hardens.  This can take several hours depending on the temperature of the room and climate conditions.  Cut each strip into 5/8-inch slices.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Storage:  Store in an airtight container, layered between strips of wax paper, for up to 3 weeks.  (Note: These cookies may be frozen, preferably before slicing.)  This cookie improves with age.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 80 1 1/4- by 5/8-inch cookies.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Rainbow Cookies are popular at Christmas, when they are called Neapolitan or Venetian cookies, perhaps to denote the colors of the flag of Italy.  They are sometimes associated with the Passover holidays (when made with matzo cake meal instead of flour).  The classic Rainbow Cookie is made with tinted layers of an almond-paste flavored cookie dough that, after baking, is spread with seedless raspberry preserves and then weighted to seal the layers.  The cookies are then divided into long strips, coated with melted dark chocolate, and cut into slices.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  Swiss chard
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled, sliced
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Trim any discolored stems or leaves from the chard.  Separate the leaves from the stems then wash both in several changes of water.  Cut the stems into 2 1/2-inch pieces.  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.

Blanch the leaves (plunge them into the water; remove them with a slotted spoon as soon as the water returns to a boil), refresh them in ice water, then blot dry with a clean towel.  Add the stems and cook until they are almost tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain the stems, then refresh them in ice water.  Set aside with the leaves.

Combine the olive oil and garlic in a large skillet and warm over low heat.  When the garlic begins to color add the chard leaves and stems.  Warm the chard in the garlic-infused oil just until it is tender, about 5 minutes.  Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The big mistake people make with chard is cooking the stems and leaves together or ó worse ó discarding the stems altogether.  As you can see in this recipe, we separate the leaves from the meaty stems, blanch them separately (the stems need to cook longer), and then sautÈ them together quickly for the finished dish.  Lately I've seen something called "rainbow chard" ó yellow, pink, purple ó at the market.  The usual red and green varieties have beauty and flavor in abundance, and I recommend you stick with those, as we do at Craft.

                 Savoy Cabbage With Dill Butter And Bacon

Recipe By     :Andreas Viestad
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HOME-CHURNED BUTTER ===
  3               cups  sour cream
  1                cup  heavy (whipping) cream
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        === CABBAGE ===
  3        tablespoons  lightly-salted butter -- (above)
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh dill
     1/4           cup  salt
  2             medium  Savoy cabbages -- halved lengthwise
     1/4         pound  bacon -- diced
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Make The Home-Churned Butter:  Place the sour cream and cream in a blender and blend on high speed for 15 to 20 minutes, until the cream separates into yellow butter lumps and white buttermilk.  Strain and reserve the buttermilk for other purposes.

With your hands, squeeze out as much of the remaining buttermilk as you can before the heat of your hands starts melting the butter.  Place the butter in a large bowl of cold water and continue squeezing gently for 2 minutes, until the water is white.

Transfer to a small bowl and add salt to taste.  Cover and refrigerate.  Remove from the refrigerator 20 minutes before serving.

Cook The Cabbage:  In a small bowl, using a fork, mix the butter with the dill.  Refrigerate.

Combine 4 quarts water and the salt in a large pot and bring to a boil over high heat.  Add the cabbages, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for 8 to 12 minutes, or until the cabbages are tender but still offer some resistance when pricked with a fork.

Meanwhile, fry the bacon in the unsalted butter in a skillet over medium heat for 7 to 9 minutes, or until crisp.

Drain the cabbages well and place on individual plates.  Add the dill butter and bacon, season each plate with salt and pepper, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Savoy cabbage has a nice sweetness to it that is emphasized by a good lump of butter.  The best is home-churned sour cream-based butter.

Home-Churned Butter:  Although olive oil has established itself as an integral part of Scandinavian cooking, butter is still the most important cooking fat.  There are many different types of butter, from the mild, almost sweet unsalted butter that is at its best made from the cream of cows that have just calved to the salty winter varieties.

                Sourdough Dressing With Sausage And Prunes

Recipe By     :Michael McLaughlin
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dressing/Stuffing               Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  bulk breakfast sausage with sage -- coarsely crumbled
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- plus
                        extra for greasing
  4               cups  finely-chopped yellow onion - (1 1/4 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  poultry seasoning
  2 1/2         pounds  sourdough bread slices, 2 or 3 days old -- crusts trimmed and
                        bread cut into 1/2" cubes
  5                     eggs
  5               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or low-sodium canned chicken broth)
  2               cups  quartered pitted prunes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a frying pan over medium heat, cook the sausage, stirring it occasionally without breaking up too much, until just cooked through and lightly browned, about 10 minutes.  Transfer the sausage to paper towels to drain.  Discard the drippings.  Return the pan to medium heat and heat the 1/2 cup butter until it foams.

Stir in the onion and poultry seasoning, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally until the onion is tender, 12 to 15 minutes.  Let cool.

In a large bowl, combine the bread, sausage, and onion mixture.

In another bowl, lightly beat the eggs.  Whisk the stock into the eggs and stir the stock mixture into the bread mixture.  Add the prunes, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and mix well.

To Bake The Dressing Along Side A Turkey:  In a 325 degree oven, generously grease a deep 4-quart baking dish.  Spoon the mixture into the prepared dish and cover tightly with aluminum foil.  Bake for 45 minutes.  Uncover and continue to bake until the dressing is lightly browned on top and well browned on the sides and bottom but still moist, about another 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let stand on a wire rack for 5 minutes before serving.  Serve hot.

To Bake The Dressing In A Turkey:  Loosely stuff the turkey with dressing and truss the larger opening; increase the roasting time of the turkey by 35 to 45 minutes.  Generously butter a baking dish and spoon in the remaining dressing.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake alongside the turkey for 45 minutes.  Uncover and bake until the dressing is steaming hot, lightly browned on top, and well browned on the sides and bottom but still moist, about another 25 minutes, depending on the size of the baking dish.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Prunes are dried plums ó in particular, the small purple plums called prune plums.  Prunes appear in both sweet and savory dishes and are often paired with pork, as in this recipe.  Dried apricots can replace some or all of the prunes in the dressing, if desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  red onion -- chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1            package  frozen artichoke hearts - (10 oz) -- thawed, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped sun-dried tomatoes in oil -- drained
  1              pound  crusty sourdough bread -- cut 1/2" cubes and
                        dried overnight, or in oven (abt 10 cups)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh basil
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper - (to 1/2) -- or to taste
     1/2           cup  dry vermouth
                        = (or white wine)
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
  1                cup  turkey or chicken broth -- as needed

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the red onion and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 6 minutes.  Stir in the garlic and cook 1 minute.  Add the artichoke hearts and sun-dried tomatoes and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes.

Into a large bowl, scrape the vegetables.  Add the bread cubes, basil, Parmesan cheese, salt and crushed red pepper.  Gradually stir in the vermouth, eggs and about 1/2 cup of the broth, until stuffing is evenly moistened but not soggy.

Use as a turkey stuffing.  Or place in a lightly buttered casserole, drizzle with 1/2 cup broth, cover and bake in preheated 350 degree oven as a side dish.

This recipe yields about 8 cups.

Comments:  If the Thanksgiving weather forecast is cold and gray, then you might want to consider this brightly colored stuffing, which is packed with sunny Mediterranean flavors and goes well with a variety of foods: turkey, chicken, pork, bell peppers and zucchini.  Don't cut the crust off the bread; it adds texture.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     matzot
                        = (we have a special fondness for
                        egg matzah)
     2/3           cup  canola or olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  1                cup  celery in 1/4" slices - (2 medium ribs)
  2               cups  sliced mushrooms
                        = (button/ portobello/ oyster, porcini ó
                        use any combination you wish)
  2               cups  grated carrots
  2               cups  grated zucchini
  6                     eggs
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a 2-quart baking pan.  Set aside.

Break the matzot into small pieces (about the size of a quarter).  Place in a strainer, and let a stream of cold water run over them until softened.  Squeeze out and place in a large bowl.

Heat 1/3, cup of oil in a large skillet.  Add the onion and celery.  SautÈ over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent.  Add the mushrooms, and continue sautÈing and stirring, until the mushrooms are just softened.  Transfer to the bowl with the squeezed-out matzot.

Heat the remaining oil in a separate skillet, and sautÈ the carrots about 4 minutes, until nearly soft.  Add the zucchini and sautÈ an additional 3 to 4 minutes, until both the vegetables are soft.  Add to the bowl with the matzot, and mix gently to cool.

Stir in the eggs, parsley, salt, and pepper, mixing thoroughly Place in the prepared pan and bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown on top.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 (pareve) servings.

Comments:  Rather than serve a rib-sticking potato kugel at our Seders, we were inspired by our mother to make this colorful, tasty; and healthy kugel, fragrant with vegetables.  You can use yellow summer squash instead of, or along with, the zucchini, and use any combination of button or wild mushrooms (sold in bulk in many gourmet supermarkets).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  young mild-flavored leafy greens
                        = (mallow, lamb's-quarters, Swiss chard,
                        flat-leaf spinach, or 1 cup fully-cooked
                        mixed leafy greens, finely chopped)
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  homemade tahini sauce -- (see Note)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Ground sumac -- to taste

Note:  To make 1/2 cup homemade tahini sauce, blend 4 tablespoons of tahini with 3 tablespoons of lemon juice in the bowl of a food processor.  Add 3 tablespoons of ice water, 1 crushed clove garlic, salt, and process until smooth.  Thin with additional cold water to make 1/2 cup.

Steam the uncooked greens until tender and drain well.  Press well to express all moisture.

In a small skillet over medium-low heat, sautÈ the garlic in the oil until golden, 2 or 3 minutes.  Add the cooked greens and cook, stirring 1 minute.  Set aside to cool.

In a bowl combine the greens with 5 tablespoons of the prepared tahini sauce, mixing until completely blended.  Correct the seasoning with salt and pepper.  Transfer to a shallow dish.  Thin the remaining tahini until it has the consistency of creamed soup.  Drizzle over the greens and sprinkle with ground sumac.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  All around the Mediterranean you find dips ó in a bowl or on a plate ó usually assorted, always adorned and set out on the table before the meal.  One of my favorites is made with leafy greens.  One nice thing about this recipe is that the greens are interchangeable, depending on availability and season.  Yes, each green has its unique flavor, but with tahini as the base, the recipe always seems to work.

                Sweet Saffron Pilaf With Nuts And Currants

Recipe By     :Suvir Saran
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  basmati rice
  2 1/2           cups  water
     1/4      teaspoon  saffron threads
  1         tablespoon  milk or cream
     1/4           cup  ghee or canola oil
  1              piece  cinnamon stick - (abt 2")
  10                    green cardamom pods -- pounded in a mortar
                        and pestle to break open the shells
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 1") -- peeled, grated
     1/4           cup  dried currants
     1/4           cup  chopped blanched almonds
     1/4           cup  shelled pistachios -- chopped
     2/3           cup  sugar

Combine the rice and water in a medium bowl and soak 20 minutes.  Drain and reserve the water.  Set the rice and water aside separately.

Meanwhile, toast the saffron in a small frying pan over medium heat, stirring and pulling the pan off the heat occasionally to keep the saffron from burning, until the saffron darkens to a maroon color and is fragrant, 15 to 20 seconds.  Crush to a coarse powder in a mortar and pestle, or in a bowl with the back of a spoon.  Stir in the milk or cream, and set aside.

Combine the ghee or oil, cinnamon stick, cardamom, and ginger in a medium heavy-bottomed casserole over medium-high heat.  Cook, stirring, until the cinnamon unfurls, 1 to 2 minutes.

Add the currants and nuts and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Add the drained rice and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Add the reserved water, turn down the heat, cover, and simmer very gently over low heat for 15 minutes.

Now uncover and sprinkle the rice evenly with the sugar.  Drizzle the saffron mixture over the top.  Put the pan over very low heat, cover, and continue cooking 5 more minutes.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  The Mogul emperor Akbar, who ruled India from 1556 to 1605, wrote about this very old and famous rice dish in his memoirs.  For Indians, however this seductive dish has been so widespread far so long that we mostly take it for granted.  With its lovely, sweet saffron flavor, it can be served alongside savory dishes or on its own as a snack or dessert.  Some Indian households make this with yellow food coloring to give the rice an all-over yellow coloring, but I just use saffron; I like the way the spice colors the rice unevenly; so that some grains are yellow while others remain white.

Meanwhile, toast the saffron in a small frying pan over medium heat, stirring and pulling the pan off the heat occasionally to keep the saffron from burning, until the saffron darkens to a maroon color and is fragrant, 15 to 20 seconds.  Crush to a coarse powder in a mortar and pestle, or in a bowl with the back of a spoon.  Stir in the milk or cream, and set aside.

Add the currants and nuts and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Add the drained rice and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Add the reserved water, turn down the heat, cover, and simmer very gently over low heat for 15 minutes.

<DirT>
Now uncover and sprinkle the rice evenly with the sugar.  Drizzle the saffron mixture over the top.  Put the pan over very low heat, cover, and continue cooking 5 more minutes.  Serve hot.

Comments:  The Mogul emperor Akbar, who ruled India from 1556 to 1605, wrote about this very old and famous rice dish in his memoirs.  For Indians, however this seductive dish has been so widespread far so long that we mostly take it for granted.  With its lovely, sweet saffron flavor, it can be served alongside savory dishes or on its own as a snack or dessert.  Some Indian households make this with yellow food coloring to give the rice an all-over yellow coloring, but I just use saffron; I like the way the spice colors the rice unevenly; so that some grains are yellow while others remain white.

                Toasted Orzo Pilaf With Peas And Parmesan

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1             medium  onion -- chopped fine
                        Salt -- as needed
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
                        through garlic press (abt 2 tspns)
  1              pound  orzo - (abt 2 1/2 cups)
     3/4           cup  vermouth
                        = (or dry white wine)
  3 1/2           cups  canned low-sodium chicken broth
  8             ounces  frozen peas
  1                cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  1              pinch  ground nutmeg
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Once the foaming subsides, add the onion and 3/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until the onion has softened and is just beginning to brown, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Stir in the orzo and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until most of the grains are lightly browned and golden, 5 to 6 minutes.

Slide the skillet off the heat, cool for 30 seconds, and then pour in the vermouth and broth, being careful to avoid the steam.  Return the skillet to the burner and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until all of the liquid is absorbed and the orzo is tender, 10 to 12 minutes.

Stir in the peas, cheese, and nutmeg.  Remove the skillet from the heat and allow to sit for 2 minutes to heat the peas through.  Adjust the seasonings, adding salt and pepper to taste.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 side-dish servings.

Comments:  Because the pan gets extremely hot while the orzo is toasting, be sure to add the broth off the heat and after the pan has cooled a bit; otherwise, the ensuing steam can be dangerous.  For additional flavor, a couple of bay leaves, a few sprigs of thyme, or a small pinch of saffron can be added with the garlic.  Just remember to remove the herbs prior to serving.  Serve this basic pilaf with almost any dish, including red meat, poultry, and fish.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dry cannellini beans
  1                     celery stalk
  1             medium  carrot -- peeled, and
                        split lengthwise
  1                     bay leaf
  1             medium  white onion -- peeled, halved
  2                     whole cloves
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
     3/4           cup  Pecorino Romano cheese
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh sage
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cover beans with water and soak overnight.

Next day, drain beans, then place in a large saucepan with cold, lightly salted water to cover.  Add celery, carrot, bay leaf and onion halves stuck with cloves.  Bring to a boil, then simmer until beans are tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.  Discard vegetables and let beans cool in their cooking liquid.

In a sautÈ pan over medium heat, gently heat olive oil, add garlic and half the herbs and sautÈ for 2 to 3 minutes, being careful not to brown garlic.  With a slotted spoon, add beans and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add about 1 1/2 cups of their cooking liquid.  Stir in 1/2 of Pecorino Romano cheese and remaining herbs.  Boil briskly for about 10 minutes until liquid reduces slightly to form a "sauce."  If beans are tender before sauce thickens, remove them with a slotted spoon and continue boiling down liquid, then pour over beans.  Add salt and pepper, if needed, to taste and transfer to a serving platter.  Sprinkle with remaining cheese.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

              Twenty-Minute Marinara Sauce With Fresh Basil

Recipe By     :Lidia Matticchio Bastianich
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  San Marzano or other
                        Italian plum tomatoes - (one 35-oz can) -- with juices
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  7                     fat garlic cloves - (to 8) -- sliced (abt 1/2 cup)
     1/4      teaspoon  dried peperoncino (hot red pepper flakes) -- or more to taste
                        Hot water from the pasta-cooking pot
  1           teaspoon  salt -- or more to taste
  1              stalk  or big sprigs basil, with 20 or so whole
                        leaves
                        === FOR DRESSING THE PASTA ===
     1/3           cup  shredded fresh basil leaves - (packed) -- abt 12 whole leaves
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or
                        Grana Padano

Pour the tomatoes and juice into a big mixing bowl.  Using both hands, crush the tomatoes and break them up into small pieces.  (You don't have to mash them to bits; I like chunkiness in my marinara, with the tomatoes in 1-inch pieces.)

Pour the oil into the big skillet, scatter the garlic slices in the oil, and set over medium-high heat.  Cook for 1 1/2 minutes or so, until the slices are sizzling, then add and toast the peperoncino in a hot spot for another 1/2 minute.

Shake and stir the pan until the garlic slices are light gold and starting to darken.  Immediately pour in the crushed tomatoes and stir in with the garlic.  Rinse out the tomato can and bowl with 1 cup of pasta-cooking water, and dump it into the skillet too.

Raise the heat; sprinkle in the salt and stir.  Push the stalk or sprigs of basil into the sauce until completely covered.  When the sauce is boiling, cover the pan, reduce the heat slightly, and cook for 10 minutes at an actively bubbling simmer.

Uncover the pan and cook another 5 minutes or so.  The sauce should be only slightly reduced from the original volume, still loose and juicy.  Remove the poached basil stalk or sprigs from the skillet and discard (but save the sauce that's clinging to it), and keep at a low simmer until the pasta is ready.

To dress pasta with marinara sauce, toss and cook them together, incorporating the shredded basil.  Remove the skillet from the heat and toss in the cheese just before serving.

This recipe yields 4 cups of sauce, enough to dress 1 pound of pasta.

Comments:  Marinara is my quintessential anytime tomato sauce.  I can start it when the pasta water goes on the stove and it will be ready when the pasta is just cooked.  Yet, in its short cooking time, it develops such fine flavor and pleasing consistency that you may well want to make a double batch, using some right away and freezing the rest for suppers to come.  The beauty of this marinara sauce is that it has a freshness, acidity, and simplicity of taste.

This recipe for marinara includes lots of fresh basil, which I keep in the house at all times, now that it is available in local supermarkets year-round.  I cook a whole basil stalk (or a handful of big sprigs with many leaves attached) submerged in the tomatoes to get all the herb flavor.  Then I remove these and finish the sauce and pasta with fresh shredded leaves, giving it another layer of fresh-basil taste.  (If you are freezing some of the sauce, by the way, you can wait until you're cooking with it to add the fresh-basil garnish.)

This sauce can be your base for cooking any fish fillet, chicken breast, pork filet, or veal scaloppini.  Sear any of these in a pan, add some marinara sauce, season with your favorite herbs, and let it perk for a few minutes, you'll have yourself a good dish.

This sauce is good with dry and fresh pastas and raviolis.  It is wonderful for baked pastas.

                          Twice-Grilled Potatoes

Recipe By     :Jamie Purviance
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Russet potatoes - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- scrubbed, and
                        halved lengthwise
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
                        === STUFFING ===
     3/4           cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  whole milk
     1/2           cup  minced cooked ham
  1 1/2           cups  grated GruyËre cheese -- divided
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Brush or spray the potato halves with vegetable oil.  Grill over Direct Medium heat until tender when pierced with a fork, 30 to 35 minutes, turning three or four times during grilling time.  Remove from the grill and allow to cool slightly.

When cool enough to handle, use a small sharp knife to cut around the cut side of the potato to within 1/4 inch of the skin.  Using a teaspoon or melon baller, scoop out the interior of the potato, leaving a 1/4-inch-thick shell attached to the skin.  Place the potato pulp in a large bowl.  Set the potato shells aside while preparing the stuffing.

To Make The Stuffing:  Using a potato masher or pastry blender, mash the potato pulp.  Add the sour cream and milk and mix well.  Stir in the ham and half of the cheese.  Add the mustard and season with salt and pepper.  Mix well.  Adjust the seasoning with more mustard, if desired.  Divide the stuffing evenly among the skins so the stuffing mounds slightly.  Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the stuffing.

Grill the stuffed potatoes over Direct Medium heat until the cheese is melted and the potatoes are heated through, about 10 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A new take on an old steak-house standard.  This version ups the ante with GruyËre cheese and Dijon mustard.

This recipe requires the direct-cooking method over a medium heat.

          Wild Rice With Mushrooms, Cranberries, And Walnut Oil

Recipe By     :Alfred Portale
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
  1                cup  wild rice
     1/2           cup  whole rolled oats or barley
     1/2           cup  dried cranberries -- coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
                        = (or other neutral oil)
  1 1/2           cups  diced Portobello mushrooms
                        = (or other mushrooms)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  chopped walnuts
  2                     shallots -- peeled, chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1         tablespoon  walnut oil

Bring two pots of salted water to a gentle boil over high heat.  Add the wild rice to one pot, and cook until tender but not mushy, 30 minutes to 1 hour.  After 20 minutes, add the oats to the other pot and cook until tender, approximately 15 minutes.  Check both occasionally as they cook.

Meanwhile, put the cranberries in a small bowl and cover with warm water.  Set aside.

Heat the canola oil in a sautÈ pan set over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and sautÈ until they soften and begin to release their liquid, 8 to 10 minutes.  Season lightly with salt and pepper, and transfer to a serving bowl.

Add the walnuts, shallots, and parsley to the bowl containing the mushrooms.  When the cranberries are soft, drain them and add them to the bowl.  When the oats and wild rice are tender, drain them and add them to the bowl.

When all the ingredients have been added, drizzle the mixture with the walnut oil and toss gently.  Taste, and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.  Serve while still warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Helen makes this dish for Thanksgiving every year.  Though cranberries are in season roughly from October through December ó which is when you are likely to make this ó we prefer dried berries for their concentrated sweetness, so focused that even when they are chopped into small bits, you taste it in every bite.

Try to make this dish with naturally grown, hand-harvested wild rice.  Despite its name, 80 to 90 percent of wild rice is actually commercially cultivated; therefore, it can be laced with pesticides, herbicides, and chemical fertilizer.  It also doesn't compare to the nutty, sweet flavor of the real thing.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  greens, such as chard or kale -- stemmed, and
                        well cleaned
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
     1/4           cup  white wine
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Tear the greens into large pieces.  Heat the olive oil in a large pan and sautÈ the garlic and shallots.  Add the greens and then add the white wine.  Cover.  Cook until tender, stirring so as not to burn the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes.

Add the butter and season with salt and pepper to taste.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  I love sautÈed greens just about any time of the year, lightly coated with olive oil and garlic.  There are such wonderful types of greens available today, it's almost impossible to choose just one.  Add some mustard greens, leftover beet greens, and baby spinach to your mix for a rainbow of flavors.

                      Yankee Bacon And Onion Scones

Recipe By     :James Villas
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     strips lean bacon
  1             medium  onion -- minced
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chilled lard -- cut into bits
  1                cup  buttermilk
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  water

In a skillet, fry the bacon over moderate heat till crisp and drain on paper towels.  Add the onion to the skillet, stir till softened, about 2 minutes, and drain on paper towels.  Crumble the bacon finely.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Grease a large baking sheet and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and pepper, add the lard, and work it in with your fingertips till the mixture is crumbly.  Add the crumbled bacon and onion and stir till well blended.  Add the buttermilk and stir just till a sticky dough forms.

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface, knead 8 to 10 times, and pat into a rectangle 3/4-inch thick.  With a sharp knife, cut the rectangle in half lengthwise, and cut each half crosswise into 6 long narrow triangles.

Arrange the triangles on the prepared baking sheet about 1 inch apart.  In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and water, brush the tops of the triangles lightly with the mixture, and bake in the center of the oven till just golden, 12 to 15 minutes.

This recipe yields about 1 dozen scones.

Comments:  Cut into triangles, these savory, lightly glazed scones have been a staple in New England farmhouses and restaurants since Colonial days and are traditionally served with hearty soups, stews, and roasted meats.  Bacon and onions always make a wonderful combination, but other possibilities are diced cooked ham and green bell pepper, snipped fresh chives and grated Parmesan, and virtually any chopped nuts and fresh herbs.

Comments:  Cut into triangles, these savory, lightly glazed scones have been a staple in New England farmhouses and restaurants since Colonial days and are traditionally served with hearty soups, stews, and roasted meats.  Bacon and onions always make a wonderful combination, but other possibilities are diced cooked ham and green bell pepper, snipped fresh chives and grated Parmesan, and virtually any chopped nuts and fresh herbs.
