                            Asian Glazed Wings

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable or olive oil
  12             whole  chicken wings -- drummers and tips
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  plum sauce
     1/2           cup  orange juice
  2                     inches ginger root -- peeled
  3        tablespoons  tamari (dark soy sauce)
     1/2      teaspoon  red chili flakes - (to 1)
                        = (medium heat to extra spicy
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves

Preheat oven 400 degrees.

Preheat a large oven safe skillet over high heat with the oil.  Liberally season the chicken wings with salt and pepper.  Once the skillet is screaming hot add the wings in 1 even layer.  Brown the wings for 3 minutes per side.

While the wings are browning, assemble the plum glaze: in a small pot over high heat combine the plum sauce, orange juice, ginger root, tamari and hot pepper flakes.  Bring up to a simmer and lower the heat, reserving it until the wings are done browning.  Remove ginger from glaze.  Pour the simmering plum glaze mixture over the browned wings.  Place the skillet in the oven and roast for 20 minutes, flipping the wings once half way through the cooking time.

Remove the wings from the oven, if the glaze is not syrupy and thick, place the skillet of wings on the cook top and turn the heat on high, allow the glaze to reduce for about 1 minute.  Toss the wings around in the glaze and finish with the fresh cilantro and basil.

Serve hot or room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings, 3 wings per person.

Tidbits:  Close that door!  Whenever you are tending to something in the oven, pull it out of the oven completely and close that door while you are doing your business.  Otherwise your oven will have to work double time to get back up to temperature.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  quartered artichoke hearts in water - -- (15 oz), drained
  1                jar  marinated baby mushrooms - (6 oz) -- and their liquid
  1                     shallot -- coarsely chopped
  4             sprigs  fresh tarragon leaves -- stripped, plus
                        a few sprigs to garnish
  3        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        some for drizzling
  16                    baby lamb chops -- cut by butcher
     1/2         pound  baby-cut carrots
     1/2         pound  sugar snap peas
  4                     radishes -- cleaned and trimmed,
                        greens left on, halved lengthwise

Preheat the broiler or grill pan to high.

In a food processor, combine the artichokes, marinated mushrooms, shallot, tarragon, and vinegar.  Season with salt and pepper and turn processor on and stream in about 1/2 cup of extra-virgin olive oil until a spoonable, fairly smooth dip forms, about 1 minute.  Scrape the dip into a serving bowl and place a demitasse (small) spoon in the dip so it can be easy applied to each individual cooked lamb chop.

Drizzle chops with a few teaspoons of extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill or broil 2 minutes on each side and remove to rest.

To serve, place dip on large platter or cutting board and surround with cooked chops and piles of baby cut carrots, sugar snap peas and halved radishes for dipping and topping.  Garnish platter with additional sprigs of tarragon.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Place arugula in a bowl and dress with lemon juice, extra-virgin olive oil and salt.  Divide the arugula among dinner plates or place on a serving platter and mound the greens up.

Thinly slice the artichokes, finely chop rosemary and parsley and slice the caper berries.  Decoratively arrange the artichokes, chopped herbs and capers all over the meat.  Drizzle the completed salad with aged balsamic vinegar and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- finely chopped
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  1                cup  arborio rice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  3               cups  chicken stock - (to 4)
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano cheese - (to 1/3)
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1                cup  tiny frozen peas

Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil and garlic and onion and saute, stirring constantly 2 to 3 minutes then add rice and season with a little salt and pepper.  Cook another minute or so then add wine and let it completely absorb, 30 seconds.  Add about 1 cup chicken stock and stir.  Reduce heat a bit to medium.

When rice is cooked to desired consistency, remove from heat and stir in cheese, parsley and peas and stir to combine and to heat peas through.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1 1/2         pounds  small red skinned potatoes
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 oz)
                        = (or coarsely ground tomatoes)
  1              quart  chicken stock -- plus
  1                cup  chicken stock
                        = (available in quart and 1 cup paper box
                        containers on the soup aisle)
  1              pound  chicken tenders -- diced
  1                     small jar black olive tapenade - (4 oz)
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Crusty bread -- to pass at table

One medium soup pot preheated over medium-high heat.  While soup pot heats, chop carrots into 1/4-inch dice, then add garlic, and stir to coat in extra-virgin olive oil.  Chop and drop in the zucchini, pepper and onion next, 1/2-inch dice.  Season all the veggies with salt and pepper and herbes de Provence.  Cook the veggies together 5 minutes.

While they cook, cut potatoes into thin wedges.  Add wine to vegetables and reduce a minute or so.  Add the tomatoes, cut potatoes and stock to the pot, cover the pot and raise heat to high.  Bring the stoup to a boil, then add cut chicken and simmer 8 to 10 minutes until potatoes are just tender and chicken is cooked through.

Serve stoup in shallow bowls and stir in a rounded spoonful of black olive tapenade at the table.  Top soup with chopped parsley and pass crusty bread at the table for dipping and mopping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A stoup is thicker than soup and thinner than stew and best of all, a one-pot meal!

     3/4         pound  boiled deli ham -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  2        tablespoons  hot sauce
  3        tablespoons  yellow mustard - (to 4)
                        A handful curly or flat-leaf parsley
  8                     deli slices white sharp Cheddar - -- (abt 8 to 10 oz)

In a medium pot over medium-high heat melt butter.  Add bacon and onions, celery and thyme sprigs.  Season with salt, pepper and hot sauce and cook 5 minutes.  Add flour and cook a minute more.

Add half-and-half and stock and bring to a bubble, then stir in potatoes and clams.  Bring soup back to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes, until potatoes are cooked and soup has thickened to coat the back of a spoon.

Heat toaster oven or broiler then toast split English muffins.  While muffins toast, grind ham with paprika, hot sauce, mustard, and parsley in a food processor.  Spread ham on toasted muffins.  Top each muffin half with 2 slices Cheddar and melt cheese in toaster oven or under broiler.

Remove the thyme sprigs from the soup.  The thyme leaves will have fallen off into the soup.  Stir and adjust seasonings in your soup.  Pour soup into mugs.  Serve with deviled ham and cheese mug toppers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === POTATO CRISPS ===
  4              large  fingerling potatoes
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon leaves
                        = (or 2 tspns dried tarragon)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
                        = (or 1 tspn dried chives)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
                        === FISH ===
  1 3/4         pounds  thick cod fillet - (to 2) -- cut 4 portions
                        = (buy thick center cuts of fillet for
                        this dish rather than pieces which
                        include thin ends to fillets)
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
     1/2          pint  grape tomatoes -- whole
                        === BROTH ===
     1/2           cup  flat-leaf parsley
     1/4           cup  mint leaves
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1              small  shallot or 1/2 large shallot -- coarsely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARLIC ===
  4        tablespoons  light in color and weight olive oil or
                        vegetable oil -- for frying
  4                     garlic cloves -- gently cracked from
                        skin and very thinly sliced

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Preheat oven safe skillet over high heat or wrap rubber handles in double layers of foil to protect the surface in the oven.

Prick the potatoes 3 or 4 times each with a fork and cook them in the microwave on high for 5 minutes.

Pat cod dry and squeeze a little lemon juice over it and season with salt.  Drizzle fish with extra-virgin olive oil.

When potatoes cool just enough to handle, slice them into 1/4-inch pieces lengthwise.  Coat them with extra-virgin olive oil and salt and pepper.  Arrange them on a cookie sheet in a single layer and roast them for 20 minutes.  Do not move them or turn them as they cook.  Chop tarragon, chives and parsley and combine and reserve.

Add cod seasoned-side down to very hot skillet.  Sear it 2 minutes, then drizzle the tomatoes with extra-virgin olive oil and season them with salt and pepper and add them to the fish.  Sear tomatoes 1 minute, then transfer the pan to the oven and roast the fish and tomatoes 8 minutes until fish if firm and opaque and tomatoes have all burst.

Place parsley, mint, chicken stock and shallot in food processor or blender and puree.  Transfer to small sauce pot and bring to a simmer.  Season the broth with salt and pepper, to your taste.

Heat the light frying oil in small skillet over medium heat.  Add sliced garlic to the hot oil and let it fry until crisp and golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain garlic chips on a paper towel and reserve.

When the potatoes are very brown and crisp on the bottom side and tender on the top side, remove.  Coat sliced potatoes liberally with the chopped herbs.

Pour warm pesto broth onto each dinner plate.

Remove the fish from the oven.  The bottom should be crisp and brown.  Turn the fish over to place the crispy side up in pools of parsley-mint broth.  Arrange the herb potato slices and tomatoes decoratively around the fish.  Top the dish off with a scattering of garlic crisps and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This meal turns my kitchen into a country-cosmo-bistro. This is a great date meal to make for any special someone in your life and it easily adjusts from four servings down to just the two or you!  (You could get $40 a head for this plate!  Nice!)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  chicken cutlets
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour - (to 4)
  1                cup  Italian bread crumbs
     1/3           cup  grated Parmigiano - (to 1/2)
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2          teaspoons  poultry seasoning
  1                     garlic clove
  1                jar  pine nuts - (3 oz)
  1                     lemon -- zested
  2                     eggs -- beaten
                        Olive oil -- for shallow frying
                        === BASIL-PARSLEY SAUCE ===
  1                cup  loosely packed basil leaves
     1/2           cup  parsley leaves - (loosely packed)
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     Roma or plum tomato -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped, for garnish

Season the cutlets with salt and pepper on both sides turn lightly in flour.

Combine next 7 ingredients in food processor and pulse-process the crumbs to chop the spices, garlic and nuts and evenly distribute the flavors throughout the crumb and cheese mixture.  Transfer the mixture to a plate.  Beat eggs in a separate shallow dish.

Heat a thin layer of oil in a large skillet, just enough to coat the bottom of the pan, over medium to medium-high heat.  Coat the cutlets in eggs then breading and add to the hot oil.  Cook cutlets in a single layer, in 2 batches if necessary, about 3 or 4 minutes on each side, until cutlets' juices run clear and breading is evenly browned.

Return food processor bowl to base and add basil, parsley and lemon juice.  Add a little salt and pepper.  Turn processor on and stream in oil until a loose paste forms.

Serve chicken cutlets with a generous amount of basil and parsley sauce poured over the cutlets.  Garnish the chicken with finely chopped Roma tomato.  Serve Cheesy Risi E Bisi (see recipe) alongside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ANCHOVY Sauce===
  2                     tins flat filet anchovies -- lightly drained
  1         tablespoon  small capers in brine
  2        tablespoons  caper brine
  1                     garlic clove -- cracked from skin
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === BLACK OLIVE AND PARMIGIANO Sauce ===
     1/2           cup  pitted small black olives
                        = (such as Nicoise, kalamata may also be
                        used)
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
                        = (or 2 tbspns fresh thyme leaves)
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano
                        == GARDEN TOMATO AND GREEN ONION Sauce ==
  2                     plum tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
  2                     scallions, whites and tops -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        === CRUDITE ===
  2              large  eggs
  1                     seedless cucumber -- halved across,
                        then quartered lengthwise
  1               head  celery -- trimmed, separated,
                        wiped clean, and ribs left whole
  4                     scallions -- whole, cleaned,
                        and roots trimmed
  4              large  radishes -- cleaned, but
                        left whole with greens in tact
  4                     baby zucchini -- washed
  4              small  carrots -- peeled, left whole
  2                     vine ripe tomatoes

Anchovy Sauce:  Place anchovies, capers, caper brine, and garlic in food processor or blender and turn the machine on.  Stream in the olive oil and form a thick dressing.  Scrape the dressing into a small serving cup or bowl and return the processor bowl or the blender to its base.

Black Olive and Parmigiano Sauce:  Place the black olives, vinegar, and thyme in processor or blender.  Turn machine on and stream in the olive oil.  When dressing forms, stop machine and add cheese.  Pulse-process cheese into dressing then transfer dressing into a second cup or small bowl.

Garden Tomato and Green Onion Sauce:  In a small mixing bowl, combine tomatoes, scallions, and parsley.  Drizzle the raw sauce with the olive oil and season it with salt and pepper, to your taste.

Crudite:  Place the in a small pot.  Cover eggs with water and bring water to a boil.  Cover pot and remove from heat.  Let eggs stand 10 minutes.

Drain eggs and crack shells by rattling cooked eggs inside empty covered pot.  Peel and cool eggs under cold running water.

I recommend serving this in a 6- or 7-inch plain terra cotta flower pot: it looks awesome, you can use it every time you serve this crudite and it'll only cost you a few bucks at any garden shop.

Arrange the vegetables in the flower pot, building high and stuffing the pot tightly.  Nest whole eggs and whole tomatoes among the vegetables.  Serve your vegetable masterpiece with sauces to pass at table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Anchovy Sauce:  Place anchovies, capers, caper brine, and garlic in food processor or blender and turn the machine on.  Stream in the olive oil and form a thick dressing.  Scrape the dressing into a small serving cup or bowl and return the processor bowl or the blender to its base.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Black Olive and Parmigiano Sauce:  Place the black olives, vinegar, and thyme in processor or blender.  Turn machine on and stream in the olive oil.  When dressing forms, stop machine and add cheese.  Pulse-process cheese into dressing then transfer dressing into a second cup or small bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Garden Tomato and Green Onion Sauce:  In a small mixing bowl, combine tomatoes, scallions, and parsley.  Drizzle the raw sauce with the olive oil and season it with salt and pepper, to your taste.

<DirT>
Crudite:  Place the in a small pot.  Cover eggs with water and bring water to a boil.  Cover pot and remove from heat.  Let eggs stand 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain eggs and crack shells by rattling cooked eggs inside empty covered pot.  Peel and cool eggs under cold running water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
I recommend serving this in a 6- or 7-inch plain terra cotta flower pot: it looks awesome, you can use it every time you serve this crudite and it&apos;ll only cost you a few bucks at any garden shop.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the vegetables in the flower pot, building high and stuffing the pot tightly.  Nest whole eggs and whole tomatoes among the vegetables.  Serve your vegetable masterpiece with sauces to pass at table.

           Danish Burgers With Herb Caper Sauce And A Mod Salad

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  ground chicken
  1         tablespoon  poultry seasoning
  2                     shallots -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  5                     button mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        finely chopped
     1/4         pound  Havarti with dill cheese -- cut 1/4" dice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling, plus
                        a couple tbspns extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  sour cream
  3        tablespoons  chopped or snipped fresh dill - (to 4)
  3        tablespoons  capers - (to 4) -- drained
                        = (run your knife through them once)
  1                     seedless cucumber -- halved lengthwise,
                        then sliced into half moons
  1              small  red onion -- peeled, sliced
  3                     plum tomatoes -- seeded, sliced thin
  1              pound  washed baby spinach
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar - (to 3)
  4                     crusty poppy seed rolls
                        = (or other burger buns of choice)
  2              large  radishes -- thinly sliced
  1                     sack gourmet potato chips
                        = (such as Terra Chips Onion and Herb
                        Yukon Gold or Blue Potato chips)

Combine ground chicken, poultry seasoning, chopped shallots, Dijon mustard, chopped mushroom, diced Havarti, salt and pepper, and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.  Mix thoroughly.  Score the meat with your hand marking 4 equal portions.  Form each portion into large 1-inch thick patties.

Preheat a non stick skillet over medium-high heat.  Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil over the patties and place them in the hot skillet.  Cook 6 minutes per side until the patties are firm to the touch and cooked through.

While the burgers are cooking prepare the herb caper sauce and mod salad.  In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, chopped dill and capers then season with salt and pepper.

In a salad bowl combine the cucumbers, half of the red onion, plum tomatoes and 3/4 sack of baby spinach.  Dress the salad with white wine vinegar, salt and pepper then drizzle with a couple tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil to coat the salad lightly and evenly.  Toss to combine and adjust salt and pepper, to your taste.

Split the rolls or buns.  Place the burgers on the bun bottoms.  Top with sliced radishes, baby spinach and a heaping spoonful of herb-caper dressing slathered across the bun tops.  Add remaining sauce into the salad and combine to give your salad a creamy finish.  Fancy chips finish the plate.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The colder the semi-soft Havarti with dill cheese is the easier it will be to dice it.  Pop the cheese in the freezer while you prep everything else.  Because of the fat content of the cheese, just 10 minutes in a deep freeze makes the dicing a real breeze!

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sack frozen tater tots -- any brand
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  dried rosemary
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper flakes
                        === GREEN SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  baby spinach or arugula
     1/2           cup  fresh basil - (abt 10 to 12 leaves)
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts (pignoli)
  1              small  garlic clove -- cracked from skin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     rounded spoonfuls grated Parmigiano or
                        Romano cheese
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === EGGS AND HAM ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2         pound  breakfast ham -- chopped
  8              large  eggs
                        A splash half-and-half or milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Open tots and pour 4 portions onto a nonstick cookie sheet.  Sprinkle the tots with salt and dried seasonings and toss them around a bit to get the herbs to stick to the tots ó as the frost starts to melt the flavorings will set into place.  Bake the tots until crisp, about 12 minutes.

Combine ingredients for green sauce in food processor and process until sauce forms; you are making a pesto sauce for the eggs.  Set pesto aside and reserve.

Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil and butter to pan, then add the chopped ham and cook to lightly brown at edges, 3 minutes or so.

Remove the tots from the oven and switch the broiler on to toast your bread.

Beat eggs and splash of half-and-half or milk with salt and pepper.  Add eggs to the ham in the skillet and scramble them up with the ham to desired doneness and remove from heat.

Toast bread under hot broiler, 30 seconds on each side.  Rub with cracked garlic then spread with butter and top with a sprinkle of Parmesan, the diced mozzarella and ground black pepper.

In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the tomato sauce, oregano, crushed red pepper, and the garlic clove from the toast.  Cover with plastic wrap and heat for 2 minutes.  Serve as dipping sauce for the tots.

Stir the pesto into the ham and eggs, making them "green", and serve with garlic-cheese toast on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  deli sliced Swiss cheese -- finely chopped
  6             slices  Canadian bacon -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  snipped or chopped chives
                        A few grinds black pepper
  8                     eggs
                        = (or 1 pint egg beaters)
  2        tablespoons  melted butter

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Mix together the chopped cheese, Canadian bacon, and chives and season with a few grinds of pepper.  In a bowl, beat the eggs.

Brush the muffin tins with melted butter.  Using a teaspoon, fill the 24 mini-muffin cups halfway with the cheese mixture.  Using a ladle, fill the cups to just below the edge with the beaten eggs.

Bake until golden, about 12 minutes.  Remove and let cool to handle, then arrange the egg bites on a plate and serve.

This recipe yields 24 pieces.

Comments:  You must use 2 mini-muffin tins with 2-inch cups to make these easy party bites.  These tins can be found on the baking aisle in larger markets or at many discount stores.  Most hold 12 mini-muffins per tin, some hold 24.  This recipe will make 24 pieces.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  grill seasoning blend
                        = (McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning
                        recommended brand)
     1/4           cup  Tamari dark soy
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2          teaspoons  hot red pepper flakes -- divided
  4              large  garlic cloves -- chopped, divided
  2          teaspoons  toasted (dark) sesame oil
  2                     scallions -- finely chopped
                        Vegetable oil -- for drizzling plus
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2             pounds  flank steak
  1              pound  bok choy or Napa cabbage -- trimmed, and
                        shredded with a knife
     1/2                red bell pepper -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  sauerkraut
                        = (it will taste like kim chee when
                        combined with hot pepper flakes)

In a shallow dish, combine grill seasoning, dark soy, a tablespoon honey, 1 teaspoon of the hot pepper flakes, half of the chopped garlic, sesame oil, scallions and a drizzle of vegetable oil.  Coat the flank steak in the mixture and let it stand 10 minutes.

Preheat indoor electric grill, stove top grill pan or outdoor grill to medium-high.  When the grill pan or grill is screaming hot, add meat and cook 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare, 7 to 8 minutes on each side for medium-well doneness.

Heat a large skillet over high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, cabbage and peppers.  Season with salt and stir fry 2 or 3 minutes.  Add a drizzle of honey, about 1 tablespoon, hot pepper flakes and garlic and toss to combine with cabbage.  Add sauerkraut and mix in, heating it through 1 minute.  Turn off heat.

To serve, let meat rest 5 minutes for juices to redistribute.  Thinly slice the meat on a heavy angle against the grain (the lines in the meat).  Pile the slaw up and top with sliced Korean steak and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

            Lemon, Garlic, And Cilantro Baked Stuffed Tomatoes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     beefsteak tomatoes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  whole milk ricotta cheese
  1              large  lemon -- zested
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
     3/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2                     scallions -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1                     egg yolk
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling

Preheat oven 450 degrees.

For the baked stuffed tomatoes you need to make 4 tomato cups out of your 2 tomatoes.  To do so, cut a very thin slice off both ends of each of the 2 tomatoes, this is to create 4 flat bottoms.  Then cut each tomato in half across its circumference.  You should have 4 cup shapes, using the thinly sliced side as the bottom of the cups.

To create a cavity, use a melon ball scoop to remove the seeds and pulp from the wide, fleshy side of each tomato cup.  You don't have to be too fussy about this.  You are just trying to create enough room to hold the filling.  When scooping take some care not to puncture through the bottoms of the cups.  If you do puncture it, don't worry, it is not the end of the world, just keep moving forward.  Season the inside of the tomato cavities with salt and pepper.  Reserve the seasoned tomato cups while you make the filling.

In a small mixing bowl combine the ricotta cheese, lemon zest, cilantro, parsley, garlic, scallions, Parmigiano and season with salt and pepper.  Taste the mixture.  This is your last chance to adjust the seasoning.  Once you're happy with the flavor, add the egg yolk and mix thoroughly.

Divide the filling between the 4 tomato cup cavities, pushing it into the cavity with a rubber spatula or spoon.  Drizzle some extra-virgin olive oil into a baking dish.  Arrange your stuffed tomatoes in the dish, transfer to the hot oven, and bake for 15 to 17 minutes.  The stuffing and the tomatoes should be fully cooked and the top should be lightly brown.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  cauliflower head -- cut into florets
  3               cups  chicken stock
  4        tablespoons  butter -- cut into pieces
  1                cup  shredded white extra-sharp Vermont Cheddar
                        = (Cabot brand recommended)
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        A generous grating nutmeg
  1 1/2         pounds  shoulder London broil steak, 1 1/2" thick
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil or olive oil
     1/2         pound  ham -- chopped
  6               cups  chopped red chard - (1 large bundle)
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1                     shallot -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  beef broth
     1/4           cup  steak sauce
                        = (A1 or Lea and Perrin's brands
                        recommended)

Place cauliflower in a medium shallow pot or pan.  Add stock, cover and place pot over high heat.  When liquid boils, reduce heat to simmer and cook covered 10 minutes.  Remove cover, raise heat to medium-high and allow the broth to reduce by half, 2 minutes.  Add 2 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces and the cheeses and smash the cauliflower with a masher to the same consistency as desired for mashed potatoes.  Season the cauliflower with black pepper, a pinch of salt and nutmeg.

Turn broiler on.  Brush meat with Worcestershire and season with salt and pepper.  Cook London broil on top rack for 6 minutes on each side, for medium-rare to medium doneness.

While steak and cauliflower cook, heat a second large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add oil, 2 turns of the pan, and ham.  Sear ham and caramelize at edges, 2 minutes.

Add chard and wilt the greens into the pan then season with salt, pepper and a dash of nutmeg, optional.  Cook 5 to 7 minutes more, turning frequently with tongs then add vinegar to the pan and a drizzle of honey.  Turn to coat the greens, adjust seasoning and transfer to a serving dish.

Remove meat from broiler and let it rest 5 minutes.

Place a small skillet over medium heat.  Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter, add finely chopped shallot, cook 2 minutes, then whisk in flour and cook 1 minute.  Add 2 cups beef broth to the pan and bring to a bubble.  Reduce the broth 2 minutes then add 1/4 cup steak sauce and black pepper, to taste.

Very thinly slice the meat on an angle against the grain (the lines in the meat).  The degree to which you can thinly slice the meat will determine how tender it is to cut and chew, so make sure the carving knife is sharp ó the thinner the better!

Serve sliced London broil with steak sauce gravy all over it and smashed cauliflower and red chard with ham piled up alongside the meat.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  3        tablespoons  pine nuts -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmigiano or Romano cheese
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1                cup  arugula leaves or baby spinach
  6             slices  prosciutto di Parma
  6             slices  deli-sliced provolone
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
     1/2         pound  cavatappi or rigatoni
  1              pound  broccolini -- trimmed to florets
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  ricotta cheese
  2          teaspoons  lemon zest
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  12                    grape or small vine tomatoes -- halved

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Put water on to boil for your pasta.

Mix meat and next 10 ingredients as if you were making meatloaf.  Flatten meat out on a waxed paper lined cookie sheet into a thin layer: 1/2-inch thick, 12 inches long by 6 to 8 inches wide.  Cover meat with arugula or spinach, prosciutto and cheese then roll the meat, using the waxed paper to help roll up into a large log, working across the 6- to 8-inch side, resulting in a 12-inch long log.  Drizzle the log with extra-virgin olive oil to coat lightly.

Roast meatroll 20 minutes.  Cut into 1-inch slices, 3 pieces per portion, and serve.  Make pasta while meat is in the oven.

Salt water and cook off pasta, about 7 to 8 minutes to al dente, with a bite to it.  Drain and return pasta to hot pot.

While pasta cooks, place broccolini in 1-inch of water in a sauce pot and bring up to a boil.  Add salt to the water and add the trimmed broccolini.  Cover and cook 5 minutes, drain and reserve.

To hot, cooked pasta add a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, butter, ricotta, lemon zest, thyme, broccolini and season with salt and pepper.  Toss pasta to coat it in the cheese and butter.  Season it with salt, to your taste.  Portion pasta onto dinner plates alongside meat roll slices and top pasta with tomatoes and freshly ground pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1              large  egg -- beaten with
                        A splash of milk
  1                cup  plain bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  grill seasoning
                        = (Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick
                        recommended)
  1                cup  smoky barbecue sauce
     1/2           cup  tomato salsa
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce

Put ground beef into a big bowl.  Put onion and celery into a food processor.  Cut the bell pepper in half, rip out the seeds and throw them into your garbage bowl.

Brush a 12-muffin tin (1/2-cup each) with vegetable oil or extra-virgin olive oil.  Use an ice cream scoop to help you fill meat into a each tin.  Top each meat loaf with a spoonful of extra sauce.  Bake about 20 minutes.  Cut open 1 muffin to test that the middle is cooked through.  While meatloaf muffins bake, make green beans in the microwave.  Serve meatloaf with Smashed Potatoes and Cream Cheese on the side, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     store-bought pizza dough
                        = (or from your favorite pizza shop)

  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped rosemary leaves
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  ground sirloin
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves - (to 6) -- finely chopped
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                can  tomato paste - (6 oz)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        A handful flat-leaf parsley -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     3/4         pound  fresh mozzarella or brick mozzarella -- sliced or grated

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

On a round pizza stone or pan or on a rectangular baking sheet, using flour or cornmeal to dust the dough, spread out the dough to form your crust.  If you are using a baking sheet, drizzle pan with extra-virgin olive oil then set crust in place.  Poke the pizza dough in several areas with the tines of a fork.  Drizzle the dough with extra-virgin olive oil then season it with finely chopped rosemary and a little salt.  Place in oven 10 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, then the meat.  Brown and crumble meat a couple of minutes, then add onions and garlic.  Season the meat with salt and pepper then work in the tomato paste using the back of a wooden spoon to combine.  Stir in the cheese, parsley and oregano.

Remove pizza crust from oven and top with meat.  Arrange cheese over the pizza, working to edges.  Return the pizza to the oven and bake until cheese is golden, another 10 to 12 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  old-fashioned oats
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4           cup  chopped walnuts - (2 oz)
     3/4           cup  sour cream
     3/4           cup  whole milk
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2                     really ripe bananas -- mashed up
     3/4           cup  raisins
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted, plus
                        additional for buttering skillet
                        Maple syrup or honey -- for drizzling

Mix dry ingredients, the first 7, in a bowl.  In a another bowl, mix the wet ingredients, the next 4.  Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry until just combined, then fold in the mashed up bananas and the raisins.  Stir in the melted butter.

Heat a griddle over medium heat and brush with additional melted butter.  Cook pancakes, each about 1/3 cup, until bubbles form on the top, then turn.  Cakes will cook in about 2 minutes on each side.

Keep pancakes tented with foil as they come off the griddle to keep them hot.  Serve with drizzled honey or maple syrup over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings, about 12 cakes.

Comments:  If you cannot find really ripe bananas, just nuke them in the microwave for about 15 seconds and they will become super soft for mashing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     box chopped spinach - (10 oz)
  1                     loaf ciabatta bread
                        = (flat, rectangular or oval shaped
                        Italian bread, 12" to 14" long and 8"
                        wide ñ substitute focaccia loaf if
                        ciabatta is not available to you)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
  2               cups  ricotta cheese
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano or Reggiano
  1                can  artichokes -- drained, sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  shredded mozzarella
                        = (or Italian cheese blend)
                        Simple Marinara Dipping Sauce -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Defrost spinach 6 minutes on high and wring the spinach dry in a kitchen towel.

Crust bread in oven for 5 or 6 minutes.  Remove and split bread in half from end to end as if it were a large sandwich roll.

Turn broiler on.  If your broiler is too small to place ciabatta breads under it, you can melt the cheese in oven as well, see below, it simply browns faster under broiler.

Drizzle hot bread with extra-virgin olive oil.  Mix ricotta, garlic, parsley and grated cheese.  Spread the mixture evenly over the bread halves then dot with the defrosted chopped spinach.  Evenly distribute the sliced artichokes, season the breads with salt and pepper and top with an even layer mozzarella cheese.

Melt and brown the cheese under the broiler 3 minutes, 1 rack down from the top of the oven.  If you are using the oven rather than broiler, the cheese will take 6 or 7 minutes to brown.

Cut into bread into wedges and serve.  If desired, serve with Simple Marinara Dipping Sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

<DirT>
Defrost spinach 6 minutes on high and wring the spinach dry in a kitchen towel.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Crust bread in oven for 5 or 6 minutes.  Remove and split bread in half from end to end as if it were a large sandwich roll.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn broiler on.  If your broiler is too small to place ciabatta breads under it, you can melt the cheese in oven as well, see below, it simply browns faster under broiler.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drizzle hot bread with extra-virgin olive oil.  Mix ricotta, garlic, parsley and grated cheese.  Spread the mixture evenly over the bread halves then dot with the defrosted chopped spinach.  Evenly distribute the sliced artichokes, season the breads with salt and pepper and top with an even layer mozzarella cheese.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt and brown the cheese under the broiler 3 minutes, 1 rack down from the top of the oven.  If you are using the oven rather than broiler, the cheese will take 6 or 7 minutes to brown.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut into bread into wedges and serve.  If desired, serve with Simple Marinara Dipping Sauce.

                          Panini-Stacked Sticks

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     round crusty rolls
                        = (plain Kaisers will do if your store
                        offers no others)
     3/4         pound  provolone -- sliced
     1/2         pound  prosciutto di Parma
  1                cup  arugula
  8                     hot peperoncini peppers
                        = (or 8 large pitted green olives)
                        Twelve-inch bamboo skewers

To make the sandwich, split rolls and cover with provolone.  Top with a few pieces of arugula and 2 or 3 thin slices of ham, set the top in place and press down.  Cut sandwiches into 8 small cubes or grill to toast the roll, then cut.  Stack 8 pieces or 1 panini on each stick, threading 2 hot peppers or 2 jumbo olives in among the panini pieces as you work.  Repeat to make 4 (12-inch) panini-stacked sticks.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In Italy, my favorite panini (sandwich) is made with ham (prosciutto di Parma) cheese (robiola) and arugula (rucola or rocket lettuce).  You can eat it cold, or press it and grill it on a sandwich press or in a skillet.  If you want to press it, put a heavy skillet on top of the sandwich as it cooks on a griddle or in a nonstick pan over medium heat.  Cook just a minute or so on each side to crisp the roll and slightly warm the filling.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Golden Delicious apples -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
  2             ounces  golden raisins
  1              piece  fresh ginger root - (abt 1")
  3        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  2               cups  all natural apple juice or cider -- plus
                        a splash for pan sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil or olive oil
  4                     center-cut 1"-thk boneless
                        pork loin chops - (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter

Combine first 8 ingredients in a medium pot placed over medium-high heat and cook until a chunky sauce forms, 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally.  If sauce begins to spatter as it bubbles, reduce heat back a little, but it should be allowed to reduce and form quickly.  Once apples are soft and sauce forms, remove it from the heat.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add oil to the pan.  Season chops on 1 side with salt and pepper.  Using a pair of tongs, add chops to hot skillet seasoned-side down.  Season the opposite side of the chops with salt and pepper.  Brown and caramelize the chops 2 minutes on each side, then reduce heat to medium and cook another 5 to 6 minutes, turning occasionally, until juices run clear.  Remove chops from heat and let them rest a couple of minutes for juice to redistribute.

Deglaze the pan with a splash of apple juice and 2 tablespoons of butter.  Pour pan sauce over chops.  Remove ginger from the apple sauce and top chops with generous portions of warm golden apple sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        on an angle across the center
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for brushing
  2                     dried figs -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  balsamic vinegar

Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat.

Season the quartered pieces endive and readicchio with salt and pepper.  Wrap each section with a half slice of ham.  Brush the wrapped sections with extra-virgin olive oil and grill 7 to 8 minutes, turning every couple of minutes, until ham is crispy and lettuce sections are tender.

Place figs and vinegar in a pot and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer.  Reduce the vinegar down to a few tablespoons, until the fig pieces are soft and vinegar is thick, 5 to 7 minutes.

Arrange the lettuce on individual plates or a serving dish and spoon the fig and balsamic reduction over the lettuce, drizzling back and forth over the plate.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 2") -- peeled, and
                        grated or minced
  1              small  jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
                        = (or white wine vinegar)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- divided
  10                    radishes -- thinly sliced
  1                     seedless or English cucumber -- thinly sliced
  1                     yellow pepper -- seeded, quartered,
                        and cut into thin strips
     1/4           cup  sliced almonds - (2-oz pouch)
  1                cup  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
  2            pinches  ground cinnamon
  1                cup  couscous
  4             pieces  s skin-on red snapper fillet - (8 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  sesame seeds -- un-toasted
  1              bunch  watercress -- thick stems trimmed
  1                cup  roughly-chopped fresh basil - -- (abt 20 leaves)
  2                     scallions -- chopped

In a salad bowl, combine the ginger, jalapeÒo, vinegar, salt and pepper.  In a slow steady steam, whisk in 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil.  Add the radish, cucumber, yellow pepper and toss to coat.  Let the veggies sit and marinate at room temperature while you prepare the sesame crusted snapper.

Place a medium saucepan on the stove.  Add the sliced almonds and toast over moderate heat then remove from pan and reserve.  Return pan to stove top and add 2 cups chicken broth, a tablespoon of vegetable oil ó just eyeball it, curry powder and cinnamon.  Raise heat and bring broth up to a boil.  When it boils, add couscous to the pot and stir to combine.  Cover the pot and turn off the heat and let the couscous stand until ready to serve.

With a sharp paring knife, score the skin side of the snapper fillets by slashing three, 1/8-inch thick cuts across the width of the fish.  Season both sides of the fish with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle and then gently press the sesame seeds onto both sides of the fish.

Heat a nonstick large skillet over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, 2 turns of the pan.  Once the pan is hot, add the seasoned fish to the skillet skin-side down.  Saute the snapper for 4 minutes and if you find that the fillets bubble up in the center section, carefully press each fillet down with a fish spatula.  Flip the fillets and continue to cook on the second side for 3 minutes or until the fish is cooked through and opaque.  While the fish is cooking on the second side, finish off the ginger dressed snappy veggies and prepare the couscous.

To the marinating vegetables, add the watercress and basil.  Toss to combine.

Remove the lid on the couscous.  Add scallions and toasted almonds and fluff couscous with a fork.

To serve, distribute the snappy veggies between 4 plates and top with the sesame crusted snapper; serve the couscous alongside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a salad bowl, combine the ginger, jalapeÒo, vinegar, salt and pepper.  In a slow steady steam, whisk in 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil.  Add the radish, cucumber, yellow pepper and toss to coat.  Let the veggies sit and marinate at room temperature while you prepare the sesame crusted snapper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a medium saucepan on the stove.  Add the sliced almonds and toast over moderate heat then remove from pan and reserve.  Return pan to stove top and add 2 cups chicken broth, a tablespoon of vegetable oil ó just eyeball it, curry powder and cinnamon.  Raise heat and bring broth up to a boil.  When it boils, add couscous to the pot and stir to combine.  Cover the pot and turn off the heat and let the couscous stand until ready to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With a sharp paring knife, score the skin side of the snapper fillets by slashing three, 1/8-inch thick cuts across the width of the fish.  Season both sides of the fish with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle and then gently press the sesame seeds onto both sides of the fish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a nonstick large skillet over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, 2 turns of the pan.  Once the pan is hot, add the seasoned fish to the skillet skin-side down.  Saute the snapper for 4 minutes and if you find that the fillets bubble up in the center section, carefully press each fillet down with a fish spatula.  Flip the fillets and continue to cook on the second side for 3 minutes or until the fish is cooked through and opaque.  While the fish is cooking on the second side, finish off the ginger dressed snappy veggies and prepare the couscous.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To the marinating vegetables, add the watercress and basil.  Toss to combine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the lid on the couscous.  Add scallions and toasted almonds and fluff couscous with a fork.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, distribute the snappy veggies between 4 plates and top with the sesame crusted snapper; serve the couscous alongside.

  1             medium  onion -- peeled, chopped fine
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  hot sauce
                        = (Tabasco recommended)

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatballs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     scallions, green and white parts -- coarsely chopped
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 2") -- peeled
  1                     serrano or jalapeÒo chili pepper -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped, divided
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
     1/2           cup  tamari (dark soy) -- plus
  3        tablespoons  tamari (dark soy)
     1/4           cup  fresh cilantro leaves
  2                     limes -- zest and juice
     1/2         pound  medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        tails removed
  1              pound  ground pork
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  dark sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  honey
  3        tablespoons  water
                        Toothpicks -- as needed

In the bowl of a food processor combine the scallions, half of the ginger ó grated or minced, half of the chopped chile pepper, garlic, 3 tablespoons tamari, cilantro and the lime zest.  Pulse for 30 seconds, scrape down the bowl and then continue to process 1 minute or until finely ground.

Add the shrimp and pork, process until the shrimp are ground into small pieces and the mixture is well combined but not so fine that it becomes a paste, about 1 minute.  Roll the shrimp and pork mixture into to 24 balls, about the size of a large walnut.  If you dip your hands in water before rolling the mixture the rolling goes a little easier.

Preheat a large nonstick skillet with 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium heat.  Add the balls and don't move them until they are brown on 1 side, about 2 minutes.  Turn the balls and continue to cook, browning on all sides until cooked through, about 4 minutes.

While the balls are cooking make the spicy lime dipping sauce: in a bowl combine the remaining ginger, chili pepper, 1/2 cup tamari, lime juice, toasted sesame oil, honey and 3 tablespoons (a splash) of water.  Taste and adjust the seasoning, if you find it to be too salty, add another drizzle of honey.

Platter the shrimp and pork balls with a bowl of the spicy lime dipping sauce and toothpicks.

This recipe yields 24 balls, up to 4 servings, 6 balls each.

       Shrimp Or Chicken Lettuce Wraps With Creamy Caesar Dressing

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray

Categories    : Main Dish                       Wraps

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     romaine lettuce hearts
  1              pound  jumbo fully-cooked shrimp
  1                     rotisserie chicken
  4        tablespoons  reduced fat mayonnaise - (heaping)
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed
  1                     lemon -- zested, juiced
  2        tablespoons  anchovy paste -- optional
                        = (but it tastes better with it in.  If
                        you think you don't like anchovies, try
                        them in this sauce.  They just taste
                        salty and yummy!)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Cut bottoms off the romaine and cut the heads in half lengthwise.  Wash lettuce and separate the leaves.  Let it dry in the dish draining rack while you prepare the rest of the menu.

Remove the tails from the shrimp and place the shrimp in a bowl or, pack for travel, if this is a picnic meal.

To remove the chicken meat from the chicken, cut the chicken breasts off first.  Cut the legs and thighs off using kitchen scissors to help you.  Slice the meat up on an angle.  Arrange on a plate or in a plastic container.

Place mayonnaise, garlic, lemon, anchovy paste, cheese, Worcestershire and pepper into the blender and turn it on.  Stream the extra-virgin olive oil into the dressing through center of the lid.  When the oil is combined, remove the thick dressing with a spatula to a bowl or a portable plastic container.

Place lettuce on a serving platter or pack in large plastic bag or container to travel.

To assemble, spread dressing onto a lettuce leaf.  Fill leaf with a large shrimp or sliced cold chicken, like a lettuce taco, and eat!

To pack for picnic, take the romaine hearts in plastic food storage bags.  Pack the shrimp and cut chicken in separate bags and pack dressing in small plastic container.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe requires no cooking and is served cold, so it makes a perfect picnic in the hot summer months as well!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     carrot -- peeled, and
                        chopped into a small dice

  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  3               cups  tomato sauce
  3               cups  chicken stock
  1              pound  ground beef, pork and veal mix
                        = (meatloaf mix)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano or Romano cheese -- plus
                        more to pass at table
     1/2           cup  Italian bread crumbs
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley leaves
     1/2         pound  spaghetti -- broken in half
  1                cup  basil leaves -- torn or shredded
  1                     loaf Italian crusty bread -- for dunking

Preheat a medium soup pot over medium heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, carrots, onions, celery, garlic and saute 5 minutes.  Add tomato sauce and stock and cover pot.  Turn up heat and bring to a fast boil.

While soup comes to a boil, mix the ground meat with cheese, bread crumbs, egg and parsley.  Roll into 1 1/2 to 2-inch balls.

Remove lid from soup and slide balls into soup.  Bring back to a boil then stir in spaghetti.  Reduce the heat and simmer soup 10 minutes more, until pasta is tender and balls have cooked through.  Stir in basil and remove "stoup" from the stove.  Serve soup with bread and cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Stoup, thicker than soup, thinner than stew.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     lamb rib chops
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  sweet paprika
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     green bell peppers -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  1              large  yellow onion -- cut into 1" pieces
  1                cup  grape tomatoes
     1/2           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
  1 1/2           cups  couscous
  1                     Handful golden raisins
  3        tablespoons  finely chopped fresh mint - -- (5 or 6 sprigs)
  3        tablespoons  pine nuts -- toasted

Cover the chops with wax paper or plastic and whack each chop with the heel of your palm to flatten it out.  Season chops with salt and pepper on both sides.  Combine cumin, coriander and paprika and sprinkle the mixture evenly over chops.  Pat the spices in place and wash up.  Let chops stand 15 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 turns of the pan.  Add peppers and onions.  Season the vegetables with salt and pepper and cook together 5 minutes, then add grape tomatoes and continue to cook until skins begin to burst on tomatoes.  Add half the flat leaf parsley to the skillet and toss.  Transfer vegetables to a platter and cover with loose foil to hold heat.

Place a tablespoon of oil in a small saucepan for couscous, just eyeball the amount.  Heat oil over medium heat and add garlic.  Sautee garlic 1 minute then add chicken stock and bring it up to a boil.  Add couscous and cover the pot.  Let stand for 5 minutes.  Over medium-low heat toast the pinenuts in a small pan until they begin to give off their aroma, stirring them frequently to prevent them from burning.

Return skillet to stove and add another tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, a turn of the pan.  Add lamb chops to skillet and sear 2 to 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare, cook 4 minutes on each side for medium-well chops.  Place chops on top of the peppers and onions.

Fluff couscous with a fork and stir in the raisins, mint, remaining parsley and the pine nuts.  Pass couscous at table.  It makes a nice bed for the veggies and lamb to catch all the juices.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        = (plain or sour dough flavor)
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise or reduced fat mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  chili sauce, salsa or taco sauce
                        Butter or Boston lettuce leaves

Divide the shrimp in half.  Put half the shrimp into a food processor and grind it up.  Transfer the shrimp to a bowl using a rubber spatula.  Add the whole shrimp to the bowl.  Add celery, onion, bell pepper, garlic and parsley to the processor and pulse-grind it into a fine chop.  Add the vegetable mixture to the shrimp.  Add half a palm full of crab boil seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne, lemon zest, salt and pepper to the bowl, to season.  Stir the shrimp mixture to combine.

Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium to medium-high heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan in a slow stream.  Use a large metal scoop to scoop 4 mounds of shrimp burger mixture into the pan.  Gently pat down to form patties.  Fry patties 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until they firm up and the shrimp turn whitish-pink.

Split and toast the sandwich size English muffins.  Mix mayonnaise and chili sauce, salsa or taco sauce.  Place burgers on muffin bottoms and top with lettuce.  Slather the top of the muffins with sauce and set in place.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  small waxy potatoes -- quartered or
                        halved, depending on size
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
     3/4         pound  ground pork
     3/4         pound  ground veal
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 6) -- divided
     1/2           cup  dry Italian red wine -- divided
     1/4        medium  yellow skinned onion -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh sage leaves - -- (5 or 6 sprigs)
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  cremini (baby portobello) mushrooms -- sliced
  4                     crusty rolls -- split
  8             ounces  Pecorino Romano -- shaved with a
                        vegetable peeler
  1                cup  arugula leaves - (1/2 bunch) -- trimmed of stems
  3        tablespoons  capers
  1                     celery heart and greens from
                        the center of stalk -- chopped
     1/2        medium  red onion -- finely chopped
  1                     lemon -- zested and juiced
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil while you dice potatoes.  Add potatoes to boiling water and salt water liberally.  Boil potatoes until tender, 12 to 15 minutes.

While potatoes cook, prepare burgers.  Combine pork and veal in a bowl with 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 1/4 cup (eyeball it) red wine, onion, sage, garlic, salt and pepper then form 4 large patties.

Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Place the burgers into the skillet, leaving a space in the center of the pan to pile in mushrooms.  Add sliced mushrooms to the skillet with burgers and add 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Flip burgers after 6 minutes and toss the mushrooms around as they brown at the center of the skillet.  After the mushrooms begin to brown, season them with salt and pepper.  The color will be deeper and the mushrooms will remain firmer if you wait for them to brown before salting.  Cook burgers 5 minutes on opposite side then remove them from the pan to roll bottoms on a serving plate.  Place sliced cheese on burgers, then the hot mushrooms.  Cover plate loosely with foil to slightly melt cheese.  Add remaining 1/4 cup of wine to skillet and loosen drippings.  Dip roll tops in pan drippings to soak them up.  Pile arugula on each burger then set roll tops in place.

Drain potatoes and return them to the warm pot to dry them out.  Take the pot over to your cutting board and add in capers, celery, onion, lemon zest and juice, red wine vinegar and 3 or 4 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil to pot.  Toss to combine the salad, then season the salad with salt and pepper, to your taste.  Transfer salad to a serving dish.  Potato salad can be served warm or cold.

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil while you dice potatoes.  Add potatoes to boiling water and salt water liberally.  Boil potatoes until tender, 12 to 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While potatoes cook, prepare burgers.  Combine pork and veal in a bowl with 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 1/4 cup (eyeball it) red wine, onion, sage, garlic, salt and pepper then form 4 large patties.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Place the burgers into the skillet, leaving a space in the center of the pan to pile in mushrooms.  Add sliced mushrooms to the skillet with burgers and add 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Flip burgers after 6 minutes and toss the mushrooms around as they brown at the center of the skillet.  After the mushrooms begin to brown, season them with salt and pepper.  The color will be deeper and the mushrooms will remain firmer if you wait for them to brown before salting.  Cook burgers 5 minutes on opposite side then remove them from the pan to roll bottoms on a serving plate.  Place sliced cheese on burgers, then the hot mushrooms.  Cover plate loosely with foil to slightly melt cheese.  Add remaining 1/4 cup of wine to skillet and loosen drippings.  Dip roll tops in pan drippings to soak them up.  Pile arugula on each burger then set roll tops in place.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain potatoes and return them to the warm pot to dry them out.  Take the pot over to your cutting board and add in capers, celery, onion, lemon zest and juice, red wine vinegar and 3 or 4 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil to pot.  Toss to combine the salad, then season the salad with salt and pepper, to your taste.  Transfer salad to a serving dish.  Potato salad can be served warm or cold.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bag extra-crispy style frozen potato fries -- (16 to 20 oz)
     1/4           cup  chili powder
  2        tablespoons  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  grill seasoning
                        = (McCormick Montreal Seasoning
                        recommended)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil -- divided
  2             pounds  ground turkey breast - (to 2 1/4)
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1                cup  tomato sauce - (8-oz can)
  3                     red bell peppers -- 1/4 of 1 pepper
                        finely chopped, remaining peppers
                        thinly sliced
  4                     garlic cloves -- divided
  2        tablespoons  hot sauce -- divided
  6             ounces  Cheddar or smoked Cheddar -- cut 1/4" dice
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt -- divided
  1              small  red onion -- thinly sliced
  4               cups  shredded red cabbage
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  finely chopped curly parsley
  4                     soft burger rolls

Preheat oven to the temperature listed on the sack of fries.

Preheat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Combine chili powder, cumin and grill seasoning in a small bowl.  Add a tablespoon of vegetable oil, 1 turn of the pan, to a skillet and half of the turkey.  Break up the turkey with the back of a wooded spoon.  Season the turkey with half of the spice mixture.  Break up and brown turkey a couple of minutes, then add half of the finely chopped onion and cook another couple of minutes.  When onions are translucent, add Worcestershire sauce and tomato sauce, adjust seasonings and simmer the chili sauce over low heat until ready to serve.

While chili sauce is working, make the burgers.  Place the remaining turkey in a bowl and add the remaining spice mixture, half of the remaining chopped onions, the 1/4 red bell pepper that's chopped, 2 cloves of chopped garlic and about a tablespoon of hot sauce.  Combine the chili burger mixture and incorporate the diced cheese.  Form 4 (1-inch thick) patties.  Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add a tablespoon of vegetable oil, 1 turn of the pan, then the burgers.  Cook the burgers 6 minutes on each side.

When you place the burgers in the pan, the timing is right to add the fries to the preheated oven.

While everything is moving forward, throw together the slaw salad.  In the bottom of a medium bowl, combine 1 tablespoon hot sauce ó just eyeball it, with about 3 tablespoons vinegar, 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 teaspoon salt.  Add the red pepper strips, red onion and red cabbage to the bowl and toss to combine.  Add some pepper, to taste.

Chop the last 2 cloves of garlic.  Add about a teaspoon of salt to garlic and using the flat of your knife blade, mash the garlic and salt into paste.  Place the paste in a small bowl with 3 tablespoons butter, cut into chunks.  Melt the butter and paste together on high in the microwave 20 seconds or so.  Remove the fries from the oven and toss with melted butter and lots of parsley and adjust seasoning to your taste.

Separate burger rolls.  Pile chili-cheese burgers on the bun bottoms.  Top with scoops of chili sauce and a spoonful of the remaining finely chopped raw onions.  Set bun tops in place and serve the burgers with piles of red pepper slaw and funky fries.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Preheat oven to the temperature listed on the sack of fries.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Combine chili powder, cumin and grill seasoning in a small bowl.  Add a tablespoon of vegetable oil, 1 turn of the pan, to a skillet and half of the turkey.  Break up the turkey with the back of a wooded spoon.  Season the turkey with half of the spice mixture.  Break up and brown turkey a couple of minutes, then add half of the finely chopped onion and cook another couple of minutes.  When onions are translucent, add Worcestershire sauce and tomato sauce, adjust seasonings and simmer the chili sauce over low heat until ready to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While chili sauce is working, make the burgers.  Place the remaining turkey in a bowl and add the remaining spice mixture, half of the remaining chopped onions, the 1/4 red bell pepper that&apos;s chopped, 2 cloves of chopped garlic and about a tablespoon of hot sauce.  Combine the chili burger mixture and incorporate the diced cheese.  Form 4 (1-inch thick) patties.  Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add a tablespoon of vegetable oil, 1 turn of the pan, then the burgers.  Cook the burgers 6 minutes on each side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When you place the burgers in the pan, the timing is right to add the fries to the preheated oven.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While everything is moving forward, throw together the slaw salad.  In the bottom of a medium bowl, combine 1 tablespoon hot sauce ó just eyeball it, with about 3 tablespoons vinegar, 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 teaspoon salt.  Add the red pepper strips, red onion and red cabbage to the bowl and toss to combine.  Add some pepper, to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Chop the last 2 cloves of garlic.  Add about a teaspoon of salt to garlic and using the flat of your knife blade, mash the garlic and salt into paste.  Place the paste in a small bowl with 3 tablespoons butter, cut into chunks.  Melt the butter and paste together on high in the microwave 20 seconds or so.  Remove the fries from the oven and toss with melted butter and lots of parsley and adjust seasoning to your taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Separate burger rolls.  Pile chili-cheese burgers on the bun bottoms.  Top with scoops of chili sauce and a spoonful of the remaining finely chopped raw onions.  Set bun tops in place and serve the burgers with piles of red pepper slaw and funky fries.

                        === CREAMY PARMESAN SPINACH ===
  3                     boxes frozen spinach -- defrosted
  2                     bricks cream cheese - (3 oz ea)
     1/2         small  white onion -- finely chopped
     2/3           cup  grated Parmesan
  1           teaspoon  coarse black pepper
                        === STEAK ===
  2              large  T-bone steaks, 1 3/4" thk - (abt 3 lbs)
                        Vegetable oil -- for drizzling

  4             slices  white toast -- buttered, and
                        cut from corner to corner
                        === GREEN ONION FRITTERS ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  1                cup  all-in-one pancake mix
     1/2           cup  water
  7                     scallions - (to 8) -- cleaned, dried,
                        trimmed of roots, and chopped
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat a large griddle pan or 14-inch skillet over high heat.

Combine hot pepper sauce, ketchup, lemon zest and juice, celery and parsley in a small bowl.  Add shrimp and coat evenly.  Chill 20 minutes, then line 4 cocktail glasses or small dishes with leaf lettuce and top each with 1/4 of chilled shrimp.

Place spinach in microwave to defrost.  Place boxes on a dish to defrost the spinach because it will leek.  While spinach defrosts, place cream cheese and onions in a medium sauce pot over low heat.  While cream cheese is melting and spinach is defrosting, continue forward with meal prep then return to spinach.  When the cream cheese melts, add Parmesan and black pepper to the cheese.  Drain spinach in clean kitchen towel, wringing it out until dry.  Stir spinach into sauce, season with a pinch of salt, to taste, if necessary and let the spinach sit over lowest heat possible 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Drizzle the steaks with oil and add to screaming hot pan.  Cook 8 minutes on each side for medium doneness.  After you flip the steak, baste it with Worcestershire sauce and season with salt and pepper.  When you remove steak to cutting board or serving platter, baste opposite side and season it up.  Let meat rest a few minutes before you cut into it to let the juices redistribute.  Cut meat from bones and portion into 4 servings.  Push toast down in toaster, butter it and cut from corner to corner.

Fill a medium saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of vegetable oil and heat to medium-high heat.  Arrange a paper towel lined plate on the counter to place the fritters on when they come out of the hot oil.

In a bowl, make the batter by combining the all-in-one pancake mix with the water (the batter will be on the thick side).  Add the chopped green onions and season with the cayenne, salt, and pepper.  When the oil is ready for frying, drop spoonfuls of the batter into the oil and fry on all sides until golden brown and puffy.  This should take no more than 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove and drain on the paper towel lined plate.  Season with salt while they are still hot.

Serve steaks on toast with green onion fritters and spinach alongside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2          teaspoons  dried thyme or poultry seasoning
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  2        tablespoons  softened butter
  2               cups  grated Gruyere - (abt an 8-oz brick)
  1                cup  plain bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley leaves - (to 3)

Bring a large pot of water to a boilfor your egg noodles.  When it boils, salt the water and cook noodles to al dente.

Preheat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, and bacon or turkey bacon.  Render the bacon fat 2 to 3 minutes, until bacon begins to brown at edges.  Add meat and brown it, crumbling it with a wooden spoon.  Move the meat over to 1 side of the pan and add mushrooms and onions to the opposite side.  Cook mushrooms and onions 3 to 5 minutes, then combine the meat with veggies and season the mixture liberally with salt and pepper, then sprinkle in the ground thyme or poultry seasoning.  Cook another 5 minutes then add wine.  Deglaze the pan, lifting up pan drippings and bits.  Stir in stock and bring to a bubble, then stir in cream and reduce the heat to low.  Add nutmeg to sauce and stir.  Taste to adjust seasonings.

Preheat broiler to high.  Combine noodles with turkey and sauce.  Grease a casserole dish with a little softened butter nested in a piece of paper towel then transfer the turkey noodle mixture to the dish.  Top the casserole with Gruyere then bread crumbs.  Place the casserole 8 to 10 inches from the broiler and brown 2 to 3 minutes until cheese is melted and the crumbs are brown.  Remove from oven and garnish the casserole with parsley.

  1              large  Fuji apple
  1              large  red- or brown-skinned pear -- slightly underripe
  1                     lemon wedge

Quarter apple and pear lengthwise and cut into each quarter on an angle to remove the core.  Slice apple and pear into 1/4-inch thick slices.  Squeeze a little lemon juice over the fruit to slow browning.

Cut the top rind off the brie and place in the microwave on high for 60 seconds.  Depending on the ripeness of the cheese, it will take 60 to 90 seconds on high to heat and melt.  If brie is not yet soft and hot after 1 minute, place it back in microwave for another 30 seconds on high.

Serve the softened, warm brie with a platter of fruit and Melba toasts for dipping and spreading.  Reheat brie if it tightens up for 20 to 30 seconds at a time on high.

           Wild Mushroom Ravioli With Eggplant And Goat Cheese

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  eggplant
                        = (four 5" to 6" Japanese eggplants or
                        a small, firm eggplant)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1            package  fresh wild mushroom ravioli - (12 oz)
  2             medium  vine ripe tomatoes - (abt 8 oz)
  8             ounces  goat cheese -- to crumble
  20                    fresh basil leaves -- torn or shredded

Place a pot of water on the stove to boil for pasta.

Trim half of the skin from the eggplant.  Leaving a little skin on will add color and texture to the dish.  The small, firm eggplants are not too bitter and when they are firm, they will not soak up as much oil, so they do not need to be salted and pressed.  However, if you leave all the skin, especially when you use baby eggplant, the skin overpowers the flavor of the flesh and the texture is too tough overall.

Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Cut the eggplant into 1-inch by 1/2-inch bite-size pieces.  Add 2 turns of extra-virgin olive oil to the pan, the garlic and the eggplant.  Turn and toss the eggplant and season it with salt and pepper.  Let it brown lightly at edges, about 5 minutes, then reduce heat to medium low and continue to cook.

Add salt and ravioli to the pasta water and simmer to package directions, about 5 or 6 minutes, until just tender.

While the pasta cooks, dice tomatoes and add them to the cooking eggplant.  Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

Drain cooked pasta and plate individually or on a platter.  Top with eggplant and tomatoes and all of the basil and cheese.  If you plate individually, use 1/4 of the basil and 2 ounces of cheese, crumbled, per portion.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === VEAL DUMPLINGS ===
  1              pound  ground veal
  1              large  egg -- beaten
     1/3           cup  Italian bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano or Romano
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly grated nutmeg - (to 1/2)

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === STOUP ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     carrots -- peeled
  2                     celery ribs and their greens
  1             medium  yellow-skinned onion -- peeled, halved
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     fresh or dried bay leaf
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1                can  white cannellini beans - (14 oz) -- drained
  1                can  diced tomatoes in puree - (15 oz)
                        = (or coarsely ground tomatoes)
  3               cups  chicken stock
  2               cups  beef stock
  1                cup  egg pasta
                        = (broken egg fettuccini or medium egg
                        noodles)
                        === GREMOLATA ===
  2                     garlic cloves -- cracked
  1                     tin flat fillet anchovies - (2 oz) -- drained
     1/4           cup  flat-leaf parsley - (loosely packed)

                        Crusty bread -- to pass at table

Combine the veal and the next 5 ingredients then reserve mix and rinse off your hands.

Heat a medium soup pot over medium to medium-high heat.  Begin to chop veggies while pot heats up: dice carrots into 1/4-inch pieces, chop celery and onion.  Add extra-virgin olive oil to hot pot and carrots.  Turn carrots to coat them in oil and add celery and onion as you get them chopped up.  Work near the stove so you can chop, then drop into the pot.  Season the vegetables with salt and pepper and a bay leaf.  Stir vegetables and cook 5 minutes to begin to soften.  Do not let vegetables brown, reduce heat if necessary.

Next, add beans and tomatoes and stock to the pot.  Put a lid on the pot and raise heat to high.  When soup boils, about 3 minutes, add 1-inch balls of veal dumplings directly to the pot.  When you are done adding the veal, stir in the egg noodles.  Simmer stoup for 6 minutes to cook noodles and meat dumplings.  Adjust seasonings and turn the heat off, then let stoup stand a couple of minutes.

Pile garlic, anchovies, parsley and lemon zest on a cutting board and finely chop the mixture, then transfer to a small dish.

Serve stoup in shallow bowls with a couple of teaspoonfuls of gremolata on top.  Stir the gremolata throughout the stoup and pass crusty bread at the table for dipping and mopping.
