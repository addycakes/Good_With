Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter
  1                cup  sugar
  6                     eggs -- separated
     1/4           cup  potato starch
     1/2           cup  flour
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  sweet butter
  4                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  grated fresh ginger
     1/2           cup  brown sugar

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

In a mixing bowl, combine the butter and sugar and cream them together.  Once they are well mixed and fluffy, incorporate the egg yolks, one at a time, and continue to beat.

In a separate bowl, combine the potato starch, flour, yeast, and salt and mix well.  Combine the wet and dry ingredients, stirring just enough to blend.

In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites and fold them into the mixture.  Turn the batter out into a greased 9-inch round cake pan and bake for 30 minutes.

While the cake bakes, heat the butter in a medium saucepan.  Add the apples, ginger, and sugar and cook until very soft, about 20 minutes.  Set aside in a warm place.

When the cake comes out of the oven allow it to rest 5 minutes, then invert it onto a plate.  Spoon the apple compote over and serve with whipped cream on the side.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     onions -- cut into fine dice
     3/4         pound  fresh mushrooms -- thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  mascarpone
     3/4         pound  Emmentaler -- grated
     1/4         pound  Parmigiano-Reggiano -- grated
  3              whole  eggs -- beaten
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-grated nutmeg
  8             slices  white bread -- cut into 1" squares
  2              large  acorn squash -- seeds and strings
                        removed, caps reserved

In a medium saute pan, heat 3 tablespoons of the butter, add the onion and mushrooms, and saute until they soften and the onions release their juices.  Add salt and pepper, to taste, and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  In a large bowl, combine the mascarpone, Emmentaler, Parmigiano-Reggiano, eggs, and nutmeg, and stir well.  Season with salt and pepper and stir in the onions and mushrooms.

In a saute pan, melt the remaining butter and toss in the bread cubes, cooking over high heat until they are crisp.

Place the squash in a baking dish and, using a total of a third of the cheese mixture, stuff the bottom of each of the squash.  Using a total of half of the bread cubes, place them in even quantities into each of the squash.  Top the bread cube layer with more of the cheese mixture, then the remaining bread cubes, and the remaining cheese.

Replace the caps on the squash and roast 1 1/2 hours in the oven, until the flesh is very soft.  Remove from the oven, let cool for a few minutes and scoop out the cheese and flesh to serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  pearl barley
  4               cups  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  3              large  apples -- cored, chopped fine,
                        and tossed with
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  1           teaspoon  pear grappa
     1/2           cup  Tocai Friuliano, such as Bastianich
     1/2         bunch  mint, leaves removed and finely chopped
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

Place the barley in a saucepan, add water to cover by 2 inches, and let soak, refrigerated, for 12 hours or overnight.  After soaking, drain the barley and spread out on a baking sheet to dry.

Place the chicken stock in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.

In a wide, high-sided pot, heat the butter over medium-high heat until it foams and subsides.  Add 1/3 of the apple and saute for a few minutes, until it begins to soften.  Add the barley and stir for 3 minutes over high heat.

Combine the grappa and wine, and stir into the pan with the barley.  Add the Brown Chicken Stock, a little at a time, stirring constantly, allowing the barley to absorb the liquid to become firm and creamy, like risotto.  This will take about 10 minutes.

After 10 minutes, toss in the remaining apples, mint, and grated cheese and stir 2 more minutes over high heat.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               pint  heavy cream
     3/4         pound  Asiago cheese -- grated
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     treviso heads -- halved, cored
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

In a bowl, combine the cream and cheese and mix well.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Pour the mixture into a double boiler and cook, stirring constantly, over low heat until the mixture has thickened and increased in bulk, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool.

When cold place into ice cream maker and run until smooth, dense and creamy.  Remove and place in freezer until ready to serve.

Meanwhile, preheat the grill or broiler.  Once the gelato is cold enough to serve, brush the cut side of each head of treviso with some of the olive oil, season with salt and pepper and grill for 5 to 10 minutes, until tender.  Serve the treviso alongside a small serving of the gelato.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  asparagus spears -- tough ends
                        snapped off
  3                     eggs
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Fill a large frying pan or skillet, large enough to hold the asparagus, two-thirds full with water and bring to a boil.  Add 3 tablespoons salt and the asparagus.  Cover the pan to return the water to a boil, then cook, uncovered, until the asparagus spears are tender but still bright green, about 7 minutes.  Drain and set on a kitchen towel or paper towel to dry.

Fill a medium saucepan half-full with water and bring to a simmer.  In a medium, heat-proof bowl, combine the eggs, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste and whisk until the mixture is pale.  Slowly whisk in the oil to emulsify.  Place the bowl over the simmering water and, whisking constantly, cook the sauce over the water bath until it thickens.

Serve the asparagus spears and sauce so that guests may dip the spears in the sauce and eat with fingers.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  baccala (dried, salted codfish) -- soaked for 48 hours,

     1/2           cup  flour
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  dry white wine from the Veneto
     1/2                onion -- roughly chopped
  2                     bay leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     sole fillets - (8 oz ea)
     1/2         pound  medium shrimp - (16/20 size)
  2 1/2           cups  milk
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  flour
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
     1/2           cup  toasted bread crumbs

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Prepare the Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough according to the recipe and roll out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Cut the sheets into 1/4-inch thick strips, dust with semolina flour and set aside, covered with a damp kitchen towel, until ready to use.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, combine the wine, onion, bay leaves, and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook over high heat until the wine boils.  Add the sole and shrimp.  Reduce to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.  Strain out the solids, reserving them, and return the liquid to the pan.  Add the milk and bring to a simmer.

Once the fish and shrimp are cool enough to handle, cut the shrimp into 3 pieces each and the fish into strips.  Set aside.

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat half of the butter until it is melted.  Add the flour and whisk it in for 30 seconds.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and whisk in the milk and wine mixture.  Return the pan to the heat and bring to a boil over low heat.  Cook over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes.  Mix in the parsley and bread crumbs and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Remove from heat and set aside.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the tagliatelle in the boiling water until tender yet al dente, about 2 minutes.  Drain the pasta and, in a large bowl, dress it with 1/3 of the fish sauce.

In a shallow casserole that has been greased with a little of the remaining butter, place half the dressed pasta, and top it with the cooked fish and shrimp.  Spoon a little bit of the sauce over the seafood and top with the remaining pasta.  Cover the top with the remaining pasta.

Melt the remaining butter in a small pan on the stovetop and pour it over the top of the casserole.  Bake for 20 minutes, then let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  beets -- trimmed, scrubbed
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  ricotta
     1/2           cup  milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  poppyseeds
  1                cup  unsalted butter -- melted
                        Carnia cheese -- for grating
                        = (Montasio can be substituted)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Drizzle the beets with the olive oil.  Wrap in foil and roast for 45 minutes, until very tender.  Remove from the heat and, once cooled, peel the beets and mash them with a fork or a potato masher.

In a small bowl, combine the mashed beets, ricotta, and milk and stir well with a wooden spoon to combine.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Allow to cool completely.

Prepare the Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough and roll it out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Cut the pasta sheet into 2-inch squares.  Place a scant tablespoon of the beet filling on the center of half of the squares and top with the remaining squares, pressing around the edges to seal.  Set aside, covered with a damp towel, until ready to use.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the ravioli in the boiling water until cooked through and tender, about 5 minutes.  Drain the ravioli and place in a large serving bowl.  Toss with the melted butter and poppyseeds and serve with cheese grated over.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2            bunches  beet greens -- beets reserved
                        for another use
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  2             ounces  prosciutto di San Daniele -- thinly sliced,
                        then julienned
  2                     oranges zested -- plus
                        Juice of 1 orange
  1              pinch  cinnamon

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Clean the beet greens, removing the leaves and setting them aside for another use.  Trim the stalks on the cut end to 6 inches long.

Bring 1 quart of water to a boil and set up an ice bath nearby.  Cook the stalks for 2 to 3 minutes in the boiling water until tender, then shock in ice water.  Once cooled, remove the stalks and pat dry.  Cut the stalks into 1/4-inch julienne and set aside.

Add the beet stalks, prosciutto, orange zest, cinnamon, remaining olive oil and red onion and toss to coat, about 30 seconds.  Splash with the orange juice and toss again.  Season with salt and pepper and divide among 4 plates.  Serve immediately, with fish or grilled meats.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2                onion -- roughly chopped
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
     1/2                carrot -- roughly chopped
  1                     bay leaf
  1              pound  cleaned cuttlefish -- ink sac retained
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2            packets  squid ink
  1 1/2           cups  arborio rice (Vialone Nano brand preferred
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley

Bring 3 quarts water to a boil and add the roughly chopped onion, carrot, and the bay leaf.  Prepare an ice bath.  Plunge the cuttlefish into the boiling water and cook for 30 seconds.  Remove and submerge in the ice bath 1-minute.  Drain and set aside. Keep the cooking liquid warm on stove.

In a 12- to 14-inch frying pan with 3-inch sides, heat the olive oil and finely chopped onion and squid ink over medium heat until softened but not brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the rice and, stirring constantly, cook until opaque, about 2 minutes.  Add the white wine, then the cuttlefish cooking liquid, ladle by ladle, until the rice is covered.  Turn the heat to high and, stirring constantly, continue to cook, maintaining the level of liquid just above the level of rice, for 15 minutes.

Chop the cuttlefish into 1-inch pieces and toss into the rice.  Continue cooking until rice is soft but still al dente.  Season with salt and pepper, remove from heat and stir in butter and parsley.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  8                     onions -- very thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
  1              pound  calves liver -- thinly sliced
     1/3           cup  red wine
                        A few drops of aceto tradizionale

Heat the olive oil with 3 tablespoons of the butter in a large, heavy saute pan over a medium flame.  Add the onions and cook them over low heat until they are very soft but not colored, for literally about 1 hour.

Salt the onions and remove them to a warm platter.  Add the liver to the pan, salting and cooking for 30 to 45 seconds on each side.  Work in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan.  When done, place the liver over the onions and keep warm.

Add the wine to the pan and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to dislodge any browned bits.  Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and pour it over the liver and onions.  Drizzle the vinegar over and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

           Chestnut Soup With Friulian Cheese And Salami - ...

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             quarts  water
  2        tablespoons  salt -- plus
  1           teaspoon  salt -- and more
  4             pounds  fresh chestnuts
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3             ounces  speck -- cut 1/4" dice
  2                     onions -- cut 1/4" dice
  2          teaspoons  crushed fennel seeds
  1                     bay leaf
  2             quarts  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  2               cups  dry white wine
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  boiled short-grain rice
     2/3           cup  mascarpone
     1/2         pound  dark rye bread -- crusts cut off,
                        and cut into 1" cubes

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Slit the chestnuts on the side with a paring knife and boil for 3 to 4 minutes in the water.  Remove with a slotted spoon and, once they are cool enough to handle, but still warm, peel them.

In a large, heavy soup pot, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter and saute the speck with the onions.  Add the chestnuts, fennel seeds, bay leaf, 1 quart of the Brown Chicken Stock, and 1 cup wine, season with remaining salt and black pepper, and bring to a simmer.  Cook, loosely covered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until the chestnuts are very soft but still intact.

Remove the soup from the heat and allow to cool.  Remove and discard the bay leaf, then puree the soup in batches and return to the soup pot.  Add the remaining stock and wine to thin the soup.  Bring to a simmer, then stir in the rice and mascarpone, and simmer for an additional 2 minutes.

Meanwhile, brown the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a saute pan, and crisp the bread in the pan.

Divide the soup evenly among 4 warmed soup bowls and top with the browned bread.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  chicken livers
  2               cups  white wine from Friuli
  10                    black peppercorns - (to 15)
  1                     bay leaf
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  cippolline -- peeled, trimmed
                        Salt -- to taste
     3/4           cup  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- divided
  1           teaspoon  brandy
                        === HORSERADISH SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  finely-grated horseradish
     1/2                green apple -- finely grated
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cider vinegar

Clean the livers, removing fat, and connective tissue.  Place in a non-reactive casserole or bowl with the white wine, peppercorns, and bay leaf and refrigerate, covered, in the refrigerator for 6 hours.

In a medium saucepan, heat olive oil and add the onions.  Once browned, add a pinch of salt and enough water to cover the onions halfway, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook until the onions fall apart, about 20 minutes.

Drain the onions and place in a blender or food processor to puree.  Return the onion puree to the pot and stir in the Brown Chicken Stock and 1 tablespoon of the butter.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and keep warm.

Drain the livers and discard the bay leaf and peppercorns.  In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the remaining butter over high heat until it foams and subsides.  Add the livers and saute for 1 minute.  Add the brandy and saute for 1 minute more, then drain the liquid from the pan and serve immediately with the onion sauce and horseradish sauce served over.

Horseradish Sauce:  In a small bowl, combine the horseradish and apple, then stir in the vinegar.  This may be stored for up to 1 week, tightly sealed, in the refrigerator.  (Makes 3/4 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  12                    dried prunes -- plumped in
     1/2           cup  warm grappa or brandy

Warm the olive oil in a large, heavy casserole and cook the speck until light golden brown.  Remove it to a plate, using a slotted spoon.

Season the chicken with salt and pepper and brown it on both sides, then remove it to a plate.  Add the leeks and shallots and saute.  Add the thyme, bay leaf, wine, and Brown Chicken Stock, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to dislodge the browned bits.

Bring to a simmer and return the chicken to the casserole.  Cover the casserole loosely and simmer for 30 minutes.

Add the soaked prunes and their liquids and simmer another 30 minutes, until the chicken is very tender and falling off the bone.

Remove the chicken to a plate and add the sauteed speck.  Reduce the sauce for 5 minutes and season with salt and pepper.  Return the chicken and speck to the sauce, let rest to cool, then reheat gently and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        == STRUDEL PASTRY AUSTRO-ITALIAN STYLE ==
  16            ounces  butter -- cold, divided
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3 1/2           cups  flour -- divided
     1/2           cup  ice water
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  walnuts -- chopped roughly
     1/2           cup  hazelnuts -- chopped roughly
  1                     lemon -- zested
  1                     orange -- zested
     1/4           cup  candied citron
     1/4           cup  semi-sweet chocolate pieces -- roughly chopped
     1/4           cup  currants -- soaked 1 hour in
     1/2           cup  Verduzzo wine
  2                     eggs -- separated, and
                        whites beaten until stiff
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  3        tablespoons  sugar

Strudel Pastry Austro-Italian Style:  In a food processor, place 4 ounces of the butter, 1 teaspoon salt, and 2 1/2 cups of the flour and blend until texture of breadcrumbs.  Slowly add ice water until dough comes together.  Remove and form into a ball, then flatten it into a 8- by 10-inch rectangle and place in refrigerator.  This is called the pasta mixture.

In a food processor, place the remaining butter and 1 cup flour, and mix until blended and scrape out on to board.  Working quickly, form this mixture in a 4-inch square and place in refrigerator.  This is called the burro mixture.

After 1/2 hour, when the 2 mixtures are similar in texture, place pasta mixture on a well-floured clean marble surface.  Place burro mixture in center and fold the pasta mixture over it, like wrapping a gift.  Flatten with a rolling pin and roll out to an 8- by 16-inch rectangle, flouring regularly.  If butter comes to surface, flour the spot heavily and continue working.

Fold bottom third up and top third down to form a small package and turn 90 degrees clockwise.  Pat dough with rolling pin to adhere and roll out to large 8- by 16-inch rectangle again.  Repeat folding process and refrigerate 30 minutes, covered in a moist cloth.

Remove and repeat the rolling-and-folding process 3 times.  Allow 30 minutes refrigeration between each maneuver.  The dough is now ready and will keep in the refrigerator 10 days, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees and grease a cookie sheet.

Filling:  In a large mixing bowl, combine the walnuts, hazelnuts, lemon zest, orange zest, candied citron, chocolate pieces, currants, and soaking liquid and stir to combine.  Add the egg whites and 1/4 cup sugar and fold together.

Assembly:  Roll the pastry out to a 10- by 16-inch rectangle and position the longest side parallel to the work surface edge.  Spoon the filling over the pastry evenly, leaving 2 inches uncovered at one end.  Roll the pastry up like a jelly-roll from south to north so it appears to be a thick pipe.

Make a circle of the pipe by attaching the two open ends like a wreath.  Brush with the beaten eggs yolks and sprinkle with the remaining sugar.  Place on a cookie sheet and bake for 50 minutes.  Allow to cool before cutting.  Serve with Verduzzo wine.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2                     garlic cloves -- halved lengthwise
  2             pounds  squash (hubbard, butternut, or pumpkin) -- peeled, and

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  dry active yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- divided
  5 1/2           cups  flour
  5                     beaten eggs -- plus
  1              whole  egg -- plus
  1                     egg yolk
  1              pinch  salt

In a large bowl, combine the yeast, warm water, and 1 tablespoon sugar and set aside for 10 minutes, until the mixture is foamy.

In a separate bowl, combine the flour and salt, forming a well in the center.  Add the yeast mixture and beaten eggs and stir with a wooden spoon, gradually incorporating the ingredients to form a soft dough.  Adding more flour if necessary to help bring the dough together, and knead with floured hands when the dough becomes too stiff.

Knead for 10 minutes on a floured surface, or for 10 minutes in the bowl of a mixer, using the dough hook attachment.  When the dough is smooth and elastic, form it into a ball and place in a greased bowl, turning to grease all sides.  Cover with a damp dish towel and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.  Punch down and allow to rise, covered, a second time.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Punch the dough down and, with clean, oiled hands, press the dough to fit an 11- by 15-inch pan by 1-inch thickness.  Dimple the dough in several spots with your knuckles, cover, and let rise for 15 minutes.

After 15 minutes, beat the remaining egg, yolk, remaining sugar, and pinch of salt and brush the mixture over the surface of the dough.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until light golden brown.  Serve warm, cut into wedges.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

                        === VARIATION III ===
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  sea scallops

     1/4           cup  white wine
                        === VARIATION IV ===
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  sea scallops
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  dry white wine
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1              pinch  hot chile flakes

  1         tablespoon  capers
  1                     lemon, cut into wedges

Variation I:  Preheat the oven to 475 degrees, or preheat the broiler.

Dredge the scallops in the seasoned flour.  In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons of the butter over high heat until it foams and subsides.  Add the scallops, working in batches if necessary, and cook for 2 minutes on 1 side.  Carefully turn and cook for 2 minutes on the other side, then remove to a plate until all are cooked.  Place the scallops under the broiler or in the oven for 3 to 4 minutes, until they are nicely browned at the edges.

Meanwhile, add the garlic to the pan in which you cooked the scallops and cook for 2 minutes over medium-high heat.  Add the wine, scraping the bottom of the pan to dislodge any browned bits, and bring to a boil.  Add the remaining butter, a half-tablespoon at a time, until it is absorbed.  Add the parsley, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and serve the scallops with the sauce poured over.

Variation II:  Preheat the oven to 475 degrees, or preheat the broiler.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the butter over high heat until it foams and subsides.  Whisk in the cornmeal, stirring for 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and set aside.

Add the tarragon and salt and pepper.  Season the scallops with salt and pepper and sprinkle the polenta mixture over them.  Bake in the oven or under the broiler for 5 to 7 minutes, until cooked through and nicely browned at the edges.

Variation III:  Preheat the oven to 475 degrees, or preheat the broiler.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil over high heat until just smoking.  Season the scallops with salt and pepper and saute over high heat 2 minutes, then turn and cook on the other side for 2 minutes.

Remove to a plate and add the Basic Tomato Sauce, parsley, basil, and wine to the pan.  Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, season with salt and pepper, and cook for 5 minutes.

Place sauce on a broiler plate and place scallops over sauce.  Cook in the oven or broiler until they are cooked through and nicely browned on the edges.  Serve immediately.

Variation IV:  Preheat the oven to 475 degrees, or preheat the broiler.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil over high heat until just smoking.  Season the scallops with salt and pepper and saute over high heat 2 minutes, then turn and cook on the other side for 2 minutes.

Remove to a plate and add wine, garlic, chile flakes, anchovies, and capers to the pan.  Bring the wine to a boil, reduce to a simmer, season with salt and pepper and cook for 10 minutes over low heat, until the capers have burst and the anchovies are falling apart.

Sprinkle the scallops with the wine mixture and cook in the oven or broiler until they are cooked through and nicely browned on the edges.  Serve immediately with lemons.

This recipe yields 4 servings each.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTA ===
  4               cups  unbleached flour
  2                     eggs -- beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  warm water
                        === RAGU ===
  2                     onions -- finely chopped
     1/8         pound  pancetta
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     carrots -- shredded
  6                     bay leaves
  6                     whole cloves
  1           teaspoon  fresh rosemary leaves
  3 1/2         pounds  wild boar shoulder or butt
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2            bottles  Barolo
     1/2           can  peeled plum tomatoes
  8               cups  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)

On a clean work surface, mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour, reserving 1/2 cup.  Form a well at the center of the mound and place the eggs, salt, and olive oil in the center of the well.  Beat the wet ingredients with a fork and slowly drizzle in the warm water.  Start to incorporate the flour into the center of the well, a little at a time, until it is all incorporated.

With clean, floured hands, knead the dough for 20 minutes by hand, or use the dough hook attachment in a mixer.  The dough should be smooth and satiny.  Let rest for 2 hours, covered and refrigerated, before rolling out.

Cut the dough into thirds or quarters, and roll out to the second-thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Cut the pasta into 1 1/2-inch thick strips, then lay the strips atop one another forming 3 stacks.  Cut the strips crosswise at a slight angle at 2-inch intervals, forming lozenges.  Roll each lozenge into a quill shape, pressing the ends together as they overlap.  Set aside on a baking sheet, covered with a damp towel.

In a large casserole, combine the onion, pancetta, and olive oil and cook over high heat until the onion is golden.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Add the carrot, bay leaves, cloves, and rosemary.  Season well with salt and pepper, then push the aromatics to 1 side of the pot.

Season the meat with salt and pepper and add to the pot.  Cook over high heat until it is browned on all sides, about 15 minutes.  Add the tomato paste and stir it in thoroughly.  Add the wine and simmer for 30 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and Brown Chicken Stock, stir them in thoroughly, then simmer for 3 hours, or until the meat is very tender.

Remove the meat and set aside.  Once the meat is cool enough to handle, shred it with a fork.  Return the meat to the pot and simmer for another 30 minutes, until it is a nice thick ragu consistency.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the pasta quills in the boiling water until tender yet al dente, about 4 minutes.  Drain and toss in a large serving bowl with enough ragu to coat the pasta but not overwhelm it.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2               cups  milk
     1/2           cup  flour -- plus
     1/4           cup  cornstarch -- sifted together
  1                     lemon -- zested
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  2               cups  fresh bread crumbs -- mixed with
  1                cup  ground almonds
  3                     eggs -- lightly beaten

Combine the egg yolks and the sugar and whisk until the yolks are pale yellow.

Meanwhile, bring the milk almost to a boil, remove from heat, and pour half of it into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly.  Return the egg and milk mixture to the pan with the rest of the milk and, continuing to whisk, mix in the flour/cornstarch mixture.  Cook over high heat, now stirring with a wooden spoon, until the mixture begins to thicken.

Stir in the lemon zest and vanilla, remove from heat, and allow to cool in a wide-surfaced bowl that has been set atop an ice bath.  Once the cream has cooled, turn the mixture out into a buttered 9- by 13-inch pan, place in refrigerator, and allow to cool and solidify.

In a tall-sided pot, heat the olive oil to 375 degrees.

Cut the cooled cream into 1-inch squares and dredge in the bread crumb and almond mixture.

Working in batches, fry the custard in the oil until they are golden brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon, and drain on a plate lined with paper towels.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1              pound  ricotta
     1/4         pound  smoked ricotta -- finely grated
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  currants
     1/2      teaspoon  bitter cocoa
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  2        tablespoons  sliced scallions
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped Italian parsley
                        Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  4                     sage leaves
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring 6 quarts of water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a bowl, mix the ricotta, smoked ricotta, eggs, salt, currants, chocolate, nutmeg, lemon zest, scallions, and parsley.

Roll the Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough out on a pasta machine down to the thinnest setting, and cut 3-inch squares from the dough.  Place a scant tablespoon of the filling in the middle of 1/2 of the squares, and top them with the other squares, pressing the edges together to seal.  Set aside.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the ravioli in the boiling water until they are tender and cooked through, about 5 to 7 minutes.

Meanwhile, place the Brown Chicken Stock, sage, and butter into a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, and bring to a boil.  Drain the pasta and toss into the pan with the butter mixture.  Toss over high heat, season with salt and pepper, and serve.

  1                cup  flour
     1/2           cup  butter
  1                     egg -- plus

     1/4           cup  chopped walnuts
     1/4           cup  chopped pine nuts
     1/4           cup  chopped candied orange peel
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs
  2                     crushed cloves
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1              pinch  cinnamon
                        === WHEAT CREAM ===
  4                     apples -- cored, and
                        cut into chunks
     1/4           cup  Currant Marmellata -- (see below)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  butter -- cut into chunks
                        === CURRANT MARMELLATA ===
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  1                cup  water
  2              pints  currants
  1              pinch  salt

In a large bowl, combine the flour, all but 1/2 teaspoon of the butter, 1 egg, 1 yolk, the sugar, knead the mixture, and form the mixture into a ball.  Cover and let sit for 1 hour.

In a separate bowl, combine 1 egg yolk, the raisins, walnuts, pine nuts, candied peels, bread crumbs, cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon and stir well.  Set aside for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Roll the dough out to 1/4-inch thick with a rolling pin and place the nut and fruit filling in the middle of the dough.  Fold the dough over in half, pinch the edges, and brush the outside of the dough with the remaining yolk, beaten.  Bake in the oven for 40 minutes.

Wheat Cream:  Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.

Place the apples in a casserole, making a well in the center of the chunks.  Fill the well with the Currant Marmellata, sprinkle the apples with the sugar, dot with the butter, and bake in the oven for 20 minutes.

Currant Marmellata:  In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine sugar and 1 cup of water and bring to a boil.  Add the currants, and salt, and cook over high heat for 20 minutes, until the currants are tender but not falling apart and the liquid has reduced to a syrupy consistency.  (Makes 1 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             pounds  beef -- cut into cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             medium  onions -- finely chopped
  4                     celery stalks -- finely chopped
  5                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  1                     carrot -- finely chopped
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (16 oz) -- drained, crushed
  2               cups  red wine
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme leaves
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1              pinch  cloves
  1              pinch  cinnamon
                        Gnocchi -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

In a 6- to 8-quart, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat.

Season the beef cubes well with salt and pepper and brown them over high heat on all sides.  Remove the beef from the pan and add the onion, celery, and garlic.  Sweat over medium heat until vegetables are translucent.

Return the beef to the pan and stir in the tomatoes and wine.  Add the thyme, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and salt and pepper, to taste, and simmer over medium-low heat for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until the beef cubes are falling apart.

Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and remove from heat.  Remove the beef and, when it is cool enough to handle, shred the meat with a fork and return to the sauce.  Simmer for an additional 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare the gnocchi according to the recipe, then preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt.  Cook the gnocchi in the boiling water for 1 minute, then drain, and place in a lightly greased casserole.  Pour the beef sauce over the gnocchi to cover, top with the grated cheese and cook in the oven 10 to 15 minutes, until the ragu is bubbling at the edges and the cheese is browned.  Let sit for 10 minutes, then serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

          Goose Liver With Dried Figs - {Fegato D'Oca Con Fichi}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Goose                           Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     goose livers
     1/2           cup  white or cider vinegar
                        Instant flour -- to dredge
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     onions -- thinly sliced rings
  3                     dried figs -- rehydrated in
                        warm water and thinly sliced
  1                cup  sweet wine, Verduzzo or Dindorello
     1/4           cup  dry wine, Soave
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  2        tablespoons  butter

Trim the livers of connective tissue and fat.  Rinse in a cold water bath that has been augmented with the vinegar.  Drain and pat dry.  Slice into 1/2-inch thick slices, and dredge lightly with the flour.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat until smoking.  Add the liver pieces and sear until crisp and golden brown and medium-rare inside, about 1 minute per side and remove to a plate.  Be careful here as an extra minute in the pan can reduce your livers to liquid.

Add the onion rings and cook over medium-high heat until they are softened and browned.  Add the figs and the wines and cook over high heat scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to dislodge any browned bits until reduced by half.  Add the butter.  Return the livers briefly to the pan to heat through, season sauce with salt and pepper, grated lemon zest, and parsley, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Trim the livers of connective tissue and fat.  Rinse in a cold water bath that has been augmented with the vinegar.  Drain and pat dry.  Slice into 1/2-inch thick slices, and dredge lightly with the flour.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat until smoking.  Add the liver pieces and sear until crisp and golden brown and medium-rare inside, about 1 minute per side and remove to a plate.  Be careful here as an extra minute in the pan can reduce your livers to liquid.

<DirT>
Add the onion rings and cook over medium-high heat until they are softened and browned.  Add the figs and the wines and cook over high heat scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to dislodge any browned bits until reduced by half.  Add the butter.  Return the livers briefly to the pan to heat through, season sauce with salt and pepper, grated lemon zest, and parsley, and serve immediately.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- cut julienne strips
  1              pound  fresh sweet peas -- shelled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  Besciamella -- (see below)
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        === BESCIAMELLA ===
  5        tablespoons  butter
  4        tablespoons  flour
  3               cups  milk
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg

Roll out Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine and cut into 1/4-inch thick strips.

Preheat the oven to 475 degrees, or preheat the broiler.  Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 12- to 14-inch frying pan, heat the butter over medium-high heat until it foams and subsides.  Add the prosciutto and peas and cook over high heat until the meat is browned and the peas are tender and cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat.

Cook the tagliolini in the boiling water until tender and not quite cooked through, about 1 minute.  Drain well and toss in the pan with the peas and prosciutto.  Add the Besciamella and toss over high heat for 30 seconds, then transfer to an ovenproof casserole.

Top with the grated Parmigiano and cook in the oven or broiler for 3 to 5 minutes, until the cheese is browned and besciamella bubbles.  Serve immediately.

Besciamella (Bechamel Sauce):  In a medium saucepan, heat butter until melted.  Add flour and stir until smooth.  Over medium heat, cook until light golden brown, about 6 to 7 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat milk in separate pan until just about to boil.  Add milk to butter mixture 1 cup at a time, whisking continuously until very smooth and bring to a boil.  Cook 10 minutes and remove from heat.  Season with salt and nutmeg and set aside.  (Makes 3 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  Gorgonzola -- broken into chunks
  2             ounces  unsalted butter
  1              ounce  grappa
                        Green Gnocchi -- (see below)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Asiago
     1/4           cup  chopped chives
                        === GREEN GNOCCHI ===
  2             pounds  fresh spinach -- rinsed, spun dry
  1              pound  potatoes -- boiled
     3/4           cup  flour
  1                     egg
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, mash together the Gorgonzola and butter until smooth.  Add the grappa and simmer 4 minutes.

Place the Green Gnocchi in water and cook at low boil until they float.  Drain well and toss into pan.  Toss the gnocchi over medium heat, add Asiago and chives.  Pour into a warmed bowl, and serve.

Green Gnocchi:  Set up a small ice bath.

In a pot with a lid, cook the spinach over medium heat, allowing it to steam from the liquid still present on the leaves, about 1 minute.  Meanwhile, take the warm boiled potatoes, peel them and run them through a food mill on smallest setting.

Remove the cooked spinach and shock in the ice bath.  Drain well and wrap in a clean towel and twist to totally dry leaves.  Chop very finely with a knife and add to the potatoes.  Add the flour.  Make a well in the center, add the egg and salt and knead to form dough.

Bring 6 quarts water to boil and retain the initial ice bath.  Roll the dough into 1-inch thick ropes and cut into 1-inch long pieces.  Flick off fork tines to establish the classic shape and drop 10 to 15 at a time into boiling water.  When they float, all together, remove to ice bath.  Repeat until all are done.  Remove from ice bath and drain.  Dress with oil and hold covered in bowl in refrigerator until ready to use.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

             Ham Baked In Bread With Stuffed Radicchio - ...

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ham                             Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  dry yeast -- plus
  1           teaspoon  dry yeast
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1                     ham, preferably from Trieste - (abt 6 lbs)
  1              sprig  rosemary
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  16                    radicchio leaves -- hard base removed
  1              pound  Montasio cheese -- cut into 16 sticks
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Combine the flour and salt on a work surface and form a well in the middle.  Dissolve the yeast in about 1 1/2 cups water and pour this mixture into the well.  Wet your fingers in some more water and push the flour into the yeast, working the ingredients to form a dough.  Judiciously add a few drops of water to incorporate all the flour.  Form an elastic, even dough.  Place the dough in a large bowl and let rise, covered, in a warm place for an hour.  It should double in size.

Gently wipe the ham with paper towels but do not remove any visible fat.  Cut the rosemary sprig in half and "massage" it gently into to outside of the ham, then discard.  Season the outside of the ham with black pepper.

Return the dough to the work surface and use a rolling pin to roll it out to 1/2-inch thickness.  The dough may be an irregular shape.  Place the ham in the middle of the dough and completely wrap it in the dough.  Pinch the edges together to seal.  Place the ham on a baking sheet and let sit for 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Bake the ham for 2 hours, after which time the crust should be light golden and fragrant.

While the ham cooks, prepare the stuffed radicchio.  Place a piece of cheese at the end of each of the radicchio leaves and roll each leaf to completely enclose the cheese.  Secure with toothpicks.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the butter over medium heat until it foams and subsides.  Working in batches, saute the rolls in the pan for about 1 minute each.  After the rolls are cooked, transfer them to a 9- by 13-inch casserole and season lightly with salt and pepper.  When all the rolls have been sauteed, pour the pan juices over the rolls and set aside until the ham is done cooking.

After 2 hours of cooking, remove the ham and let it sit for 5 minutes.  Increase the heat to 400 degrees, and cook the radicchio rolls in the oven for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove, carve the ham, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Combine the flour and salt on a work surface and form a well in the middle.  Dissolve the yeast in about 1 1/2 cups water and pour this mixture into the well.  Wet your fingers in some more water and push the flour into the yeast, working the ingredients to form a dough.  Judiciously add a few drops of water to incorporate all the flour.  Form an elastic, even dough.  Place the dough in a large bowl and let rise, covered, in a warm place for an hour.  It should double in size.

Gently wipe the ham with paper towels but do not remove any visible fat.  Cut the rosemary sprig in half and &quot;massage&quot; it gently into to outside of the ham, then discard.  Season the outside of the ham with black pepper.

Return the dough to the work surface and use a rolling pin to roll it out to 1/2-inch thickness.  The dough may be an irregular shape.  Place the ham in the middle of the dough and completely wrap it in the dough.  Pinch the edges together to seal.  Place the ham on a baking sheet and let sit for 20 minutes.

         Lamb With Horseradish And Vinegar - {Agnello Al Raffano}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  lamb shoulder
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- divided
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
  3                     bay leaves
  6        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     3/4           cup  Brown Chicken Stock, recipe follows
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated horseradish
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley

Remove the bone, most of the fat and all of the gristle from the lamb and cut the meat into 1-inch cubes.

In a large Dutch oven, combine 2 tablespoons butter, the oil, onion, thyme, bay leaves, vinegar, Brown Chicken Stock and salt and pepper, to taste, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Add the lamb cubes and cook, covered, for 1 hour.  The meat should be very tender, and there should be very little liquid left in the pan.  If there is a lot of liquid in the pan, remove the meat and reduce the liquid over high heat, then return the meat to the pan.

In a small saucepan, melt the remaining butter and mix in the horseradish and parsley.  Cook, stirring, over high heat for 1 minute, then pour the sauce over the meat and toss to coat.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/3         pounds  fresh ricotta -- drained in a
                        colander or strainer
  3                     eggs
     1/4         pound  Montasio cheese -- freshly grated
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Several gratings nutmeg
  1              pinch  ground cloves
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus more for dustin
  4                     scallions -- very thinly sliced
  1              bunch  chive flowers with 1" stems
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     sage leaves -- torn small pieces

In a large bowl, pulverize the ricotta cheese into very little curds with a wooden spoon.  Beat the eggs and add them to the cheese.  Add the Montasio, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cloves.  Combine the ingredients thoroughly, then add the flour.  Stir very gently, just until the flour is incorporated.

Very lightly dust a clean surface with flour.  Place the ricotta mixture on the work surface.  Divide the mixture into 8 batches.  Take a batch and enclose it in your hands.  Form a flat oval shape measuring about 2 inches long and 3/4-inch wide.  Keep the gnoccho in one hand and press a flower into the center of the gnoccho.  Add some of the scallions.  Enclose the flower with the dough and repeat the process with the remaining dough and flowers.  You should have eight gnocchi.  Place them in a casserole and cover for 10 minutes.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the gnocchi in the boiling water for 12 minutes.

While the gnocchi cook, melt the butter and sage in a saucepan and keep warm.

Drain the gnocchi and divide evenly among 4 warmed pasta bowls.  Top with the melted butter and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              dozen  mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped Italian parsley
     1/4           cup  breadcrumbs
  20                    basil leaves -- cut into chiffonade
  20                    mint leaves -- cut into chiffonade
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated ginger
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Olive oil -- for drizzling

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

In a large pot with a lid, place the mussels and enough water to come 1/4 of the way up the sides.  Cover and cook over medium-high heat until the mussels steam open, about 8 minutes.  Discard any that don't open.  Retain the cooking liquid.  Once they are cool enough to handle, remove the top shell from each bivalve and discard.  Set the mussel-bearing shells on a sheet pan.

In a small bowl, combine the garlic, parsley, breadcrumbs, basil, mint, ginger and salt and pepper and mix well.  Stir in a few tablespoons of the cooking liquid.  Place a small amount of the mixture atop each mussel, drizzle with olive oil and cook in the oven for two minutes to brown the bread crumbs.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  1                     celery rib -- finely chopped
  1                     carrot -- finely chopped
  2                     pigeons or Cornish hens - (1/2 lb ea), cle
                        livers reserved and halved
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2             quarts  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  6             slices  homemade bread
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

In a large stockpot, large enough to hold all the pigeon pieces in 1 layer, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat until it foams and subsides and add the onion, celery and carrot.  Cook over medium-high heat until the vegetables are soft and browned, about 5 minutes.

Add the pigeon pieces and cook over high heat until the meat is nicely browned, about 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and add the wine.  Cook over high heat until the wine evaporates completely, then add a little of the Brown Chicken Stock and cook over medium-high heat.  Meanwhile, spread the slices of bread with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Remove the pigeon pieces from the pot and remove all the bones.  Shred the meat and add the reserved livers and 1 liter of broth.  Soak 2 of the slices of bread in the broth and lay them along the bottom of a casserole.  Sprinkle with some of the cheese and add some of the meat, liver, and stock mixture.  Repeat with the remaining bread, 2 slices at a time, cheese, and meat mixture.  The top layer should be cheese.

Place the casserole in the oven and cook for about 1 hour, adding 1/4 cup of the remaining chicken stock every 15 to 20 minutes.  Serve in bowls with additional cheese grated over, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  4               cups  water
  1                cup  quick cook polenta
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  2             pounds  sweet Italian sausage - (8 links) -- cut 1" pieces
  1              large  portobello mushroom -- stem removed,
                        cap thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped rosemary leaves
  1                cup  red wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring the water to a boil in a 6-quart saucepan.  Pour the polenta in a thin stream into the boiling water and, whisking constantly, cook until it is as thick as porridge.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the oil until it is smoking and add the onion.  Cook until just softened, or 2 to 3 minutes, and add the sausage pieces.  Cook until browned on all sides and drain the fat from the pan.

Add the portobellos, rosemary and red wine and bring to a boil.  Simmer 10 minutes covered, or until sausage is cooked.

Slice pieces of polenta off the board with a knife and place in each of four warmed pasta bowls.  Remove the sausage mixture from the heat, season, to taste, and pour over polenta.  Serve immediately.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- divided
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  1                     carrot -- finely chopped
  1                     celery rib -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  pork sausage -- ground
  1              pound  chicken gizzards, hearts, and cockscombs
  3                     ripe tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
  1                cup  grated young Parmigiano-Reggiano
  2             ounces  dried mushrooms -- soaked to rehydrate,
                        squeezed dry, and chopped
                        === SOFT POLENTA ===
  4               cups  water
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1                cup  polenta or cornmeal
     1/2           cup  stracchino -- cut into cubes

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat and add the onion, carrot, celery and salt and pepper, to taste, and cook until softened and golden brown.  Add the sausage and chicken, and cook until browned.  Stir in the tomatoes and cook until they have broken down and released their juices.

In a separate bowl, combine the mushrooms and cheese.

Prepare the soft polenta according to the recipe and pour 1/3 into a buttered casserole.  Place a few dots of butter from the remaining 2 tablespoons on top of the polenta, then top it with 1/3 of the meat and tomato mixture, then with 1/3 of the cheese and mushroom mixture.  Repeat until all the ingredients are used up.  The top layer should be cheese and mushrooms.  Cook in the oven for 15 minutes and serve.

Soft Polenta:  In a 3-quart saucepan, heat water and salt until boiling.  Drizzle in polenta in a thin stream, whisking constantly, until all polenta is incorporated and mixture begins to thicken.  Switch to a wooden spoon, pull off heat and continue to stir until thick as paste.  Stir in the cheese and continue to stir until it is melted and incorporated.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     center-cut pork chops, 1"-thick
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated horseradish
                        === BAKED TURNIPS ===
  2 1/2         pounds  young turnips -- tops removed
  1 1/2           cups  Besciamella -- (see below)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BESCIAMELLA (BECHAMEL SAUCE) ===
  5        tablespoons  butter
  4        tablespoons  flour
  3               cups  milk
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg

Season the chops with salt and pepper, to taste.  Beat the egg with salt and pepper and dip each chop in the egg and then in the bread crumbs.

In a large skillet, heat the oil over high heat and add the chops, working in batches if necessary, and cook until deep golden brown on both sides, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat the butter over medium-low heat until it melts, then whisk in the flour, stirring constantly until it is dissolved.  Whisk in the Brown Chicken Stock, a little at a time, then stir in the horseradish and cook for 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and pour over the chops.

Baked Turnips:  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Place the turnips in a large pot and cover with water.  Add 2 tablespoons salt, bring to a boil, and cook until tender.  Cut the turnips into 5 pieces each and place in a casserole.  Cover with the Besciamella (Bechamel Sauce) and Parmigiano.  Season with salt and pepper, and cook for 30 minutes, until the besciamella is bubbling and the top is browned.

Besciamella (Bechamel Sauce):  In a medium saucepan, heat butter until melted.  Add flour and stir until smooth.  Over medium heat, cook until light golden brown, about 6 to 7 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat milk in separate pan until just about to boil.  Add milk to butter mixture 1 cup at a time, whisking continuously until very smooth and bring to a boil.  Cook 10 minutes and remove from heat.  Season with salt and nutmeg and set aside.  (Makes 3 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2                     pork shanks, or shins

  6                     juniper berries
  1              whole  clove
  2               cups  dry white wine
  1                cup  veal stock
  1                     green apple -- cored, and
                        cut into julienne
  1                     lemon -- zested, and
                        cut into julienne
  1              bunch  Italian parsley -- leaves picked
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated horseradish
                        === BLAUKRAUTI ===
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  6               cups  chiffonaded (1/2" ribbons) red cabbage
  4                     sage leaves
  1                     garlic clove
  2               cups  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar

Rinse and dry the shanks and remove the hairs and hard skin.  Season with salt and pepper.  In a heavy bottom Dutch oven, heat the lard over medium heat and place the shanks in pan.  Sear until dark golden brown on all sides and remove.

Add the onion, celery, carrot, garlic, rosemary, juniper, and clove and cook until just softening, 4 to 5 minutes, then put the shanks back into pan on top of the vegetables.  Add the wine and stock and bring to boil.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and cover.  Cook for 1 hour and 45 minutes, turning every 1/2 hour.  Meat will be falling off the bone.

In a medium bowl, combine the apple, lemon zest, parsley, and horseradish and mix well by hand.  Sprinkle with a little salt.

Carve the shank into large chunks and serve, topped with gremolata, with Blaukrauti on the side.

Blaukrauti (Italian Sauerkraut):  Place all ingredients in a 6-quart pot and cover.  Bring to a boil over high flame and reduce to simmer.  Cook covered 40 to 50 minutes, stirring frequently or until very tender.  Can be reheated with great success.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Basic Fresg Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
  1 1/2                 pounds starchy potatoes
     1/2                onion -- roughly chopped
     1/8         pound  pancetta -- cut 3 or 4 pieces
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chives
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh marjoram
  1         tablespoon  freshly-grated Montasio, plus
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Montasio
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  poppy seeds

Prepare the Basic Fresg Egg Pasta dough according to the recipe and set aside, wrapped in plastic, while you prepare the stuffing.

In a large stockpot, cover the potatoes with water and bring to a boil.  Cook until they are easily pierced with the end of a paring knife, about 15 minutes.  Drain and, when cool enough to handle but still hot, peel them and run them through a food mill or ricer.  Set aside.

Combine the onion and pancetta in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until both are finely chopped and mingled.  In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil over high heat and add the pancetta and onion mixture.  Cook for 5 minutes over high heat, then stir in the potatoes and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Remove from the heat and turn the mixture into a large bowl.  Mix in the egg yolks, chives, marjoram and 1 tablespoon grated Montasio.  Set aside to cool.

Unwrap the pasta dough and, using a pasta rolling machine, roll it out to the thinnest setting.  Cut 3-inch squares from the dough.  Using a spoon or clean hands, place walnut-sized dollops of the potato mixture onto half of the squares, and top them with the other squares to form the ravioli.  Seal the edges of each raviolo and place them on a baking sheet.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the ravioli in the boiling water until cooked through and tender, about 4 to 5 minutes.  You may need to work in batches.

Meanwhile, in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the butter over medium-high heat until it foams, subsides, and begins to brown.  Add a splash of the pasta cooking water.  Add the cooked ravioli to the pan and toss gently over high heat for 1 minute.  Sprinkle with the poppy seeds and remaining cheese and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     rabbit - (abt 3 1/2 lbs) -- cut into 8 pieces
                        Coarse sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  lard -- divided
     1/2                onion -- finely chopped
  1              pound  Italian Sauerkraut -- (see below)
     1/2      teaspoon  black peppercorns
     1/2           cup  white wine
                        === ITALIAN SAUERKRAUT ===
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  6               cups  red cabbage chiffonade
  4                     sage leaves
  1                     garlic clove
  2               cups  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  salt
                        2     tablespoons    sugar

Rinse the rabbit and pat dry with paper towels.  Season with sea salt and pepper and set aside.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the lard over high heat until it is melted.  Add half of the rabbit pieces, skin-side down, and cook until golden-brown, about 5 minutes.  Turn over and cook until golden brown on the other side.  Remove the browned meat and cook the remaining meat.  Set aside on a plate covered with foil.

Add the remaining lard and heat until it melts.  Add the onion and cook for 2 minutes, until translucent but not browned.  Add the Italian Sauerkraut and peppercorns, reduce the heat to medium and cook for about 8 minutes.  Stir occasionally to keep from sticking.

Return the rabbit pieces to the pan.  Pour the wine into the skillet and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan and cook for 30 minutes.  Serve immediately.

Italian Sauerkraut:  Place all ingredients in a 6-quart pot and cover.  Bring to a boil over high flame and reduce to simmer.  Cook covered 40 to 50 minutes, stirring frequently or until very tender.  Can be reheated with great success.

                      Rice And Peas - {Risi E Bisi}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     shallots -- finely chopped
  2                     celery ribs -- finely chopped
  2             ounces  prosciutto di San Daniele -- chopped 1/8" dice
  1 1/2           cups  arborio rice
                        = (Vialone Nano brand preferred)
  3             quarts  strained warm Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  2             pounds  fresh peas -- shelled
                        = (to yield 1 1/2 cups peas)
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the olive oil, shallots, celery, and prosciutto in a 12- to 14-inch, deep-sided frying pan, and place over medium heat.  Cook until soft but not brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the rice and stir over medium heat for 2 minutes, until rice becomes almost opaque.

Add the Brown Chicken Stock to cover rice and turn heat up to high.  As level of stock dips below level of rice, continue to add stock, 1 ladle at a time, to keep rice covered.  Stir the rice constantly during this procedure.

Taste the rice after 15 minutes; it should still be hard.  Add the peas and continue cooking, until the rice is soft and creamy yet still "al dente".  Rice should still be quite wet, but not swimming.  Remove from heat and stir in butter and cheese.  Adjust for seasoning and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Arborio rice
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cut into chunks
     1/2           cup  ricotta -- strained
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  2                     eggs
     1/2           cup  milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  butter -- for greasing pan
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  flour
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt.  Add the rice and cook in the boiling water for 12 minutes, then strain, and place in a large bowl.  Add the 2 tablespoons of butter, a bit at a time, then stir in the ricotta and Parmigiano-Reggiano.  In a small bowl, beat 1 of the eggs with the milk and stir it into the mixture.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Butter a 10-inch cake pan with the remaining butter and dust it with the bread crumbs and a pinch of salt.

Form a small mound of the flour on your work surface and make a well in the center.  Pour the olive oil and remaining egg into the center of the well and beat to combine, then slowly begin to incorporate the flour to form a smooth, elastic dough.

Roll the dough out into a 3-inch wide strip that will fit around the entire inside rim of the cake pan, acting as a "border".  Fit the dough into the pan and fill the pan with the rice mixture.  Bake in the oven for 40 minutes, then remove and allow to cool to room temperature before slicing and serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  asparagus -- rough ends removed
     1/4         pound  speck -- cut 1/2" dice
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- chopped 1/8" dice
  1 1/2           cups  rice
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley

Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Set up ice bath nearby.  Blanch the asparagus for 1 minute, place in an ice bath, and reserve the asparagus cooking water.  Once the asparagus is cooled, drain and cut into 1-inch lengths.  Set aside.

In a heavy-bottomed skillet with 3-inch sides, combine the speck, olive oil and onion and cook over medium heat until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes.  Add the rice and, stirring constantly, cook until the rice turns opaque, about 2 minutes.

Add the asparagus cooking water until it covers the rice.  Turn the heat up to high, stirring constantly, and cook the rice until the liquid level goes below the level of the rice.  Continue adding the warm asparagus cooking liquid, 1 ladle at a time, to maintain the liquid level above the rice for 15 minutes.

Add the asparagus to the rice and cook until the rice is soft but still al dente.  Remove from heat, add butter, Parmigiano and parsley and stir through.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  dried kidney beans
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  pork shoulder -- fat trimmed,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4         pound  speck -- finely diced
  3              large  sage leaves -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
  4                     garlic clove -- peeled, minced

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SOFT POLENTA ===
  4               cups  water
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1                cup  polenta or cornmeal
     1/2           cup  stracchino -- cut into cubes
                        === SALUME ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  12            slices  red-wine cured salume or sopresatta
     1/3           cup  red wine
  2        tablespoons  good-quality red wine vinegar

Soft Polenta:  In a 3-quart saucepan, heat water and salt until boiling.  Drizzle in polenta in a thin stream, whisking constantly, until all polenta is incorporated and mixture begins to thicken.  Switch to a wooden spoon, pull off heat and continue to stir until thick as paste.  Stir in the cheese and continue to stir until it is melted and incorporated.

Salume:  Place the olive oil in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan and heat over high heat until almost smoking.  Add the salume and cook for 2 minutes, until it is browned and crisped, then turn and cook on the other side.  Remove the salume to a plate and add the wine to the pan.  Swirl over high heat to reduce for 2 minutes, then add the vinegar, and reduce another 2 minutes, until the liquids turn syrupy.

Divide the polenta evenly among 4 plates and lay some salami over each portion.  Serve with red wine.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/4           cup  dry white wine, like Soave

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Season the fillets well with salt and pepper.  Using parchment paper, fashion 4 packages for two fillets each.

Place 2 fillets in the center of each piece of parchment paper.  Drizzle with some of the olive oil and divide the onion, garlic, pepper, and fennel fronds evenly among the packages.  Sprinkle each fillet with some of the wine, seal the packages by folding the paper over, and, if necessary, sealing the edges with beaten egg whites.

Place each package on a baking tray and cook in the oven for 10 minutes.  Remove the packages, slash with a knife to let the steam escape and serve the fish and its cooking liquids immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  10                    garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2                     onions -- finely chopped
  4                     celery ribs -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1                cup  dry white wine
  3               cups  water
  1              small  sole -- cleaned
  1                     red rock fish -- cleaned
  1                     small eel -- cleaned, peeled
  1                     red mullet -- cleaned
  24                    mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley

In a stockpot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and add the garlic and onion.  Cook over medium-high heat until the onion and garlic are slightly browned and softened, about 5 minutes.  Add celery and cook 5 minutes more.  Stir in the vinegar and reduce it to almost nothing.

Add the wine and 3 cups of water and bring to a boil.  Carefully place the fish into the liquid with 1/2 the parsley and reduce the heat to a high simmer.  Cover loosely and cook until the fish is completely cooked through, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Note that you will not stir this.  The fish should be served whole.  During the last 5 minutes of cooking, add the mussels.  When the mussels open, stir in the remaining parsley and serve immediately, drizzled with additional olive oil if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

               Shrimp In A Pancake - {Crespelle Di Scampi)

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  eggs -- plus
  6                     egg yolks -- beaten
  6               cups  milk -- divided
  1 1/4           cups  flour -- divided
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5        tablespoons  butter -- plus more,
                        for greasing
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  1              pound  small shrimp -  (26/30) -- peeled
     1/4           cup  prosecco
     1/4           cup  tomato puree
     1/4         pound  ricotta salata -- shredded

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a large bowl, combine the whole eggs, 1 cup of the milk, 3/4 cup of the flour, and a pinch of salt and pepper.  Mix well with a whisk and set aside in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a medium stock pot, melt 5 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat.  Whisk in the remaining 1/2 cup flour and cook over medium heat 5 minutes, whisking constantly.

In a separate pot, heat the remaining milk over medium heat until it is warm but not scalded.  Slowly whisk the warm milk and the beaten egg yolks into the butter and flour mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly.  Cook this mixture over medium heat, stirring, until it thickens to the consistency of chowder.  Remove from heat and set aside.

Remove the crepe batter from the refrigerator and stir.  Heat a non-stick pan over high heat and pour in enough of the batter to just coat the pan.  Cook for 1 minute, then flip and cook for an additional minute.  Set the crepe aside and continue with the remaining batter until it is all used up.  Set aside.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil over high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion and cook for 2 minutes, until softened.  Add the shrimp and cook until they are just pink, about 2 minutes.  Add the prosecco and tomato puree and cook over high heat an additional 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and remove from heat.

Lightly butter or grease a 10-inch round terracotta casserole and line the bottom with a few crepes.  Spread about 1/3 cup of the bechamel over the crepes, then top with some of the shrimp.  Repeat this layering process until all ingredients are used up.  Top with the ricotta salata and bake, uncovered, for 20 minutes, until cheese is bubbling and bechamel has firmed into a custard-like consistency.  Let cool 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  water
  3                     bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  coarse salt
  1 1/2           cups  coarse yellow cornmeal
     1/2                celery rib -- coarsely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  rock shrimp
  2          teaspoons  tomato paste
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped Italian parsley

In a heavy-bottomed saucepot, combine the water, 1 of the bay leaves, and salt and bring to a simmer over medium heat.  Gradually whisk the cornmeal into the pot, a little at a time, stirring constantly.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir constantly until the polenta is smooth and thick, about 30 minutes.  Remove the bay leaf.  Turn the polenta into a serving bowl and keep warm.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the celery and garlic, and process to form a smooth paste.  Set aside.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and add the onion.  Saute until softened and slightly browned, about 3 minutes, then add the celery and garlic, and remaining 2 bay leaves.  Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the tomato paste and wine, mix well, and cook for 5 minutes.

Add the shrimp and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Add a bit of water if necessary to keep the mixture from getting too thick, cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the shrimp are tender but cooked through.

Remove the bay leaves and stir in the parsley.  Serve immediately with the warm polenta.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fritters

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  acorn or butternut squash -- seeded, and
                        cut into 3 slices, horizontally
     1/4           cup  raisins -- soaked in water
                        to rehydrate and drained
     1/2           cup  flour
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1              pinch  salt
  1              quart  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Place the squash in a roasting pan and add 1/2 cup water.  Roast in the oven, uncovered, for 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and, when cool enough to handle, wrap the squash in cheese cloth and squeeze to release all excess water.

Scrape the squash from the rind and place in a large bowl.  Add the raisins, flour, yeast, lemon juice and salt and mix well to form a sticky dough.  Let cool in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Heat the oil to 375 degrees in a tall-sided pot.

Using 2 spoons, form 2-inch dumplings from the squash mixture and fry in the olive oil until golden brown and floating, working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.  Once cooked, remove with a slotted spoon and set on a plate lined with paper towels to drain.  Dust with powdered sugar and serve.

This recipe yields 30 fritters, about 6 to 8 servings.

            Squash Gnocchi With Marjoram - {Gnocchi Di Zucca}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  acorn squash
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  fresh marjoram leaves
  4                     radicchio leaves -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated smoked ricotta

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut the squash in half or thirds and place on aluminum foil in the oven.  Bake until tender when pierced with a fork, usually 30 to 35 minutes.  Remove from the oven and, when it is cool enough to handle, scoop out and discard the seeds and membrane.  Scoop the flesh into a strainer placed over a large bowl.  Place in the refrigerator so that the squash cools and the liquid drains away.  Leave for at least 6 hours or overnight.

Pass the drained squash through a ricer and then transfer to a large bowl.  Add the eggs and salt.  Stir well and add the flour, a little at a time, stirring to amalgamate all the ingredients.  The result should be soft but not runny.

Bring a large pot of cold water to a boil.  Add a pinch of salt and allow the water to return to a boil.  With a teaspoon, scoop up some of the dough.  Use your fingers to form the gnoccho, which should be about the size and shape of a spoon.

Cook the gnocchi in the boiling water and cook until they rise to the top of the pot.  While the gnocchi cook, heat the butter over medium-high heat until it foams and subsides.  Add the marjoram and radicchio and saute over high heat for 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Drain the cooked gnocchi and add them to the pan with the radicchio.  Toss very gently to coat.  Divide the dressed gnocchi evenly among 4 warmed pasta bowls, top with the grated ricotta and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  double goose breast -- bone removed
  4                     juniper berries -- smashed
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2             medium  onions -- chopped 1/4" dice
  3                     green apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped into 1" dice
  2        tablespoons  caraway seeds
  2                     boiled potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" cubes
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  1              pinch  cloves
  1                     egg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Lay the goose breast out in a baking pan.  In a mixing bowl, stir together the juniper, rosemary, 1/4 cup of the olive oil and vinegar and pour over the breast.  Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.

In a 14-inch saute pan, heat the remaining oil over medium heat and add onions.  Cook until softened, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the apples, caraway and cooked potatoes and cook another 10 minutes, or until apples have started to soften.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.  Add the bread crumbs, parsley, cloves, and egg and season with salt and pepper.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Remove the goose from the marinade, brush off and pat dry.  Season with salt and pepper and lay flat on cutting board.  Lay the stuffing out evenly over the goose and roll up like a jelly roll.  Tie securely with butcher's twine and place in roasting pan.

Roast in oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees.   Remove, allow to rest 10 minutes, then carve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  2             pounds  calamari -- cleaned, and
                        sliced into rings
  4                     garlic clove -- thinly sliced, plus
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  hot chile flakes
  6                     red bell peppers -- tops cut off,
                        pith, and seeds removed
  2             pounds  fresh or canned tomatoes -- peeled, and
                        roughly chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped Italian parsley

In a large saute pan, heat 1/4-cup of the olive oil over high heat until smoking.  Add the calamari, sliced garlic, and chile flakes, and cook for 1 hour, until the calamari is tender.  Remove and set aside.

In a large skillet, heat the remaining oil until smoking.  Add the peppers and cook until they are soft and browned, turning occasionally to cook evenly.  Once they are soft, remove and drain on paper towels.

Remove most of the oil from the pan and add the tomatoes, chopped garlic, reserved calamari, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Cook over high heat for 5 minutes, then remove from heat, and stuff the mixture into the peppers.  Top with parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fillet of sole
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/4           cups  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour, seasoned with
                        salt and pepper
  1                     Spanish onion -- chopped 1/2" dice
     1/2           cup  currants
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
  1 1/2           cups  red wine vinegar

Heat 1 cup of the oil to 375 degrees in a deep saucepan.

Season the sole fillets with salt and pepper.  Dredge the fillets in the seasoned flour and fry in the hot oil until golden brown.  Remove and drain on paper towels.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the remaining 1/4 cup oil over medium heat.  Add the onions and cook until softened and just light brown, 10 to 12 minutes.  Add the currants, sugar, pine nuts, and vinegar and bring to boil.  Cook 5 to 6 minutes until currants are soft, then allow to cool.

When all the ingredients are cool, choose an earthenware dish that just fits the fried fillets, slightly overlapping.  Top with the sweet and sour mixture and refrigerate for 24 hours.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  4               cups  red wine vinegar
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  4        tablespoons  salt
  2             pounds  red grapes -- chopped roughly in

     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     yellow onion -- peeled, chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  caraway seeds

Place the turnips in a 2-gallon ceramic jar.  In a mixing bowl, stir together the water, vinegar, sugar, salt and crushed grapes and pour over turnips.  Cover and refrigerate for 48 hours.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  veal breast
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             pounds  apples -- cored, and
                        cut into 6 slices each
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1                cup  red wine
  1              liter  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
                        === SOFT POLENTA ===
  4               cups  water
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1                cup  polenta or cornmeal
     1/2           cup  cubed stracchino cheese

Season the veal breast all over with salt and pepper.  Roll the meat over on itself and tie off with butcher's twine to form a roll.

In a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over high heat until smoking.  Add the meat and sear on all sides until dark golden brown.  This should take about 15 minutes.  Remove the meat and set aside.

Add the apples and flour to the pan and cook, stirring to coat the apples with the flour, for 3 minutes.  Add the cinnamon, red wine and chicken stock and scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to dislodge any browned bits.  Season with salt and pepper, bring to a boil, add the veal breast, reduce to a simmer and cook for 2 hours, until the meat is very tender.  Remove the meat and set aside.

Once the braising liquid has cooled for 10 to 15 minutes, place in a blender or food processor and puree.  Slice the meat and serve with the puree poured over, and polenta on the side.

Soft Polenta:  In a 3-quart saucepan, heat water and salt until boiling.  Drizzle in polenta in a thin stream, whisking constantly, until all polenta is incorporated and mixture begins to thicken.  Switch to a wooden spoon, pull off heat and continue to stir until thick as paste.  Stir in the cheese and continue to stir until it is melted and incorporated.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Season the veal breast all over with salt and pepper.  Roll the meat over on itself and tie off with butcher&apos;s twine to form a roll.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over high heat until smoking.  Add the meat and sear on all sides until dark golden brown.  This should take about 15 minutes.  Remove the meat and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the apples and flour to the pan and cook, stirring to coat the apples with the flour, for 3 minutes.  Add the cinnamon, red wine and chicken stock and scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to dislodge any browned bits.  Season with salt and pepper, bring to a boil, add the veal breast, reduce to a simmer and cook for 2 hours, until the meat is very tender.  Remove the meat and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Once the braising liquid has cooled for 10 to 15 minutes, place in a blender or food processor and puree.  Slice the meat and serve with the puree poured over, and polenta on the side.

Soft Polenta:  In a 3-quart saucepan, heat water and salt until boiling.  Drizzle in polenta in a thin stream, whisking constantly, until all polenta is incorporated and mixture begins to thicken.  Switch to a wooden spoon, pull off heat and continue to stir until thick as paste.  Stir in the cheese and continue to stir until it is melted and incorporated.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/4         pound  fontina cheese -- shredded
     1/4         pound  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus more
                        for serving
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs
                        Grated zest of 1/2 lemon
                        Grated zest of 1/4 orange
  1                cup  unsalted butter

Prepare the Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough according to the recipe.

Soak the raisins in the rum to rehydrate.  In a large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until the yolks are pale.  Add the fontina, Parmigiano-Reggiano, hydrated raisins, and bread crumbs, mixing well.  Add the citrus zests and mix well by hand.  Set aside.

Roll the pasta out to the second-thickest setting on a pasta-rolling machine.  Using a biscuit cutter or water glass, cut 3-inch circles from the dough.  Spoon tablespoonfuls of the filling onto the center of half of the circles and top each filled circle with an unfilled circle, pressing to release any air bubbles before sealing the edges with moistened fingertips.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a small saucepan, heat the butter over medium heat to melt and warm it through.

Cook the krafi in the boiling water until tender and cooked through, about 6 minutes.  Drain the pasta and turn out into a serving bowl.  Drizzle the melted butter over, top with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

           Wheat Noodles With Anchovy Sauce - {Bigoli En Salsa}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Bigoli Noodles -- (see below)
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  8                     salted anchovies -- filleted, and
                        soaked in milk for 2 hours
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
                        === BIGOLI NOODLES ===
  4               cups  whole wheat flour -- plus a little more
                        for bench flour
  4                     eggs
     1/2           cup  warm milk -- with
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted in

Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Place the noodles in boiling water, and allow 8 to 9 minutes to cook.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, place the oil, anchovies, and onion over medium heat and cook.  Stir often to break up the anchovies until a paste is formed, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Drain the pasta and toss into the pan.  Add the parsley, toss over high heat 1 minute and place on a plate.  Serve immediately.

Bigoli Noodles:  To make the dough, make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and milk mixture.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and milk mixture and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any leftover crusty bits.  Discard these bits.  Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

To shape the Bigoli:  Knead dough until smooth and tight, and let rest 20 minutes.  (Note: Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe.  They are essential for a light pasta.)  Cut the dough into 6 pieces, and run each piece through a meat grinder set to the smallest extrusion size.  As the pasta exits, cut it into 12-inch pieces and immediately dust with flour.  Lay out onto a cookie sheet dusted with cornmeal, being careful to keep the strands separate.  Finish all 6 pieces the same way.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Lasagne Dough -- (see below)
  2        tablespoons  poppy seeds
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  browned butter
                        Montasio cheese -- for grating
                        === LASAGNE DOUGH ===
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour - (to 4)
  2                     eggs -- plus
  5                     egg yolks
     1/2      teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil

Prepare the lasagne dough according to the recipe and cut into 1/2-inch strips.  Cover with a damp towel until ready to cook.

On a concave cutting board or in a mortar and pestle, combine the poppy seeds and sugar and crush with a mezzelune or pestle to make a sandy mixture.  Place the mixture in a large bowl and add the browned butter.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Add the pasta and cook until tender yet al dente, about 2 minutes.  Drain the pasta and add it to the bowl with the butter mixture.  Toss well to coat the noodles.  Serve immediately with the Montasio grated over.

Lasagne Dough:  Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and the olive oil.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Roll or shape as desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.
