Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10                    mackerel fillets
     1/2           cup  rice or white flour -- mixed with
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
                        Canola oil -- for saute
                        === TOMATO SAUCE ===
  1                cup  sliced sweet onion
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
     1/2           cup  vinegar (rice or cider)
  8              large  tomatoes -- peeled and chopped

Cook onions in a stainless pan to release juices and simmer, do not brown, oil is not necessary.  Add garlic and cook for 2 minutes, add vinegar, turn up heat and reduce to half.  Then add tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, puree and adjust seasonings. 

Fillets should be halved to cut out blood line and bones that run from head of fillet to tail. 

Dredge mackerel fillets in flour and cornmeal.  Saute over high heat in just enough oil not to burn, 1 1/2 minutes per side.  Remove fish and wipe out pan.  Return fish and add sauce.  Cook in pan for 2 minutes more. 

Serve with citrus corn relish and steamed potatoes or pasta. 

Optional:  Add 1 tablespoon of lime juice mixed with 1 teaspoon of hot pepper paste to the sauce. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             medium  whole herring or 16 fillets -- with skin on
  8             ounces  bread crumbs
  5             ounces  butter
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme
  1                     garlic clove -- grated
  1                     egg -- beaten
     1/4      teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  2             ounces  lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste

If whole herring were purchased, scale and then fillet the fish.  Leave the skin on.  Wash the fillets that you prepared or purchased and pat dry. 

To make the stuffing combine bread crumbs, 3 ounces of softened butter, parsley, thyme and garlic in a bowl.  Stir lightly until mixed. 

Mix the eggs, lemon zest and lemon juice in a separate bowl.  Add egg mixture to the crumbs and mix.  Add salt if desired. 

Place half of the herring fillets on a well-oiled baking sheet skin-side down.  Top each fillet with 1 1/2 ounces of stuffing and spread it evenly over the length of the fillet.  Place the second fillet on top and press down lightly.  Brush the fish with the remaining melted butter. 

Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until fish turns opaque and flakes easily when tested with a fork. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                          Baked Stuffed Lobster

Recipe By     :Dave Schaper, White Cap Fish Company, Islip, NY
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     live lobsters - (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 lbs ea)
  3               cups  soft bread crumbs
  4        tablespoons  lite margarine -- melted
  2        tablespoons  grated onions
  1                     garlic clove

Boil live lobsters for 8 to 10 minutes.  Lobsters should not be fully cooked at this stage of preparation because they will finish cooking in the oven.  Remove lobsters from the boiling water and immediately place them in cold water for several minutes to stop cooking. 

When the lobsters are cool enough to handle comfortably, split each lobster lengthwise and remove the green tomally and red and pink coral. 

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Make a stuffing by mixing bread crumbs, margarine, onion and garlic together.  (You can get creative with this basic stuffing mixture and add other ingredients such as herbs like parsley or tarragon or grated Parmesan cheese to customize this recipe to your own personal taste.)  Place stuffing in the body cavities and spread over the tail meat. 

Place the lobsters in a shallow baking pan, stuffing-side up and bake for 15 to 20 minutes (until golden brown). 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    live hard-shell blue crabs
     1/2           cup  Old Bay or other seafood seasoning
  2               cups  Water and/or beer

Use a steamer or large pot with a rack and tight fitting lid.  Pour water and/or beer into steamer and bring to a boil.  Add crabs -- a few at a time -- and sprinkle each layer of crabs with seasonings.  Steam crabs for 15 to 20 minutes. 

PICKING THE CRAB MEAT:  A little practice will enable you to remove the meat from the crabs with minimal difficulty.  You will need a small, heavy, sharp kitchen knife and a mallet.  Spread out the newspapers and start right in.  You'll find the meat in the body sections where the legs attach to the body and in the claws. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Use a steamer or large pot with a rack and tight fitting lid.  Pour water and/or beer into steamer and bring to a boil.  Add crabs -- a few at a time -- and sprinkle each layer of crabs with seasonings.  Steam crabs for 15 to 20 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;PICKING THE CRAB MEAT:  A little practice will enable you to remove the meat from the crabs with minimal difficulty.  You will need a small, heavy, sharp kitchen knife and a mallet.  Spread out the newspapers and start right in.  You&apos;ll find the meat in the body sections where the legs attach to the body and in the claws.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  bluefish - (2 fillets) -- skinned, or
                        with skin on, scaled
     1/2           cup  Dijon or coarse-grained mustard
                        Juice and grated zest of 1 lime
  1         tablespoon  olive or peanut oil
  1             medium  to large fresh ripe tomato -- coarsely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Lime wedges

Mix together the mustard, lime juice and zest, salt and pepper.  Preheat the broiler pan with the oil, and lay the bluefish on it.  Brush it with the mustard-lime mixture.  Broil about 6 inches from the heat source for 6 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish (bluefish is white throughout when done; peek between the layers of the flesh with a thin-bladed knife). 

Sprinkle with the tomato and return to the broiler for 1 minute.  Serve immediately, with lime wedges. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Substitutes:  Any rich tasting fish will be nicely complemented by this treatment.  Try fillets or steaks of mackerel or striped bass.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  cape shark (dogfish) -- cut into
                        four 3-oz portions
  1                     fennel bulb with green leaves
                        and stems attached
  2               cups  homemade chicken broth
                        (or one 14 1/2-oz can chicken broth)
  1                     garlic clove
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1                     carrot -- for garnish

Divide cape shark into serving-size portions, discarding any remaining bony-looking cartilage.  For appearance sake, thin red edges (which are edible) may also be trimmed. 

Rinse fennel and cut off leaves and stems near top of bulb.  Slice bulb into 1/2-inch thick cross-sections and set aside.  Reserving leaves for garnish, coarsely chop remaining bulb, leaves and stems to yield approximately 1/2 cup. 

In a 2-quart saucepan, heat chicken broth, chopped fennel and garlic until boiling.  Reduce heat to simmer, add fish, cover and poach gently (liquid should just "quiver") for 10 minutes or until flesh is opaque and white. 

Using tongs or slotted metal spatula, carefully transfer cape shark from hot liquid to heatproof dish; keep warm.  Stir cream into poaching liquid, raise heat to medium and cook, uncovered, for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until sauce is reduced by about one-half (should have consistency of syrup). 

While liquid is reducing, heat oil in large skillet.  SautÈ fennel slices, turning once, until tender-crisp (15 to 20 minutes).  Divide fennel slices among four dinner plates; top with cape shark.  When sauce is reduced, strain and pour over fish.  Garnish each plate with festive "flowers" crafted from the fresh carrot. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  bluefish fillets or steaks
     1/4           cup  melted butter or margarine
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2      teaspoon  mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  lemon-pepper seasoning
     1/8      teaspoon  tarragon
     1/8      teaspoon  rosemary

Make spicy marinade by melting butter or margarine in a small pan.  Add white wine, mustard, salt, lemon pepper, tarragon and rosemary.  Cook over low heat until seasonings are blended and the mixture is warm. 

To grill the bluefish make a fire with charcoal briquets.  When coals are white hot spread them evenly over the bottom of the grill.  Rinse fish, pat dry and cut into serving-size pieces.  Place fish in well-oiled hinged wire hand grill. 

Baste fish with spicy marinade and place wire hand grill about 4 inches from the hot coals.  Cook for about 5 minutes, baste the fish and turn the hand grill.  Continue to cook, turn and baste the fish until it is done and flakes easily.  Approximately 10 to 15 minutes. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  40                    littleneck clams
  20             small  new potatoes - (1 1/2" dia)
  1           teaspoon  seafood seasoning (Old Bay, for example)
  1                     roasting pan/ 15" by 11" by 3"

  8                     corn ears -- unhusked
     1/2         pound  butter -- drawn (optional)

Preheat grill on high.  Scrub the clams and the potatoes. 

Put 1/2-inch of water in the bottom of the roasting pan and add Old Bay seasoning.  Lay corn in the bottom of the pan (trim the corn slightly if necessary to fit in the pan). 

Put the potatoes in around the outside edge of the corn, against the vertical wall to form a border or frame for the clams.  Place scrubbed clams in the center on top of the corn. 

Cover pan tightly with foil to retain heat and steam.  Place in closed grill for 30 minutes.  You may have to scrunch the aluminum pan a little to enable the lid to go down. 

Check after 20 minutes.  If clams are steamed open, shut off the grill. 

Serve with parsley and drawn butter (optional). 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Bill Zeller, Captree Clams, West Babylon, NY
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  24                    littleneck clams (or Long Island oysters)
  1                     chicken bouillon cube
  1         tablespoon  grated Parmesan cheese
  4        tablespoons  light olive oil
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
  2             slices  bacon
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/8           cup  dry white wine
     1/3           cup  clam juice
                        Paprika -- to taste
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish

Shuck the little neck clams, reserve clam juice and leave clams "on the half shell", (if unfamiliar with opening clams, ask your fish market for assistance.  Be sure to have them save the clam juice for you.) 

Place clams on a broiler pan.  Dissolve the chicken bullion cube in 1 cup of hot water and set aside. 

Cut bacon into small pieces and brown in a frying pan, drain fat.  Add olive oil and chopped garlic to bacon, cook for 2 more minutes.  Add white wine, Parmesan cheese, clam juice and bread crumbs.  Stir until mixed.  Slowly stir in enough chicken broth to thoroughly moisten the mixture making an almost soupy consistency. 

Place a teaspoonful of the mixture onto opened clams (distribute any leftover mixture on top of the clams) and sprinkle with paprika.  Place under broiler 5 minutes or until nicely browned.  Remove and serve with lemon wedges as garnish. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  hake fillets
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  2                     lemons
  3        tablespoons  soft margarine or butter
  2             medium  onions
  4        tablespoons  dry white wine
  1           teaspoon  mixed herbs
     1/2           cup  unseasoned bread crumbs

Grease a small, deep oven-proof baking pan with a little margarine to prevent sticking.  Rinse hake filets under cold running water and pat dry.  Slice the lemons into very thin slices and remove the seeds.  Peel and thinly slice the onions. 

You will be creating four layers of alternating hake, lemon and onions.  To form the first, spread one-fourth of the hake evenly over the bottom.  Top the hake with one-fourth of the lemons and then add a layer of onions using one-fourth of them.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the wine on top.  This completes the first layer. 

Arrange three more layers exactly like the first using up all the ingredients.  Sprinkle the herbs, parsley and ground pepper on the top.  Complete the loaf by spreading the bread crumbs over it and evenly distributing the remaining margarine over the top.  Bake in a 400 degree oven for about a half hour. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     herring fillet - (4 to 6 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  butter -- melted
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh dill
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1              pinch  marjoram
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped shallots
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2                     lemon slices -- thinly sliced,
                        with seeds removed
                        Parchment paper -- for cooking

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Cut out a piece of parchment paper in a heart shape.  Make sure the paper is large enough to hold the herring fillet with sufficient room for crimping the edges when folded in half. 

Brush the parchment paper with the vegetable oil and place on a work surface oil-side down.  Place the herring fillet on the right side of the heart shaped paper.  Brush the fillet with melted butter and sprinkle with dill, parsley, marjoram, chopped shallots, salt and white pepper.  Lay lemon slices on top. 

Fold the paper over the fish and crimp tightly to enclose the fish.  Place the folded package in a cold ovenproof frying pan and start to heat the pan slowly.  As soon as the paper starts to puff, place the pan in the oven. 

Bake for 5 to 8 minutes until parchment if puffed and brown.  Cut paper open and serve while hot. 

This recipe yields 1 serving.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Cut out a piece of parchment paper in a heart shape.  Make sure the paper is large enough to hold the herring fillet with sufficient room for crimping the edges when folded in half. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Brush the parchment paper with the vegetable oil and place on a work surface oil-side down.  Place the herring fillet on the right side of the heart shaped paper.  Brush the fillet with melted butter and sprinkle with dill, parsley, marjoram, chopped shallots, salt and white pepper.  Lay lemon slices on top. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Fold the paper over the fish and crimp tightly to enclose the fish.  Place the folded package in a cold ovenproof frying pan and start to heat the pan slowly.  As soon as the paper starts to puff, place the pan in the oven. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Bake for 5 to 8 minutes until parchment if puffed and brown.  Cut paper open and serve while hot.

                         Historical Fish Chowder

Recipe By     :Alice Ross
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chowder                         Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR FISH STOCK ===
  2             pounds  fish scraps (frames or bones,
                        heads, collars, etc.)
                        Water -- to cover fish
                        === FOR CHOWDER ===
  3             pounds  fish -- cut into 2" cubes,
                        Additional shellfish -- to taste (optional)
  1        small piece  salt pork
  3             medium  onions -- peeled, and
                        cut into large pieces
  4             medium  potatoes - (to 5) -- scrubbed, peeled,
                        and coarsely cut
  1              sprig  lovage -- to taste (optional)
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  cream
  1            handful  old-style oyster crackers - (to 2) -- whole or crushed
                        Salt -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Oyster crackers -- to serve on the
                        side

To prepare stock:  Place fish scraps in a soup kettle with just enough water to cover.  Bring to a boil.  Simmer 20 minutes until there is a mild stock.  Strain and save stock.  Discard strained pieces of fish and bone. 

Meanwhile, soak salt pork to remove some salt. 

To prepare chowder:  Dice presoaked salt pork into 1/2-inch cubes.  In the rinsed soup kettle, render salt pork over a medium heat.  Remove crispy fried pork bits and reserve to be used as a garnish.  Drain most of the rendered fat, leaving a small amount in pot. 

SautÈ onions in fat until transparent and wilted.  Add potatoes. Pour in fish stock to cover, adding water if stock is insufficient.  Simmer over medium-low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until potatoes are just done. 

Add fish, seafood and oyster crackers.  Bring just to a boil.  Simmer briefly (2 to 3 minutes) or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.  Add milk and cream.  Heat to serving temperature being careful to not boil.  Taste and correct salt, if necessary.  Add ground pepper to taste. 

Serve hot with additional whole oyster crackers and reserved pork cracklins as garnish. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 

Seafood Options:  Be creative! 3 pounds of fish.  Try cod, hake, pollock, monkfish, blackfish, or halibut.  You may also want to add shellfish such as shrimp, scallops, or shucked clams or oysters. 

Comments:  This recipe, provided by Alice Ross, a Long Island food historian, represents one of our traditional fish chowder preparations.  While some question which variation (cream or no cream) might be the most authentic recipe, you will find a simple and hearty meal in this satisfying recipe.  One very traditional variation called for all ingredients to be added in layers, producing more of a seafood pie.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     herring fillets - (abt 1 lb total) -- with skin on
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  sherry wine vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne Pepper -- or to taste
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced garlic
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced shallots
     1/4           cup  medium-diced roasted red peppers
  5                     Bliss potatoes -- medium diced
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary -- chopped

Preheat a broiler and broil the fish fillets about 6 inches from the heat source for 3 to 4 minutes until lightly browned (the fillet should just begin to turn opaque and begin to flake).  Remove from heat. 

Toss potatoes with marinade, diced roasted peppers, chopped rosemary and shallots.  Place potato salad on a platter, place the fillets over the salad and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  mussels
     1/2         pound  steamers (soft shell clams)
  8                     littleneck clams (hard shell clams)
  8                     shrimp - (26/30) -- in the shell
  2                     lobsters - (1 1/4 lbs ea)
  2               ears  fresh corn -- in the husk
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1                cup  white cooking wine

Rinse the shellfish and remove the beards from the mussels.  Place one half of the mussels, steamers, clams, and shrimp into a muslin sack (a 12- by 12-inch piece of cheesecloth may be used).  Place the shellfish on the cloth and form a loose sack by tying the opposite corners into a knot.  If the cloth is tied too tightly the shellfish may not open during cooking.  Place remainder of the shellfish into another sack and put them aside. 

Add three quarts of water in a pot large enough to hold all of the ingredients.  Place pot on stove over high heat.  When the water reaches a boil, place the lobsters (head first) into the water and cover the pot.  After seven minutes, add corn, sacks of shellfish, wine and garlic.  Re-cover the pot and boil for an additional five minutes. 

Remove the lobster and split it in half lengthwise.  Place the 1/2 lobster, 1 ear of corn and a shellfish sack into a large bowl for each person.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  mussels -- steamed in wine,
                        cooled, and removed from shells
  2               cups  long grain rice
  4               cups  hot broth from steaming mussels
                        (add chicken broth if needed)
  3        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  finely-chopped onions
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1                     green pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
  1                cup  diced cooked smoked ham
  2               cups  canned plum tomatoes -- well drained
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Hot pepper sauce -- to taste

Steam mussels in about 1 cup of white wine until they open and are plump.  Remove from the shells.  Reserve mussel meats and discard the shells.  Save all cooking liquid from steaming the mussels. 

Saute onions and garlic in butter and olive oil for about 3 to 4 minutes in a medium-size soup pot or Dutch oven for this dish.  Add dry rice, stir carefully, making sure rice kernels are well coated and slightly golden.  Add half of the broth, stir and cook over medium heat for about 2 minutes.  Add green pepper, celery, ham, tomatoes, and spices.  Add remaining 2 cups of broth.  Cover and cook over medium-low heat until the rice has absorbed the liquid (about 15 minutes).  Taste for seasoning and add additional broth if the rice seems dry. 

Carefully mix in all of the steamed mussels and any accumulated juices.  Cover and keep warm in the oven until serving.  Provide a generous helping of chopped parsley with each serving. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  porgies or scup -- whole, dressed
                        Cooking oil
                        Cornmeal, white stone ground if available
                        Butter or margarine
                        Lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Wash and remove excess moisture from fish by patting dry with a paper towel.  Place a handful of cornmeal in a strong paper or plastic sack and place fish one or two at a time into the sack and shake it to coat the fish. 

Heat oil in a skillet until hot.  Place fish in skillet after shaking off excess cornmeal.  Adjust heat so that fish fry quickly but do not burn.  Using a turner and fork if necessary turn fish when the edges are crisp and brown.  Cook 2 to 3 minutes more to brown the second side. 

Remove cooked fish and place on a paper towel to drain.  Immediately run a pat of butter or dab of margarine over each fish and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste.  Serve as soon as possible. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                           Roast Whole Bluefish

Recipe By     :Shirley King
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bluefish - (abt 3 lbs) -- dressed and scaled
                        with gills removed, fins left on
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped or grated fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                     lemon -- sliced
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lemon rind
  1                     tomato -- cut in wedges
     1/2         bunch  parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Dry white wine, as needed
                        Aluminum foil

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Lay the onion in a baking pan large enough for the whole fish and toss with olive oil.  Roast the onions while you prepare the fish.  Combine the chopped parsley, ginger, garlic, lemon rind and salt in a small bowl.  Place the mixture inside the cavity of the fish. 

Take the baking pan out of the oven and lay the fish on top of the onions.  Rub olive oil all over the fish, head to tail, to protect the skin and keep it moist.  Pour white wine on top of fish until there is 1/8- to 1/4-inch of wine in baking pan. 

Wrap the head and tail of the fish with aluminum foil so they don't burn.  Take an 8- by 12-inch piece of foil, lift up the head and slide the foil under it.  Bring the edges of the foil together, and pinch or fold them over, leaving a space of 2 inches above the head.  (This space is necessary so the heat will circulate but not burn the head.)  Fold another piece of foil over the tail. 

Roast the fish for about 35 minutes.  Check it after 30 minutes.  The fish is cooked when an instant read thermometer registers 140 degrees. 

To serve:  Use two wide spatulas to lift the fish onto a platter and decorate it with the cooked onions, lemon slices (curled into twists), tomato wedges and the parsley.  To remove the skin, cut across it behind the head and along both the top and bottom of the fish.  Then pull the skin back with a fork.  Discard it and carve the fish off the backbone starting with a cut along the backbone.  Once the backbone is exposed, lift it off and discard.  The second half of the fish remains for your enjoyment.  Serve the stuffing with the fish. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  You can substitute ingredients to stuff the fish, such as scallions, fresh basil, fresh thyme, dill and coriander.  You can roast any size fish.

              Shad Roe With Bacon In Balsamic Vinegar Sauce

Recipe By     :Chef Mike Valle of Catalina Seafood Company, Carle Place, NY
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pair shad roe
  4             strips  bacon or pancetta - (to 6)
  2             ounces  olive oil
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  4                     shallots -- peeled and sliced
     1/4         ounce  fresh thyme
  3                     garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  whole black peppercorns
     1/2           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/4         pound  butter -- chilled and cubed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

For the Roe:  Carefully clean residual skin and fat from the roe while leaving the roe sac intact.  Gently wrap 2 to 3 strips of bacon or pancetta around the roe.  Refrigerate for about 20 minutes. 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Pour about 2 ounces of olive oil into a sautÈ pan, heat until lightly smoking. 

Remove shad roe from refrigerator and roll in flour to coat.  Place floured shad roe in the pan.  SautÈ until golden brown, turn over and repeat browning for other side.  When both sides are brown, place in oven for about 10 minutes or until the roe is firm to the touch. 

For the Sauce:  In a small saucepan place the sliced shallots, thyme, garlic, whole black peppercorns, balsamic vinegar, chicken stock and wine.  Reduce over medium heat until approximately 3/4 of original volume.  Add heavy cream, continue cooking until reduced by half.  Remove from heat and gently whisk in the butter, piece by piece.  Pour sauce through a strainer to remove all herbs, etc.  Season with salt and pepper. 

To Serve:  Drain shad roe on paper towel.  Pour the sauce on the plate and place roe on top.  Can be served over sautÈed spinach.  Possible garnishes include chopped parsley and fresh bacon bits. 

This recipe yields 2 servings.
