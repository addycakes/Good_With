  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Butter -- for coating pans
  2               cups  sugar
  1 3/4           cups  cake flour
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa
                        = (preferably Dutch process)
  1           teaspoon  instant coffee
     3/4           cup  boiling water
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4              large  egg whites -- room temperature
                        = (you may want to save yolks to use in
                        the frosting)
  14       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 3/4 sticks) -- melted, but not hot
                        === CREAMY DOUBLE-CHOCOLATE FROSTING ===
     1/2           cup  egg substitute
                        = (or 4 egg yolks [left over from cake],
                        with enough milk added to equal 1/2 cup,
                        plus additional milk, if necessary)
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa
     1/2      teaspoon  instant coffee
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  4             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- melted
  3               cups  confectioners' sugar
                        = (sifted if it contains hard lumps)
  4          teaspoons  light corn syrup
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
  2                     eight-inch cake pans

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously grease the cake pans with butter and dust with flour.

Whisk sugar, flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl; set aside.

Place cocoa and coffee in a medium bowl.  Whisk in 3/4 cup boiling water to form a smooth paste.  Stir in sour cream and vanilla and set aside.

With a hand mixer in a medium bowl, beat egg whites to soft peaks.  Without cleaning beaters, mix melted butter into dry ingredients until mixture is smooth.  Immediately add cocoa mixture, and beat until batter is smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.  Carefully fold egg whites into batter until just incorporated.

Divide batter evenly between pans and bake until a skewer inserted into center comes out with wet crumbs, 30 to 35 minutes.  Remove from oven, and let cakes sit in pans to cool slightly, about 5 minutes.  Invert each cake onto a plate, then onto a cooling rack and split each cake to make 4 layers.  Frost with Chocolate Frosting and serve.

Creamy Double Chocolate Frosting:  Mix egg substitute or yolks, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, and salt in a small bowl with a whisk.

Beat butter in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.  Add melted chocolate and cocoa mixture; continue to beat until smooth.  Add confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating slowly at first, until sugar has been incorporated into mixture, then at medium speed until frosting is light and fluffy.  Add corn syrup, and beat until frosting is smooth and glossy.  If frosting is still stiff, add droplets of milk until it is of spreading consistency.  (Frosting can be refrigerated for up to 1 week and microwaved for a few seconds until just spreadable).

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  13            ounces  ripe apricots - (abt 5)
  1                     prebaked 9 1/2" Tart Shell -- (listed below)
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
     1/4           cup  sliced almonds - (1 oz)
                        === TART DOUGH ===
  1              large  egg
  1 1/2    tablespoons  heavy whipping cream
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2    tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  12       tablespoons  cold unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks)

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Slice the apricots 3/4-inch thick, discarding the pits.  Place the apricots in the prebaked tart shell in a decorative pattern.  Set aside.

Combine the sugar, egg yolks, and cream in a medium mixing bowl.  Whisk until combined.  Stir in the flour and salt.  Carefully pour the creamy mixture over the apricots.

Sprinkle the almonds over the top of the tart.  Bake until the custard is almost completely set, about 35 to 40 minutes.  Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

Tart Dough:  In a small bowl, mix the egg and cream together.  Set aside.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and butter.  Using the paddle attachment on low speed, mix in the butter until it is the size of small peas.  With the mixer on low speed, add the egg mixture.  Mix the dough just until it is no longer dry looking.  It will still be loose and crumbly at this point.

Place the dough on the work surface.  With your hands, combine and form the dough into a single ball.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm but still malleable.

Roll out dough and fit it into a 9 1/2-inch tart shell.  Prebake the shell in a preheated 325 degree oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.  (Makes 1 (9 1/2-inch) tart shell)

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Slice the apricots 3/4-inch thick, discarding the pits.  Place the apricots in the prebaked tart shell in a decorative pattern.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the sugar, egg yolks, and cream in a medium mixing bowl.  Whisk until combined.  Stir in the flour and salt.  Carefully pour the creamy mixture over the apricots.

Sprinkle the almonds over the top of the tart.  Bake until the custard is almost completely set, about 35 to 40 minutes.  Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

<DirT>
Tart Dough:  In a small bowl, mix the egg and cream together.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and butter.  Using the paddle attachment on low speed, mix in the butter until it is the size of small peas.  With the mixer on low speed, add the egg mixture.  Mix the dough just until it is no longer dry looking.  It will still be loose and crumbly at this point.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the dough on the work surface.  With your hands, combine and form the dough into a single ball.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm but still malleable.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out dough and fit it into a 9 1/2-inch tart shell.  Prebake the shell in a preheated 325 degree oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.  (Makes 1 (9 1/2-inch) tart shell)

          Bacon-Wrapped Scallop Tournedos With Summer Succotash

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Chris Schlesinger
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  thick-cut bacon
  2             pounds  extra-large sea scallops - (abt 24)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2               cups  corn kernels - (from 2 ears)
  2               cups  fresh lima beans -- peeled, blanched
                        = (or thawed frozen lima beans)
  1              large  tomato -- cored, and
                        cut into small cubes
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh sage leaves
  8                     eight-inch skewers

Build a multi-level fire in the grill: Leave 1/4 of the bottom free of coals, bank the coals in the remaining 3/4 of the grill so that they are 3 times as high on one side as on the other.  When the coals are all ignited and the temperature has lowered to medium (hold hand about 5-inches above grill grid, over the area where coals are deepest, for 4 to 5 seconds), the grill is ready to cook.

In a large skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until it has rendered a good amount of fat, but has not begun color or crinkle up, about 4 minutes (The bacon should be cooked halfway, it should remain pliable).  Remove from the heat.

Thread the scallops onto skewers, putting 3 on each skewer, zig-zagging with a piece of bacon around each trio of scallops, securing it at the top and bottom with toothpicks, or secure with a second skewer.  Sprinkle the skewers generously with salt and pepper, then place on grill over the side with fewer coals and cook until scallops are opaque all the way through, about 5 to 7 minutes per side.

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the corn, lima beans, tomato, sage, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until all the ingredients are nice and hot, about 5 minutes.

To serve, place about 1/4 of the succotash on each plate, top with 2 skewers.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Try to use the largest scallops available, if dry scallops are available, it's even better.  When grilling scallops watch carefully for any flare-ups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
     1/4      teaspoon  dried hot red pepper flakes
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 to 32 oz)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2         pounds  large shrimp - (abt 36) -- shelled, deveined
  1              pound  orzo (rice-shaped pasta)
     1/2           cup  Kalamata olives -- pitted, chopped
                        = (or other brine-cured black olives)
  1              pound  feta -- patted dry,
                        and crumbled - (3 cups)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Cook onion, garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes in 1 tablespoon oil in a 4-quart heavy pot over moderately-high heat, stirring, until onion is softened, about 3 minutes.  Add wine and boil until reduced by 1/2, about 3 minutes.  Stir in tomatoes and salt, then reduce heat, and simmer briskly, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, about 8 minutes.  Stir shrimp into sauce and simmer, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are just cooked through, about 3 minutes.

While sauce and shrimp are cooking, cook orzo in a 6-quart pot of boiling salted water until al dente.  Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, then drain orzo in a sieve.  Return orzo to pot and toss with remaining tablespoon oil.  Stir in sauce with shrimp and reserved cooking water, then add olives and salt and pepper, to taste.

Spoon 1/2 of pasta into an oiled 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish, then sprinkle with 1/2 of feta.  Top with remaining pasta and feta, then bake in middle of oven, uncovered, until cheese is slightly melted and pasta is heated through, 10 to 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cook onion, garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes in 1 tablespoon oil in a 4-quart heavy pot over moderately-high heat, stirring, until onion is softened, about 3 minutes.  Add wine and boil until reduced by 1/2, about 3 minutes.  Stir in tomatoes and salt, then reduce heat, and simmer briskly, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, about 8 minutes.  Stir shrimp into sauce and simmer, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are just cooked through, about 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While sauce and shrimp are cooking, cook orzo in a 6-quart pot of boiling salted water until al dente.  Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, then drain orzo in a sieve.  Return orzo to pot and toss with remaining tablespoon oil.  Stir in sauce with shrimp and reserved cooking water, then add olives and salt and pepper, to taste.

Spoon 1/2 of pasta into an oiled 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish, then sprinkle with 1/2 of feta.  Top with remaining pasta and feta, then bake in middle of oven, uncovered, until cheese is slightly melted and pasta is heated through, 10 to 15 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pieces  store bought puff pastry -- each 3" by 4"
  1                cup  heavy (whipping) cream
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  dark rum - (to 2)

Slice each piece of puff pastry in 1/2 horizontally along the 4-inch side.

Whisk the cream, sugar, vanilla extract, and rum in a large bowl until soft peaks form.

Slice the bananas 1/2-inch thick on a bias.  Place them in a bowl and mix in the lime and orange juices.

Place some bananas and a little rum cream on each of 6 plates.  Place a piece of puff pastry on top.  Place the remaining bananas and rum cream on the puff.  Drizzle warm caramel sauce over and around the bananas.  Top with a second piece of puff.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     firm ripe banana
     3/4           cup  half-and-half
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  4             slices  day-old challah or brioche, 1" thick
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting
                        === ACCOMPANIMENT ===
                        Warm maple syrup

Cut banana into 1/4-inch thick slices.  In a bowl, whisk together half-and-half, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Cut bread slices horizontally almost in half, leaving 1 edge intact.  Stuff each pocket with 4 to 6 banana slices (do not overstuff).

In a baking dish just large enough to hold bread slices in one layer, arrange slices and pour custard over them.  Soak slices, turning them over once or twice to allow bread to absorb all liquid, about 15 minutes.

In a 12-inch non-stick skillet melt butter over low heat until foam subsides and cook slices until golden, about 5 minutes on each side. Dust French toast with confectioners' sugar and serve with syrup.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

                        === BRISKET ===
  2 1/2         pounds  beef brisket
                        = (preferably from the point cut, also
                        called the 2nd cut)

  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  4                     lager-style beers - (12 oz ea)
  3             sprigs  fresh flat-leaf parsley -- plus
                        Chopped parsley leaves -- for garnish
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1                     bay leaf
  1              large  rutabaga - (abt 2 lbs) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  6             medium  carrots -- cut crosswise
                        into 1"-thk pieces
  6             medium  waxy-style potatoes -- unpeeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
                        === BEURRE MANIE ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        === SERVING SUGGESTIONS ===
                        Buttered egg noodles

Make the Brisket:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Pat the brisket dry and season with salt and pepper.  In a Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid, cook the bacon over moderate heat, stirring, until crispy and its fat has rendered.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain, and pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat.

Heat the remaining fat over moderately-high heat until it is hot but not smoking.  Brown the brisket all over and transfer it to a platter.  Add the onions to the Dutch oven and cook until golden brown.  Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until caramelized, about 1 minute.  Add the bacon, brisket, and beer and bring to a boil.  Tie the parsley sprigs, thyme, and bay leaf together with a piece of kitchen twine and add to the Dutch oven.  Cover and braise the brisket in the oven for 2 hours.

Stir in the rutabaga, carrots, and potatoes and continue braising until the brisket and vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes more.

Transfer the brisket and the vegetables to a platter and set aside covered with foil to keep warm.  Boil the braising liquid it until it is reduced to about 3 cups.

Meanwhile, make the Beurre Manie:  In a small bowl, blend the butter and flour together to make a paste.

Whisk the beurre manie into the reduced braising liquid, bit by bit, whisking well after each addition.  Simmer the sauce for 3 minutes and season it with salt and pepper.

Slice the brisket against the grain, on the diagonal, and arrange it on the platter.  Surround the brisket with the vegetables, spoon some of the sauce over the top, and sprinkle with the chopped parsley.  Pass the remaining sauce at the table.  Serve with the buttered noodles.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                        Whipped cream or ice cream

Make the Topping:  In a small bowl blend together butter, sugar, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg until the mixture resembles coarse meal, and chill the topping while making the batter.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     beef short ribs - (6 oz ea)
                        = (or beef flanken)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour -- for dusting
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3             ounces  smoked bacon -- cut into
                        lardons that are 1/4" by 1"
  2             medium  carrots -- peeled, and
                        chopped into 1/2" dice
  1             medium  onion -- chopped 1/2" dice
  16                    garlic cloves -- smashed
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  2               cups  dry red wine
     1/2           cup  brandy
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
  1           teaspoon  celery seeds
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  5                     whole cloves
  2               cups  canned low-sodium chicken broth
  18                    dried apricot halves
     1/3           cup  Kalamata olives -- pitted
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Season the ribs with salt and pepper.  Dust with the flour.  Heat the oil in a large braising pan or ovenproof casserole over medium-high heat.  Add the bacon and cook until most of the fat is rendered, then remove and set aside.

Add as many ribs as can fit in a single layer to the pan.  You will need to cook them in batches.  Sear the ribs on both sides until well browned, then remove from the pan and set aside.  Repeat with the remaining ribs.  Discard all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan.

Lower the heat to medium, add the carrots and onions, season with salt and pepper, and saute until the vegetables begin to brown, about 10 minutes.  Add the garlic and tomato and paste and cook for 4 more minutes, scraping the browned bits off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Add the red wine and brandy and reduce by 1/2, about 6 minutes.

Return the ribs and bacon to the pot.  Add the remaining ingredients except the apricots and parsley and bring to a boil.  The liquid should come 1/3 of the way up the ribs, if it does not, add some water.  As soon as the liquid comes to a boil, turn off the heat an cover the ribs tightly with foil, pressing the foil down into the pan, then place a lid on the pan.

Braise the ribs in the oven for 2 hours, turning them every 30 minutes so they cook evenly.  Add water as necessary to keep the braising juice 1/3 of the way up the ribs.

After 2 hours, add the apricots and cook for an additional 30 minutes.  The meat should be almost falling off the bones (if it is not, keep cooking until it does).  Transfer the short ribs to a large platter.  Spoon the vegetables, olives, and apricots over them.  Keep warm.

Strain the braising juices into a clear glass container and siphon or skim off the fat.  The braising juices may already be the consistency of a sauce.  If not, return them to the pan and boil for a few minutes to thicken.  If you prefer an absolutely smooth sauce, strain out any remaining pieces of vegetable.  Taste, season with salt and pepper, and add the parsley.  Pour the sauce over the ribs and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === CREAMED SPINACH ===
  1            package  frozen creamed spinach
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        A ricer

Prepare lamb:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Season the lamb shanks with salt and pepper and brown them in batches, transferring each to a plate when browned.  Add onions and herb sprigs and cook, stirring, until lightly browned and soft, about 10 minutes.  Return the shanks to the Dutch oven with the wine, broth, and water and bring to a boil.  Cover, transfer to the oven, and braise until fork tender, about 2 hours.  Transfer shanks to a plate.  Discard herb sprigs.  Pour cooking liquid (including onions) into a large glass measure.

Prepare potatoes and boil carrots while lamb roasts:  Pierce each potato once with a fork and bake on rack in lower third of oven until cooked through, 45 to 50 minutes.  Cool potatoes 10 minutes, then halve lengthwise and scoop out flesh.  Force warm potatoes through ricer into a bowl.  Stir in milk, and salt, pepper, to taste.

Cook carrots in boiling salted water until tender, about 10 minutes.  Rinse under cold running water to stop cooking.

Make gravy:  Skim fat from cooking liquid (you'll have about 2 1/2 cups broth).  Put the cooking liquid in a saucepan and bring to boil.  Knead the flour and softened butter into a paste and whisk it into the liquid.  Return the gravy to a boil to thicken and simmer, whisking occasionally, for 5 minutes.

Cut lamb meat from bones, then tear meat into bite-size pieces.  Stir meat into gravy and set aside.

Creamed Spinach:  Cook spinach according to package directions.  Whisk in Parmesan, salt, nutmeg, and pepper, to taste.

Assemble and bake pie:  Spoon lamb-shank mixture into a 12- by 3-inch oval gratin dish or a 2 1/2- to 3-quart shallow baking dish, spreading evenly.  Scatter carrots over lamb, then top with creamed spinach, spreading evenly.  Top spinach with mashed potatoes, spreading evenly to edges of dish to cover filling completely.  Make swirl patterns on surface of potatoes with back of spoon, then drizzle with the melted butter.

Put baking dish in a foil-lined shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan to catch drips and bake until top is golden and filling is bubbling, about 1 hour.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Spinach can be made 1 day ahead of assembling shepherd's pie and chilled, covered.  Bring to room temperature before proceeding.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COFFEE BUTTERCREAM ===
  4              large  egg whites
  1                cup  sugar
  24       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3 sticks) -- softened
  2        tablespoons  instant espresso powder
  2        tablespoons  rum or brandy
                        === CHOCOLATE GENOISE SHEET ===
  3              large  eggs
  3              large  egg yolks
  1              Pinch  salt
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  cake flour
                        = (spoon flour into dry-measure cup and
                        level off)
     1/3           cup  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  alkalized (Dutch process) cocoa
                        === MARZIPAN ===
  8             ounces  almond paste
  2               cups  confectioners' sugar
  3        tablespoons  light corn syrup - (to 5)
                        === FOR FINISHING ===
                        Cocoa powder
                        Red and green liquid food coloring
                        Confectioners' sugar

To make the Buttercream:  Whisk the egg whites and sugar together in the bowl of an electric mixer.  Set the bowl over simmering water and whisk gently until the sugar is dissolved and the egg whites are hot.  Attach the bowl to the mixer and whip with the whisk on medium speed until cooled.  Switch to the paddle and beat in the softened butter and continue beating until the buttercream is smooth.  Dissolve the instant coffee in the liquor and beat into the buttercream.

To make Chocolate Genoise Sheet:  Butter a 10- by 15-inch jelly-roll pan and line with buttered parchment.

Set rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.

Half-fill a medium saucepan with water and bring it to a boil over high heat.  Lower the heat so the water is simmering.

Whisk the eggs, yolks, salt, and sugar together in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer.  Place over the pan of simmering water and whisk gently until the mixture is just lukewarm, about 100 degrees (test with your finger).  Attach the bowl to the mixer and with the whisk attachment, whip on medium-high speed until the egg mixture is cooled (touch the outside of the bowl to tell) and tripled in volume.

While the eggs are whipping, stir together the flour, cornstarch, and cocoa.

Sift 1/3 of the flour mixture over the beaten eggs.  Use a rubber spatula to fold in the flour mixture, making sure to scrape all the way to the bottom of the bowl on every pass through the batter to prevent the flour mixture from accumulating there and making lumps.  Repeat with another 1/3 of the flour mixture and finally with the remainder.

Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.  Bake the genoise for about 10 to 12 minutes, or until well risen, deep and firm to the touch.  (Make sure the cake doesn't overbake and become too dry, or it will be hard to roll.)

Use a small paring knife to loosen the cake from the sides of the pan.  Invert the cake onto a rack and let the cake cool right-side up on the paper.

Turn the genoise layer over and peel away the paper.  Invert onto a fresh piece of paper.  Spread the layer with half the buttercream.  Use the paper to help you roll the cake into a tight cylinder.  Transfer to baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until set.  Reserve the remaining buttercream for the outside of the buche.

To make the Marzipan:  Combine the almond paste and 1 cup of the sugar in the bowl of the electric mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on low speed until the sugar is almost absorbed.  Add the remaining 1 cup sugar and mix until the mixture resembles fine crumbs.  Add half the corn syrup, then continue mixing until a bit of the marzipan holds together when squeezed, adding additional corn syrup a little at a time, as necessary; the marzipan in the bowl will still appear crumbly.  Transfer the marzipan to a work surface and knead until smooth.

To make Marzipan Mushrooms:  Roll 1/3 of the marzipan into a 6-inch long cylinder and cut into 1-inch lengths.  Roll half the lengths into balls.  Press the remaining cylindrical lengths (stems) into the balls (caps) to make mushrooms.  Smudge with cocoa powder.

To make Holly Leaves:  Knead green color into 1/2 the remaining marzipan and roll it into a long cylinder.  Flatten with the back of a spoon, then loosen it from the surface with a spatula.  Cut into diamonds to make leaves, or use a cutter.

To make Holly Berries:  Knead red color into a tiny piece of marzipan.  Roll into tiny balls.

To make Pine Cones:  Knead cocoa powder into the remaining marzipan.  Divide in half and form into 2 cone shapes.  Slash the sides of cones with the points of a pair of scissors.

Unwrap the cake.  Trim the ends on the diagonal, starting the cuts about 2 inches away from each end.  Position the larger cut piece on the buche about 2/3 across the top.  Cover the buche with the reserved buttercream, making sure to curve around the protruding stump.  Streak the buttercream with a fork or decorating comb to resemble bark.  Transfer the buche to a platter and decorate with the marzipan.  Sprinkle the platter and buche sparingly with confectioners' sugar "snow."

Storage:  Keep at cool room temperature.  Cover leftovers loosely and keep at room temperature.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  finely-ground pine nuts -- plus
  2        tablespoons  finely-ground pine nuts
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into pieces
  2                     egg yolks -- slightly beaten
                        Ice water -- if needed
                        === FILLING ===
  1                     large whole egg
  1                     egg yolk
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  coffee flavored liqueur
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/3           cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  triple-strength coffee
                        = (or instant espresso)
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  triple-strength coffee
                        = (or instant espresso)
                        Chocolate-covered coffee beans -- for garnish

To make the crust:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into the bowl of a food processor.  Add the pine nuts and butter and pulse until the texture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 10 to 15 seconds.  With the motor running, add the egg yolks.  If the dough is too dry to form a soft ball when pressed, add ice water 1 tablespoon at a time and pulse to mix.  Do not over process; the dough should not be processed for more than 30 to 40 seconds after adding the liquids.

Transfer the dough to a sheet of waxed paper or plastic wrap.  Form the dough into a flat circle.  Enclose tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.

Press the chilled dough in a 10- to 11-inch fluted tart pan and use fingers to press it over the bottom and up the side of the pan.  Roll over the edges.  Use a fork to prick the shell all over.  Cover and chill for 1 hour.

Line the chilled dough with foil or parchment paper smoothed carefully into all of the corners.  Line with dry beans, rice, or pie weights.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, just to set the crust.  Remove from the oven and carefully lift the foil and weights.  Return to the oven 8 to 10 minutes, until the edges barely begin to color.  Set aside to cool.

Prepare the filling:  In a mixing bowl, beat the egg, egg yolk, and the 1/4 cup sugar until they double in volume and become pale in color.

In a double boiler over medium heat, melt the chocolate and butter.  Slowly whisk in the liqueur and vanilla until completely blended.  Slowly whisk the egg mixture into the double boiler and cook, whisking constantly, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove the top pan from the heat and set aside to cool.

Whip the cream with 1 tablespoon sugar until soft peaks form.  Slowly drizzle in the coffee and beat until stiff peaks form.  Fold the whipped cream into the cooled chocolate mixture.  Pour the filling into the tart shell, cover, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving, or up to 3 days.

Prepare the topping:  Whip the cream with the sugar until soft peaks form.  Slowly drizzle in the coffee and beat until stiff peaks form.

To serve, cut the tart into wedges.  Spoon a generous dollop of the whipped cream on each slice and decorate with a chocolate coffee bean, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1                cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
                        = (abt 2 1/2 tspns)
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose unbleached flour - (to 2 1/2)
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
                        more for oiling bowl
  1              pound  Italian sausage -- casings discarded
  1                can  peeled whole tomatoes - (14 to 16 oz) -- drained, chopped
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1               cups  grated whole-milk mozzarella cheese - -- (abt 1/4 lb)
  1                cup  grated fontina cheese - (abt 1/4 lb)
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan

In a large bowl, dissolve sugar in water.  Sprinkle yeast over water and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.  Stir in 2 1/4 cups flour, cornmeal, salt, and 2 tablespoons oil and blend until mixture forms a dough.  Knead dough on a floured surface, incorporating as much of remaining 1/4 cup flour as necessary to prevent dough from sticking, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.

Put dough in a deep oiled bowl and turn to coat with oil.  Let dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

While the dough is rising, in a heavy skillet cook sausage over moderately-high heat, breaking up lumps, until no longer pink and stir in tomatoes, oregano, and salt and pepper.  Transfer sausage mixture to a strainer over a bowl to drain and cool.

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.

Punch down dough and knead 4 times.  In an oiled 10 1/2-inch cast-iron skillet, press dough with oiled finger until it comes 2 inches up the side and is an even thickness on bottom.  Let dough rise, covered loosely with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 15 minutes.

Sprinkle dough with half of mozzarella and fontina and top with sausage mixture and remaining cheeses.  Sprinkle the top with the Parmesan and bake the pizza in the lower third of an electric oven, or on floor of a gas oven for 15 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees and bake 10 minutes more, or until crust is golden.

This recipe yields 4 servings as main course.

                        = (or to taste - wear rubber gloves)
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12                    corn tortillas - (7" dia) -- warmed
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying flautas
  3               cups  shredded romaine or iceberg lettuce
                        === ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
                        Guacamole
                        Sour cream
                        Favorite salsa

In a large saucepan, combine the beef, sliced onion, whole garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and enough water to cover.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, covered partially, until the beef is tender, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Let the beef cool in the broth and drain it, reserving 1/3 cup of the broth.  Using 2 forks, shred the beef and set aside.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over moderately-low heat.  Cook the minced onion and garlic, stirring occasionally, until softened.  Add the beef, tomato sauce, chile, cumin, reserved broth, and salt and pepper, and simmer, stirring, until thickened, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Let the beef filling cool.

Working with 1 warmed tortilla at a time, and keeping the others covered with a kitchen towel, spread about 2 rounded tablespoons of the filling down the center of each tortilla, roll up the tortillas, enclosing the filling, and secure the ends closed with wooden picks.  Keep the rolled tortillas covered with plastic wrap.  The flautas may be prepared up to this point 2 hours in advance and kept covered tightly with plastic wrap and chilled.

Pour enough oil into a straight-sided skillet to reach about 1/2-inch up the sides.  Heat the oil over moderately-high heat until it is hot but not smoking.  Fry the flautas in batches, turning them, until crisp, about 2 minutes.  Transfer them with tongs to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.  Spread the lettuce on a platter or divide it among 6 plates, arrange the flautas on it, and top them with guacamole, sour cream, and salsa.

Comments:  To warm tortillas in the oven: Stack 6 tortillas at a time, wrap each stack in foil, and heat the tortillas in the middle of a preheated 325 degrees oven for 5 minutes.  (If the tortillas are very dry to begin with, pat each tortilla between dampened hands before stacking them.)  Alternatively, to warm them in a microwave oven: Stack 6 tortillas at a time, wrap each stack in a microwave-safe plastic bag, and heat in a microwave oven at high power for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until they are heated through and pliable.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     poblano chiles
     3/4         pound  grated mild cheddar cheese - (abt 3 cups)
                        Vegetable shortening -- for frying
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4              large  egg yolks -- beaten
  4              large  egg whites -- beaten until foamy
     1/4         pound  grated sharp cheddar - (abt 1 cup)
                        === ACCOMPANIMENT ===
                        Prepared salsa

Using a long-handled fork, char chiles over an open flame, turning, until skins are blackened, 4 to 6 minutes.  (Alternatively, broil chiles on a broiler pan about 2 inches from heat, turning occasionally until skins are blistered and charred.)  Transfer chiles to a bowl and let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle.  Using a small knife, carefully scrape the charred skin off the chiles (leave the stems attached).

Carefully cut a lengthwise slit in each chile to form a pocket, and cut out and discard the seeds.  Stuff each chile with some of the mild cheddar, and thread shut with a toothpick.  In a large saucepan, melt enough shortening to reach 1/2-inch up the sides, and heat to 375 degrees on a deep-fat thermometer.

Preheat the broiler.  In a bowl, combine flour, salt, and pepper.  In another bowl, carefully fold yolks into egg whites.  Working in batches, dredge the chiles in the flour and, using a slotted spoon, dip into the eggs to coat completely.  Fry, turning occasionally, until golden, no more than a couple of minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer chiles (careful, they are delicate) to paper towels to drain.

Arrange chiles on a flameproof plate and sprinkle with the sharp cheddar.  Broil chiles just long enough to melt cheese and serve immediately, accompanied by salsa, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ROAST PORK ===
  1                     pork shoulder - (8 lbs) -- boned
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced garlic
  1                cup  distilled white vinegar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  distilled white vinegar
     3/4           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  fresh grapefruit juice
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
  2        tablespoons  dried oregano -- crumbled
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  adobo-style seasoning
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  green bell pepper -- coarsely chopped
  1             medium  onion -- coarsely chopped
                        === SANDWICHES ===
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  4                     canned chipotle chiles in adobo
  6                     long sandwich rolls -- split in half
                        = (French loaf style bread)
  6                     thin slices Black Forest ham
  12                    thin slices imported Swiss cheese
  2                     kosher dill pickles -- thinly sliced
                        lengthwise
  1 1/2         pounds  Roast Pork - (above) -- thinly sliced or
                        shredded - (abt 3 cups), plus reserved
                        pan juices
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

For the Roast Pork:  Using a small, sharp knife, make 1-inch-long slashes in the skin of the pork shoulder, about 2 inches apart.  Rub the garlic into the slashes and along the underside of the pork.

In a large glass or ceramic bowl, combine the vinegar, lime juice, grapefruit juice, orange juice, oregano, pepper, adobo seasoning, and salt and pepper.  Stir in the green pepper and onion, then add the pork, skin-side up.  Refrigerate overnight turning the meat once or twice.  Bring to room temperature before cooking.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Transfer the pork and its marinade to a roasting pan.  Cover with foil and roast until very tender, about 3 hours.  Let cool in the liquid.  Transfer the pork to a cutting board and discard the skin and fat.  Strain the pan juices into a glass measure and skim off the fat.  Slice or shred the pork, as desired.

For the Sandwiches:  In a mini food processor, combine the mayonnaise and chipotles and process until smooth.  Spread the cut sides of the rolls with the chipotle mayonnaise.  Assemble the sandwiches with the ham, cheese, pickles and roast pork.  Top the meat with a spoonful of the pork pan juices and season with salt.  Close the sandwiches and tuck in any overhanging filling.

Using an electric sandwich grill press, grill the sandwiches in batches until crispy and hot.

Alternately, preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Set a large skillet or griddle over moderately-low heat.  Arrange the sandwiches on the griddle and cover with a large baking sheet weighed down with a heavy skillet.  Cook the sandwiches, turning once, until they're crisp on the outside, about 6 minutes.

Transfer the sandwiches to a baking sheet and bake until the cheese is melted, about 8 minutes.  Cut the sandwiches in half and serve immediately; pass the remaining pan juices separately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The pork can be refrigerated for up to 3 days

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  good-quality seasoned or
                        plain breadcrumbs -- more or less
  2             pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- halved
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  7               cups  store-bought tomato sauce
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/3           cup  minced fresh flat-leaf parsley -- (optional)
                        === ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
                        Linguine With Olive Oil -- (see recipe)
                        Sauteed Broccoli Rabe -- (see recipe)

Place the eggs in a bowl and whisk with salt and pepper.  Place the bread crumbs on a large plate.  Dip the chicken in the egg and then dredge in the bread crumbs.  Re-dip in the egg a second time and then dredge in the bread crumbs again.

In a large, heavy skillet, heat the olive oil over moderate heat.  Brown the double-dipped chicken in the hot oil for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.  Remove the chicken and drain on paper towels.  The chicken can be made up to this point a day ahead of time.  Wrap the chicken in aluminum foil and refrigerate.

Simmer the tomato sauce until hot.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Pour about 2 cups of the sauce in the bottom of a large gratin dish or large ovenproof, glass baking dish.  Place the browned chicken breasts on top of the sauce and cover with 1/2 or all of the remaining sauce.  Sprinkle with the cheese and bake on the middle shelf for 15 minutes, or until the sauce and cheese are bubbling.

Serve hot, and sprinkle with parsley, if using.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  The chef's preference is to have a lot of tomato sauce poured on top of the chicken.  If less saucy chicken is desired, use only 1/2 the amount of the sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  eggplants -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1/4"-thk slices
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  Tomato Sauce II -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  fresh cavatelli pasta
  1              pound  ball fresh mozzarella -- chopped
  1                cup  grated pecorino -- plus
                        extra for sprinkling on top
     1/4           cup  basil chiffonade -- plus
                        basil leaves for garnish
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
  6                     ceramic souffle dishes - (5" by 2")

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Place the eggplant slices on top of a sheet tray lined with parchment or waxed paper.  Drizzle with oil and season with salt and pepper.  Bake in oven until it turns golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Remove from oven and let it cool.

Oil the bottoms and sides of 6 souffle dishes and layer 4 to 5 pieces of eggplant in a circular pattern into each souffle dish, letting excess drape out over the edge.

Heat up the tomato sauce in a large saucepan.  Then turn off flame.  Reserve some tomato sauce for plating in a smaller pot.

In a large pot with boiling salted water, cook the cavatelli pasta for 3 to 4 minutes, and drain.

In the pot with the sauce, add the partially cooked cavatelli, mozzarella, and pecorino to the tomato sauce and cook over medium heat just to blend well.  When hot, stir in the basil chiffonade.  Spoon the pasta-sauce mixture into the souffle dishes and fold over the top with excess eggplant.  Bake in oven for 4 to 5 minutes.

To serve, spoon the remaining tomato sauce onto individual plates.  Turn a finished timballo upside down onto a large spatula to remove it from the souffle dish, then carefully slide it onto the plates.  Sprinkle with pecorino and garnish with a basil leaf.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                 Espresso Chocolate Chip Angel Food Cake

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Emily Luchetti
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  instant espresso powder
  1 1/3           cups  cake flour -- sifted
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1 3/4           cups  egg whites - (abt 12 large)
  1           teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1 3/4           cups  granulated sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/3      teaspoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     3/4           cup  chocolate chips -- coarsely chopped
                        === EQUIPMENT ===
  1                     ten-inch angel food cake pan -- ungreased

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Sift together the espresso powder, cake flour, and salt.  Set aside.

Put the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer.  Using the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites on medium speed until frothy.  Add the cream of tartar.  Increase to high speed and slowly pour in the sugar.  Continue whipping until the whites are stiff but still shiny, about 3 minutes.

Reduce to low speed and add the vanilla extract and lemon juice.  Add the reserved flour mixture.  When the flour mixture is almost completely incorporated, remove the bowl from the machine and fold in the chocolate chips.  Make sure that the chocolate chips are spread throughout the batter and that the flour is evenly mixed into the egg whites.  Do not over mix.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and cut through it a few times with a dull knife to break up any air pockets.

Bake until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.  Invert the cake on a rack and let it cool upside down in the pan.

Unmold the cake and slice it with a serrated knife.

This recipe yields 1 (10-inch) cake.

Comments:  This cake will keep for several days.  Store wrapped in plastic wrap at room temperature.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TART DOUGH ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  8             ounces  cold butter - (2 sticks) -- cut small pieces
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  ice water -- or as needed

                        === FRUIT FILLING ===
  1               pint  gooseberries -- stems picked off,
                        washed and dried
  2              pints  blueberries -- wash and dried
  1                     lemon -- juiced
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  freshly grated nutmeg
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
     1/4           cup  butter - (1 stick)
                        = (1 tbspn per tartlet) -- plus
                        extra butter for brushing tin
  1              large  egg white -- for egg wash
                        Finely-ground cornmeal -- for sprinkling tin
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
  8                     three-inch pie tins

Make the Tart Dough:  Put in the work bowl of a food processor, the flour, butter, salt and sugar.  Pulse quickly until the butter is the size of peas.  Add very cold, ice water in a small stream until the dough just comes together.  Empty the work bowl out onto waxed paper and halve the dough.  Using the ends of the paper, shape into 2 balls.  Wrap in plastic wrap and place in refrigerator until ready for use.

Make the Caramelized Sugar:  Pour sugar in heavy skillet, cook over low heat until sugar turns a medium brown.  Pour caramelized sugar in a 10-inch aluminum tin or silcone mat to cool and harden.  After it is cooled, break into pieces of 1- to 1 1/2-inch big.  Set aside, it will be used to bake with berries.

Make Fruit Filling:  In a large bowl, place cleaned gooseberries and blueberries.  Pour lemon juice on top.  Sprinkle sugar, flour and nutmeg on top of the berries (Be careful not to mix, just sprinkle on top, or fruit will be mushy if over-handled).

To Assemble Tartlettes:  Take 8 small pie tins, brush with butter and liberally sprinkle with cornmeal.  Cut dough into 8 equal pieces and put 7 back in the refrigerator (must be kept cold) roll out the dough into a 4-inch circle, it should be quite thick, you don't want it too thin.  Place disk in pie tin and repeat until all 8 are done.  Place all 8 tarts on sheet pan.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Brush bottom of dough shell with egg whites.  Gently scoop out the berries with the flour-sugar mixture on top into the shells.  Place a piece of the caramelized sugar on top of berries.  Fold up the sides in a circle, do not close up completely, leaving an opening.  Put 1 tablespoon butter on top of each tartlette.  Brush egg white on the exposed dough and bake for 45 minutes.

Serve with confectioners' sugar dusted on top.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     orange bell peppers
  2             medium  tomatoes -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1                     fresh serrano chile -- minced,
                        including seeds
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced

  2 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  red-wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt

         Grilled Giant Pork Chops With Sweet Peach Barbecue Sauce

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Chris Schlesinger
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     rib or loin pork chops, abt 1 1/2" thk - -- (12 to 14 oz ea)
                        === FOR SPICE RUB ===
  3        tablespoons  ground coriander
  3        tablespoons  ground paprika
  2        tablespoons  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              small  red onion -- peeled, sliced thin
  3                     peaches -- pitted, and
                        cut into medium-sized cubes
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  2             medium  ripe tomatoes -- cut medium cubes
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  orange juice
     1/3           cup  light or dark brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground allspice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Build a multi-level fire in the grill:  Leave 1/4 of the bottom free of coals, bank the coals in the remaining 3/4 of the grill so that they are 3 times as high on 1 side as on the other.  When the coals are all ignited and the temperature has lowered to medium (hold hand about 5-inches above grill grid, over the area where coals are deepest, for 4 to 5 seconds), the grill is ready to cook.

Make spice rub:  Combine the ingredients for the spice rub in a small bowl and mix well.  Rub the pork chops generously on both sides with the mixture and set aside while making the sauce.

Make the sauce:  In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until hot, but not smoking.  Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 11 to 13 minutes.  Add the peaches, ginger, and tomatoes and cook, stirring frequently for 2 minutes.  Stir in the vinegar, orange juice, sugar, allspice, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the mixture is reduced by about 1/2 and thickened slightly, about 20 minutes.  Taste and adjust for the seasoning, then transfer the sauce to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth (be careful with hot liquids).  Reserve 1/4 cup sauce for basting the chops, then pour the remaining sauce into a small serving bowl.

Put the chops on the grill over the coals and cook, turning once, until desired doneness; 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium.  During the last 30 seconds of cooking on each side, baste the chops generously with the sauce.  Check for doneness.

Serve the chops hot with extra barbecue sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The spice rub and barbecue sauce contains sugar, which might burn while cooking on the grill.  If the chops start to burn on the outside, move them to cooler part of the grill and cover with a metal pie pan or disposable foil to finish cooking.

                        T-bone steaks - (abt 2 lbs each)
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        = (1/4 cup for steak; 1/4 cup for
                        mushrooms)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

                        chanterelles, oyster, or other kinds)
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  roughly-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  3        tablespoons  dry sherry

Build a multi-level fire in the grill:  Leave 1/4 of the bottom free of coals, bank the coals in the remaining 3/4 of the grill so that they are 3 times as high on 1 side as on the other.  When the coals are all ignited and the temperature is hot (Hold hand about 5-inches above grill grid, over the area where coals are deepest, for 2 seconds or less), the grill is ready to cook.

Pat the steaks dry with paper towels, then rub them all over with 1/4 cup of the olive oil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.  Place the steaks over the hottest part of the fire and cook until well seared on 1 side, 6 to 8 minutes.  Then move them to the medium-hot part of the grill and cook, turning once, until they are done the way you like them, 10 to 15 minutes more for rare.  Check for doneness.

Make mushrooms while grilling steaks:  Combine the mushrooms, the remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil, and the teaspoon of pepper in a large bowl.  Toss gently until the mushrooms are well coated and all the oil is absorbed.

When steaks are done, transfer them to a serving platter, cover loosely with foil, and let them rest while grilling mushrooms.  Put the mushrooms on the medium-hot part of the grill and cook, turning occasionally, until they are golden brown and moist all the way through, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Slice the cooked mushrooms and put them back in the bowl along with the butter, parsley, and sherry, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and toss gently to coat.

To serve, cut the meat away from the bone, then cut it into thick slices.  Divide them among 4 serving plates and spoon mushrooms over the top.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR BLACK PEPPER PARMESAN PASTRY ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2        tablespoons  cold vegetable shortening
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  ice water - (to 4)
                        ===FOR FILLING ===
     3/4         pound  fresh mozzarella (not unsalted) -- very thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  store-bought tapenade or pesto -- (optional)
  2             pounds  mixed heirloom tomatoes -- sliced 3/4" thick
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Pie weights or raw rice

Make pastry:  Blend together flour, butter, shortening, Parmesan, pepper, and salt in a bowl with your fingertips or a pastry blender (or pulse in a food processor) until mixture resembles coarse meal with some roughly pea-size lumps.  Drizzle 2 tablespoons ice water over and gently stir with a fork (or pulse in food processor) until incorporated.

Gently squeeze a small handful.  If it doesn't hold together without falling apart, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring (or pulsing) after each addition until incorporated, continuing to test.  Do not overwork dough, or it will become tough.

Turn out dough onto a work surface and divide into 2 portions.  With heel of your hand, smear each portion once in a forward motion to help distribute fat.  Gather both portions of dough into 1 ball, then pat into a disk.  Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch round and fit into a 9-inch round tart pan with a removable rim.  Fold excess dough in to make sides.  Lightly prick tart shell all over with a fork.

Line the shell with foil and fill with pie weights, or rice.  Bake in middle of oven 20 minutes.  Carefully remove foil and weights and bake until golden, about 15 minutes more.  Cool in pan on a rack.

Fill tart shell:  Remove side of pan and slide shell onto a platter.  Arrange 1/3 of mozzarella in bottom of shell and drizzle with 1/3 of pesto.  Arrange 1/3 of tomato slices, overlapping, on top of cheese.  Season with salt and pepper.  Repeat layering twice.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Tart shell can be made 1 day ahead and kept, covered, at room temperature.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             medium  all-purpose potatoes - (abt 3 3/4 lbs) -- peeled, and
                        halved lengthwise
  2              large  yellow onions -- peeled, and
                        halved lengthwise
  1                     tube anchovy paste - (2 oz)
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  heavy cream -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  milk -- room temperature

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Lightly coat a shallow 3-quart baking dish with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.

Equip the food processor with the slicing disk (the thin slicing disk, if you have one).  Stand as many pieces of potato in the feed tube as will fit, then exerting gentle pressure on the pusher, pulse the potatoes through the slicing disk.  Repeat until all the potatoes have been sliced.  As the work bowl fills, scoop the potatoes onto a large piece of waxed paper.  Scoop the last batch of sliced potatoes onto the waxed paper and reserve.

Slice the onions just as you did the potatoes, transfer to a second sheet of waxed paper, and reserve.  Remove the slicing disk from the processor and insert the chopping blade.

Add the anchovy paste, butter, flour, pepper, and 1/2 cup of the cream to the processor and churn 3 to 5 seconds until smooth.  Add the remaining cream and the milk and pulse 4 to 5 times to incorporate.

Layer 1/3 of the potatoes in the prepared casserole, spreading evenly, top with 1/3 of the onions and 1/3 of the anchovy mixture.  Repeat twice.  The anchovy mixture should just be visible in the casserole; it should not cover the onions and potatoes.

Bake uncovered on the middle oven rack until bubbling and nicely browned, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let stand 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  If your food processor has a thin slicing disk, by all means use it. Otherwise, the medium disk will do. Also, because of the saltiness of the anchovy paste, this recipe needs no salt.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR LAMB SAUCE ===
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  lean ground lamb
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pound  eggplant -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 to 32 oz)
                        === FOR CHEESE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  milk
  1                     garlic clove
  1                     whole clove
     1/2         pound  feta cheese -- crumbled
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2              large  eggs
                        === FOR PASTA ===
  10            ounces  penne - (3 cups)

To make lamb sauce:  Cook onion in oil in a 4-quart heavy pot over moderately-low heat, stirring, until softened, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Add lamb and cook over moderately-high heat, stirring and breaking up lumps, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes.  Add garlic, salt, oregano, cinnamon, sugar, and pepper and cook, stirring, about 2 minutes.

Stir in eggplant and tomatoes and gently simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until eggplant is just tender, about 40 minutes.  Remove lid and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened, about 15 minutes more.  Season with the salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Make cheese sauce and cook pasta while lamb sauce is simmering:  Melt butter in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, then stir in flour and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Whisk in milk and add garlic clove and whole clove, then bring to a boil, whisking constantly.  Reduce heat and simmer, whisking occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Add feta, salt, and pepper and cook, whisking vigorously, until cheese is well incorporated.

Beat eggs in a large bowl and gradually add sauce to eggs, whisking.  Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until just al dente, then drain in a colander.  Toss half of pasta with lamb sauce and half with cheese sauce.

Assemble pastitsio:  Pour pasta with lamb sauce into a wide shallow 3-quart baking dish, spreading evenly.  Spoon pasta with cheese sauce on top, spreading evenly.  Bake pastitsio, uncovered, in middle of oven until bubbling and top is golden, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2          large  carrots -- cut 1/4"-thk rounds
  1              small  sweet potato -- peeled, and

  5        tablespoons  champagne vinegar
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1              pound  rib-eye -- very thinly sliced

  12            slices  white American cheese
  4                     poppy seed kaiser rolls -- split

Make Gary's Secret Onions:  In a bowl, combine all the ingredients except the onions and oil.  Working in batches, grind the spice mixture in a clean coffee grinder.  Return half of the spice mixture to the bowl and reserve the remaining spice mixture.  Add the onions to the bowl of spice mixture and mix to combine.  Store the onions in the refrigerator, covered, to marinate for at least 3 hours and up to overnight.  Heat the 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the marinated onions and reserved spice mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent.  Set aside covered with foil to keep warm.

Make the Tangy Relish And Cheese Steak:  In a mini food processor, combine the ketchup, capers, cornichons, green peppercorns, and celery salt and pulse four or five times.  Add the vinegars and pulse two to three times until just blended.  Set aside.

When ready to serve, heat the 2 teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the beef and cook, stirring, until just cooked through.  Remove from the heat.

Slather the bottom halves of the rolls with the tangy relish and top with the beef, onions, cheese and the top halves of the rolls.  Slice and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2             pounds  equal-sized boiling potatoes
  3        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  chopped celery

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  Italian parsley leaves - (lightly packed)
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves - (lightly packed)
  1           teaspoon  fresh rosemary leaves
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried rosemary, crumbled)
  1         tablespoon  fresh marjoram leaves
                        = (or 1 tspn dried marjoram, crumbled)
  6                     veal shanks abt 4" dia and 2 1/2" thk
     3/4           cup  unsifted all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt - (to 1 1/2)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     large whole garlic clove -- peeled, halved
  1              large  Spanish onion -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" chunks
  1             medium  celery rib -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" lengths
  2             medium  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" lengths
  6                     strips lemon zest - (3" long)
  2             medium  ripe tomatoes -- cored, and
                        cut into slim wedges (no need to peel)
  2               cups  dry white wine
                        = (such as Pinot Grigio)
                        === GREMOLATA ===
  2             medium  whole cloves garlic -- halved
  5                     strips lemon zest - (3" long)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  Italian parsley leaves - (lightly packed) -- rinsed in cool
                        water and wrung as dry as possible in
                        paper toweling

For the Ossobuco:  Churn the parsley, basil, and fresh marjoram and rosemary, if using, in a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade 5 seconds.  Scrape the work bowl and churn 2 to 3 seconds more until moderately fine.  Scrape into a large fine sieve, then rinse the work bowl and blade directly over the sieve so that all stray bits of herbs fall into it.  Rinse the herbs well under cool running water, transfer to paper toweling, and wring dry.  Set aside.

Dredge the veal shanks well on all sides in the flour, shaking off the excess.  Heat the butter and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large, heavy nonreactive kettle over high heat for 2 minutes.

Add 1/2 the shanks, brown well on all sides, and lift to paper toweling to drain.  Add the remaining tablespoon olive oil to the kettle, heat 1 minute, then add the remaining shanks, and brown the same way.  Transfer to paper toweling to drain and slide the kettle off the heat.  Sprinkle the shanks well on both sides with the salt and pepper.

Add the garlic to the processor and mince fine by churning 4 to 5 seconds.  Scrape the work bowl well, add the 1/2 the onion, the dried marjoram and rosemary, if using, and pulse 5 to 6 times until moderately coarsely chopped; add to the drippings in the kettle.  Coarsely chop the remaining onion with the celery the same way and add to the kettle.

Add the carrots to the processor and churn 10 to 15 seconds until fairly finely chopped.  Add to the kettle along with the lemon zest and reserved chopped parsley and herbs.  Stir well to mix.

Set the kettle over low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables very soft but not brown.

Meanwhile, add the tomatoes to the processor (no need to wash the bowl or blade), and reduce to juice by churning 30 seconds.

Add the tomatoes to the kettle together with the wine and stir well to mix.  Return the veal shanks to the kettle, pushing down under the liquid.  Bring to a boil over moderately-high heat, then adjust the heat so the mixture bubbles gently, cover, and simmer very slowly until the meat almost falls from the bones, 3 1/2 to 4 hours.  Remove the strips of lemon zest and discard.  Taste for salt and pepper and adjust as needed -- but remember there's salt in the gremolata.

For the Gremolata:  Coarsely chop garlic and lemon zest with the salt in a mini food processor using 2 (5-second) pulses, scraping the work bowl and lid in between.  Use the 'grind' mode if your mini offers that option.  Add the parsley and coarsely chop with 3 (2-second) pulses, again scraping the work bowl and lid between each.  (If the mini has 'chop' mode, use it for the parsley.)

Scatter the gremolata evenly over the veal shanks, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes more.

Serve the ossobuco with boiled rice -- either over it or beside it.

This recipe yields 6 serving.

<DirS>
<DirT>
For the Ossobuco:  Churn the parsley, basil, and fresh marjoram and rosemary, if using, in a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade 5 seconds.  Scrape the work bowl and churn 2 to 3 seconds more until moderately fine.  Scrape into a large fine sieve, then rinse the work bowl and blade directly over the sieve so that all stray bits of herbs fall into it.  Rinse the herbs well under cool running water, transfer to paper toweling, and wring dry.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dredge the veal shanks well on all sides in the flour, shaking off the excess.  Heat the butter and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large, heavy nonreactive kettle over high heat for 2 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add 1/2 the shanks, brown well on all sides, and lift to paper toweling to drain.  Add the remaining tablespoon olive oil to the kettle, heat 1 minute, then add the remaining shanks, and brown the same way.  Transfer to paper toweling to drain and slide the kettle off the heat.  Sprinkle the shanks well on both sides with the salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the garlic to the processor and mince fine by churning 4 to 5 seconds.  Scrape the work bowl well, add the 1/2 the onion, the dried marjoram and rosemary, if using, and pulse 5 to 6 times until moderately coarsely chopped; add to the drippings in the kettle.  Coarsely chop the remaining onion with the celery the same way and add to the kettle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the carrots to the processor and churn 10 to 15 seconds until fairly finely chopped.  Add to the kettle along with the lemon zest and reserved chopped parsley and herbs.  Stir well to mix.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Set the kettle over low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables very soft but not brown.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, add the tomatoes to the processor (no need to wash the bowl or blade), and reduce to juice by churning 30 seconds.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the tomatoes to the kettle together with the wine and stir well to mix.  Return the veal shanks to the kettle, pushing down under the liquid.  Bring to a boil over moderately-high heat, then adjust the heat so the mixture bubbles gently, cover, and simmer very slowly until the meat almost falls from the bones, 3 1/2 to 4 hours.  Remove the strips of lemon zest and discard.  Taste for salt and pepper and adjust as needed -- but remember there&apos;s salt in the gremolata.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Gremolata:  Coarsely chop garlic and lemon zest with the salt in a mini food processor using 2 (5-second) pulses, scraping the work bowl and lid in between.  Use the &apos;grind&apos; mode if your mini offers that option.  Add the parsley and coarsely chop with 3 (2-second) pulses, again scraping the work bowl and lid between each.  (If the mini has &apos;chop&apos; mode, use it for the parsley.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Scatter the gremolata evenly over the veal shanks, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes more.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve the ossobuco with boiled rice -- either over it or beside it.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 serving.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2             pounds  ground pork
     1/3           cup  raisins
  1 1/2           cups  prepared tomato sauce
     1/2           cup  sliced pimiento-stuffed green olives
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying tortillas
  12                    corn tortillas - (7" dia)
  3               cups  shredded romaine or iceberg lettuce
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-grated radishes
                        Lime wedges
                        Shredded Jack cheese

Heat the oil a large heavy skillet over moderately-low heat.  Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, stirring, until softened.  Raise the heat slightly, add the pork and cook, stirring and breaking up any lumps, until no longer pink.  Pour off any excess fat, add the raisins, tomato sauce, olives, cinnamon, cloves, and salt and pepper, and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 to 15 minutes.  The picadillo may be made 1 day in advance, kept covered, chilled, and reheated before proceeding.

Pour enough oil into a straight-sided skillet to reach about 1/2-inch up the sides.  Heat the oil over moderately-high heat until it is hot but not smoking.  Fry the tortillas, 1 at a time, folding them almost in half with tongs to form taco shells until crisp, and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.

Divide the picadillo among the tacos, top with some of the lettuce and radish and serve with lime wedges and cheese.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  garlic head
  12              cups  water
  4               cups  chicken broth
  4             pounds  country-style pork ribs
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
                        = (preferably Mexican)
  2             ounces  dried New Mexico red chiles
  1 1/2           cups  boiling-hot water
     1/4         large  white onion
  3          teaspoons  salt -- divided
  2               cans  white hominy - (30 oz ea)
                        = (preferably Bush's Best)
  8                     corn tortillas
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable oil -- more or less
                        === ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
                        Diced avocado
                        Thinly-sliced iceberg or romaine lettuce
                        Chopped white onion
                        Diced radishes
                        Lime wedges
                        Dried oregano
                        Dried hot red pepper flakes

Peel the garlic cloves and reserve 2 for the chile sauce.  Slice the remaining garlic.  In a 7- to 8-quart heavy kettle bring water and broth just to a boil with sliced garlic and pork.  Skim the surface and add oregano.  Gently simmer pork, uncovered, until tender, about 1 1/2 hours.

While pork is simmering, wearing protective gloves, discard stems from chiles, and in a bowl, combine chiles with boiling-hot water.  Soak chiles, turning them occasionally, for 30 minutes.  Cut onion into large pieces and in a blender puree with chiles and soaking liquid, reserved 2 cloves of garlic, and 2 teaspoons of the salt until smooth.

Transfer pork with tongs to a cutting board and reserve broth mixture.  Using 2 forks, shred the pork.  Discard the pork bones.  Rinse and drain hominy.  Return pork to broth mixture and add chile sauce, hominy, and remaining teaspoon salt.  Simmer posole 30 minutes and, if necessary, season with salt.  Posole may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.

While posole is simmering, stack tortillas and halve.  Cut halves crosswise into thin strips.  In a 9- to 10-inch skillet heat 1/2 inch oil until hot but not smoking and fry tortilla strips in 3 or 4 batches, stirring occasionally, until golden, 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer tortilla strips with a slotted spoon as fried to brown paper or paper towels to drain.  Transfer tortilla strips to a bowl.  Tortilla strips may be made 1 day ahead and kept, covered, at room temperature.

Serve posole with tortilla strips and bowls of accompaniments.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BALSAMIC-HONEY GLAZE ===
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary -- plus
                        rosemary branches for garnish
     1/2           cup  balsamic vinegar
  3        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE PORK ===
  1 3/4         pounds  pork tenderloin - (to 2)
                        Canola oil -- for searing

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Make the Glaze:  Put garlic and rosemary in a small bowl.  Add the vinegar, honey, olive oil, mustard, and salt and pepper, to taste, and stir to combine.

For the Pork:  Slice the tenderloin into 1-inch thick medallions (rounds).  Cover the bottom of a medium skillet with a light film of canola oil and heat over medium-high heat until hot.  Add the pork slices in 1 layer, season with salt and pepper, and sear for 1 minute.  Turn and sear for 1 more minute, until lightly browned.  Transfer the slices in 1 layer to a shallow baking dish.

Pour the glaze over the slices and turn them to coat.

Roast for 8 to 10 minutes, until a thermometer inserted reaches 140 degrees for medium.  Remove from the oven and keep warm, loosely covered until ready to serve.

To serve place pork medallions on a platter and spoon the balsamic-honey glaze over them.  Garnish the platter with the rosemary sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Add the pork slices in 1 layer, season with salt and pepper, and sear for 1 minute.  Turn and sear for 1 more minute, until lightly browned.  Transfer the slices in 1 layer to a shallow baking dish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the glaze over the slices and turn them to coat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast for 8 to 10 minutes, until a thermometer inserted reaches 140 degrees for medium.  Remove from the oven and keep warm, loosely covered until ready to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve place pork medallions on a platter and spoon the balsamic-honey glaze over them.  Garnish the platter with the rosemary sprigs.

                      Portuguese Farm Bread - {Pao}

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
     3/4           cup  unsifted semolina (durum) flour
  1                cup  very warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  3               cups  sifted unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt

Combine the yeast, semolina flour, and water by pulsing 10 seconds in a large heavy-duty food processor (about 11 cup capacity) fitted with the metal chopping blade.  Scrape down the side of the work bowl, recover, and let stand until foamy, about 15 minutes.

With the machine running, add 1 1/2 cups of the all-purpose flour down the feed tube.  It's easier if the flour is poured from a spouted measuring cup into a wide-mouth canning funnel inserted in the feed tube, or a stiff piece of paper rolled into a cone (the opening at the bottom should be at least 1-inch across).

Using a plastic spatula scrape the work bowl and, if necessary, redistribute the dough so that it evenly surrounds the blade.  Be careful of the blade.  Add the salt and remaining flour, distribute evenly over the dough, and pulse for 10 seconds.  Again scrape the work bowl and redistribute the dough.

Pulse the dough for 20 seconds nonstop, shut the machine off, and let the dough rest covered in the work bowl for 5 minutes.  Now pulse for another 20 seconds.

Leaving the blade in place, carefully redistribute the dough until it's of uniform thickness.  Recover the work bowl, keeping the pusher from the feed tube in.  Note the level of the dough, estimate what it should be when doubled in bulk, and mark that level on the side of the work bowl.

Let the dough rise in the sealed work bowl until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.  Meanwhile, lightly coat an 8-inch springform pan or 8-inch pie pan lightly with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.

When the dough has fully doubled, pulse quickly 4 to 5 times to punch down, then pulse for 20 seconds nonstop.  Let the dough rest in the sealed work bowl for 5 minutes, then pulse for another 20 seconds.  The dough will roll into a ball and leave the sides of the work bowl reasonably clean.

Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface, shape into a ball, then roll in the flour to dust lightly.  Place the loaf in the prepared pan, cover with a clean, dry dish towel, and set in a warm, dry spot until nearly doubled in bulk, this will take about 30 minutes.

When the dough has risen for 10 minutes, position 1 rack in the middle of the oven and slide a second rack in the slot just below.  Place a large shallow baking pan on the lower rack -- I use a 15 1/2- by 10 1/2- by 1-inch jelly roll pan -- and half-fill with water.  Preheat oven to 500 degrees.

Center the risen loaf on the middle rack and bake uncovered for 15 minutes.  Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees and continue to bake until richly browned and hollow sounding when thumped, about 20 to 25 minutes longer.

Remove the bread from the pan as soon as it comes from the oven, set right-side up on a wire rack, and cool to room temperature before cutting.

This recipe yields 1 (8-inch) round loaf.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- plus
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  12                    prune plums -- halved, pitted
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  brandy
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  2                     extra-large eggs -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  ground toasted walnuts
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9-inch springform pan with 1 tablespoon of the butter and dust it with 1 tablespoon of the flour.

Toss the plums with 2 tablespoons of the sugar and the brandy; set aside.

Cream the remaining 8 tablespoons butter in a large bowl with 1 cup of the sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla until light and fluffy.  Sift the remaining 1 cup flour, baking powder, and salt together and beat into the creamed butter.

In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until they start to foam.  Do not over beat, or the cake will be tough.  Add the eggs and ground walnuts to the flour and butter mixture.  Mix well.

Scrape the batter into the prepared pan.  Arrange the plums on top in rings.  Sprinkle with any remaining brandy-sugar syrup and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.

Bake for 1 hour, or until the cake is golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the cake (not the plums) comes out clean.  Let cool for 10 minutes before removing the sides of the springform pan and serving.  Garnish with a dusting of confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR CRUST ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  cold unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces
  2        tablespoons  cold water - (to 3)
                        === FOR FILLING ===
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- softened
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1              large  egg -- beaten lightly
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  seedless raspberry jam
  1         tablespoon  water
  3               cups  raspberries -- picked over

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Make crust:  In a food processor blend together flour, sugar, and butter until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 2 tablespoons water and toss until incorporated.  Add enough remaining water if necessary until mixture begins to come together but is still crumbly.  Refrigerate dough, wrapped in plastic for 1 hour.

Press crust evenly onto bottom and sides of an 11-inch tart pan with removable fluted rim.  Prick the crust with a fork, line the dough with aluminum foil and weigh it down with pie weights or beans and bake in middle of oven until golden, about 30 minutes.

Make filling while crust bakes:  In a bowl with an electric mixer beat together cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, and egg until smooth.  Add flour and blend mixture well.

Pour the filling into the warm crust, spreading evenly, and bake in middle of oven until set, about 20 minutes.  Cool the tart in its pan on a rack.

In a small saucepan heat jam with water over moderate heat, stirring, until melted and smooth.  Remove pan from heat and cool jam slightly.  Arrange raspberries decoratively on top of tart and brush gently with jam.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  1              pound  rigatoni
                        = (or other large tubular pasta)
  2                     onions
  2              small  eggplants - (abt 2 lbs)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt -- plus more if needed
  1                cup  water - (to 1 1/2)
  2               cans  whole tomatoes - (16 oz ea) -- including juice
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
     1/2           cup  ricotta

Fill a 5-quart kettle 3/4 full with salted water and bring to a boil for pasta.

Chop onions and cut eggplants into 1-inch cubes.  In a large deep heavy skillet, heat oil over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking and cook onion, stirring occasionally, until softened.  Add eggplant and salt and cook, stirring frequently, until eggplant is lightly browned.

Add 1 cup water to eggplant mixture and cook, covered, over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, adding more water, 1/4 cup at a time, if mixture becomes dry.  Cook until eggplant is tender, about 10 minutes.  Add tomatoes with juice and simmer, stirring vigorously to break up tomatoes, for about 5 minutes, or until mixture has a sauce-like consistency.  Stir in garlic and basil and season with salt to taste and add Parmesan.

While sauce is simmering, cook pasta in boiling water until al dente and drain well in a colander.  Add pasta to sauce and toss to coat.  Divide pasta between 4 bowls and serve with dollops of ricotta on top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                     kabocha squash - (4 lbs) -- halved, seeded
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  20             whole  fresh sage leaves -- plus,
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh sage
     1/4         pound  sliced pancetta -- coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

Puree soup in batches in a blender, transferring to a bowl.  (Use caution when blending hot liquids.)  Return soup to pot and reheat.  If necessary, thin to desired consistency with water.  Stir in vinegar and salt and pepper, to taste.

  1                     pork tenderloin - (abt 1 lb)
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Top each packet with a lemon slice.  Cover packets with a sheet of waxed or parchment paper, then tightly cover dish with foil.

               Rosemary And Thyme Roasted Cornish Game Hens

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4          teaspoons  rosemary leaves
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- softened
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme leaves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  finely-grated fresh lemon zest
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              small  Cornish game hens - (abt 1 1/4 lbs ea)
  1              small  lemon -- halved
     1/4           cup  dessert or sweet wine
                        = (or a late harvest Riesling)
                        Rosemary sprigs -- for garnish
                        Thyme leaves -- for garnish

With a mortar and pestle coarsely crush rosemary and in a small bowl stir together with butter, thyme, zest, and salt and pepper, to taste, until combined well.  Spoon mixture onto a sheet of plastic wrap and form into a 4-inch long log.  Chill compound butter, wrapped well in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 30 minutes, and up to 3 days.

Preheat oven to 475 degrees.

Discard gizzards from birds and trim necks flush with bodies, if necessary.  Rinse birds inside and out and pat dry.  Starting at neck end of each bird, slide fingers between meat and skin to loosen skin (be careful not to tear skin).  Cut butter into 16 (1/4-inch thick) slices and gently push 4 slices under skin of each bird, putting 1 slice over each breast half and thigh.  Tie legs of each bird together with kitchen string and secure wings to sides with wooden picks or bamboo skewers.

Arrange birds in a flameproof roasting pan large enough to hold them without crowding.  Gently rub birds with lemon halves, squeezing juice over them, and season with salt and pepper.  Roast birds in middle of oven 30 minutes (for poussins) to 45 minutes (for Cornish hens), or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in thickest part of a thigh (be careful not to touch bone) registers 170 degrees.

Transfer birds to a platter and loosely cover with foil to keep warm.  Add the wine to roasting pan and deglaze over moderate heat, scraping up brown bits.  Transfer jus to a small saucepan.  Skim fat from jus and simmer until reduced to about 1/2 cup.  Garnish birds with herbs and serve with jus.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh sage
  2        tablespoons  fresh rosemary leaves
  10                    garlic cloves
  1         tablespoon  fennel seeds
  1 1/2    tablespoons  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  6             pounds  boneless pork Boston shoulder roast -- not tied
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Kitchen string

Preheat oven to 275 degrees.

Blend together sage, rosemary, garlic, fennel seeds, salt, and pepper in a food processor until a thick paste forms.  With motor running, add wine and oil and blend until combined well.

If necessary, trim fat from top of pork, to leave a 1/8-inch thick layer of fat.  Make 3 small incisions, each about 1-inch long and 1-inch deep, in each side of pork with a small sharp knife, and fill each with about 1 teaspoon herb paste.  Spread remaining herb paste over pork, concentrating on boned side, and tie roast with kitchen string at 2-inch intervals.

Put pork, fat-side up, in a roasting pan and roast in middle of oven 6 hours.  Transfer roast to cutting board and let stand 15 minutes.  Discard string and cut pork roast (with an electric knife if you have one) into thick slices.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  You can make the herb paste 1 day ahead and chill it, covered.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             ounces  mascarpone - (abt 2/3 cup)
  2        tablespoons  small brined capers -- rinsed
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh chives
  1           teaspoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4         pound  smoked salmon -- cut into 24 thin
                        slices, 2" to 3" on the short side
                        = (presliced salmon is fine)
  48             small  tender arugula leaves

Mix the mascarpone with 1 tablespoon of the capers, 1 tablespoon of the chives, and the lemon juice.  Season with salt and pepper.

Lay the salmon slices out on a cutting board so that they are all arranged with a short side facing you, with plenty of space above and below each slice.  (If necessary, fill and roll the slices in batches).

Put a spoonful of the mascarpone mixture on the narrow end of 1 slice.  Lay 2 arugula leaves, fanned slightly apart, across the mascarpone, so that the tips of the leaves will project several inches from one end of the roll, and roll up the salmon.  Stand the roll upright, the arugula leaves pointing upward, on a platter large enough to hold all 24 rolls.  Repeat the process with the remaining slices.  Cover and refrigerate until serving.

Remove from the refrigerator, sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon each capers and chives, and serve.

This recipe yields 24 hors d'oeuvres or 6 appetizer servings.

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR CRACKERS ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon rind
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
  2        tablespoons  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Kosher salt -- for sprinkling
                        === FOR CHOWDER ===
  6                     boiling potatoes - (to 8) -- abt 1 lb
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  5               cups  whole milk -- heated
  1              pound  salmon fillet -- skinned
  4             ounces  smoked salmon -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh dill
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To prepare the Crackers:  Combine the flour, pepper, lemon rind, and butter in a large bowl.  Blend with fingertips or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  Stir in the sour cream, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon cold water.  Toss to form stiff dough.  Turn out onto a floured work surface and knead briefly into a ball.  Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of cold water if the dough appears to be too stiff.  Wrap the ball in plastic and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 15 minutes (The dough can be made up to a day in advance).

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Cut the ball in half and working with one half at a time, roll the dough out 1/16-inch thick.  Use a 2-inch cookie cutter to make 16 rounds.  Repeat with the other half of the dough.  Transfer to an ungreased cookie sheet and sprinkle with salt.  Bake in the middle of the oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden.  Cool on wire racks for 5 minutes before serving.  (Makes 32 crackers)

To make the Chowder:  Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/4-inch cubes.  Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat; add the onion and cook, stirring often until softened, about 5 minutes.  Whisk in the flour and cook for about 3 minutes.  Increase the heat to medium-high, pour in the hot milk, and bring to a boil, whisking constantly.  Add the potatoes, season with salt, and reduce the heat to medium-low.  Cook until the potatoes are almost tender, 10 to 12 minutes.  Add the salmon, and cook until slightly firm to the touch, about 5 minutes.  Transfer the salmon to a plate and break into chunks.  Add the chunks, smoked salmon, dill and lemon juice to the hot chowder.  Season with salt and pepper and simmer until just heated through, about 2 minutes.  Serve hot with crackers on the side.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR CHILI ===
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2             pounds  boneless beef chuck or rump -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2              large  fresh jalapeÒo chiles -- seeded if desired,
                        and finely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  chili powder
  1                can  crushed tomatoes in puree - (28 oz)
  1                     box frozen corn - (10 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1                can  pinto or black beans - (15 to 16 oz) -- drained, rinsed
  1                cup  chopped pimiento-stuffed green olives
                        === FOR TOPPING ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal (not coarse)
  3             ounces  coarsely-grated sharp cheddar - (3/4 cup)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1             medium  fresh jalapeÒo chile -- seeded, chopped fine
     3/4           cup  milk
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, cooled
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten

Make Chili:  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown beef in 4 batches, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes per batch, transferring with a slotted spoon to a bowl.

Add remaining tablespoon oil to pot and cook onion and jalapeÒos over moderately-high heat, stirring, until onion is softened, about 4 minutes.  Reduce heat to moderate, then add garlic, salt, and chili powder and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Return beef to pot with any juices that have accumulated in bowl and stir in tomatoes, corn, and water.  Simmer chili, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until meat is very tender, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.

Remove from heat and stir in beans, olives, and salt, to taste.  Transfer chili to a shallow 3 quart baking dish.

Make Topping:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Whisk together flour, cornmeal, cheese, sugar, baking powder, salt, cumin, and jalapeÒo in a large bowl.  Whisk together milk, butter, and egg in a small bowl, then stir into flour mixture until just combined.

Drop batter by large spoonfuls (about 8) over chili, spacing them evenly, and bake in middle of oven 10 minutes.  Reduce temperature to 350 degrees and bake pie until topping is cooked through, about 30 minutes more.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1                can  tuna packed in olive oil - (6 to 7 oz)
  5                     anchovy fillets packed in olive oil -- drained

     1/4           cup  minced fresh flat-leaf parsley -- for garnish
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  2         tablespoon  capers -- drained
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2           cup  cream -- plus more if desired
                        === FOR SERVICE ===
  2               cups  combined endive, mache and/or arugula
  1                cup  shaved fennel
  1                cup  fresh corn kernels -- blanched
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as desired
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     Squeeze lemon juice
     1/2           cup  pitted Nicoise olives
                        Store-bought marinated roasted peppers
                        Store-bought marinated mushrooms

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Place slivers of garlic on the inside of the turkey breast and roll into neat package, tie with kitchen twine.  Rub olive oil all over the roast and season with salt and pepper.  If turkey breast was purchased tied, make small slits on the outside of the roast and insert the slivered garlic into the slits.

Put the onion, celery, and chopped garlic in roasting pan with 1/2 cup of the stock.  Lay seasoned turkey breast roll on top.  Lightly tent pan with foil.  Add more stock, as necessary, to keep vegetables from burning.  Roast for about 45 minutes, until internal temperature registers 160 degrees.

Remove and let cool in pan.  When turkey is room temperature, wrap well in plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 4 hours or up to 2 days.  Discard the onion, celery, and garlic.

To make the sauce:  Put the tuna, anchovies, 2 tablespoons of parsley, olive oil, and lemon juice in blender.  Using short pulses, puree the mixture.  Scrape the sides down frequently and stir to ensure even blending.  When smooth, add the mayonnaise, capers, and white pepper and blend.  Add the cream, a little at a time until you have desired texture and flavor.  Additional white pepper, lemon, or anchovy may be added at this point, if desired.  The sauce may be prepared up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated.

To serve, arrange the selection of greens, fennel, and corn on platter.  Drizzle lightly with olive oil, season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon.  Slice turkey thinly, about 1/8-inch thick, and arrange on top of the greens.  Drizzle with the sauce.  Garnish with minced parsley and olives.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  For a buffet party presentation, you could surround the Tonnato with marinated roast red peppers and mushrooms.

                        into 4 slices
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Asian-style chili oil to taste -- (optional)

Make the Slaw:  In a small saucepan, combine the water, sugar, and vinegar and bring to a boil.  Transfer the vinegar mixture to a bowl and cool.  Add the carrot and daikon, mix well, and season with salt.  Set aside to marinate for 30 minutes or store in the refrigerator up to overnight.

Meanwhile, make the Seasoned Pork:  Heat the oil in small nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, until soft.  Add the pork, seasoning, garlic, and pepper and cook, stirring, until just cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the heat and set aside covered with foil to keep warm.

Make the Sandwiches:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Slice the baguettes open lengthwise, and slather the insides with mayonnaise.  Arrange the baguettes on a baking sheet and bake until hot and crusty about 5 minutes.  Remove the baguettes from the oven and immediately fill each with some of the seasoned pork.  In each sandwich, arrange 2 slices each of the pork roll and salami, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, 1/2 tablespoon cilantro, 1 slice cucumber, ground pepper, and chili oil, if using.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
