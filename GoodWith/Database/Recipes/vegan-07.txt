  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  finely-diced onion
     1/3           cup  finely-diced celery
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
                        additional for oiling pan
  1         tablespoon  garlic -- minced
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped almonds
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped Brazil nuts
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped cashews
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  rubbed sage
  1 1/2           cups  breadcrumbs
  2        tablespoons  nutritional yeast flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  Ener-G Egg Replacer

In a non-stick skillet, saute the onion and celery in the olive oil for 5 minutes or until almost tender.  Add the garlic and saute an additional 1 minute.  Add the almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, parsley, thyme, and sage, stir well to combine, and saute the mixture an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until the nuts are fragrant.  Remove the skillet from the heat.

In a medium bowl, place the breadcrumbs, nutritional yeast flakes, salt, and pepper, and stir well to combine.  In a small bowl, place the water and egg replacer, and whisk vigorously for 1 minute or until very frothy.  Add the nut mixture and egg replacer mixture to the breadcrumb mixture and stir well to combine.

Using a little olive oil, lightly oil (or mist with oil) an 8- by 12-inch baking pan.  Transfer the nut mixture to the prepared pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown and firm to the touch.  Remove the pan from the oven and allow the loaf to cool for a few minutes before cutting into pieces.  Serve as a main dish, sandwich filling, or add to soups, salads, and side dishes.

This recipe yields one 8- by 12-inch loaf.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  raw almonds
  1 1/3           cups  water -- divided
  2        tablespoons  brown rice syrup
                        = (or maple syrup)
  2          teaspoons  unbleached cane sugar
                        = (or white sugar from sugar beets)
     3/4      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  8             slices  whole-grain bread
                        = (or other bread of choice)
                        Safflower oil -- for oiling pan

Begin by blanching the almonds.  In a small saucepan, place 2 inches of water, and bring to a boil.  Add the almonds and cook for 1 minute to blanch them.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside for 3 minutes to cool.

Remove the almonds from the water, squeeze each almond between your thumb and forefinger to remove their skins, and set them aside for 5 minutes to dry and cool.

Place the almonds in a blender or food processor and process for 1 to 2 minutes to finely grind them.  Add 1/3 cup of the water and the brown rice syrup and process for 1 minute or until smooth.  Add the remaining water, sugar, almond extract, vanilla, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and process the mixture an additional 2 minutes or until very smooth and creamy.

Transfer the mixture to a large casserole dish.  Place 4 slices of the bread in the almond mixture, flip them over to coat the other side, and then let the slices of bread soak in the liquid mixture for 2 minutes.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil a large non-stick skillet (or griddle), and place it over medium heat.  Using a fork, carefully remove the slices of bread from the almond mixture, and place them in the hot skillet.  Cook the bread slices for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden brown, carefully flip the slices over, and cook an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until golden brown.

While cooking the first batch, repeat the soaking procedure for the remaining 4 slices of bread.  Transfer the French toast to a large plate.  Lightly oil the skillet again with a little safflower oil and repeat the cooking procedure for the remaining slices of bread.

Serve the French toast with your choice of jams, preserves, syrups, or fresh fruit.

This recipe yields 8 slices.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
                        = (or vegetable stock)
     2/3           cup  millet -- rinsed, drained
     1/3           cup  quinoa -- rinsed, drained
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  raw almonds
     1/2           cup  raw sunflower seeds
     3/4           cup  red onion -- finely diced
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
                        additional for oiling cookie sheet
     1/2           cup  baby bella mushrooms -- roughly chopped
                        = (or other mushrooms of choice)
     1/3           cup  finely-diced carrot
     1/3           cup  finely-diced celery
     1/3           cup  diced seeded red pepper
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  spinach or Swiss chard -- triple washed,
                        patted dry, and roughly chopped
  3        tablespoons  quinoa flour
                        = (or brown rice flour)
  2        tablespoons  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce or Bragg Liquid Aminos)
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  2        tablespoons  cornmeal
                        	

In a medium saucepan, place the water, and bring to a boil.  Add the millet, quinoa, salt, basil, oregano, thyme, and pepper, stir to combine, and return the mixture to a boil.  Cover the saucepan, reduce the heat to low, and simmer the grains for 18 to 20 minutes or until all of the water has been absorbed.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, in a dry non-stick skillet, place the almonds and sunflower seeds and cook them over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes or until lightly toasted and fragrant.  Transfer them to a small bowl to cool.

In the same skillet, saute the red onion in the olive oil for 3 minutes to soften.  Add the mushrooms, carrot, celery, and red pepper, and continue to saute an additional 5 minutes or until the vegetables are crisp tender.  Add the garlic and saute an additional 1 minute.  Remove the skillet from the heat.

Transfer the slightly-cooled grains to a medium bowl.  Finely chop the toasted almonds and sunflower seeds and add them to the cooked grains.  Add the sauteed vegetable mixture, along with the remaining ingredients except the cornmeal, and stir well to combine.

Using a little olive oil, lightly oil (or mist with oil) a non-stick cookie sheet and set aside.  Place the cornmeal on a small plate.  Using a 1/2-cup measuring cup, portion the grain-vegetable mixture into 6 patties.  Dust the patties on all sides with the cornmeal and place them on the prepared cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned.  Serve the patties plain or with your choice of condiments.

This recipe yields 6 patties.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPICY SWEET POTATO SAUCE ===
  2               cups  cubed (1") peeled sweet potato
     1/2           cup  tomato juice
     1/4           cup  Red Chile Sauce -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === BLACK BEAN CAKES ===
  1                can  black beans - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1                cup  finely-diced seeded red pepper
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
  2        tablespoons  finely-diced seeded jalapeÒo pepper
  3        tablespoons  freshly-chopped cilantro
  2         tablespoon  lime juice
     1/2           cup  unbleached flour -- divided
  2        tablespoons  cornmeal
  1               dash  chili powder
                        Safflower oil -- as needed
                        Green Chiles And Almond Cream -- (see recipe)

Begin by preparing the Spicy Sweet Potato Sauce:  Place the cubed sweet potatoes in a steamer basket and steam them for 10 to 15 minutes or until tender.  Allow the sweet potatoes to cool for 10 minutes.

Transfer potatoes to a food processor or blender, add the tomato juice, Red Chile Sauce, lime juice, cumin, and cinnamon, and process until smooth.

Transfer the sauce to a small saucepan, add the cilantro, season to taste with salt, and stir well to combine.  Warm the sauce over low heat while preparing the Baja Black Bean Cakes.

In a medium bowl, place the black beans, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper.  Using a potato masher or fork, roughly mash the mixture to combine.  Add the red pepper, green onion, jalapeÒo pepper, cilantro, and lime juice, and stir well to combine.

On a plate, place 1/4 cups flour, cornmeal, and dash of chili powder, stir well to combine, and set aside.  Add the remaining flour to the black bean mixture and stir well to combine.  Using a 1/4-cup measuring cup, portion the mixture into 8 patties, and place them on a large plate.  Chill the bean cakes for 30 minutes or more in the refrigerator.

Lightly oil a non-stick cookie sheet with a little safflower oil and set aside.  Coat the chilled cakes in the reserved flour/cornmeal mixture and place them on the cookie sheet.  Brush a little safflower oil on the tops of each bean cake.  Bake them at 450 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned and crisp on the outside.  Top individual servings of the bean cakes with some of the Spicy Sweet Potato Sauce and a dollop of the Green Chiles and Almond Cream.

This recipe yields 8 bean cakes or 3 to 4 servings.

Comments:  The Baja Black Bean Cakes can also be served with a little Red Chile Sauce drizzled over the bean cake and then topped with a spoonful of Avocado, Black Bean, and Tomato Salsa (see recipe).

  3           packages  tempeh - (8 oz ea)
                        Safflower oil -- for oiling pans
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce or Bragg Liquid Aminos)
     1/2           cup  water
                        = (or vegetable stock)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === BREADING ===
     1/3           cup  unbleached flour
     3/4           cup  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk
                        of choice)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce or Bragg Liquid Aminos)
     2/3           cup  breadcrumbs
     1/2           cup  nutritional yeast flakes
     1/4           cup  cornmeal
  3        tablespoons  freshly-chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped thyme
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper

Begin by cutting each block of tempeh into pieces that are 2 inches wide and 1/4-inch thick.  Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or mist with oil) a casserole dish that is large enough to hold the pieces of tempeh in a single layer, and then place the pieces of tempeh in the dish.

In a small bowl, stir together all of the marinade ingredients, and then pour it over the tempeh pieces.  Place the casserole dish in the refrigerator and leave the tempeh to marinate for 20 minutes.

Remove the casserole dish from the refrigerator, carefully flip over each piece of tempeh, return the casserole dish to the refrigerator, and continue to marinate the tempeh for 20 additional minutes or more.

Remove the casserole dish from the refrigerator and bake the tempeh in the marinade at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  Remove the casserole dish from the oven, carefully flip over the pieces of tempeh, return the casserole dish to the oven, and bake an additional 10 minutes or until all of the liquid has been absorbed.  Remove the casserole dish from the oven and set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, prepare the breading setup for the tempeh.  Place the flour on a large plate and set aside.  In a shallow bowl or pie pan, place the soy milk, lemon juice, and tamari, stir well to combine, and set aside for 10 minutes to allow the mixture to thicken slightly.  On a large plate, place the remaining ingredients, stir well to combine and set aside.  Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or mist with oil) two non-stick cookie sheets, and set aside.

When the tempeh pieces are completely cool, carefully dip each piece of tempeh in the flour, coating each evenly on all sides, and place them on large plates.  Add any remaining flour to the breadcrumb mixture and stir well to combine.

Carefully and quickly dip each piece of floured tempeh into the soy milk mixture, coating the pieces evenly on all sides, and then return them to the large plates.  Then dip the coated tempeh pieces into the breadcrumb mixture, pressing evenly to coat on all sides, and return them to the large plates.

After all of the pieces have been coated with the breadcrumb mixture once, return each cutlet to the breadcrumb mixture and press firmly to give each of them a second coating.

Place the breaded cutlets on the prepared cookie sheets.  Using a little safflower oil, drizzle the top of each tempeh cutlet lightly with oil (or mist with oil).  Bake the cutlets at 400 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until the breading is crispy and golden brown.  Transfer the cutlets to a large platter for service.  Leftovers make excellent fillings for sandwiches or wraps, or cut into cubes and add to salads, grains, or side dishes.

This recipe yields 24 cutlets.

                  Baked Tofu With Ratatouille Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm tofu
  2               cups  horizontally-sliced lengthwise-quartered
                        green pepper
  2               cups  horizontally-sliced lengthwise-quartered
                        red, orange, or yellow pepper
  2               cups  sliced onion in half moons
  3         tablespoon  olive oil -- divided
  2               cups  zucchini in 1/2" by 2" sticks
  1 1/2           cups  yellow squash in 1/2" by 2" sticks
  4           teaspoon  minced garlic -- divided
     1/2           cup  white wine
                        = (or white grape juice or apple juice)
     1/3           cup  black olives -- pitted, and each
                        cut from end to end into 6 strips
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped basil -- divided
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- divided
  2         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1 1/2       teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce)

Cut the block of tofu in half lengthwise, turn each half cut-side down on the board, and cut through the outer edge of the block of tofu 3 times to yield 4 tofu cutlets from each half.  This means that the block of tofu will yield 8 tofu cutlets.

On a large cookie sheet, place a clean, lint-free towel, or a layer of natural, unbleached paper towels, then all of the tofu cutlets in a single layer, followed by another layer of toweling, and finally place another large cookie sheet on top.  Place several large cans or something very heavy on top of the cookie sheet and leave tofu to sit for 1 hour.  This process is known as cutting tofu into cutlets and pressing.  I use this technique a lot as it makes the texture of the tofu much firmer.

Meanwhile, in a non-stick skillet, saute both peppers and onion in 2 tablespoon of the olive oil for 3 minutes to soften.  Add the zucchini, yellow squash, 1 tablespoon of garlic, and saute an additional 3 minutes or until the vegetables are crisp tender.  Add the white wine, olives, half of the fresh herbs, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes.

While the vegetables are simmering, in a small bowl, combine the remaining olive oil, garlic, fresh herbs, black pepper, and other remaining ingredients, stir well to blend, and set aside.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) a 9- by 13-inch baking dish.  Spread the sauteed vegetable mixture in the bottom of the pan.  Place the pressed tofu in two rows over the top of the vegetables and pour the reserved red wine vinegar mixture over the tofu.

Cover the baking dish with a piece of aluminum foil and bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.  Serve 2 pieces of tofu per person with a generous portion of the ratatouille vegetables spooned over the top of the tofu.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  vital wheat gluten
  3        tablespoons  nutritional yeast flakes
  2          teaspoons  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1                cup  water
                        = (or vegetable stock)
                        Safflower oil -- for oiling pan
  1                cup  Sweet And Spicy Barbecue Sauce -- (see recipe)

In a medium bowl, place the vital wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, onion powder, and garlic powder, and stir well to combine.  Using your hands, mix the water into the dry ingredients, and work into a soft dough that will feel very moist to the touch.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or lightly mist) a 9-inch square baking pan.  Transfer the dough to the prepared pan, and using your hands, flatten the dough to evenly cover the bottom of the pan.  Using a sharp knife, cut the dough into 8 strips lengthwise, turn the pan a quarter turn, and then make one cut through the middle widthwise to form 16 pieces.

Bake the seitan for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  Prepare the Sweet and Spicy Barbecue Sauce according to the recipe instructions.

After 20 minutes of baking, remove the pan from the oven.  Spread a little of the Sweet and Spicy Barbecue Sauce over each of the puffed strips.  Return the pan to the oven and bake an additional 12 to 15 minutes.

Serve the strips as an appetizer or main dish, or chop and use to add flavor to soups, salads, grains, and side dishes.

This recipe yields 16 seitan strips.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  vital wheat gluten
  2          teaspoons  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  water
                        = (or vegetable stock)
  2             quarts  vegetable stock

In a medium bowl, place the vital wheat gluten, onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper, and stir lightly.  Add the 1 1/2 cups water (or vegetable stock) and stir well to combine.

Using your hands, knead the mixture for 1 to 2 minutes to form a smooth and pliable ball of dough.  Divide the mixture into 2 pieces and form into logs or separate into several small pieces.

Place the 2 quarts of vegetable stock in a large saucepan or pot and place the saucepan over low heat.  Add the seitan pieces, cover, and simmer (do not allow to boil or it will effect the texture of the seitan) for 40 to 50 minutes or until firm to the touch.  Remove the seitan from the broth and allow it to cool slightly before use.

The seitan can be sliced, cubed, or chopped for use in recipes and the cooking liquid can be used to flavor sauces, soups, grains, main and side dishes.

This recipe yields 4 1/2 cups or 5 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  sweet potatoes -- unpeeled, and
                        washed well
     1/2           cup  diced onion -- diced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  diced seeded green pepper
     1/2           cup  diced seeded Roma tomatoes
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                can  black beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  1                can  tomato sauce - (8 oz)
                        Hot pepper sauce -- to taste

Using a fork, pierce the skins of the sweet potatoes in several places.  Place an oven-proof rack on a cookie sheet and place the sweet potatoes on the rack.  Bake at 400 degrees for 60 to 75 minutes or until the sweet potatoes feel soft when gently squeezed.

While the sweet potatoes are baking, prepare the black bean chili.  In a medium saucepan, saute the onion in the olive oil for 3 minutes to soften.  Add the green pepper and saute an additional 3 to 4 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.  Add the tomatoes, garlic, and seasonings, and saute an additional 2 minutes.

Add the black beans, tomato sauce, and season to taste with hot pepper sauce, stir well to combine, and simmer the chili for 10 minutes.  Taste and adjust seasonings, to taste.  Remove the saucepan from the heat.

When the sweet potatoes are tender, remove the cookie sheet from the oven and leave the sweet potatoes on the rack to cool for 5 minutes.  For each serving, place one sweet potato on a plate or in a bowl, split it open, ladle some of the black bean chili over the top, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Using a fork, pierce the skins of the sweet potatoes in several places.  Place an oven-proof rack on a cookie sheet and place the sweet potatoes on the rack.  Bake at 400 degrees for 60 to 75 minutes or until the sweet potatoes feel soft when gently squeezed.

<DirT>
While the sweet potatoes are baking, prepare the black bean chili.  In a medium saucepan, saute the onion in the olive oil for 3 minutes to soften.  Add the green pepper and saute an additional 3 to 4 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.  Add the tomatoes, garlic, and seasonings, and saute an additional 2 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the black beans, tomato sauce, and season to taste with hot pepper sauce, stir well to combine, and simmer the chili for 10 minutes.  Taste and adjust seasonings, to taste.  Remove the saucepan from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the sweet potatoes are tender, remove the cookie sheet from the oven and leave the sweet potatoes on the rack to cool for 5 minutes.  For each serving, place one sweet potato on a plate or in a bowl, split it open, ladle some of the black bean chili over the top, and serve.

                 Blue Plate Special - Hot Seitan Sandwich

Recipe By     :Beverly Lynn Bennett
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches
                Vegan                           Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Basic Simmered Savory Seitan A.K.A. Gluten -- (see recipe)
     1/3           cup  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce or Bragg Liquid Aminos)
  1              piece  ginger - (1" long) -- sliced
  4          teaspoons  toasted sesame oil
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Portabello Mushroom Gravy -- (see recipe)
  6              large  rolls
                        = (or slices of whole-grain bread)
                        === SIDE DISH SUGGESTIONS ===
                        Oven-Baked Seasoned French Fries -- (see recipe)
                        = (or mashed potatoes)
                        Cooked carrots and peas

Begin by preparing the Basic Simmered Savory Seitan A.K.A. Gluten according to the recipe instructions.  Remove the pieces of seitan from the cooking liquid and immerse them in a bowl of ice water, which will "shock" them, and make the texture of the final product much firmer.

Add the tamari, slices of ginger, toasted sesame oil, and black pepper to the seitan cooking liquid.  Return the seitan pieces to the cooking liquid, cover, and simmer the seitan an additional 45 minutes.  Remove the seitan pieces from the cooking liquid and set them a side to cool slightly.

Using a very sharp knife, thinly slice the pieces of seitan, and set aside.  Remove and discard the ginger slice, and reserve the seitan cooking liquid for use in making the Portabello Mushroom Gravy.

Prepare the Portabello Mushroom Gravy according to the recipe instructions.  Prepare the side dish suggestions, if desired, of Oven-Baked Seasoned French Fries according to the recipe instructions, or mashed potatoes and cooked carrots and peas.

To assemble the sandwiches:  Slice a large roll (or slices of whole grain bread) in half lengthwise (toast lightly, if desired).  On the bottom part of the roll, place 2 ounces of the sliced seitan, ladle a little of the Portabello Mushroom Gravy over the top of the seitan, replace the top of the roll (or slice of whole grain bread), secure with toothpicks if desired, and cut each sandwich in half with a sharp knife.

Transfer the sandwich to a plate and serve with sides of Oven-Baked Seasoned French Fries or mashed potatoes topped with a little additional Portabello Mushroom Gravy, if desired, and cooked carrots and peas for a diner or comfort food type of meal.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  whole-wheat pastry flour -- divided
     3/4           cup  cornmeal
  1 1/4      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  sea salt
  1 1/3           cups  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk
                        of choice)
     1/2           cup  apple juice
                        = (or water)
  10            ounces  fresh or frozen blueberries
                        Safflower oil -- as needed

Place 2 tablespoons of the whole wheat pastry flour in a medium bowl and set aside.  In a large bowl, place the remaining whole wheat pastry flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, and stir well to combine.

In a small bowl, place the soy milk and apple juice, and whisk well to combine.  Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until just mixed.  Place the blueberries in the medium bowl with the reserved whole wheat pastry flour and gently toss to thoroughly coat the blueberries with the flour.  Gently fold the blueberries into the batter.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil a large non-stick skillet (or griddle), and place it over medium heat.  Using a 1/4-cup measuring cup, portion the batter into the hot skillet, and cook until the corncakes have bubbles on top and the edges are slightly dry, about 3 minutes.

Using a spatula, carefully flip over the corncakes and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown.  Transfer the corncakes to a non-stick cookie sheet and place in a 200 degree oven to keep warm while continuing with the remaining batter.

Lightly oil the skillet again with a little safflower oil and repeat the cooking procedure for the remaining batter.  Serve the corncakes with your choice of jams, preserves, syrups, or fresh fruit.

This recipe yields 16 pancakes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  onion -- diced
  1                cup  shallot -- diced
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3             pounds  buttercup squash -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
                        = (or other winter squash)
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  7               cups  vegetable stock
     1/2           cup  orange juice
  1         tablespoon  orange zest
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  1                     bay leaf
  1                cup  soy milk

                        Freshly-snipped chives

In a large pot, saute the onion and shallot in olive oil for 5 minutes to soften.  Add the buttercup squash and ginger, and saute an additional 5 minutes.

Add the vegetable stock, orange juice, orange zest, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and bay leaf, and bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 25 minutes or until the squash is tender.  Remove the pot from the heat, remove the bay leaves, and discard them.

Using an immersion blender or food processor, puree the soup in batches.  Stir in the soy milk and reheat the soup until just heated through, if necessary.  Do not boil the soup or the soy milk will curdle.

Garnish individual servings with a few toasted pumpkin seeds or toasted almonds, or a few snipped chives for color.

This recipe yields 3 quarts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     red peppers -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and cut into quarters lengthwise
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  3               cups  diced peeled potatoes
  2               cups  diced red onion
  1                cup  diced celery
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4           cup  unbleached flour
  4               cups  vegetable stock -- divided
     1/4           cup  dry sherry
  1                cup  soy milk
                        = (rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Basil-Spinach Puree -- (see recipe)

Place the red peppers, skin-side up, on a cookie sheet.  Using your fingers, coat the skins with a little of the olive oil.  Place the peppers under the broiler and broil for several minutes or until the skin has charred and blackened.  Remove the cookie sheet from the oven, place the peppers in a brown bag, and allow them to cool in the bag for 15 minutes.  Remove the peppers from the bag, remove and discard the blackened skins, place the peppers on a plate, and set aside.

In a large pot, saute the potato, red onion, and celery in olive oil for 10 minutes or until lightly browned and soft.  Add the garlic, chili powder, paprika, salt, and white pepper, and saute an additional 2 minutes.  Sprinkle the flour over the top of the vegetables, stir well, and cook an additional 1 minute.  Remove the pot from the heat.

Transfer the roasted red peppers and sauteed vegetables to a food processor.  Add 1 cup vegetable stock and puree until smooth.  Transfer the puree back to the large pot, add the remaining vegetable stock and sherry, and simmer over low heat until heated through.  Stir in the soy milk, taste, and adjust the seasonings as needed.

Garnish individual servings with a drizzle of the Basil-Spinach Puree for added color and flavor.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  1 1/2         pounds  asparagus -- tough ends trimmed
  3               cups  cubed (1/2") peeled Yukon Gold potatoes
  2               cups  diced onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1                cup  cold water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch or arrowroot
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
  3        tablespoons  freshly-chopped basil
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

                        Thinly-sliced lemon

Cut the tips off the asparagus, place them in a steamer basket, steam them for 2 to 3 minutes or until tender, and set aside.  Thinly slice the stems diagonally, place them in a steamer basket, steam them for 4 to 5 minutes or until tender, and set aside.

Add half of the reserved steamed asparagus stems to the food processor and puree the mixture until smooth.  To the pot containing the herbed cooking liquid, add the pureed mixture, reserved steamed tips and stems, and the remaining ingredients, and stir well to combine.  Remove the pot from the heat and set the soup aside for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.

Taste and adjust seasonings, as needed.  Serve hot or cold and garnish individual servings with a thin slice of lemon.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  water -- divided

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  firm tofu -- patted dry
  2               cups  Curry And Herb Marinade -- (see recipe)

Cut each block of tofu in half lengthwise.  Turn each half cut-side down on the board, and cut through the outer edge of the block of tofu 3 times to yield 4 tofu cutlets from each half.  This means that each block of tofu will yield 8 tofu cutlets.

On a large cookie sheet, place a clean, lint-free towel, or a layer of natural, unbleached paper towels, then all of the tofu cutlets in a single layer, followed by another layer of toweling, and finally place another large cookie sheet on top.  Place several large cans or something very heavy on top of the cookie sheet and leave tofu to sit for 1 hour.  This process is known as cutting tofu into cutlets and pressing.  I use this technique a lot as it makes the texture of the tofu much firmer.

Cover the bottom of a large casserole dish with a third of the marinade, place the pressed tofu cutlets on top, and pour the remaining marinade over the top.  Cover, place in the refrigerator, and leave to marinate for 1 hour.

Place the cutlets on a hot grill and cook for 7 to 8 minutes per side or until lightly browned around the edges.  Transfer the grilled cutlets to a platter and serve two cutlets per person.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16             large  broccoli florets
  16             large  cauliflower florets
  16                    button mushrooms -- wiped clean
  2              large  red onions -- each cut 8 wedges
  2                     green peppers -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and cut into 16 pieces
  2                     orange or yellow peppers -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and cut into 16 pieces
  2                     red peppers -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and cut into 16 pieces
  1                     eggplant -- stemmed, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  1                cup  Curry And Herb Marinade -- (see recipe)
  8                     bamboo skewers

Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil.  Add broccoli and cook 1 to 2 minutes or until it turns bright green.  Remove the broccoli with a slotted spoon and immediately plunge into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process.  Remove the broccoli from the ice water and allow to dry on a towel.  Repeat the same process with the cauliflower.

Thread the vegetables onto the skewers in the following order: 1 button mushroom, 1 wedge of red onion, 2 pieces of orange pepper, 2 cauliflower florets with the tops facing outward, 2 pieces of green pepper, 2 pieces of eggplant, 2 pieces of red pepper, 2 broccoli florets with the tops facing outward, 1 wedge of red onion, and end with 1 button mushroom.  Repeat the same procedure for the remaining skewers.

Place the skewers in a large casserole dish, pour the marinade over the top of the kabobs, and rotate them a bit to fully coat with the marinade.  Cover, place in the refrigerator, and allow to marinate for 1 hour.

Place the skewers on a hot grill, turn them over often, and cook until lightly charred on all sides, approximately 10 minutes total cooking time.  Transfer the kabobs to a large platter and serve 1 kabob per person.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

           Fettuccine In The Raw With Basil-Parsley Pesto Sauce

Recipe By     :Beverly Lynn Bennett
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Vegan
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  sundried tomatoes -- cut small pieces
  3               cups  zucchini -- cut into "noodles"
  3               cups  summer squash -- cut into "noodles"
  1 1/2           cups  diced seeded yellow or orange pepper
     1/2           cup  black olives -- roughly chopped
     1/2           cup  Basil-Parsley Pesto Sauce -- (see recipe), or
                        more to taste
     1/3           cup  finely-diced shallots
     1/3           cup  pine nuts
  3        tablespoons  nutritional yeast flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a small bowl, place the sundried tomatoes, cover with warm water, and set aside for 20 to 30 minutes to rehydrate.  Drain off any remaining water from the sundried tomatoes (saving it for use in another dish) and set aside.

To make "noodles" from vegetables, use a spiral vegetable slicer to cut the zucchini and summer squash into "noodles" or long ribbons.  Or, slice the zucchini and summer squash in half lengthwise, make a "v" shaped cut to remove most of the seed section, and cut the seed section into long thin strips.  Then, using a vegetable peeler, shave long strips down the entire length of the zucchini and summer squash halves, repeating the process for all of the zucchini and summer squash halves, and then pack the "noodles" into a measuring cup to measure.

Transfer the zucchini and summer squash "noodles" to a large bowl, add the remaining ingredients, and toss gently to combine.  Season the mixture to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Serve immediately or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Place them on a hot grill, grill them for 2 to 3 minutes or until lightly browned or slightly wilted on one side, carefully turn them over, and grill the other side until lightly browned and wilted, an additional 2 to 3 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  water
  1              pound  collard greens -- washed well,
                        stemmed, and roughly chopped
                        = (or a 10-oz pkg frozen collard greens)
  1              pound  turnip greens -- washed well,
                        stemmed, and roughly chopped
                        = (or a 10-oz pkg frozen turnip greens)
  1              pound  kale -- washed well,
                        stemmed, and roughly chopped
                        = (or a 10-oz pkg frozen kale)
  1              pound  spinach -- washed well,
                        stemmed, and roughly chopped
                        = (or a 10-oz pkg frozen spinach)
     1/4           cup  safflower oil
     1/4           cup  unbleached flour
  1 1/2           cups  onion -- diced
  1                cup  diced celery
  1                cup  diced seeded green pepper
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  3               cups  shredded cabbage
  1         tablespoon  Creole Seasoning -- (see recipe)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                     bay leaf
  4               cups  water
  2               cups  brown rice -- rinsed
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
     1/4           cup  nutritional yeast flakes
                        Tabasco sauce -- for garnishing
                        = (or other hot sauce)

In a large saucepan, place the 2 quarts of water, and bring to a boil.  Cook the collard greens in the boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes to blanch them.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the collard greens from the boiling water, place them in a large bowl, and set aside.  Cook the turnip greens, kale, and spinach in the same manner, and add to the bowl of collard greens.

If using frozen greens, cook them individually in the boiling water until thawed, then remove them with a slotted spoon, and place them in a large bowl for later use.  Set the cooking liquid aside for use in the gumbo.

In a large pot, stir together the oil and flour to form a roux.  Cook the roux over medium heat, while stirring constantly for 20 to 30 minutes, or until it is a golden (nutty) color.  Add the onion, celery, green pepper, and garlic, stir well to combine, and cook an additional 5 to 7 minutes or until the vegetables are soft.

Slowly, stir a little of the greens' cooking liquid into the roux-vegetable mixture, blending them thoroughly together, and then stir in the remaining cooking liquid.  Add the reserved greens, cabbage, Creole Seasoning, salt, and bay leaf, and bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, bring the 4 cups water to a boil.  Add the brown rice, stir well, cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 45 minutes or until the water is absorbed.  Remove the saucepan from the heat, leave covered, and set aside for 10 minutes to allow the rice to steam.

After the gumbo has simmered for 45 minutes, add the parsley and nutritional yeast, and simmer an additional 5 minutes.  Taste and add additional Creole Seasoning or salt, if needed.  Serve the gumbo in bowls over the brown rice, and garnish individual servings with a little Tabasco sauce, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  you can substitute other fresh or frozen greens of choice such as, Swiss chard, mustard greens, beet greens, or escarole.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  vegetable stock - (to 4)
  1              pound  asparagus -- tough ends trimmed
  1                cup  diced onion
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  cremini mushrooms -- temmed, cut in
                        half lengthwise, and sliced
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1                cup  Arborio rice
     1/2           cup  white wine -- (optional)
     1/4      teaspoon  saffron threads
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  fresh or frozen peas
     1/3           cup  nutritional yeast flakes
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped dill
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated lemon zest

In a medium saucepan, place the vegetable stock, and bring to a boil.  Slice the asparagus spears diagonally into 1-inch pieces and place them in a fine mesh strainer.  Place the strainer in the boiling vegetable stock and cook the asparagus in the stock for 2 minutes to blanch them.  Remove the strainer from the stock and set the asparagus aside.  Reduce the heat of the stock to low.

In a large saucepan, saute the onion in the olive oil for 3 minutes to soften.  Add the mushrooms and garlic and saute the mixture an additional 3 minutes.  Add the Arborio rice, stir well to coat it with the sauteed vegetable mixture, and cook an additional 2 minutes while stirring constantly or until rice turns opaque.

Add the white wine (or use some of the stock if omitting) and saffron threads, season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir well to combine.  Reduce the heat to low and cook the mixture while stirring occasionally until all of the liquid has been absorbed.

Add 1/2 cup of the simmering vegetable stock and continue to cook, while stirring occasionally, until all of the stock has been absorbed.  Repeat the procedure of adding a 1/2 cup of simmering stock, stirring, and cooking until fully absorbed before adding additional stock, until all but a 1/2 cup of stock remains.

Add the blanched asparagus, along with the remaining ingredients, and stir well to combine.  Cook the mixture an additional 2 to 3 minutes while stirring constantly, adding the remaining stock, as needed, so that the rice is tender and the risotto has a creamy consistency.  Taste and adjust the seasonings, as desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  finely-diced onion
  1         tablespoon  safflower oil -- plus
                        additional for oiling loaf pan
     1/2           cup  finely-diced carrot
     1/2           cup  finely-diced celery
     1/2           cup  finely-diced seeded red pepper
     1/2           cup  finely-diced zucchini
  4          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2           cup  millet -- rinsed, drained
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2 2/3           cups  water -- divided
     1/3           cup  basmati rice -- rinsed, drained
     1/3           cup  quinoa -- rinsed, drained
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley

In a medium saucepan, saute the onion in the safflower oil for 3 minutes to soften.  Add the carrot and celery and saute an additional 3 minutes.  Add the red pepper and zucchini and saute an additional 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and dried herbs and saute an additional 1 minute.

Add the millet, salt, and pepper, stir well to thoroughly combine it with the vegetable mixture, and then add 1 1/3 cups of the water, and bring the mixture to a boil.  Cover the saucepan, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, in another medium saucepan, place the remaining 1 1/3 cups water, and bring it to a boil.  Add the basmati rice and quinoa, stir, cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer the mixture for 15 minutes.  At the end of the cooking time, remove both saucepans from the heat, leave the saucepans covered, and set them aside for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the grains to steam.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or mist with oil) a 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan, and set aside.

Add the cooked basmati rice-quinoa mixture to the millet-vegetable mixture, along with the chopped parsley, and stir well to combine.  Taste and adjust the seasonings, to taste.  Transfer the mixture to the prepared loaf pan and pack it down firmly into the loaf pan.

Bake the loaf at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned on top.  Remove the loaf pan from the oven and allow it to cool on a rack for 10 minutes.  Invert the loaf onto a plate or serving platter, remove the loaf pan, and allow the loaf to cool a few minutes before slicing with a sharp knife.

Serve slices plain or topped with your choice of gravy or tomato sauce.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  raw almonds
  1         tablespoon  nutritional yeast flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  powdered kelp
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  safflower oil
     1/4           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  apple cider vinegar
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice or lime juice
  1                can  diced green chiles - (4 oz)
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped cilantro

Begin by blanching the almonds:  In a small saucepan, place 2 inches of water, and bring to a boil.  Add the almonds and cook for 1 minute.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside for 3 minutes to cool.

Remove the almonds from the water, squeeze each almond between your thumb and forefinger to remove the skin, and set them aside for 5 minutes to dry and cool.

Place the almonds in a blender or food processor and process for 1 to 2 minutes to finely grind them.  Add the nutritional yeast, garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, kelp, and salt, and process for 30 seconds to combine.

In a small measuring cup, combine the oil and water, and add the mixture to the blender in a slow stream while the machine is running.  Scrape down the sides of the container, add the vinegar and lemon juice, and continue to process the mixture an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until thickened.

Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and stir in the green chiles and cilantro.  Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or more, to allow the flavors to blend.

Use as a replacement for sour cream in recipes, also as a condiment or spread on sandwiches, a dip for raw veggies or chips, or as a sauce for steamed vegetables and grains.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 cups.

  2               cups  diced onion
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  diced celery
  1 1/2           cups  diced seeded yellow or orange pepper
  1 1/2           cups  diced seeded red pepper
  2                     jalapeno peppers -- seeded, diced

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  tempeh - (8 oz ea) -- cut into cubes
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  ground fennel
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour
     1/2           cup  Bragg Liquid Aminos or tamari
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Safflower oil -- for frying

Place the cubes of tempeh in a steamer basket, steam for 15 minutes, and set aside to cool.

Using your fingers, crumble the steamed tempeh into a bowl.  Add the basil, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, fennel, thyme, pepper flakes, and pepper to the tempeh and toss well to coat.  Add the remaining ingredients and stir well to combine.

Lightly oil or line a cookie sheet or tray with waxed paper, and set aside.  Using a 1/4-cup measuring cup to portion the sausages, lightly fill it with the tempeh mixture and gently pack it into the cup with the back of a spoon.  Flip the measuring cup over on to the tray and give it a tap to release the patty.  Form the mixture into 10 patties and chill for 1 hour.

Lightly grease a non-stick skillet with a little safflower oil.  In batches, cook the tempeh sausages until well browned on each side, about 5 to 7 minutes per side.  Add more oil to the pan, if needed, to prevent the sausages from sticking.

This recipe yields 10 sausage patties.

Comments:  You can make these sausages in larger batches and freeze them for later use.  Then simply reheat them in the oven or in a nonstick skillet until heated through.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  multi-grain tempeh - (8 oz)
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- divided
  2        tablespoons  Creole Seasoning -- (see recipe),
                        divided
  2        tablespoons  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce)
  1 1/2           cups  diced onion
  1                cup  diced celery
  1                cup  diced seeded green pepper
  1                cup  diced seeded red pepper
  1                     jalapeÒo -- seeded, diced
  1 1/2           cups  basmati rice -- rinsed
                        = (or other white rice)
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2               cups  vegetable stock
                        = (or water)
  2               cups  diced seeded tomato
                        = (or a 14-oz can diced tomatoes)
  1                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                can  red beans - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley

Using your fingers, crumble the tofu into small pieces onto a plate.

In a large pot, saute the tempeh in 2 tablespoon olive oil for 5 minutes.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon Creole Seasoning over the tempeh and saute an additional 1 minute.  Add the tamari, stir well to coat the tempeh, and continue to cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until the liquid has evaporated.  Transfer the tempeh to a plate and set aside.

In the same pot, saute the onion, celery, green pepper, red pepper, and jalapeÒo in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil for 5 minutes to soften.  Add the rice and garlic, stir well to combine, and continue to cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until the rice turns opaque.

Add the vegetable stock, tomatoes, remaining Creole Seasoning, bay leaf, and salt, and bring the mixture to a boil.  Cover, reduce the heat to low, simmer for 20 to 25 minutes or until the rice is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed.

Remove the lid, add the reserved tempeh and remaining ingredients, stir well to combine, and recover the pot.  Remove the pot from the heat and let sit for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.

Can be served as a side dish, main dish, or as a filling for wraps or sandwiches.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === TEMPEH AND BROCCOLI RABE ===
  8             ounces  tempeh -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/2           cup  shallots -- diced
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              pound  broccoli rabe -- washed well,
                        and roughly-cut into bite-sized pieces
  1                cup  diced seeded red pepper
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  4          teaspoons  nutritional yeast flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the marinade ingredients.  Add the tempeh cubes and toss gently to thoroughly coat with the marinade.  Cover, place the bowl in the refrigerator, and allow the tempeh to marinate for 1 hour or more.

After 1 hour, transfer the tempeh cubes to a non-stick skillet, and cook, while stirring often, for 8 to 10 minutes or until the tempeh is well browned and crisp around the edges.  Remove the skillet from the heat, transfer the tempeh to a plate, and set aside.

Wipe out the skillet, return it to medium heat, and saute the shallots in the olive for 2 minutes to soften slightly.  Add the broccoli rabe and continue to saute the mixture for an additional 5 minutes.  Add the red pepper and garlic and saute an additional 3 minutes.

Add the reserved tempeh, nutritional yeast flakes, and season the mixture to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Stir well and continue to cook the mixture an additional 1 to 2 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.

Serve as a main dish, side dish, or toss with cooked grains or pasta for a heartier dish.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  diced onion
     1/2           cup  diced seeded red pepper
     1/2           cup  diced seeded orange or yellow pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  eggplant -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  1                cup  baby bella mushrooms -- roughly chopped
                        = (or other mushrooms of choice)
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped basil
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped rosemary
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  whole-wheat flour
  2        tablespoons  nutritional yeast flakes
     3/4           cup  breadcrumbs
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika

In a large non-stick skillet, saute the onion and both types of peppers in the olive oil for 5 minutes to soften.  Add the eggplant and saute an additional 5 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and garlic and saute an additional 3 minutes.

Add the dry sherry and balsamic vinegar, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 3 minutes.  Add the fresh herbs, salt, and pepper, and continue to simmer the vegetable mixture until the vegetables are tender.  Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside to cool.

When the mixture is cool, transfer the mixture to a large bowl, add the flour and nutritional yeast, and stir well to combine.

Lightly oil a non-stick cookie sheet and set aside.  Place the breadcrumbs on a plate, toss them with the paprika, and set aside.

Divide the vegetable mixture into 12 portions.  Using your hands, roll each portion into a ball, and flatten them slightly to form cakes.  Press the cakes into the breadcrumbs, covering them evenly on all sides.  Place the cakes on the prepared cookie sheet.  Repeat the procedure for the remaining vegetable mixture.  Cover and chill the cakes for 2 hours or overnight.

Bake at 375 degrees for 5 to 7 minutes or until golden brown, flip the cakes over, and bake them an additional 5 to 7 minutes or until golden brown on the other side.  Serve two cakes per person.

This recipe yields 12 cakes or 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  potato
  1                cup  warm water
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
                        additional for oiling bowl and pan
  2               cups  unbleached flour
  1                cup  whole-wheat flour
     1/2           cup  soy flour
  2          teaspoons  sea salt
  1           teaspoon  sesame seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  poppy seeds

Begin by baking the potato.  Wash it well and prick with a fork in several places.  Place the potato in the oven and bake at 350 degrees for 40 to 50 minutes or until soft to the touch.  Remove the potato from the oven and set aside to cool.

When the potato is cool, cut in half, and using a spoon, carefully separate the cooked potato from its skin.  Place the cooked potato in a small bowl, mash it well with a fork (should yield 1 cup), and set aside.

In a large bowl, place the warm water, yeast, and olive oil.  Stir well to dissolve the yeast, and set aside until bubbly, about 10 to 15 minutes.

Add the reserved mashed potato and stir well to combine.  Add the unbleached, whole wheat, and soy flours, and salt, and stir well to form a soft dough.  Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead, adding additional flour if needed, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.

Place a little olive oil in the large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, give it a twist, and turn the ball over to coat the other side.  Cover the bowl with a clean towel, place it in a warm place, and leave to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

Using a little olive oil, lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) a large cookie sheet or pizza pan, and set aside.

When the dough has doubled, transfer it to the oiled pan, and stretch it to form a 10-inch circle.  Sprinkle the sesame seeds and poppy seeds over the top.  Cover the pan with a clean towel, place in a warm place, and leave to rise for an additional 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

Remove the towel from the pan.  Bake the loaf at 425 degrees for 15 to 18 minutes or until lightly golden brown.  Transfer the loaf to a rack to cool.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields one 10-inch loaf.

     3/4           cup  fresh or frozen peas
     1/2           cup  sun-dried tomatoes in small pieces
  3        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  unbleached flour
  1         tablespoon  onion powder
  2 1/2           cups  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk
                        of choice)
     1/3           cup  nutritional yeast flakes
     3/4      teaspoon  sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes -- or more to taste
  4               cups  spinach -- triple washed,

In a large pot of boiling water, cook the fettucine for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente.  Drain well, return the cooked fettucine to the pot, and set aside.

Meanwhile, in a large non-stick skillet, saute the shallots in the olive oil for 2 minutes to soften.  Cut the spears of asparagus diagonally into 1-inch pieces, separating the stems and tips, and set the tips aside for later use.

Add the sliced asparagus stems, carrot, and red pepper to the shallots, and saute for 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and garlic and saute an additional 2 minutes.  Add the zucchini, peas, and sun-dried tomatoes, and continue to saute the mixture until the vegetables are tender.

Add the Dijon mustard, flour, and onion powder to the pan, stir well to combine, and cook the mixture for 1 minute while stirring constantly.  Add the soy milk, nutritional yeast flakes, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes, stir well to combine, and cook the mixture an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until thickened.

Add the remaining ingredients, cover, remove the pan from the heat, and set aside for 2 to 3 minutes to allow the spinach to wilt.  Add the vegetable mixture to the cooked fettucine and toss well to combine.  Taste and adjust the seasonings, as desired.  Transfer the pasta to a large bowl or platter for service.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

     3/4           cup  diced carrot
     3/4           cup  diced celery

  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano
  8             ounces  crushed tomatoes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  water
  2               cups  basmati rice -- rinsed well
  2               cups  red onion -- cut half moons
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2         tablespoon  unbleached flour
  2               cups  vegetable stock
  2         tablespoon  curry powder
  1                     delicata or acorn squash -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
  2               cups  broccoli in small florets
  2               cups  cauliflower in small florets
  2               cups  sliced carrot
  1                cup  diced seeded red pepper
  1                cup  diced seeded orange or yellow pepper
  1                can  coconut milk - (14 oz)
     1/2           cup  frozen peas -- thawed
  3         tablespoon  freshly-chopped mint
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a large saucepan, place the water, and bring it to a boil.  Add the basmati rice, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 15 minutes.  Remove the saucepan from the heat, do not lift the lid, and set aside for 5 minutes to allow the rice to steam.

Meanwhile, in a large pot, saute the red onion in olive oil for 5 minutes or until soft.  Add the flour, stir well to coat the onions, and cook an additional minute while stirring constantly to slightly cook the flour.  Add the vegetable stock and curry powder, stir well, and cook over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until slightly thickened.

Add the squash, broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, red pepper, and orange pepper, and stir well to thoroughly coat the vegetables with the broth mixture.  Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.

Add the remaining ingredients, stir well, and simmer an additional 3 to 5 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.  Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.

Fluff the basmati rice, transfer the rice to a large platter, and top with the vegetable curry.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  finely-diced seeded green pepper
     1/4           cup  finely-diced seeded red pepper
     1/4           cup  finely-diced carrot
     1/4           cup  finely-diced celery
  2        tablespoons  minced green onion
  1             medium  zucchini - (to 2) -- very thinly sliced
                        on the diagonal - (need 24 slices)

Assemble the pieces of lasagne on a large platter.  To assemble each piece of raw lasagne: place one slice of the marinated zucchini, carefully spread 1 tablespoon of the Artichoke Pate over the slice of zucchini, then 1 tablespoon of the chopped marinated vegetables, followed by 1 teaspoon of the Tomato and Herb Paste, repeat the layers, and place a slice of zucchini on top.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10             whole  dried New Mexico, ancho or
                        pasilla chiles - (or a mixture)
  3               cups  water
                        = (or vegetable stock)
     1/2           cup  onion -- diced
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  garlic -- minced
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
                        = (preferably Mexican oregano)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

On a non-stick cookie sheet, place the dried chiles and bake them at 400 degrees for 3 to 4 minutes or until just fragrant.  Remove them from the oven and set aside to cool.  When the chiles are cool to the touch, remove and discard their stems, seeds, and inner membranes.

Meanwhile, in a medium sauce pan, place the water and bring it to a boil.  Add the dried chiles, remove the saucepan from the heat, and set aside for 1 hour to allow the chiles to rehydrate and soften.

In a small non-stick skillet, saute the onion in the olive oil for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.  Add the garlic, oregano, and cumin, and saute an additional 2 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.

After the chiles have soaked for 1 hour, transfer the chiles and a little of the soaking liquid to a food processor, and puree until smooth.  Add the sauteed onion mixture, remaining soaking liquid and the other remaining ingredients, and process until smooth.  Return the sauce to the medium saucepan and simmer for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.

Transfer the sauce to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to one week, or the sauce can be frozen for later use.

Use as a sauce for enchiladas or other Mexican or Southwestern style dishes, to add flavor to steamed vegetables and grains, or as a condiment.

This recipe yields 3 1/2 cups.

     1/2           cup  shredded vegan soy mozzarella cheese

Begin by preparing the asparagus:  Fill a medium saucepan half full with water, place it over high heat, and bring to a boil.  Slice the asparagus spears diagonally into 1-inch pieces and place them in a fine mesh strainer.  Place the strainer in the boiling water and cook the asparagus in the water for 2 minutes to blanch them.  Remove the strainer from the water and set the asparagus aside.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil a 10-inch quiche pan or spring-form pan and set aside.

In a food processor, place the tofu, soy milk, arrowroot, nutritional yeast flakes, garlic, agar-agar, Dijon mustard, salt, turmeric, and white pepper, and process for 2 minutes or until it forms a smooth puree.

Pour half of the tofu mixture into the prepared quiche pan, evenly distribute the blanched asparagus and the remaining ingredients in the pan, and then top with the remaining tofu mixture.  Using a spoon, slightly swirl the two mixtures together, and then smooth the top.

Bake at 375 degrees for 35 to 45 minutes or until the filling is firm to the touch and dry on the top.  Remove the frittata from the oven and allow to cool for 15 minutes before cutting.  Serve warm, cold, or at room temperature.

This recipe yields one 10-inch frittata.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  tomatillos -- husks removed
  2                     poblano chiles
                        = (or 2 jalapeÒo peppers)
  1             medium  onion -- unpeeled
  3                     garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  cilantro leaves - (packed)
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Unbleached cane sugar -- (optional)

On a non-stick cookie sheet, place the tomatillos, poblano chiles, and onion, and place them under the broiler.  Broil the vegetables for 3 to 5 minutes per side, turning them as their skins begin to char.  The entire process should take around 15 minutes.

After 12 minutes of broiling time, add the cloves of garlic.  Remove the cookie sheet from the oven and set aside to cool.

When the tomatillos and poblano chiles are cool to the touch, remove their skins, stems, and seeds, and discard.  Remove and discard the onion skin, as well.

Transfer the tomatillos, poblano chiles, onion, and garlic to a food processor or blender, and pulse a few times to roughly chop the vegetables.  Add the cilantro, lime juice, and cumin, and continue to pulse to form a chunky puree.  Add salt to taste and a little unbleached cane sugar, if desired.  Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Serves as a sauce for Mexican and Southwestern style dishes, as a sauce for steamed vegetables and grains, or as a dip with raw veggies or tortilla chips.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  water
  12            ounces  mushrooms -- washed well,
                        stems trimmed, and thinly sliced
  1                can  sauerkraut - (14 oz)
  2               cans  sauerkraut juice - (8 oz ea)
     1/3           cup  barley
     1/2           cup  finely-minced onion
  2        tablespoons  safflower oil
  2        tablespoons  unbleached flour
  1 1/2           cups  Vegan Dumplings -- (see recipe),
                        precooked
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Unbleached cane sugar -- to taste

In a large pot, combine the water, mushrooms, sauerkraut, sauerkraut juice, and barley, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small non-stick skillet, saute the onion in the safflower oil for 2 to 3 minutes or until softened.  Add the flour and stir well to combine.  Cook the onion-flour mixture an additional 2 to 3 minutes, while stirring constantly, until the color of the mixture darkens a bit.

Add a little of the simmering soup to the skillet, stir well to incorporate it with the onion-flour mixture, and then stir the entire contents of the skillet into the simmering soup.  Cook the soup an additional 30 minutes or until the barley is tender.

Add the Vegan Dumplings and season to taste with a little salt, pepper, and sugar.  Simmer the soup an additional 5 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.  Taste and adjust seasonings, if needed.

Garnish individual servings with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast flakes, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  The flavor of this soup is almost better the next day.

  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  4               cups  water
                        = (or vegetable stock)
  1              pound  cut fresh or frozen corn
     1/3           cup  Red Chile Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin

     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
     1/3           cup  freshly-chopped cilantro

In a food processor or blender, place 3/4 cups of the cut corn, add 1 cup of the cooking liquid from the pot, and process to form a chunky puree.  Add the pureed mixture, the remaining corn, Red Chile Sauce, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper to the pot, and simmer the soup an additional 5 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.  Add the remaining ingredients and stir well to combine.

Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.  Top individual servings with dollops of Green Chiles and Almond Cream and a few crumbled tortilla chips, as desired.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 quarts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  dried hijiki
                        Water -- as needed
     1/4           cup  tamari -- divided
                        = (or soy sauce)
  1         tablespoon  Sucanat
  8             ounces  soba noodles
  3        tablespoons  sesame seeds
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
                        = (or safflower oil)
  2               cups  diagonally thinly-sliced green onions -- green and
                        white parts divided
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2               cups  carrots -- julienned
  8             ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- washed, sliced
  3               cups  thinly-shredded Napa cabbage
  3               cups  thinly-shredded red cabbage
  2        tablespoons  seasoned rice wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped cilantro
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  chili oil

Place the hijiki in a saucepan, cover with water, and leave to soak for 30 minutes.  Drain the hijiki and return it to the saucepan along with 2 tablespoons tamari, Sucanat, and enough water to cover.  Place the saucepan over low heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until soft.  Drain the hijiki, reserving the liquid, and set both of them aside.

Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling water, cook the soba noodles until al dente, about 5 to 7 minutes.  If the water in the pot foams up during the cooking process, adding a little cold water to the pot will help to control the problem.  Drain the soba noodles, rinse them well with cold water, drain again, and set aside.

In a dry wok or large non-stick skillet, place the sesame seeds and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until toasted and fragrant.  Remove the toasted sesame seeds from the wok and set aside.

In the same wok, heat the peanut oil; when it is very hot, add the white part only of the sliced green onions, ginger, and garlic, and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add the carrots and shiitake mushrooms and stir-fry an additional 2 minutes.  Add both types of cabbage and stir fry for 1 minute.  Then add the remaining 2 tablespoons tamari and seasoned rice wine vinegar, place a cover over the wok, and leave it to cook for 2 minutes.

Add 3/4 of the hijiki (reserving some for garnish), reserved hijiki cooking liquid, and cooked soba noodles, and toss well to combine with vegetables.  Cook an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until heated through.  Add the toasted sesame seeds, cilantro, toasted sesame oil, and chili oil, and toss well to combine.

Transfer to a large platter or bowl for service, and garnish with the remaining hijiki and sliced green onions.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SOYBEAN PATTIES ===
  1                cup  dry soybeans -- sorted, rinsed
  1 1/4           cups  pecans
  1                cup  vegetable stock
                        = (or water)
  2        tablespoons  Ener-G Egg Replacer
  2        tablespoons  water
  2               cups  quick-cooking oats
  1                cup  finely-diced onion
     1/2           cup  finely-diced celery
     1/3           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  nutritional yeast flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Safflower oil -- for cooking patties
                        === BROWN BEAN GRAVY ===
  1                can  soybeans - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed
     3/4           cup  vegetable stock
     1/2           cup  finely-diced onion
     1/4           cup  nutritional yeast flakes
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  rubbed sage

Place the dry soybeans in a bowl, cover with water, and place in the refrigerator to soak overnight.

Place the pecans on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 5 minutes or until lightly toasted and fragrant.  Remove the pecans from the oven and set aside to cool.

Transfer the cooled pecans to a food processor and pulse a few times to finely chop them.  Transfer the finely chopped pecans to a small bowl and set aside.  Wipe out the food processor for use again.

Drain the soaked soybeans, place them in the food processor with the vegetable stock, and blend for 1 to 2 minutes or until smooth.

In a large bowl, whisk together the egg replacer and water, for 1 minute or until very frothy.  Add the soybean puree, chopped pecans, and the remaining soybean patties ingredients, and stir well to combine.  Set the soybean patties mixture aside for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to blend and the oats to rehydrate.

Lightly oil (or spray) a large baking dish with a little safflower oil and set aside.  Lightly oil (or spray) a non-stick skillet with a little safflower oil and place over medium heat.  Using a 1/3-cup measuring cup, portion the soybean mixture into patties and slightly flatten them.  Cook the patties for 3 to 5 minutes per side or until lightly browned.  Transfer the cooked patties to the prepared baking dish and set aside.

To make the gravy, in a blender or food processor, place all of the gravy ingredients, and blend until smooth and creamy.  Transfer the bean gravy mixture to a small saucepan.  Place the saucepan over low heat and simmer the gravy, while stirring often, until heated through.  Taste and adjust seasonings, as needed.

Spoon a little of the gravy over the soybean patties and then bake the patties at 350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until heated through.  Serve the soybean patties topped with additional gravy.  Serve as a side dish, main dish, or as a sandwich filling.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                Spicy Fried Tofu With Peppers And Cashews

Categories    : Main Dish                       Vegan
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm tofu
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  ground coriander
  2          teaspoons  Sucanat
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1                cup  cashews
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  2               cups  julienned red pepper
  1                cup  julienned orange or yellow pepper
  1                cup  julienned green pepper
  1                cup  thinly-sliced green onion
  2                     jalapeÒos -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and diced

Cut the block of tofu in half lengthwise.  Turn each half cut-side down on the board, and cut through the outer edge of the block of tofu 3 times to yield 4 tofu cutlets from each half.  This means that the block of tofu will yield 8 tofu cutlets.

On a large cookie sheet, place a clean, lint-free towel, or a layer of natural, unbleached paper towels, then all of the tofu cutlets in a single layer, followed by another layer of toweling, and finally place another large cookie sheet on top.  Place several large cans or something very heavy on top of the cookie sheet and leave tofu to sit for 1 hour.  This process is known as cutting tofu into cutlets and pressing.  I use this technique a lot as it makes the texture of the tofu much firmer.

In a small bowl, place the cumin, coriander, Sucanat, salt, garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper; stir well to combine and then set aside.

Cut the pressed tofu into 1/2-inch cubes and transfer them to a bowl.  Sprinkle the tofu with the reserved spice blend, toss well to evenly coat the tofu cubes, and set aside.

In a dry wok or large non-stick skillet, place the cashews and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until lightly toasted and fragrant.  Remove the cashews from the wok and set them aside to cool.

In the same wok, heat the peanut oil, add the cubes of tofu, and stir-fry for 5 to 7 minute or until crispy and lightly browned on all sides.  Remove the tofu cubes from the wok with a slotted spoon and set them aside.

In the same wok, stir-fry the red, orange, and green peppers for 2 minutes.  Add the green onion and jalapeÒos and stir-fry an additional 2 minutes.  Roughly chop the toasted cashews, add them and the cooked tofu to the wok, and stir fry an additional 1 minute.  Transfer to a large platter or bowl for service.

  1                cup  whole-wheat flour
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
  3        tablespoons  nutritional yeast flakes

Place the red peppers, skin-side up, on a cookie sheet.  Using your fingers, coat the skins with a little of the olive oil.  Place the peppers under the broiler and broil for several minutes or until the skin has charred and blackened.

Remove the cookie sheet from the oven, place the peppers in a brown bag, and allow them to cool in the bag for 15 minutes.  Remove the peppers from the bag, remove and discard the blackened skins, place the peppers on a plate, and set aside.

Meanwhile, place the cubes of tempeh in a steam basket, and steam the tempeh for 20 minutes.  Remove the tempeh from the steamer basket and allow it to cool for 15 minutes.  Using your fingers, crumble the tempeh into small pieces, place it in a small bowl, and set aside.

In a non-stick skillet, saute the onion in olive oil, for 5 to 7 minutes or until lightly browned.  Add the garlic and saute an additional 2 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat, transfer the onion mixture to a plate, and set aside.

In the same skillet, place the roughly chopped spinach, cook over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes or until just wilted, transfer to a plate, and set aside.

In a saucepan, combine the water, tamari, ketchup, and peanut butter, and bring to a boil.  In a large bowl, place the TVP, oats, basil, oregano, thyme, and pepper, and stir well to combine.  Pour the hot tamari mixture over the TVP mixture, stir well to combine, and set aside for 10 minutes to rehydrate.

Add the crumbled tempeh, sauteed onion mixture, flour, parsley, and nutritional yeast flakes, stir well to combine, and set aside for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) two 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pans.  To assemble each meatless loaf: place 3 cups of the tempeh-TVP mixture in the prepared loaf pan.  Press it firmly to cover the bottom and sides of the pan, cover with 1/4 of the roasted red peppers, evenly layer half of the wilted spinach, cover with another 1/4 of the roasted peppers, top with another 2 cups of the tempeh-TVP mixture, and press down slightly to pack the layers down.

Repeat the procedure for the remaining loaf pan.  Bake at 375 degrees for 35 to 45 minutes or until heated through and browned on top.  Allow the loaves to sit in the pans for 10 minutes, then invert them on to a large plate or platter, and slice each loaf into 8 pieces with a sharp knife.

This recipe yields 16 slices.

Comments:  Leftover slices make an excellent sandwich filling.

  1                     dried New Mexico chile
                        Water -- as needed
  1 1/2           cups  diced onion
  1         tablespoon  safflower oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                can  tomato puree - (28 oz)
     1/2           cup  Sucanat
                        = (or brown sugar from sugar beets)
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  brown mustard
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Begin by removing the stem and seeds from the dried New Mexico chile.  Place the chile in a small bowl, cover with cold water, and set aside for 10 to 15 minutes to rehydrate.

In a medium saucepan, saute the onion in the safflower oil for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.  Add the garlic and saute an additional 1 minute.

When the chile has rehydrated, transfer it to a cutting board and finely mince it.  Add the minced chile, along with the remaining ingredients to the saucepan and stir well to combine.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer the sauce for 20 minutes.  Taste and adjust the seasonings, to taste.

Use as a sauce for sandwiches and main dishes, or to add flavor to sauces, grains, vegetables, or side dishes.

This recipe yields 4 cups.

                           Tempeh Maple Sausage

Categories    : Main Dish                       Vegan
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  tempeh - (8 oz ea) -- cut into cubes
  2          teaspoons  Herbes de Provence
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  whole-wheat flour
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped peeled cored apple
     1/4           cup  maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  apple juice
  2        tablespoons  safflower oil -- plus
                        additional for oiling pan
  2        tablespoons  tamari

Begin by placing the cubes of tempeh in a steamer basket, steam for 15 minutes, and then set aside to cool.  Using your fingers, crumble the steamed tempeh into a medium bowl.  Add the Herbes de Provence, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper, and toss well to thoroughly coat the tempeh with the seasonings.  Add the remaining ingredients and stir well to combine.

Line a cookie sheet with a piece of parchment paper and set aside.  Using a 1/4-cup measuring cup, portion the sausage patties by lightly filling the measuring cup with the tempeh mixture and gently pack into the cup with the back of a spoon.  Flip the measuring cup over on to the prepared cookie sheet and give it a tap to release the patty.  Repeat the portioning procedure for the remaining tempeh mixture, yielding 10 patties.  Place the cookie sheet in the refrigerator and chill the patties for 1 hour or more.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil a non-stick skillet and place it over medium heat.  In batches, cook the tempeh sausage patties until well browned, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Carefully flip them over with a spatula and cook the patties an additional 5 minutes or until golden brown and crisp around the edges.  Add additional safflower oil to the skillet, as needed, to prevent the patties from sticking between batches.

Serve as a side dish, a sandwich filling, or crumble the cooked sausage patties on pizza, or use to add to sauces or main dishes.

This recipe yields 10 sausage patties.

Comments:  These tempeh sausage patties can be prepared in larger batches, precooked, and frozen in an airtight container for later use.  Then simply reheat in the oven or in a nonstick skillet until heated through.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  water
  2               cups  basmati rice
  1 1/2           cups  half-moon sliced onion
  1 1/2           cups  carrot in 2"-long matchsticks
  1 1/2           cups  celery in 2"-long matchsticks
  1 1/2           cups  red pepper in 2"-long matchsticks
  2        tablespoons  safflower oil -- divided
  2               cups  broccoli in small florets
  2           packages  multigrain tempeh - (8 oz ea) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
                        Peanutty Miso Salad Dressing -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  peanuts -- roughly chopped

In a large saucepan, place the water, and bring to a boil.  Add the basmati rice, cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 15 minutes or until all of the water is absorbed.  Remove the saucepan from the heat, leave covered, and set aside for 5 minutes to allow the rice to steam.

Meanwhile, in a large non-stick skillet or wok, stir-fry the onion, carrot, celery, and red pepper in 1 tablespoon safflower oil, for 2 minutes over medium-high heat.  Add the broccoli and stir-fry an additional 2 minutes.  Transfer the vegetables from the skillet to a large bowl and set aside.

In the same non-stick skillet, stir-fry the tempeh in the remaining safflower oil for 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry an additional 2 minutes.  Add the soy sauce, curry powder, and chili powder, and stir-fry an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until fragrant.  Add the reserved vegetables and Peanutty Miso Salad Dressing and simmer for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are crisp-tender.

Fluff the basmati rice with a fork.  Serve the stir-fry mixture over the basmati rice and sprinkle with some of the chopped peanuts.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  shredded cabbage
  2               cups  spicy sprouts
                        = (broccoli sprouts or other sprouts of
                        choice)
  2               cups  sprouted lentils
                        = (or other sprouted beans of choice)
  1 1/2           cups  shredded carrot
  1                cup  shredded red cabbage
  1                cup  diced cucumber
  1                cup  diced celery
     3/4           cup  diced red pepper
     3/4           cup  peanuts -- chopped
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
     1/3           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
                        Spicy Thai Peanut Dressing -- (see recipe)
  12             large  loose leaf lettuce leaves - (to 16) -- washed well,
                        and patted dry

In a large bowl, place all of the vegetables, and toss well to combine.  Drizzle to taste with some of the Spicy Thai Peanut Dressing and toss gently to thoroughly coat the vegetables with the dressing.

To assemble the lettuce rolls:  Place a lettuce leaf flat on a cutting board or large plate, depending on the size of the leaf, place 1/3 to 1/2 cup of the vegetable mixture in the center of the leaf near the stem end.  Fold the stem end over the filling and roll slightly, folding both sides of the lettuce leaf toward the center, and continue to roll to enclose the filling completely.

Secure the rolls with a toothpick, if desired, and place the rolls seam-side down on a large platter for service.  Serve one or two rolls per person.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

     3/4           cup  sliced lengthwise-halved zucchini
     3/4           cup  sliced lengthwise-halved yellow
                        summer squash
     3/4           cup  diced seeded red or orange pepper
     3/4           cup  diced seeded green pepper
  2        tablespoons  safflower oil -- divided
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
                        = (or cilantro)
                        Salt -- to taste

  1                cup  TVP granules
                        = (textured vegetable protein)
  1                cup  hot water
  1                cup  diced onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                can  pinto beans - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed
                        = (or other red beans of choice)
  1         tablespoon  tamari
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
                        = (preferably Mexican oregano)
     1/2           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  8                     corn tortillas - (6" dia)
  1             recipe  Red Chile Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1             recipe  Roasted Tomatillo Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  shredded vegan soy cheese -- cheddar flavor

In a non-stick skillet, saute the zucchini, summer squash, and both peppers in 1 tablespoon of the safflower oil for 3 to 5 minutes or until crisp tender.  Add the parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer the vegetables to a plate and set aside.

Place the TVP in a small bowl, pour the hot water over it, and set aside for 10 minutes to allow the TVP to rehydrate.  In the same skillet used to saute the vegetables, saute the onion in the remaining 1 tablespoon of safflower oil for 5 minutes to soften.  Add the rehydrated TVP and garlic and saute an additional 2 minutes.

Add the pinto beans, tamari, chili powder, paprika, and oregano, and continue to saute the mixture an additional 2 minutes.  Add the water and tomato paste, stir well to combine, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes or until most of the liquid has been absorbed.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and remove from the heat.

Place some of the Red Chile Sauce in a shallow bowl.  To assemble the tortilla tortas: begin by dipping one corn tortilla into the bowl of Red Chile Sauce, place the tortilla on a non-stick cookie sheet, spread one quarter of the TVP mixture on top of the tortilla, drizzle with a few tablespoons of the Roasted Tomatillo Sauce, and a few tablespoons of the remaining Red Chile Sauce.

Dip another corn tortilla into the bowl of Red Chile Sauce, place it on top of the first layer, place one half of the reserved sauteed vegetables mixture on top of the tortilla, drizzle with a few tablespoons of the Roasted Tomatillo Sauce, a few tablespoons of the remaining Red Chile Sauce, and sprinkle with one quarter of the shredded cheese.

Dip another corn tortilla into the bowl of Red Chile Sauce, place it on top of the second layer, spread another one quarter of the TVP mixture on top of the tortilla, drizzle with a few tablespoons of the Roasted Tomatillo Sauce, and a few tablespoons of the remaining Red Chile Sauce.

Dip another corn tortilla into the bowl of Red Chile Sauce, place it on top of the third layer, and sprinkle with another one quarter of the shredded cheese over the top.  Repeat the assembling-layering procedure with the remaining ingredients to assemble a second torta.

Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until heated through and the soy cheese is melted.  Cut each torta into 4 pieces and serve 2 wedges per person.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Can substitute crumbled tofu or tempeh for the TVP in the TVP filling, and other vegetables in the vegetable filling, if desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pumpkin - (abt 5 lbs)
  1 1/2           cups  sliced onion in half moons
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  thinly-sliced lenghtwise-halved
                        summer squash
  1                cup  thinly-sliced lenghtwise-halved zucchini
  1              bunch  Swiss chard -- leaves and
                        stems roughly chopped
  1                cup  baby bella mushrooms -- washed, halved,
                        and thinly sliced
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
  3               cups  vegetable stock
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  Wheatear-shaped pasta
                        = (or other vegetable or
                        grain-shaped pasta)
  1                can  baby butter beans - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped basil
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped Italian parsley
  2        tablespoons  nutritional yeast flakes

Using a sharp knife, cut the top off the pumpkin and set it aside.

Cut along the inside of the pumpkin to loosen the flesh from the outer shell of the pumpkin.  Use a combination of a sturdy spoon and the knife to remove the seeds and as much of the flesh as possible, keeping the outer shell of the pumpkin intact.

Separate the flesh from the seeds, cut the pumpkin flesh into 1-inch cubes, and set them aside.  The pumpkin seeds can be washed and toasted for a tasty snack or discarded.

Replace the lid on the pumpkin shell, place it on a cookie sheet, and bake it at 350 degrees for 45 to 55 minutes or until it is tender on the inside.

In a large saucepan, saute the reserved pumpkin cubes, onion, garlic, and ginger in the olive oil for 7 to 10 minutes or until softened.  Add the summer squash and zucchini, and saute an additional 2 minutes.  Add the Swiss chard and mushrooms, and saute an additional 2 minutes.

Add the crushed tomatoes, vegetable stock, salt, and pepper, and bring mixture to a boil.  Add the pasta, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes or until pasta is al dente.  Add the remaining ingredients and cook an additional 2 minutes to heat through.

When the baked pumpkin shell is tender, remove it from the oven, transfer it carefully to a large platter, and remove the lid.  Fill the pumpkin shell with the pasta-vegetable mixture, replace the lid slightly ajar on top of the shell, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  diced onion
                        = (or shallots)
  2        tablespoons  safflower oil -- plus
                        additional for oiling pan
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  4               cups  vegetable stock
                        = (or water)
     2/3           cup  nutritional yeast flakes
     1/4           cup  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce)
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  rubbed sage
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4 1/2           cups  vital wheat gluten
     3/4           cup  unbleached flour
                        Golden Onion Gravy -- (see recipe)

In a non-stick skillet, saute the onion in the safflower oil, over low heat, for 7 minutes or until lightly browned.  Add the garlic and ginger and saute an additional 2 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat.

Transfer the sauteed onion mixture to a blender or food processor.  Add the vegetable stock, nutritional yeast flakes, tamari, toasted sesame oil, thyme, sage, salt, and pepper, and process for 2 to 3 minutes or until smooth.  Transfer half of the wet ingredients to a small bowl and set aside.

In a large bowl, place the vital wheat gluten and flour, and stir well to combine.  Add some of the remaining wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stir well to combine, and continue to add the remaining liquid, as needed, to form a firm dough.  Using your hands, knead the dough in the bowl for 2 minutes.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or spray with a fine mist) a 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan.  Stretch the dough slightly and then press it into the loaf pan.  Pour the half of the reserved wet ingredients over the top of the roast.  Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes, then remove the loaf pan from the oven and pour the remaining reserved wet ingredients over the top of the roast.

Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees and return the roast to the oven.  Bake an additional 20 to 25 minutes or until all of the liquid is absorbed and the roast is very firm to the touch.  Remove the loaf pan from the oven and set aside for 10 minutes to cool slightly.

Transfer the roast to a cutting board and using a sharp knife, cut into slices of desired thickness.  Transfer the slices to a large platter for service.  Serve with Golden Onion Gravy.

This recipe yields one 9- by 5- by 3-inch roast.

Comments:  Leftover seitan roast can be used in your favorite casserole and grain dishes or as a filling for sandwiches or wraps.

  2               cups  unbleached flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  Spectrum Spread non-hydrogenated margarine
     1/4           cup  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk
                        of choice)
                        === GARNISHES ===
                        Freshly-chopped parsley
                        Spectrum Spread non-hydrogenated margarine

In a large pot, place the vegetable stock, and bring to a boil.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, place the flour, baking powder, and salt, and stir well to combine.  Using a pastry blender or a fork, cut in the Spectrum Spread until mixture resembles a coarse meal.  Stir in the soy milk, mixing to form a manageable dough.

Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and roll out to 1/8-inch thickness.  Cut the dough into 1- by 1-inch strips and toss the strips with a little additional flour to prevent them from sticking together.

Carefully drop the cut dumplings in the boiling stock, cover, and cook for 10 minutes without lifting the lid.  Remove the dumplings from the vegetable stock with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a large bowl.  Save the vegetable stock for making soups.  Sprinkle the dumplings with a little chopped parsley and Spectrum Spread (1 to 2 tablespoons or to taste), and toss gently.

Serve as a side dish, or as an accompaniment to soups and stews, or they can also be cooked directly in a simmering soup or stew for added flavor.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  TVP
                        = (textured vegetable protein)
  2               cups  water -- divided
     1/2           cup  lentils -- sorted, rinsed
  8             ounces  elbow macaroni
     3/4           cup  diced onion
     3/4           cup  diced seeded green pepper
     1/2           cup  diced carrot
     1/2           cup  diced celery
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  sliced halved mushrooms
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
  2        tablespoons  vegan soy parmesan cheese
                        = (or nutritional yeast flakes)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a small bowl, place the TVP, pour the hot water over the top, and set TVP aside to rehydrate.

In a small saucepan, place 1/2 cup water, and bring to a boil.  In the same saucepan, place the remaining water and lentils, and bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer the lentils for 30 minutes or until just tender.  Remove the saucepan from the heat, drain the lentils (save the cooking liquid for use in soups), and set aside.

In a large pot, cook the elbow macaroni in boiling water for 5 to 7 minutes or until al dente, drain well, and set aside.

In the same large pot, saute the onion, pepper, carrot, and celery in the olive oil for 3 minutes to soften.  Add the mushrooms and garlic and saute an additional 3 to 5 minutes or until the vegetables are crisp tender.

Add the rehydrated TVP, basil, and oregano, and saute for 1 minute.  Add the crushed tomatoes, and stir well to combine.  Reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 3 minutes.

Remove the pot from the heat, add the cooked lentils, macaroni, and vegan parmesan cheese, and stir well to combine.  Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.
