  1                     orange -- zested
  1              pinch  fennel seeds
  2             quarts  rich fish fumet
  2        tablespoons  pastis
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  1                cup  Rouille -- (listed below)
  1                     baguette -- sliced and toasted
                        Grated Gruyere
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
                        === ROUILLE ===
  4                     garlic cloves
  2                     egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  cayenne pepper
  1                cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste

Place the saffron, garlic and fish into a mixing bowl.  Drizzle with a little olive oil and toss to coat.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Saute the onion, leek and celery in olive oil until tender.  Add the tomatoes, orange zest and fennel seeds and cook for about 5 minutes.  Add the fumet and pastis.  Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.  Add the fish and cook until just done.  Season with salt and pepper.

To serve, place a baguette slice in the bottom of a serving bowl and top with a spoonful of rouille and a bit of cheese.  Top with the fish soup.  Garnish with parsley.

To make the Rouille:  Using either a mortar and pestle or a food processor, puree the garlic, egg yolks and cayenne pepper until smooth.  Slowly drizzle in the olive oil and whisk to incorporate as you would for a mayonnaise.  Season, to taste, with salt.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Caution:  There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  water
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  melted butter
                        Nonstick vegetable spray
                        Cherry Filling -- (listed below)
  2                     tablepsoons canola oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Sour cream or yogurt -- as accompaniment
                        === CHERRY FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  dried cherries
     1/4         pound  cream cheese -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        = (or 1/2 scraped vanilla bean)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              large  egg
  1              pound  farmer's cheese - (2 cups)
                        = (or pot cheese or cottage cheese)

Put the milk, water, eggs, and flour into a food processor or blender and process until smooth, about 10 seconds.  If necessary, scrape down any solids that stick to the sides.  Add the butter and process for a few more seconds to blend.  Refrigerate, covered, for at least 2 hours or overnight.

Set a 10-inch, non-stick crepe pan over moderately-high heat, then spray with non-stick vegetable spray.  When the pan is hot, remove the pan from the heat and add 2 tablespoons of batter, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan.  Cook for 1 1/2 minutes and lightly browned.  Set aside on a plate, cooked-side up, and continue with the remainder of the batter.

Place 2 tablespoons of Cherry Filling in the lower center of the blintz.  Fold up once from the bottom then fold over the sides.  Roll up the rest of the way.  Repeat with the rest.

Heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan.  In 4 small batches, fry the blintzes fold-side down until golden brown.  Gently flip to fry the other side.  Serve with sour cream or yogurt.

Cherry Filling:  In a small saucepan, cover the cherries with water and bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat and let rest.  In a bowl, mix together the cream cheese, vanilla, sugar and egg until blended.  Gently mix in the pot, farmer or cottage cheese.  Drain the cherries and fold in.

This recipe yields 8 blintzes to serve 4.

Recipe By     :Aaron Sanchez
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  instant corn flour (masa harina)
  4        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
                        Canola oil -- for frying
                        === CHORIZO AND POTATO FILLING ===
  4                     baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled and diced
  1              pound  Spanish chorizo -- diced small
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     Spanish onion -- diced
  1                     red bell pepper -- diced
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- diced
  1                     green bell pepper -- diced
  1                     poblano pepper
  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  chopped cilantro
  1                     scallion -- chopped

Mix flours, baking powder, and salt, and add the warm water.  You may need a little more warm water to make moist, smooth dough.

Traditional sopes forming method:  Make balls the size of a walnut, a few at a time, and keep the dough in a plastic bag to prevent it from drying out.  Moisten a cloth napkin or tea towel and spread out on a flat surface.  Roll each ball of dough in moistened palm of your hand until smooth, lay on the damp towel, cover with a plastic bag, and press down with your hand to flatten to the size of a silver dollar.  To shape the patty, flatten again with a small can or flat-bottomed glass into a perfectly smooth circle 2 to 2 1/2 inches in diameter.  It should be about 1/4-inch thick.  Peel the plastic bag off the top, then lay the tortilla in your hand and peel off the damp cloth.  Smooth any rough edges with your fingers and the tortilla is ready to fry.

Quick sopes forming method:  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thick.  Using a 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out sopes.  Re-roll unused dough.

Heat a cast-iron skillet and add enough canola oil to coat the bottom of the pan.  When hot, slide the patties into the hot oil and fry until they are a light golden brown and slightly crisp on top, about 1 minute on each side.  Drain on paper towels and make a slit on the side as soon as they have cooled enough to handle.  Fill with chorizo and potatoes filling.  These do not keep well; they must be eaten immediately.

Chorizo and Potato Filling:  Begin by cooking potatoes in a pot of water, when tender remove and set aside.

In a large saute pan add a little oil.  While shaking, add chorizo and cook for 4 minutes.  When crispy, add garlic, onion, and all the peppers.  Cook for 8 minutes.  At that point, add the chicken stock and cook for 3 more minutes.  Then add the potatoes, cilantro, and scallions; cook for 3 minutes more and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Use for stuffing sopes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                        Butter -- for greasing
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for sprinkling

Beat together the egg, sugar and 1 to 2 tablespoons of warm water until light and creamy.  Gradually fold in the flour until the mixture leaves the sides of the bowl clean.

For the filling, beat together the eggs and sugar until creamy.  Fold in the lemon rind, ground almonds and cinnamon.

Roll out the pastry to 1/8-inch thick on a floured work surface.  Line a greased, loose-bottomed 10-inch tart pan with the pastry.  Prick it all over with a fork and spoon the filling on top.

Bake in a preheated oven at 355 degrees for about 30 minutes, until golden brown.  Leave the almond tart to cool in the pan.

Once cool, transfer it to a serving plate and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar before serving.  A St. James' cross template can be used, if liked.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     beef tenderloin - (abt 3 lbs) -- cleaned
  4             ounces  olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     shallots -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped rosemary
  4             ounces  balsamic vinegar
  2                     fresh bay leaves
  2              large  golden beets
  1                cup  chicken stock
  4             ounces  Maytag blue cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Arugula -- cleaned, stemmed

Place tenderloin in a non-reactive container.  Whisk together olive oil, garlic, shallots, rosemary and vinegar.  Pour marinade over tenderloin and place in refrigerator for 8 hours.

Peel and roughly chop the beets.  Place in sauce pot with bay leaf, chicken stock, and salt.  Simmer until beets are tender.  Place mixture in blender and puree until smooth.  With machine running, crumble in the blue cheese.  Remove beet sauce from blender and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate until needed.

Heat grill.  Grill tenderloin until medium-rare, about 20 minutes total, turning the tenderloin to cook evenly.  Let tenderloin rest for 10 minutes before slicing into 12 (4-ounce) pieces.  Drizzle beef with beet sauce and garnish with arugula and serve.

Recipe By     :Alex Garcia
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Jams/Jellies

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  small-diced ripe mango
  6                     jalape√íos -- diced small
  1 1/2           cups  cider vinegar
  6 1/2           cups  sugar
  1             bottle  liquid pectin - (6 oz)

Boil 5 clean jelly jars in at least one inch of water while making the jelly.

Combine all ingredients except the pectin in a large saucepan and boil for 30 minutes.  Allow to cool for ten minutes.  Stir in pectin and boil for 10 minutes or until jelled.  To test, dip a metal spoon in at right angles to the surface of the jelly and lift it about 12 inches above the surface.  While still at right angles, allow the drops to "sheet" off.  If they do not come together and sheet off, continue boiling and test again.

Remove the jelly from heat, skim, and allow it to cool.  Carefully ladle into sterilized jars.  Clean the outside of each jar around the top with a hot cloth dipped in boiling water.  When cool, seal with melted paraffin.

This recipe yields 4 small jars.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHOCOLATE SPONGE ===
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate
  6                     eggs
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  espresso powder -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/2           cup  Dutch processed baking cocoa
                        === COCOA WHIPPED CREAM FILLING ===
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar
  2               cups  heavy cream
                        Raspberry and apricot preserves
                        === GANACHE FROSTING ===
  4             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  pailettes de feuilletine -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  cocoa nibs -- (optional)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line a 10 1/2- by 15 1/2-inch jellyroll pan with parchment and spray with nonstick vegetable spray.

In a dry bowl, melt chocolate over barely simmering water.

Whisk the eggs and sugar until they hold a ribbon shape for 2 seconds.  Whisk in the Coffee mixture.  Sift, then fold in the cocoa.  Fold in the melted chocolate.  Spread in the prepared pan and bake for 9 minutes until set.  Let cool.

Meanwhile, make the filling.  Sift the cocoa and confectioners' sugar into the cream and whip to the consistency of shaving cream.  Divide the sheet cake in half.  Lightly spread one layer with apricot preserves.  Spread on the whipped cream.  Lightly spread the other half with raspberry preserves and flip on top of the whipped cream.  Refrigerate.

Make the Ganache:  Put the chocolate in a small bowl.  Over medium heat, bring the cream to a scald.  Pour the hot cream over the chocolate.  Working from the center out, gently stir with a whisk to melt and blend.  Continue stirring until smooth.  Stir in the feuilletine and nibs.  Pour over the cake.  Allow cake to chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, until chocolate is set.

This recipe yields 10 squares.

     3/4           cup  sugar
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1                cup  water - (scant)
  1                cup  red La Rioja

  2                     egg whites
                        Mint leaves -- to decorate

Put the sugar in a saucepan with the cinnamon stick and a scant cup of water.  Bring to a boil and simmer until the sugar has dissolved completely and the syrup is clear.  Remove the cinnamon stick and let the syrup cool.

Mix together the sugar syrup, red wine and orange zest.

Beat the egg white until soft peaks form, and then fold into the red wine mixture.  Transfer the mixture to a metal bowl and place in the freezer for 3 hours.  Break up the ice crystals occasionally by whisking with a balloon whisk.

Before serving, the sorbet should be whisked again, then divided between chilled glasses.  Decorate with mint leaves.

Variation:  The sorbet can also be served in tall glasses, which are then topped up with chilled Spanish sparkling wine (Cava).

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  salt cod
                        === AIOLI ===
  1              whole  bulb garlic
  1                     egg yolk
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === VEGETABLES ===
  2              large  artichokes -- blanched in
                        salted water
  1               head  cauliflower -- blanched in
                        salted water, cut bite sized pieces
  2                     hard-boiled eggs -- halved
  4              large  fingerling or new potatoes -- cooked through in
                        salted water, cut bite sized pieces
  1              large  red beet -- roasted at 400
                        degrees till tender, cut bite size pcs
  2              large  vine ripened tomatoes -- quartered
  20                    green beans -- blanched in
                        salted water
  10                    baby carrots -- blanched in
                        salted water
  1                     baguette

The salt cod needs to soak in fresh cold water in the refrigerator for 24 hours.  The water should be changed several times.  Remove from the water and break into pieces.

The rest of the components of the platter can be started a day in advance as well.  Start with the aioli by preheating your oven to 350 degrees.  Wrap the bulb of garlic in a piece of aluminum foil with a few drops of olive oil.  Bake for about 30 minutes or until tender.  Allow to cool completely and then squeeze out the garlic into a mixing bowl.  Add the egg yolk and slowly whisk in the olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper and put in the refrigerator.

The day of you picnic, simply make sure all the vegetables are in bite size pieces.  For the artichoke, clean and cut in half lengthwise.  Rub with olive oil and place on a hot grill for about 5 minutes.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Caution:  There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cans  sweetened condensed milk
  3                     sheets puff pastry -- baked according to
                        box instructions
  1                     pineapple -- peeled, and
                        sliced into rings

Place the unopened cans of sweetened condensed milk into a large pot and cover with water, by about 2 inches.  Bring the water to a boil and reduce heat so water is simmering.  Maintain water level and simmering water for 3 hours.  After 3 hours, pour off water, being careful not to touch the cans.  Let the cans cool completely before opening.  This is now called dulce de leche.

Grill the pineapple slices and dice small.  Set aside.

Onto 2 sheets of the baked puff pastry, evenly distribute the dulce de leche.  Dulce de leche-side-up, layer one sheet one on top of the other (so it looks like: pastry, dulce de leche, pastry, dulce de leche).  Then, place the remaining plain layer of puff pastry on top of the top layer of dulce de leche.  Trim the edges, and cut into 2- by 3-inch triangles.  Serve with pineapple.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Place the unopened cans of sweetened condensed milk into a large pot and cover with water, by about 2 inches.  Bring the water to a boil and reduce heat so water is simmering.  Maintain water level and simmering water for 3 hours.  After 3 hours, pour off water, being careful not to touch the cans.  Let the cans cool completely before opening.  This is now called dulce de leche.

<DirT>
Grill the pineapple slices and dice small.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Onto 2 sheets of the baked puff pastry, evenly distribute the dulce de leche.  Dulce de leche-side-up, layer one sheet one on top of the other (so it looks like: pastry, dulce de leche, pastry, dulce de leche).  Then, place the remaining plain layer of puff pastry on top of the top layer of dulce de leche.  Trim the edges, and cut into 2- by 3-inch triangles.  Serve with pineapple.

Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  diced carrot
  1                cup  diced onion
  1                cup  diced celery
  6                     peeled garlic cloves
  1                cup  crushed peeled tomatoes
  2               cups  red wine or port
  1              quart  duck stock
  2             sticks  canela
  1         tablespoon  star anise
  3                     fresh bay leaves
  1              bunch  thyme
     1/2           cup  seedless tamarind paste
  2                     boneless duck breasts with skin on -- pricked numerously
                        with a sharp knife
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat a Dutch oven.  Add the butter; cook the carrots, onion, celery, and garlic for 10 minutes or until caramelized.  Add tomatoes and cook for another 2 minutes.  De-glaze with red wine.

Reduce down by half and add duck stock, canela, star anise, and bay leaves.  Cook for 30 minutes, or until the sauce is reduced by 2/3.  At this point, add the thyme and the tamarind paste.  Cook for 5 minutes then strain sauce through a fine mesh sieve.

Heat a saute pan large enough to hold the two duck breasts.  Season the duck breast with salt and pepper.  Add it to the pan skin-side down, and sear for 3 minutes.  Place the pan in a preheated 400 degree oven for 5 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the duck is 145 degrees.

Place 2 tablespoons of tamarind sauce on a plate.  Slice the duck breasts on a bias and put on the plate, on top of the tamarind sauce.

This recipe yields 2 servings, plus extra sauce.

  1                     onion -- chopped
  1                     green bell pepper -- cut 1" pieces
  2                     carrots -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  shiitake mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        trimmed and sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
  4                     celery stalks -- thickly sliced
  3               cups  coarsely-chopped green cabbage
  1         tablespoon  garam masala
     1/4           cup  Szechuan stir-fry sauce -- or more to taste
  1                can  bamboo shoots - (8 oz) -- drained
  1                can  water chestnuts - (8 oz) -- drained
     1/2           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  chili paste - (to 3) -- or to taste
  2          teaspoons  Oriental sesame oil - (to 3) -- or to taste
     1/2           cup  minced fresh cilantro -- or to taste

Make the rice:  In a saucepan over moderately-high heat bring the water to a boil, add the bouillon cube, bay leaves, sesame oil, and salt to taste, and stir to dissolve bouillon.  Add the rice, bring back to the boil, stirring, and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.  Let stand for 5 minutes.  Transfer rice to a bowl and fluff with a fork.  Discard bay leaves.

Make the egg sheets:  In a bowl whisk together the whole eggs, egg whites, and salt.  In a large non-stick skillet set over moderate heat, warm the oil until it is hot, add the egg mixture, lifting and tilting the pan to coat the bottom evenly with the egg, and let it cook until set on the underside.  Turn and let cook until eggs are completely set.  Transfer to a plate and let cool.  Cut into shreds.

In a wok or casserole set over moderately-high heat, warm the 3 tablespoons of oil until it is hot.  Add the garlic and gingerroot and stir-fry for 1 minute, or until fragrant.  Add the onion, green pepper, carrots, mushrooms, and salt and stir-fry 5 minutes.  Add the celery and cabbage and stir-fry 3 minutes more.  Add the garam masala and Szechuan sauce, and stir-fry 2 minutes.  Add the bamboo shoots, water chestnuts and 1/2 cup water and let cook, stirring, 3 to 5 minutes, or until vegetables are crisp-tender.

Add the rice and egg sheets, and stir-fry until rice is heated through.  Season with the chili paste, sesame oil, and cilantro.  Adjust seasonings.  Transfer mixture to a large serving dish.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a large nonstick skillet set over moderately-high heat, warm the oil until hot, add the chicken, and saute it for 2 minutes.  Turn and cook for 1 minute more.  Transfer the chicken to a plate.

Add the wine to the skillet and reduce it by half.  Add the broth, whisk in the mustard, and return the chicken to the skillet.  Simmer 2 to 3 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and springy to the touch.  Transfer the chicken to a plate, reduce the remaining liquid to 1/2 cup, and pour it into a small bowl.

Make the dressing:  Add the olive oil, whisking, to the bowl of reduced cooking liquid and whisk in the vinegar and salt and pepper, to taste.  Cut chicken into slices and add to the salad bowl.  Pour juices from plate into dressing, whisking to combine, and drizzle over salad.  Toss mixture until chicken and vegetables are well coated with dressing.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Olive oil -- as needed
  1                cup  celery brunois
  1                cup  carrot brunois

Recipe By     :Wayne Harley Brachman
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  water
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  turmeric
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2             pounds  baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled
  1              large  Spanish onion -- minced (2 cups)
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  3        tablespoons  pureed chipotle in adobo sauce
  1              pound  pre-cooked kielbasa -- cut 1/4" dice

In a mixer fitted with the paddle, combine the oil, water, cumin, turmeric, salt, and 1 1/2 cups flour.  If necessary, add additional flour or water to make a soft dough.  Form into 2 rectangles.  Wrap in plastic and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.  This is an oil-pastry called ail teig.

Place the potatoes in a pot of water and boil until fork-tender (25 minutes).  Drain, rinse and mash.  Meanwhile, saute the onions in the oil until golden and caramelized then add the ground cumin and let saute until aromatic.  Mix onions into potatoes.  In a blender, puree the chipotle.  Add the chipotle and kielbasa to the potato mixture.  Let cool.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Roll out the dough into 2 triangles, 1/8-inch thick each, about 10 by 15 inches.  Spoon filling down the center, shaping into a squared-off log.  Trim dough and wrap the filling, rolling the pastry so the seam is on the bottom.  Alternatively, cut dough into 4 1/2-inch squares.  Place 1/4 cup filling in the center of the squares.  Fold up the corners and pinch to seal.  Set seam-side down, on a non-stick cookie sheet.  Bake for 30 minutes, until golden.

This recipe yields 2 large or 12 to 16 small knish.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10                    dried corn husks
  1 1/2           cups  masa harina
  1 1/4           cups  chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  shredded cooked chicken
                        === AMARILLA MOLE ===
  3                     guajillo chiles -- seeded, deviened
  1                     ancho chile -- seeded, deviened
  1             medium  onion
  4                     garlic cloves
  5             medium  tomatillos
  2             medium  green tomatoes
  15                    black pepppercorns
  7                     whole cloves
  3              large  fresh hoja santa leaves
                        = (or 5 dried hoja santa leaves)
  3        tablespoons  lard or vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  masa harina
  3        tablespoons  water

In a large mixing bowl soak the corn husks for 30 minutes.

In another bowl, add the masa harina and salt and with a whisk, mix well.  Slowly add the chicken stock to the masa harina and mix well until a dough-like consistency.  Make 10 ping-pong ball size balls of dough.

In a plastic-lined tortilla press (both sides), press out each ball of dough to form a 5-inch round (about the size of the press).  Carefully remove the tortilla, and place a spoonful of amarillo mole sauce, a spoonful of shredded cooked chicken.  Fold each side of the tortilla and place in a corn husk length-wise.  Secure both ends with a string or part of the husk used as a string, and repeat process.

Steam for 30 minutes.

Mole Amarillo:  Toast chiles on a griddle.  Remove and place in a bowl.  Cover with boiling water and let stand for 20 minutes.

In a hot cast-iron pan, roast the onion, garlic, tomatillos, and green tomatoes.  Roast until well charred on all sides.  Place in a bowl and let cool.

Meanwhile grind peppercorns and cloves in coffee grinder.  When the vegetables are cool enough to handle peel off the charred skin and puree them in a blender with the hoja santa leaves, drained chiles, and spices.

In hot pot, heat the lard, add the pureed strained sauce, and cook for 5 minutes.

In a small bowl, add the masa harina and water.  Mix until well blended.  Add this mixture to the sauce and cook for 5 minutes more, until done.

This recipe yields 10 tamales.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  white wine
  2 1/2           cups  water
  1              pinch  salt
  2 1/2           cups  flour -- sifted
                        Olive oil -- for frying
  3          teaspoons  powdered cinnamon -- mixed with
  1                cup  sugar

Put wine and water in a pot.  Bring to almost a boil.  (It shouldn't come to a full boil.)  Add the flour all at once and stir constantly with a wooden spoon.  When the dough comes out of the pot in a single piece remove it from the heat.  Place on lightly oiled marble or counter surface.

Knead by pounding with a rolling pin.  Do this for 10 minutes so as to make it smooth and homogeneous.  Roll the dough into snakes about as thick as your little finger.  Pull off small pieces of dough, rub the dough between your hands and pinch ends together to make small rings.

Heat the oil and fry the zeppole a few at a time.  Prick balls with a skewer as they fry, so the dough will bubble out and they become crunchier and more golden.  Drain them on paper towels.  Dredge them in the cinnamon-sugar mixture.  Serve hot or cold.

This recipe yields ?? servings.
