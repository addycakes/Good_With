                        Maple syrup -- for serving

Slice French bread into 20 slices, 1-inch each.  (Use any extra bread for garlic toast or bread crumbs).  Arrange slices in a generously buttered 9- by 13-inch flat baking dish in 2 rows, overlapping the slices.

In a large bowl, combine the eggs, half-and-half, milk, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt and beat with a rotary beater or whisk until blended but not too bubbly.  Pour mixture over the bread slices, making sure all are covered evenly with the milk-egg mixture.  Spoon some of the mixture in between the slices.  Cover with foil and refrigerate overnight.

Praline Topping:  Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and blend well.  Makes enough for Baked French Toast Casserole.

The next day, preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Spread Praline Topping evenly over the bread and bake for 40 minutes, until puffed and lightly golden.  Serve with maple syrup.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  beef tenderloin - (to 2)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2             ounces  peeled shallots -- finely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped
  4             ounces  mushrooms -- finely chopped
  12            ounces  shucked May River Oysters
                        = (or best oysters available in your area)
                        and picked free of any broken shells
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry
  2        tablespoons  fresh bread crumbs
                        Flour -- for dusting
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- thawed
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Rub the tenderloin with salt and pepper and brush it lightly with oil.  Heat 1 tablespoon oil and the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Place the tenderloin in the skillet and lightly sear all surfaces of the meat, including the ends.  Remove the meat from the pan and set aside.

Add more oil to the pan if necessary, and then add the shallots and garlic and saute for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and saute for 2 to 3 minutes longer.  Add the oysters and sherry and cook until the oysters are opaque.

Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.  Drain off any liquid and combine the mixture with the breadcrumbs in the bowl of a food processor.  Process until well blended and nearly smooth.

Line a colander with several layers of cheesecloth and spoon the pate into it.  Allow to drain for 10 to 15 minutes.  If the pate seems too wet, pick up the edge of the cheesecloth, twist it together, and wring out the excess liquid.

Roll out the puff pastry dough on a lightly floured surface to form a rectangle less than 1/4-inch thick.  Spoon some pate into the center of the dough and spread it to form a shape similar to that of the tenderloin.  Place the meat on the pate; then cover the top and sides of the meat with the remaining pate.

Wrap the pastry around the tenderloin, overlapping the edges to form a seam.  Moisten the edges with water and pinch lightly to seal.  Trim the top layer of pastry from both ends and fold the ends up over the sides of the meat, sealing as before.

Carefully turn over the pastry wrapped tenderloin and place seam-side down on a lightly greased baking sheet.  Brush pastry with the beaten egg.  Decorate the top with designs cut from the pastry scraps, if desired.  Brush the cutouts with beaten egg.

Bake the tenderloin for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.  Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before carving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Knead gently and quickly, folding only 8 to 10 times.  Roll with a lightly floured rolling pin, until the dough is about 1/2-inch thick.  Cut into 1/2- by 1/2- by 3-inch sticks.  Brush with melted butter and bake for 5 to 8 minutes, or until just slightly golden.  Stack the sticks like building a log cabin.

This recipe yields about 20 sticks.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped pecans
                        = (or your favorite type of nuts)
                        === FILLING ===
  2           packages  cream cheese - (3 oz ea) -- room temperature
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                can  blueberry pie filling - (21 oz)

Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Combine powdered sugar, flour, and butter in the bowl of a food processor, processing until mixture forms a ball (you can combine dough by hand, if desired).  With your fingers, press dough into a 12-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, taking care to push crust into indentations in tart pan.  Pat nuts onto crust.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until very lightly browned.  Let cool completely before filling.

Filling:  In a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer, beat the cream cheese with the powdered sugar.  In a separate mixing bowl with the hand mixer, beat the heavy cream with the sugar until it forms soft peaks.  Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.  Spoon this mixture into the cooled pie shell and top it with blueberry pie filling.  Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN ===
  1                     chicken - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- cut 8 pieces
  3                     celery ribs -- chopped
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2                     bay leaves
  2                     chicken bouillon cubes
  1           teaspoon  House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  1                can  condensed cream of celery or
                        cream of chicken soup - (10 3/4 oz)
                        === DUMPLINGS ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Ice water -- as needed

To start the chicken:  Place the chicken, celery, onion, bay leaves, bouillon, and House Seasoning in a large pot.  Add 4 quarts of water and in water and bring to a simmer over medium heat.  Simmer the chicken until it is tender and the thigh juices run clear, about 40 minutes.  Remove the chicken from the pot and, when it is cool enough to handle, remove the skin and separate the meat from the bones.  Return the chicken meat to the pot.  Keep warm over low heat.

To prepare the dumplings:  Mix the flour with the salt and mound together in a mixing bowl.  Beginning at the center of the mound, drizzle a small amount of ice water over the flour.  Using your fingers, and moving from the center to the sides of the bowl, gradually incorporate about 3/4 cup of ice water.  Knead the dough and form it into ball.

Dust a good amount of flour onto a clean work surface.  Roll out the dough (it will be firm), working from center to 1/8-inch thick.  Let the dough relax for several minutes.

Add the cream of celery soup to the pot with the chicken and simmer gently over medium-low heat.

Cut the dough into 1-inch pieces.  Pull a piece in half and drop the halves into the simmering soup.  Repeat.  Do not stir the chicken once the dumplings have been added.  Gently move the pot in a circular motion so the dumplings become submerged and cook evenly.  Cook until the dumplings float and are no longer doughy, 3 to 4 minutes.

To serve, ladle chicken, gravy, and dumplings into warm bowls.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Cook's Note:  If the chicken stew is too thin it can be thickened before the dumplings are added.  Simply mix together 2 tablespoons cornstarch and 1/4 cup of water then whisk this mixture into the stew.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     box chocolate cake mix
                        = (Duncan Hines recommended)
     1/2           cup  coffee liqueur
  2               cups  Hot Fudge Sauce -- (listed below)
                        = (or 1 (16-oz) jar fudge sauce)

  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream -- whipped, and
                        sweetened with

  1                     bar German chocolate - (4 oz)

                               Creme Brulee

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/3           cup  white granulated or light brown sugar - -- (to 1/2)

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

In a heavy-bottomed medium non-reactive saucepan, heat cream with vanilla bean over medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring to ensure it does not burn; do not let boil.  Remove from heat and let steep for 15 minutes.  Remove and discard the vanilla bean, or save for another use.  Strain cream through a fine mesh sieve.

Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, beat egg yolks with an electric mixer on high speed for 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy.  Gradually beat in 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar.  Add about half the cream mixture, a little at a time, to the egg mixture, whisking until well blended.  Then pour the egg mixture into the remaining cream mixture.  Stir until completely blended.

Pour the custard into 4 (9-ounce) ramekins or custard cups.  Place the dishes in large baking pan.  Pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins.  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until the mixture is set in the center (it should still wiggle when shaken).  Carefully remove the dishes from the baking pan.  Let cool to room temperature and then refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.  Let creme brulee stand at room temperature 20 minutes before serving.

Divide 1/3 to 1/2 cup white or light brown sugar in a thin, even layer over each custard, covering it completely.  To caramelize the sugar, light a propane torch and hold it so the flame just touches the surface.  Start at the center and spiral out toward the edges of the ramekins.  If the sugar begins to burn, pull the torch away and blow on the sugar to extinguish the flame.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variations:  Finely grate orange zest or bittersweet chocolate over the creme brulee before adding the sugar for caramelizing.

Cook's Note:  A propane torch can be bought at your local hardware store.  If you don't have one, caramelize the topping under the broiler, watching carefully so as not to burn it.

  4               cups  beef broth or water
  3                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  2        tablespoons  hot sauce
                        = (Texas Pete recommended)
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  5             medium  or 4 large fresh tomatoes -- peeled, quartered
  1                can  extra-hot stewed tomatoes - (10 oz)
                        = (Ro-Tel recommended)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh parsley leaves

Season beef with kosher salt, black pepper and garlic powder.  Dust beef with about 1/3 cup flour and toss lightly.

Spray a cast-iron Dutch oven with cooking spray.  Heat 4 tablespoons of bacon grease and 4 tablespoons of cooking oil (you may use all bacon grease, all solid shortening, or all cooking oil if desired).  Brown meat in hot fat and remove to a large bowl using a slotted spoon.

Leaving fat in Dutch oven, saute bell pepper, onions, celery, and garlic.  Brown vegetables and remove to bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving fat in the pot.

Add or take away to total 3 tablespoons of fat to make your roux.  To make roux, add about 1/4 cup of flour, stirring constantly and slowly until flour is a nice deep brown, being careful not to burn the flour.

Slowly add 4 cups of beef broth or water and stir.  Bring to a simmer and add back beef and vegetables.  Add bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, dried basil and stir.  Add fresh tomatoes and 1 can extra hot tomatoes.  Simmer for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Just before serving, remove bay leaves and stir in 1/2 cup chopped parsley.  Serve over your favorite hot buttered grits.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  2        tablespoons  butter
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1              small  red bell pepper -- chopped
                        Garlic powder -- to taste
  2               cups  black-eye peas -- cooked

                        House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  8             sprigs  fresh parsley -- for garnish

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic powder, to taste, and cook for 5 minutes.

                        Non-stick cooking spray -- as needed
  1                     box chocolate cake mix
     3/4           cup  water
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
                        Vanilla ice cream -- as needed
  1                cup  sprinkles, nuts, or other toppings
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Oven-safe popsicle forms or baking tins
                        = (Cake Lolli recommended)
                        Popsicle sticks

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray the pop forms with non-stick spray.

In the bowl of a mixer, beat together cake mix, water, eggs, and oil for 30 seconds on low speed.  Turn speed to high and beat for an additional 2 minutes.  Place 2 heaping tablespoons of cake batter into each form.  Bake for approximately 12 minutes, or until cake is fully cooked.  Remove from oven and invert immediately onto a cooling rack.  Repeat with remaining cake batter.

Cool cakes completely, and then push popsicle sticks about halfway into each cake.  Stir ice cream until it is the consistency of frosting.  Using a wide, flat knife or spatula and working quickly, frost cakes.  Dip cake pops in sprinkles, nuts, or desired toppings and then place on a waxed paper lined baking sheet.  As the cakes are frosted and decorated, place in the freezer to avoid melting.

This recipe yields 32 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  14             large  red potatoes - (to 15)
                        = (about 5 pounds)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh parsley leaves
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
  3              large  garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1                cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  tarragon vinegar

Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water.  Bring to a boil, generously salt the water, and boil the potatoes until tender, approximately 30 to 40 minutes.  Drain and let stand until cool enough to handle.

Peel potatoes, if desired, and cut into 1-inch chunks.  Place cut potatoes in a large bowl.  Sprinkle parsley and green onions over potatoes.

Make the sauce by mixing the rest of the ingredients together in another bowl; then pour sauce over the potatoes.  Stir well.  Let stand all day, or at least for 4 hours, stirring every hour.  Do not refrigerate.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  shucked oysters in their liquor
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     celery stalks -- cut medium sized
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  4               cups  milk
  2               cups  heavy cream
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        Freshly-grated nutmeg -- to taste
                        Curry powder -- to taste
                        Ac'cent -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
                        Paprika -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh parsley leaves

Pick over the oysters for shells.  Simmer the oysters and oyster liqueur in a covered pot over low heat with a little salt and black pepper.  Stir occasionally until the edges of the oysters curl, about 6 minutes.

Lift the oysters out of the stock with a slotted spoon and put them in a colander with a bowl underneath to catch the pot liquor.  Pour the stock from the pot into the bowl, being careful to discard any oyster dregs.  Set the stock aside.

Cook the celery and onion in a little water until tender; drain, reserving the broth.  Add the broth to the oyster stock (should measure about 2 cups), and then add the milk and cream (reserve a little cream to whip for garnish).  Heat the butter, then whisk in the flour to make a roux.  Add the stock mixture to the roux, and stir briskly until thickened and smooth.  Add a little nutmeg, a pinch of curry powder, a pinch of Ac'cent, the lemon juice, Worcestershire, and cayenne.  Correct the seasonings.

Mash the oysters with the celery and onions and mix well; add to oyster stock.  Keep warm over hot water until time to serve.  Whip the reserved cream.  Pour bisque into individual bowls.  Swirl an even portion of whipped cream into each bowl.  Add a little paprika and chopped parsley to garnish.  Offer sherry, if desired.

This recipe yields 2 1/4 quarts.

                  Mustard And Peppercorn Crusted Rib-Eye

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  beef rib-eye steaks, 1 1/2" to 2" thick - -- (6 oz ea)
  4        tablespoons  brown mustard
  4        tablespoons  black peppercorns -- crushed
  1         tablespoon  finely-ground black pepper - (to 2) -- optional
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

Brush rib-eyes with mustard on both sides.  In a shallow bowl, or on a plate with a deep center, combine crushed peppercorns, ground pepper, if using, and salt, to taste.  Pat pepper mixture onto steaks and crust thoroughly on all sides.

Prepare your grill by lightly spraying the grate with non-stick cooking spray and then preheat the grill.  When the grill is hot, place the rib-eyes on the grate and cook until desired doneness, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side for rare.  Add 1 to 2 minutes for medium-rare and so on.

The best way to test steaks for doneness is to poke it with your index finger; rare will be soft, medium-rare will be slightly less soft, and so forth.  Never flip a steak more than once; let it cook for half the total cook time before flipping.  Remove from grill and let rest for 5 minutes in a warm place before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I've had the opportunity to make so many new friends in the restaurant.  Robin Wilson from Altamonte Springs, Florida, is one of those.  Robin recently was one of a hundred finalists in the 39th Pillsbury Bake-off, where she won a side-by-side refrigerator and a trip to San Francisco.  As she and her husband were enjoying lunch at The Lady and Sons, she mentioned her Orange Brownies, and she was happy to share the recipe.  Thanks, Robin, and good luck to ya in your next bake-off!  Get that gold, girl!

              Paula's Fried Green Tomato And Egg Hollandaise

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  firm green tomatoes -- (3 to 4)
                        Salt -- to taste
  2               cups  vegetable or peanut oil -- for deep-frying
  1                cup  buttermilk
  2               cups  self-rising flour
  6             slices  bacon -- cut in half and
                        cooked until crisp
  6                     eggs -- poached
                        === HOLLANDAISE SAUCE ===
  2                     egg yolks
  4        tablespoons  cream
  2              large  tablespoons butter
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  sugar
                        Chicken broth -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  white vinegar

Slice the tomatoes 1/4-inch thick.  Lay them out in a shallow baking pan and sprinkle with salt.  Place the tomato slices in a colander and allow time for the salt to pull the water out of the tomatoes, approximately 30 minutes.

In a skillet, heat the oil for deep-frying over medium high heat.  Dip the tomatoes into buttermilk, then dredge them in flour.  Deep-fry until golden brown.  Keep warm.

Meanwhile, prepare Hollandaise Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in the top of a double boiler, over boiling water.  Stir until thick, approximately 3 minutes; set aside until ready to use.  Do not reheat or cover the pot.  Thin, if needed with a little chicken broth.  Stir in the vinegar.

To assemble each serving, place 2 fried tomatoes on a plate.  Top with 2 strips of cooked bacon in a criss-cross fashion.  Top bacon with a poached egg, spoon on Hollandaise Sauce.  This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  sliced provolone cheese - (8 oz)
  2           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  20                    pistachios -- shelled
  2                     garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves
     1/2           cup  fresh parsley leaves
     1/2           cup  pine nuts
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3             ounces  oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes

Line a medium bowl with plastic wrap, leaving enough overhang to cover the top.  Reserving 3 slices of the provolone, line the bottom and sides of the bowl with the remaining provolone, overlapping the slices.

For the cream cheese layer, process the cream cheese, pistachios, and 1 of the garlic cloves in a food processor until blended; scrape the mixture into a bowl and set aside.

For the pesto layer, process the basil, parsley, pine nuts, and the remaining garlic clove in the food processor until blended.  Dissolve the salt and pepper in the olive oil and mix well.  With the machine running, add the oil in a fine stream.  Scrape this mixture into a second bowl and set aside.

For the tomato layer, drain the tomatoes, reserving the oil.  Puree the tomatoes with a small amount of the reserved oil in a food processor.

Spread some of the cream cheese mixture over the cheese slices lining the bowl.  Layer the pesto mixture, half of the remaining cream cheese mixture, the sun-dried tomato mixture, and then remaining cream cheese mixture in the bowl.  Cover with the remaining provolone.  Bring the edges of the plastic wrap together over the top and secure with a twist tie.  Freeze until firm.

Remove the plastic wrap and invert the mold onto a serving platter.  Serve with party crackers.  This will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.

This recipe yields 15 to 20 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7 1/2           cups  water
  2 1/2         pounds  unpeeled fresh shrimp
  3             medium  onions -- sliced
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- as needed
  1              Whole  peppercorns -- as needed
  4                     bay leaves
  2              whole  garlic cloves -- peeled
  1                cup  cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice

Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan.  Add the shrimp and cook until just pink, no more than 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain well and rinse in cold water to prevent further cooking.  Peel and devein shrimp, leaving tails on.

In a large glass airtight jar (about 1 1/2 quarts *) layer shrimp and onions and top each layer with ground black pepper, peppercorns, bay leaf and a clove of garlic.  Keep layering until jar is about 2/3 full.  * Note: for larger shrimp you may need a larger jar and adjust ingredients accordingly.

Pour vinegar and lemon juice over layers until jar is almost full.  Leave space at the top so you can gently shake jar to remix ingredients.  Seal jar tightly and chill for a few days up to 2 weeks.  Turn jar upside down to remix every other day or so.  Serve chilled as an appetizer.

This recipe yields 10 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              dozen  macaroons -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  bourbon or rum
     1/2         pound  butter - (2 sticks)
  1                cup  sugar
  6                     eggs -- separated
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- melted
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  chopped pecans
  1              dozen  double ladyfingers -- separated in halves
     3/4           cup  heavy cream -- whipped with
  3        tablespoons  sugar -- until stiff

Soak crumbled macaroons in bourbon or rum.  With an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar together until fluffy.  Beat in 6 lightly beaten egg yolks.  Add the melted chocolate, vanilla, nuts, and soaked macaroons.  In a separate clean mixing bowl, beat the 6 egg whites until stiff and then fold into chocolate mixture.

Grease a springform pan and then line it with separated ladyfingers.  Alternate layers of the chocolate mixture with the remaining ladyfingers.  Chill overnight.  Remove from pan and decorate with whipped cream.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHOCOLATE CAKE ===
  2               cups  brown sugar
     1/2           cup  vegetable shortening
  1                cup  buttermilk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- melted
  3                     eggs
  2               cups  sifted all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === HOT FUDGE SAUCE ===
  1                     bar German chocolate - (4 oz)
     1/2         ounce  unsweetened chocolate
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick)
  3               cups  powdered sugar
  1 2/3           cups  evaporated milk
  1 1/4      teaspoons  vanilla

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

To make the cake, cream the brown sugar with the shortening in an electric mixer.  Add the buttermilk and vanilla then the melted chocolate.  With the mixer running, add eggs, 1 at a time.  Sift the flour with the baking soda, and salt.  Add the dry ingredients to the sugar mixture and beat for 2 minutes.

Grease and flour a 13- by 9 by 2-inch rectangular cake pan.  Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake until the cake is springy and a toothpick can be inserted and removed cleanly, about 40 minutes.  Allow the cake to cool for 10 minutes then turn it out onto a rack to finish cooling.

To make the sauce:  Melt the German chocolate with the butter in a saucepan over very low heat.  Stir in the powdered sugar, alternating with evaporated milk and blending well.  Stirring constantly, bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat.  Simmer until the mixture becomes thick and creamy, about 8 minutes.  Stir in the vanilla.  Serve slices of cake topped with warm fudge sauce.

This recipe yields approximately 20 servings.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  sliced fresh mushrooms
  1 1/2           cups  green onions -- sliced
  1                cup  beef stock
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        A six-cup jumbo muffin tin

Crust:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

In a mixing bowl, blend butter and cream cheese until well combined.  Cut in the flour with a fork.  Divide dough into 6 balls and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Grease a 6-cup jumbo muffin tins with butter or nonstick cooking spray.  Pat each of the chilled dough balls into each muffin cup.  Bake for approximately 8 minutes, or until golden brown.

Filling:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a saucepan over medium heat, melt butter and stir in flour; then slowly blend in half-and-half, stirring constantly.  The sauce should be thick; do not brown the sauce.  Add mushroom soup, sliced mushrooms, Parmesan, and egg and stir to combine.  Fold in shrimp and add garlic powder, to taste.  Pour mixture into pie crusts and top with buttered bread crumbs.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until brown and bubbly.

Steak:  While pies are baking, season meat pieces with salt and pepper.  Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add beef and garlic and start browning the meat.  Add mushrooms and then remove meat when it reaches your desired doneness; set aside and keep warm.

Add green onions and then deglaze the skillet with beef stock, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to remove any flavorful browned bits.  Add cream and cook until reduced to sauce consistency.  Add beef back to the sauce just prior to serving.

Let pies cool for 10 minutes before removing from muffin tin.  Place each pie in the center of a dinner plate.  Arrange tenderloin chunks around pie, spoon sauce on top, and garnish each with sprig of parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.
