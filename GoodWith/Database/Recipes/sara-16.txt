  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsweetened chocolate
     1/2           cup  semisweet chocolate
  1                cup  butter
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                cup  brown sugar
  4                     eggs -- beaten
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  1 1/2           cups  flour
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  1                cup  pecans
  4        tablespoons  ancho chile powder
                        Cajeta Sauce -- (see below)
                        Sifted cocoa powder
                        === CAJETA SAUCE ===
  1              quart  goats milk, cows milk,
                        or a mixture of both
  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup
  1              small  cinnamon stick
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  1         tablespoon  cream sherry, rum or brandy

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Melt chocolate and butter in double boiler, add sugar, brown sugar, eggs and vanilla.  Place chocolate mixture in a mixing bowl and fold in flour, salt and baking powder.  Add pecans and chile powder. 
Pour mixture into a deep 9- by 13-inch greased pan and bake in oven for 1 hour or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cut into 3-inch squares.  Serve with Cajeta Sauce, cinnamon ice cream, and sifted cocoa powder. 
Cajeta Sauce:  Stir together the milk, sugar, corn syrup, and cinnamon stick in medium-size heavy pot or Dutch oven.  Bring to a boil.  Dissolve the baking soda in 1 tablespoon water, remove the milk from the heat, and stir in the soda mixture, having a spoon ready to stir the mixture down if it bubbles up. 
Cook, stirring frequently, over medium heat, until the mixture thickens into a pale-gold syrup, about 25 minutes.  At this point, begin stirring very frequently as the mixture thickens into a caramel-brown syrup that's the consistency of maple syrup, about 10 minutes more. 
Strain the cajeta sauce through a fine mesh strainer set over a large measuring cup.  Let cool for a few minutes, then stir in the sherry, rum or brandy (plus a little water, if necessary, to bring it to 1 1/2 cups).  Refrigerate covered.  When cold, the cajeta sauce should have the consistency of thin corn syrup. 
This recipe yields 12 brownies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     bacon slices
  3                     corn ears
  1              large  egg
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Pure maple syrup or sliced tomatoes -- for accompaniment

In a heavy skillet cook bacon over moderately-low heat until crisp.  Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain and reserve bacon fat in a heatproof bowl.  Crumble bacon. 
Working in a large bowl and using the largest holes of a 4-sided grater, grate corn until you have about 1/2 cup.  Lightly beat egg and add to corn.  Stir in flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper until combined well. 
In skillet heat 1 tablespoon reserved bacon fat over moderate heat.  Working in 2 batches, form fritters by dropping 1/8-cup measures of batter for each into skillet and cook until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes on each side.  Serve fritters warm with bacon and syrup or tomatoes. 
This recipe yields 2 to 3 side dish servings 
Comments:  Although these are called fritters, they more closely resemble pancakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              pints  mussels
  6        tablespoons  white bread crumbs
  4        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
     2/3           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Wash and scrape the mussels thoroughly under cold running water and remove the beards.  Put the mussels in a pan, without any water, and heat until the shells open.  (Any that remain unopened must be discarded.)  Discard the empty shells, and loosen the mussels from the other shells.  Arrange the mussels, in the bottom shell halves, in a cooking tray. 
Mix together the bread crumbs, parsley, garlic, chives, olive oil, salt and pepper.  Spoon the mixture over each mussel and leave for about half an hour before cooking. 
Put the mussels under a preheated broiler for just a few minutes to brown the crumb mixture and form a crust over the mussels.  Try not to overcook. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Puddings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  milk
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/2                vanilla bean
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (1")
     1/2                orange -- zested, chopped fine
     1/4           cup  arborio rice
  1              whole  egg
  3                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  crËme fraiche -- whipped
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  8                     apricots
  1              pinch  cinnamon
  4        tablespoons  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  soft butter
     1/4           cup  Brandy

Combine milk, sugar, vanilla, ginger, orange zest and rice in pot.  Over medium heat, bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to simmer and cook until most of the milk is absorbed, about 20 to 35 minutes, continuing to stir occasionally. 
Whisk together egg and yolks and slowly temper into simmering rice mixture.  Take off heat and stir butter.  Remove vanilla bean and ginger and pour onto lined sheet pan.  Cover with plastic or parchment and refrigerate to cool.  When cool, fold in whipped crËme fraiche. 
Meanwhile, split apricots in half and pit.  Lay face-side up on sheet pan.  Sprinkle each half with brown sugar and cinnamon.  Dot with butter and drizzle with brandy.  Place in broiler or under salamander until butter and sugar melt and bubble and apricots soften, about 3 to 5 minutes. 
To serve, spoon rice pudding into center of bowl, place 4 apricots halves on top. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1              pound  carrots
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  minced onion
     1/4         pound  sliced cooked ham -- cut thin strips
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  heavy cream

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  prepared puff pastry -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  grated Gruyere cheese
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  grated Cheddar cheese
  1         tablespoon  grated Parmesan cheese
  1         tablespoon  very finely chopped prosciutto -- (optional)

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. 
Divide the pastry into 3 equal portions.  Roll out one portion to rectangle 1/8-inch thick and 10 inches in length.  Sprinkle the Gruyere evenly over the surface and dust very lightly with cayenne.  Use the palms of your hand or a rolling pin to firmly press the cheese into the dough.  Cut the dough into 1/2-inch wide strips, twist them, and arrange them on a baking sheet.  Continue with the remaining pastry, sprinkling Cheddar cheese on one batch and Parmesan and prosciutto, if using on the other.  Chill for at least 30 minutes before baking. 
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Bake the straws until puffed and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.  Cool and serve. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     cavallion or cantaloupe melon -- peeled
  1                     Korean or honeydew melon -- peeled
                        (Korean melons do not have to be peeled)
  1                     Vidalia onion -- shaved
     1/4           cup  fresh mint leaves
  2        tablespoons  fresh cilantro leaves
  1         tablespoon  yuzu juice - (to 2 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin lemon oil
  4                     Miso Poached Salmon Fillets -- (see below)
     1/2           cup  Tamari Melon Sauce -- (see below)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === MISO POACHED SALMON ===
  3               cups  fish or chicken broth
     1/2           cup  light miso -- plus
  2        tablespoons  light miso
  1                cup  tamari or soy sauce
  4                     salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        === TAMARI MELON SAUCE ===
  1                cup  melon juice
  1                cup  tamari

Cut each melon into quarters lengthwise and remove the seeds with a large table or serving spoon.  Square three of the quarters of each melon so they can be sliced easily.  Run the remaining quarter of each melon through an electric vegetable juicer and reserve for tamari melon sauce.  Slice the squared quarters very thinly.  Place in a mixing bowl with the Vidalia onion, mint leaves, cilantro leaves, yuzu, and lemon oil.  Toss to combine and set aside. 
For the Miso Poached Salmon Fillets:  Combine the broth, miso, and tamari in a medium sauce pot over medium heat.  Simmer then add the salmon fillets.  Return to a simmer and cook the fillets until they are just done, approximately 6 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets.  Remove the salmon from the seasoned broth and allow to cool.  Brush the fillets with the 2 remaining tablespoons of light miso.  Store up to 4 hours. 
For the Tamari Melon Sauce:  Combine the melon juice and the tamari in a small sauce pot over medium-low heat.  Light foam will form on the top of the sauce once it begins to simmer.  Skim the foam and simmer two to four minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer. 
To assemble the dish, divide the melon salad onto the center of each of four chilled plates.  Plate a salmon fillet atop each salad.  Dress each fillet with some of the tamari melon sauce.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Set rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  In a food processor or the bowl of an electric mixer, thoroughly mix together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt.  On low speed, add the butter, then the egg and vanilla.  Process or beat until the dough is thoroughly blended and massed together. 
Drop rounded half teaspoons of batter onto a non-stick cookie sheet at 2-inch intervals.  With moistened fingers, round out the cookies and flatten them a little.  Bake for 8 minutes, turning once for even baking, until the cookies are set.  Cool on the pan on a rack. 
For the Vanilla Cream Filling:  Place the butter and shortening in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat until combined.  Gradually beat in the vanilla and confectioner's sugar at low speed until blended.  Increase the speed to high and continue beating for 2 to 3 minutes until fluffy. 
To assemble the cookies, place 1/2 of the cookies, top-side down on a flat surface.  Scrape the cream filling into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tip.  Pipe teaspoon-sized rosettes of the filling on the tops of the cookies.  Place the remaining cookies, top-side up on top of the filling and lightly press to form sandwiches. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Pico de Gallo -- (see below)
  6 1/2    tablespoons  pureed chipotle chiles in adobo sauce
  2        tablespoons  water
  30             large  shrimp - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, deveined
  1                cup  unsalted butter -- softened
                        === CORN CAKES ===
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  coarse cornmeal
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/4           cups  buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter -- cooled to
                        room temperature
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1                cup  fresh corn kernels - (2 small ears)
  2                     scallions -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     finely-chopped scallions -- for garnish
                        === PICE DE GALLO ===
  1         tablespoon  finely-diced onion
  1                cup  diced Roma tomatoes
  1                     serrano chile -- seeded, minced
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
  1           teaspoon  sugar -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  Mexican beer
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2                lime -- juiced

To prepare the Pico de Gallo, place the onion in a small strainer, rinse with hot water, and drain.  Transfer to a mixing bowl, add the remaining salsa ingredients, and mix well.  Let sit, refrigerated, for at least 30 minutes for the flavors to marry.  (Makes 1 cup) 
In a mixing bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the chipotle puree with the water.  Add the shrimp and toss to thoroughly coat.  Marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour in the refrigerator. 
In a small mixing bowl, stir together the 1 cup of softened butter with the remaining 4 1/2 tablespoons of chipotle puree; use more or less chipotle, to taste.  Set aside at room temperature. 
To prepare the Corn Cakes, thoroughly combine the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a mixing bowl.  In a separate large mixing bowl, whisk the buttermilk and melted butter together, then whisk in the egg.  Gradually add the combined dry ingredients, stirring continuously until thoroughly incorporated. 
In a food processor, puree 1/2 cup of the corn kernels and fold into the batter.  Then add the whole corn kernels and scallions, and mix together.  Add a little more buttermilk if the batter is too thick.  Set aside. 
To cook the shrimp, heat the 3 tablespoons of butter on a griddle or in a skillet.  Saute the shrimp for 3 to 5 minutes over medium heat, turning once.  Be careful not to overcook.  Keep warm. 
To cook the Corn Cakes, heat a nonstick pan over medium heat and ladle enough corn cake batter to make 3-inch cakes.  Cook until golden brown, about 2 1/2 minutes per side.  Repeat for the remaining cakes (there should be enough for 18 cakes). 
Place 3 warm Corn Cakes on each serving plate.  Place 5 shrimp on top of the cakes and spread the warm soft chipotle butter liberally over the shrimp.  Spoon the Pico de Gallo next to the Corn Cakes and garnish with the scallions. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  finely-diced onion
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  2          teaspoons  finely diced apple
     1/2                banana -- finely diced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  mayonnaise
  2          teaspoons  sour cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12            ounces  tuna steak
     1/2           cup  peeled seeded cucumber in 1/8" dice
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped chives
                        Juice of 1/2 small lemon
  8             dashes  hot sauce -- or to taste
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable oil
  1            package  plain pappadams - (1 1/4" dia)

Heat oil in small skillet over medium heat, add the onion, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the curry powder, apple, and banana, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes stirring continuously.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons water and cook for 4 minutes more, stirring.  Remove from the heat and set aside until cool.  (Make sure the curry sauce is cool before blending with the mayonnaise or it will separate.) 
Add the curry mixture, mayonnaise, sour cream, salt, and pepper to the bowl of a food processor and blend until smooth.  Add a little more water if the curry sauce is too thick.  Set aside. 
Cut the tuna into 1/4-inch dice and place into a very cold bowl.  Add the cucumber, 1 teaspoon of chives, 1/2 cup curry sauce, lemon juice, hot sauce and salt.  Adjust the seasoning to taste.  Cover and place into the refrigerator until ready to assemble.  This can all be done up to 3 hours in advance. 
Heat 1/2-inch of oil in a small skillet over medium heat.  When hot, add 2 or 3 pappadams at a time, turning them over when they start to curl.  Cook until bubbles appear, or they start to turn golden brown, about 20 seconds.  Do not allow them to get too dark or they will have a burnt flavor.  Remove and drain on a paper towel.  Keep them in a warm oven until ready to use up to 2 hours; this will dry them out and keep them crisp. 
Arrange 1 teaspoonful of the tuna tartare on each mini pappadam, and garnish with the remaining chopped chives. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

Season beef with salt and pepper.  Dip the top and bottom of the beef into the espresso.  Place the beef espresso-end down in super-hot cast-iron pan.  Sear all sides of the beef leaving the one espresso-crusted side unseared until your finished with the rest, then place the unseared side down in the pan and place into a 500 degree oven.  Cook until desired temperature, 2 minutes being rare and 8 being well done (times will vary).  Always let your meat rest for a few minutes after cooking.  It lets the juice set into the meat.

* Note:  You can substitute olive oil or a low-cholesterol vegetable oil.  The taste, while delicious, will not be authentically African-American. 
Wash the okra, cut it into 1/2-inch rounds, and place it in a small brown paper bag or plastic bag.  Add the cornmeal and salt and pepper and shake to coat the okra with the cornmeal and seasoning mixture.  Heat the bacon fat in a large, heavy skillet.  Drop in the okra pieces a few at a time and fry until golden brown, turning frequently so that they are browned on all sides.  Drain on paper towels and serve warm.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BLOSSOMS ===
  24                    zucchini blossoms
     1/2           cup  goat cheese
  1 1/2         quarts  olive oil
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  chilled seltzer water or ice water
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
                        === ZUCCHINI PESTO ===
  1             medium  zucchini - (abt 8 oz)
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts
  30                    basil leaves - (abt 3/4 cup
                        loosely packed)
     1/4      teaspoon  finely-chopped garlic
  6             ounces  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly cracked black pepper -- to taste

For the Blossoms:  Carefully stuff each zucchini blossom with 1 teaspoon of the goat cheese.  Fold over the petals to form an envelope.  In a deep skillet or deep fryer, heat the oil to 375 degrees.  Meanwhile put the flour in a mixing bowl.  Pour in the seltzer a little at a time, whisking constantly to ensure a smooth batter.  Season with salt and cayenne. 
When the oil is properly heated, dip a stuffed blossom into the batter to coat it evenly, scraping off any excess.  Fry until crisp and golden, about 30 seconds per side.  Remove to paper towels to drain.  Repeat process with all blossoms, being careful not to overcrowd the skillet and maintaining the proper oil temperature. 
For the Pesto:  Quarter zucchini and cut into 1-inch pieces.  Blanch zucchini for 2 minutes in salted boiling water, and then shock in ice bath to preserve color.  Drain well and pat dry with cloth.  Place blanched zucchini, Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, basil leaves, garlic, in food processor and start to puree.  With the motor running, pour the olive oil through the feed tube in a slow, steady stream until the pesto emulsifies.  Season with salt and pepper taste. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  fresh center-cut salmon - (to 3 1/2 lbs) -- cleaned, scaled
  1              bunch  dill
     1/4           cup  coarse kosher salt
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  crushed black peppercorns

Ask your fishmonger to fillet the salmon and remove the backbone and small pin bones. 
Place one fillet, skin-side down, in a deep glass, enamel, or stainless, baking dish.  Chop the dill and press into the flesh of the fish. 
In a separate bowl mix together salt, sugar, and crushed pepper.  Cover the fillet with this mixture.  Place the other fillet on top, skin-side up, and wrap in plastic, and then in aluminum foil.  Place a heavy platter on top of the fish with 4 cans on top, this makes it easy to distribute the weight.  Refrigerate for 48 hours, up to 3 days.  Turn the fish every 12 hours, basting in the natural juices that are released during the process.  Be sure to separate the fillets so all the flesh is basted. 
After the allotted time, remove the fish from the cure, wipe off the dill and salt mixture, pat dry with paper towels.  Slice the salmon, on the bias, very thinly, and serve with the accompaniment of your liking, such as mustard sauce with toast points. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lobster                         Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     live hard shell lobster - (1 3/4 lbs ea)
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  2                     shallots -- finely diced
     1/4           cup  bourbon or Cognac
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine - (to 3 tbspns)
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces,
                        and chilled
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh chervil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh chives
                        Kosher or sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the broiler or preheat the oven as hot as possible 500 to 550 degrees.  Position the oven rack in the upper third of the oven.  You may to shorten the cooking time slightly if the broiler rack is close to the heat. 
Quarter the lobsters, removing the tomalley and the roe if present.  Place the pieces of lobster, shell-side down, on a plate.  Place the tomalley and roe in a small bowl.  With a fork, break them into small pieces.  Cover. 
Place a heavy 12-inch saute pan over the highest heat possible.  Allow the pan to heat for 3 to 5 minutes until it becomes extremely hot.  Add the oil and heat until it forms a film on the surface of the pan.  Slide the lobster pieces, shell-side down, into the hot oil.  Using tongs, move the pieces in order to evenly sear all the shells.  Because the lobster pieces are not flat, you will need to hold them with the tongs and press the shells into the hot oil to accomplish this.  The claws need to be seared on only one side.  When the shells have all turned bright red, which should take no longer than 2 minutes, turn the pieces over.  The oil will also have taken on a beautiful red tinge.  Add the tomalley and roe into the pan. 
Place the pan in the oven.  If using the broiler, cook 2 minutes.  If using the oven, cook for 3 minutes.  The shells should be slightly browned, even a bit charred in places.  Remove the pan from the oven and return it to the stove at maximum heat.  Turn off the oven and put your plates in to warm.  This will take only a minute.  Warning:  The handle of the pan will be red hot and will stay hot until the dish is complete.  To avoid burns, wear oven mitts from now until the dish is complete. 
Add the shallots to the fat in the pan and stir.  Add the bourbon and ignite.  Shake the pan until the flames die down.  Add the wine and let liquids in the pan reduce until the pan is almost dry.  Turn the heat to low.  Quickly remove the pieces of lobster and place, shell-side down, on warm plates. 
Return the pan to the heat and add the butter, chervil, and chives.  Swirl or stir the butter into the pan to create a creamy sauce with the pan juices.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Use very little salt, if any, because the lobster adds its own salt.  Spoon the sauce over the lobster pieces and serve at once.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  soy oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onions -- small dice
     3/4           cup  chopped red, green and yellow peppers -- small dice
  3                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
     1/2    tablespoon  hot pepper sauce
  1         tablespoon  Vietnamese fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1 1/4         pounds  jumbo lump crabmeat from Maine
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped cleaned, stemmed dill
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped cleaned, stemmed chives
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped cleaned, stemmed parsley
     1/4                fresh bread loaf -- crust removed,
                        processed into crumbs
  1                cup  Japanese bread crumbs - Panko
                        Vegetable oil -- for sauteing

In a saucepan over medium heat, place the oil, onions, and peppers, and simmer until tender, about 7 minutes. 
Combine the 3 egg yolks, lime juice, mustard, hot pepper sauce, fish sauce, and white pepper in a large bowl. 
Remove the oil and vegetables from the heat.  Slowly pour into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly.  Begin by pouring with small splashes, incorporating the oil completely before adding more.  The heat of the oil will cook the yolks as you go, and you should end up with a hollandaise-like sauce when all the oil has been blended.  Return the bowl to the heat for 30 seconds, whisking constantly to insure that the sauce is fully incorporated. 
Set the sauce down over a bowl of ice and whisk to cool quickly.  Refrigerate the sauce, covered, until well-chilled. 
Pick over crabmeat to remove any shell pieces.  Add the herbs and gently toss, taking care not to break up the crab.  Add two or three heaping tablespoons of the chilled sauce to the crab and gently combine.  Add enough of the fresh breadcrumbs to bind the crab mixture.  Check to see that the mixture is moist (the breadcrumbs will absorb moisture as the crab mixture sits) and add more sauce or breadcrumbs as needed.  Add the white pepper and taste for seasoning. 
Spread Japanese breadcrumbs on a work surface and place ring mold on top.  Pat the crab into the mold and top with more Japanese breadcrumbs.  Tap down to secure crumbs.  Remove mold and set crab cakes aside.  Repeat until all crab is used. 
Heat 1/4 of the vegetable oil in a large saute pan over medium heat.  Sauteing in batches, brown the crab cakes on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.  Reserve on an ovenproof platter.  Place platter in a pre-heated 350 degree oven until heated through, about 5 minutes, and serve. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  2             ounces  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
  1              large  ripe mango -- peeled, pitted,

                        === TOFU WHIPPED CREAM ===
     1/2         pound  low fat firm silken tofu
  2        tablespoons  maple syrup -- or more to taste
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1              pinch  sea salt
  1         tablespoon  water or soy milk -- to blend
                        === FRIED PHYLO GARNISH ===
  2               cups  canola or any high-quality oil
  1            package  shredded phyllo dough (Greek name kataifi) -- thawed
                        (if shredded variety is unavailable
                        use sheets and julienne before use)

Fried phyllo garnish:  Heat 2 cups of oil in a saute pan (do not allow the oil to smoke).  Add small handfuls of shredded phyllo dough.  Fry on both sides until the phyllo is golden in color.  Remove from pan onto paper towels.  Brush with maple syrup.  Sprinkle with toasted almonds if desired. 
For presentation:  Loosen the ramekin containing the mango mousse with a knife and turn it out on the plate.  Top with a dollop of tofu whipped cream and drizzle kiwi kool-ee on the plate.  Serve with a cookie of fried phyllo dough.  Place diced mango and kiwi on the plate to accent the sauces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  salmon -- skin on
                        Zest of one lemon
                        Zest of one lime
                        Zest of one orange
  3        tablespoons  Citronge liqueur
  1           teaspoon  orange extract
  2               cups  brown sugar
  2               cups  kosher salt
     1/4           cup  coarsely-ground peppercorns

Place salmon on a sheet pan covered with plastic (skin-side down).  Finely chop the zest of the three fruits.  Sprinkle the zest on the salmon pushing it gently into the flesh.  Pour the liquor and orange extract over the salmon.

Put an additional sheet pan on top of the salmon and apply something that weighs about ten pounds.  Make sure the weight is distributed evenly and put in the refrigerator for 24 hours. 
Pull from the refrigerator wipe off the cure very well.  Slice on the bias and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALAD ===
  2                     yellow bell peppers
  2                     red bell peppers
  4             slices  white bread -- crusts removed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  6                     plum tomatoes
  1                     cucumber -- peeled
  1              small  red onion
  2        tablespoons  capers
  3                     anchovy fillets -- (optional)
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  chianti vinegar
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  chopped basil
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste

Roast the peppers on the stovetop burners, turning with tongs to char evenly on all sides.  When thoroughly blackened, close up in a paper bag so skins will steam loose.  When cool enough to handle, rub the skin off the peppers.  Cut out and discard the stems, seeds, and white veins.  Chop into 1/4-inch dice and set aside. 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut the bread into 1/4-inch dice.  Toss the bread cubes with the olive oil.  Toast in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, or golden brown.  Set aside. 
Cut the tomatoes, cucumber, and red onion into 1/4-inch dice.  In a large bowl, combine with the diced peppers, capers, and anchovies if desired. 
For the vinaigrette, start by mixing the Dijon mustard and chianti vinegar together and then slowly add the olive oil until well emulsified.  Add the chopped basil, and season with salt and pepper.  Add all the vinaigrette ingredients to the bowl and toss well to combine. 
Just before serving, add the croutons to the salad, toss well, and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === POACHED CHICKEN ROULADE ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2            bunches  spinach -- cleaned
  2              large  whole skinless chicken breasts
                        Cheesecloth -- dampened
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3             ounces  goat cheese
                        === DIJON MAYONNAISE ===
  4                     egg yolks
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  12            ounces  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === LEMON VINAIGRETTE ===
                        Juice of 1 lemon
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6               cups  bitter greens, including dandelion
                        and mezuna

In a medium-sized saute pan over medium heat, add the olive oil and the garlic, cook for 1 minute.  Be careful not to brown the garlic.  Add the spinach and saute until wilted.  Remove from the pan and set aside. 
Place the chicken breast between 2 sheets of plastic wrap 12 by 18 inches and with the back of a heavy skillet pound thin.  Remove the chicken from the plastic wrap and place 1 chicken breast at the near end of a damp piece of cheesecloth and scoop 1 1/2 ounces of goat cheese in the middle of the chicken breast in a cylindrical shape.  Squeeze the spinach lightly, to remove any excess moisture and cover the goat cheese with the spinach. 
Lift the ends of the cheesecloth closest to you and begin to roll the chicken completely wrapping the breast.  Twist the ends of the cheesecloth, tightly closing the roulade.  Wrap the chicken in plastic wrap and twist the ends to ensure a water tight seal.  In a large saucepot simmer the roulade for 10 minutes.  When completely cooked remove from the pot and set aside. 
For Dijon Mayonnaise:  In the bowl of a food processor add 4 egg yolks, 1 clove garlic minced, and 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard.  Pulse.  While the motor is running, slowly add the olive oil until all is well incorporated and emulsified.  Afterwards, remove from the bowl and set aside.  If not using immediately, refrigerate until needed. 
For Lemon Vinaigrette:  In medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the juice of 1 lemon, 1/2 cup olive oil, chopped chives and salt and pepper to taste.  Lightly toss the greens with the lemon vinaigrette and set aside. 
To serve this dish, unwrap the roulades and slice on the bias, or diagonal, arrange the sliced roulade around the plate resting on the bitter greens tossed with the lemon vinaigrette.  Drizzle the Dijon mayonnaise over the chicken and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sifted all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  double-acting baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4            cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped sage leaves
  5                     bacon slices -- cooked, crumbled
     3/4           cup  grated cheddar
                        Milk for brushing tops of biscuits

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  In a medium saute pan, over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp.  Drain over paper towels, and set aside. 
Over a large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt.  Slowly incorporate the heavy cream just until a wet dough has formed into a ball. 
On a lightly floured surface, gather the dough into a ball, and kneed it gently six times.  Roll out the dough to a 1/2-inch thick rectangle.  Sprinkle the dough with chopped sage, crumbled bacon, and grated cheddar cheese. 
Roll the biscuit dough up jellyroll style rolling from the longer end of the rectangle.  Using a sharp serrated knife, slice the biscuits into rounds and place in an ungreased round cake pan. 
Brush the tops of the biscuits with milk and bake for 15 minutes or until pale golden brown. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

                   Simple Slaw With Sweet Corn Dressing

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Michel Nishan, Heartbeat Restaurant, New York City
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  julienned jicama
  1                cup  finely-shredded Napa cabbage
     1/2           cup  julienned carrot
     1/4           cup  shelled English peas
     1/4           cup  fava beans
     1/2           cup  fresh corn kernels
  2                     frisee lettuce heads - (to 3)
                        === SWEET CORN DRESSING ===
  6                     sweet corn ears
     1/2                vanilla bean
  1        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice -- (to 2 tbspns)
  2          teaspoons  freshly-grated lemon zest
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh tarragon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine all salad ingredients together in a large bowl and toss well.  Drizzle salad with the sweet corn dressing. 
Sweet corn dressing:  Slice raw corn kernels away from the cobs.  Run the corn kernels through an electric vegetable juicer.  Strain the juice through a fine strainer.  This should yield about 2 cups of corn milk.  Place the corn milk and vanilla bean in a small saucepot over a low flame.  Stir constantly until the milk thickens to a sauce.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool.  Add the remaining ingredients.  If you like a tangier dressing, add more lemon juice. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                     green breadfruit

     1/4           cup  minced red bell pepper
     1/4           cup  minced green bell pepper
  2             sprigs  parsley -- minced
  1                     habanero chile -- seeded, minced,
                        or to taste [handle with care]
  1 1/2           cups  freshly-squeezed lime juice

Remove the breadfruit, drain it, and place it in a non-reactive bowl.  Mix all of the ingredients together.  Pour them over the breadfruit, cover and refrigerate for 3 to 5 hours or overnight so that the flavors marry.  Serve slightly chilled.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh tarragon
  1                cup  salad oil, such as safflower,
                        sunflower or peanut
     1/2         large  lemon -- juiced
  1         tablespoon  ice water
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste

Place a stainless steel mixing bowl on a damp cloth to keep the bowl from sliding around.  Add the egg yolk, mustard and tarragon to the bowl and whisk until blended.  Drizzle the oil into the bowl while whisking constantly.  Be sure that the mixture is smooth and well blended at all times.  Stop adding the oil periodically to allow yourself time to catch up; when there is no oil visible, continue adding and whisking. 
When half the oil is added, add 1 teaspoon of the lemon juice.  Alternate between the remaining oil and lemon juice, whisking all the while, until both are incorporated.  Whisk in the ice water.  (The water stabilizes the mayonnaise, which prevents separating, a common flaw of homemade mayonnaise.)  Season to taste with salt and pepper and cayenne.  Whisk.  Store in a small container, covered and refrigerated, until needed. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

     Steamed Mussels With Pasilla Pepper Cream, Shallots And Tarragon

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Starfire Contemporary Bistro, Hilton Head Island, SC
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Clams/Mussels                   Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     dried pasilla pepper -- seeded, stemed
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2    tablespoon  Spanish paprika
     1/2           cup  shallots -- cleaned, and
                        thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  clam juice
  2             pounds  mussels -- debearded, washed
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chives

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 
Place the pasilla pepper on a pie tin and toast in preheated 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes.  In a small saucepan, over medium heat, bring the cream to one short boil.  Lightly crumble the pasilla pepper and add to warm cream along with paprika.  Stir to combine, set aside to steep for about 20 minutes. 
Place the infused cream mixture into a blender and puree until smooth.  Strain the mixture through a fine strainer, discard the pepper pulp and reserve the pepper cream. 
In a large acid resistant pot with a tight fitting lid, combine the shallots, garlic, wine and clam juice.  Bring to a boil over high heat and reduce by half, about 10 minutes.  Add the mussels.  Cover the pot and cook over high heat until the mussels open, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Stir in the pasilla cream, tarragon and chives.  Serve in 4 individual bowls. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2       teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  light corn syrup
  2               cups  granulated sugar
     1/2         pound  roasted peanuts (no skins)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter -- softened

Grease a baking sheet with butter and set aside.  In a small bowl, mix the baking soda and salt together and set aside. 
In a large saucepan, combine corn syrup and sugar.  Cook mixture until it reads 255 degrees on a candy thermometer.  Add peanuts and stir.  Stir in baking soda and salt.  (Be careful!  Mixture will bubble up and is really hot!)  When mixture starts to settle, stir in vanilla and butter.  Pour mixture onto the prepared baking sheet and spread with a greased metal spatula.  Let cool to room temperature.  Crack the brittle into irregular chunks.  Store in an airtight container at room temperature. 
If using for sundaes, reserve some chunks of brittle for garnish.  Grind remaining brittle into coarse peanut praline by using the pulse button on your food processor.  You don't need to grind it very fine; some small chunks are good.  Alternate layers of vanilla ice cream, hot fudge and peanut praline.  Garnish with chunks of peanut brittle. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

                   The World Famous Maine Lobster Roll

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Jasper White, "Lobster at Home"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lobster                         Sandwiches
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              batch  Traditional Lobster Salad -- (see below)
  6                     New England-style hot dog buns
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
                        Pickles and potato chips
                        === TRADITIONAL LOBSTER SALAD ===
  1              pound  fully-cooked lobster meat
                        (or 5 lbs live lobsters)
  1             medium  cucumber -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely diced
     1/2           cup  Special Tarragon Mayonnaise -- (see recipe)
                        (or use prepared mayonnaise)
  3              small  scallions, white and most green -- thinly sliced
                        Kosher or sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

If using live lobsters, steam or boil them.  Let cool at room temperature.  Use a cleaver to crack and remove the meat from the claws, knuckles and tails.  Remove the cartilage from the claws and the intestine from the tails of the cooked meat.  Cut the meat into 1/2-inch dice.  You may pick all the meat from the carcass and freeze the carcass for soup or broth. 
Place the cucumber in a colander for at least 5 minutes to drain the excess liquid.  Combine the lobster, cucumber and mayonnaise.  If the salad is to be served within the hour, add the scallions.  If not, add them 30 minutes before serving with salt if needed and pepper.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes before serving. 
To assemble the roll, preheat a large heavy skillet over medium-low heat.  Lightly butter both sides of each bun.  Place in the pan and cook for about 2 minutes until golden brown.  Turn the buns over and toast the other side.  Or toast the buns under a broiler instead.  When they are ready, stuff them with the chilled lobster salad.  Place each roll on a small paper or china plate.  Garnish with pickles and potato chips.  Serve at once. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Fresh plum or vine ripened tomatoes
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground balck pepper -- to taste
                        Sugar
                        Tomato passata
                        Lemon juice
                        Worcestershire sace
                        Hot pepper sauce
                        Stale Italian bread, de-crusted and sliced
                        Minced garlic
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
  1        large bunch  fresh basil

Have enough tomatoes to overfill the mold you will use.  Dip into boiling water and peel them.  Chop roughly and sprinkle with good sea salt and black pepper plus a tiny bit of sugar. 
Pour some passata, a puree of tomatoes, into a large soup plate and season with lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce, and maybe a touch of hot pepper sauce.  Soak the bread slices briefly in this mixture and line your mold with them, leaving no cracks nor crannies. 
To the tomatoes add as much minced garlic as you fancy, plus a good measure of olive oil and lots of torn-up basil leaves.  Adjust the seasoning and pour the whole lot into the bread-lined mold.  Seal the top with more soaked bread.  Place a receptacle on top with weights (such as cans of food) and leave overnight in the refrigerator. 
Unmold onto a fine dish and surround with goodies -- quail eggs, olives, sweet peppers, capers or what you will.  A bowl of sour cream might be handed around with it, or good homemade mayonnaise. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

Turkey Meatloaf With Cranberry Glaze, Mixed Beans Almondine, And Potato Gratin

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Don Pintabona, Tribeca Grill, NYC
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatloaf
                Poultry                         Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRANBERRY GLAZE ===
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/2           cup  mashed cranberry sauce
                        === TURKEY MEATLOAF ===
  2             pounds  ground turkey
     3/4           cup  milk
     3/4           cup  bread crumbs
  3                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  diced red onions
     1/2           cup  chicken broth -- enough to moisten
                        === MIXED BEANS ALMONDINE ===
     1/2         pound  green beans
     1/2         pound  yellow wax beans
     1/4           cup  walnut oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  toasted slivered almonds
                        === POTATO GRATIN ===
  2              large  Idaho potatoes -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/8" thick
  2              large  sweet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/8" thick
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  roast garlic puree
     1/4      teaspoon  Freshly-ground white pepper
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1         tablespoon  chopped rosemary

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
For the glaze, spread the brown sugar over the bottom of a greased loaf pan and spread the cranberry sauce over the sugar. 
For the Meatloaf:  In a large bowl mix all the remaining ingredients until well incorporated.  Form the meat mixture into the loaf pan, laying out over the cranberry glaze. 
Bake in 350 degree oven for 1 hour, (be sure to assemble and cook the potato gratin along with the meatloaf, as they have the same cooking times).  Turn out the loaf and set aside. 
For the Mixed Beans Almondine:  Blanch beans in boiling, salted water for 1 minute and then shock in an ice water bath.  When ready for dinner, toss the beans with walnut oil, salt and pepper and slivered almonds and place on a baking sheet and place in the oven with the meatloaf for the last 10 minutes before the meatloaf comes out. 
For the Potato Gratin:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Season potatoes with salt and pepper and layer in buttered 2-inch deep baking pan.  Bring the rest of the ingredients to a boil and pour over the potatoes while hot, until potatoes are almost covered.  Bake at 400 degrees until tender, about one hour. 
To assemble the dish, slice the meatloaf into 1 1/2-inch thick slices, and plate with a nice square of the potato gratin, and the beans along side.  Serve everything warm.

For the glaze, spread the brown sugar over the bottom of a greased loaf pan and spread the cranberry sauce over the sugar.

For the Mixed Beans Almondine:  Blanch beans in boiling, salted water for 1 minute and then shock in an ice water bath.  When ready for dinner, toss the beans with walnut oil, salt and pepper and slivered almonds and place on a baking sheet and place in the oven with the meatloaf for the last 10 minutes before the meatloaf comes out.

For the Potato Gratin:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Season potatoes with salt and pepper and layer in buttered 2-inch deep baking pan.  Bring the rest of the ingredients to a boil and pour over the potatoes while hot, until potatoes are almost covered.  Bake at 400 degrees until tender, about one hour. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble the dish, slice the meatloaf into 1 1/2-inch thick slices, and plate with a nice square of the potato gratin, and the beans along side.  Serve everything warm.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     beefsteak tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  wood-aged red wine vinegar
  1              ounce  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              bunch  flat-leaf parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              bunch  chervil
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  18                    radishes
  6             ounces  Roquefort cheese

Blanch all tomatoes in salted water for 30 seconds and dunk in ice water, then remove skin off of tomatoes.  Remove interior juice and seeds from tomatoes and pour through a strainer into a bowl.  To make the vinaigrette mix fresh tomato juice, red wine vinegar, olive oil and seasonings then set aside. 
In a pot of salted boiling water, submerge parsley and remove; place in a blender, add seasonings and olive oil, blend for 5 to 7 minutes and strain for 30 minutes through a chinois.  Slice outside of tomato off making four slices and divide the rest of the tomato interior into four parts. 
Form the tomato into a three-inch ring, first with the interior of the tomato then the exterior of the tomato so it resembles the original tomato and place it into an oversized bowl.  Pour the vinaigrette equally into six bowls and garnish the tops of the tomatoes with thinly-sliced onions and chervil.  Garnish the tomato dish with radishes, chervil, herbed oil, and Roquefort cheese. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

     1/4         pound  bacon
  2               cups  dried cannellini beans -- soaked overnight,
                        and drained
  4               cups  chicken stock

  1              quart  cooked cannellini beans -- drained
