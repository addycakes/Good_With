  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ROMPOPE SYRUP ===
  1 1/2           cups  rompope
  1                cup  evaporated milk
  1                cup  sweetened condensed milk
  1                cup  whipping cream
                        === CAKE ===
  5              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  cake flour
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted, and
                        cooled to lukewarm
                        === FROSTING ===
  1 1/2           cups  chilled whipping cream
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1                     basket strawberries - (1 pint) -- halved
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- (optional)
  1                     basket strawberries - (1 pint) -- hulled, sliced

For Rompope Syrup:  Whisk all ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Pour half of liquid into heavy large saucepan.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium and boil gently until mixture is reduced to 1 1/4 cups, stirring frequently, about 17 minutes.  Whisk in remaining half of liquid.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Rewarm just until lukewarm before using.)

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour 8-inch-diameter cake pan with 2-inch-high sides.  Line bottom of pan with parchment paper; butter and flour parchment.  Whisk eggs and sugar to blend in large bowl.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water).  Using electric mixer, beat mixture constantly until thick, pale yellow, and tripled in volume, about 9 minutes.  Remove bowl from over water.  Continue to beat mixture until cool, about 6 minutes.  Sift flour over egg mixture in 3 additions, gently folding in each addition.  Transfer 1 cup batter to small bowl; fold in melted butter in 3 additions.  Gently fold into batter in large bowl, being careful not to deflate batter.  Transfer batter to prepared pan.

Bake cake until top is deep golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Cool cake in pan 10 minutes.  Turn cake out onto deep platter at least 2 inches larger than cake.  Remove parchment paper.  Using wooden skewer, pierce cake all over top, spacing piercings 1/2 inch apart and pressing skewer down to bottom of cake.

Gradually pour half of lukewarm rompope syrup over top of hot cake, spreading over cake with spatula and allowing rompope syrup to soak into cake before adding more.  Invert cake onto another large deep platter.  Pierce cake all over top, spacing piercings 1/2 inch apart and pressing skewer down to bottom of cake.  Gradually pour remaining rompope syrup over cake, spreading with spatula and allowing syrup to soak in before adding more.  Let cake stand at room temperature until cooled completely, about 2 hours, occasionally spooning up any rompope syrup that collects on bottom of platter and drizzling syrup over cake.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

For Frosting:  Using electric mixer, beat cream and sugar in large bowl until peaks form.  Spread frosting over cake.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Cover and chill.)  Garnish with halved berries and mint, if desired.  Serve with sliced berries.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  This special-occasion cake from the state of Sinaloa is spiked with rompope, a rich Mexican eggnog liqueur.  It is heated with the tres leches until the mixture is reduced to a syrup that is poured over the hot cake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     dried guajillo chiles -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and thinly sliced
  2                     dried ancho chiles -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick)
  3                     shallots -- chopped
  2              whole  chipotle chiles (from can) -- drained, stemmed,
                        seeded, and sliced
  1                cup  water
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  1                     beef tenderloin roast - (abt 3 lbs)
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley

Heat large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add guajillo and ancho chile slices.  Toast until fragrant and beginning to darken, stirring often, about 30 seconds.  Add butter, shallots, and chipotle chiles.  Stir just until chiles are coated with butter and shallots begin to soften, about 2 minutes.  Add 1 cup water and simmer until dried chiles are soft and all water has evaporated, about 15 minutes.  Mix in chives; season with salt.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Rewarm before using.)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Coat beef with 3 tablespoons oil, salt, and pepper, then parsley.  Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in large ovenproof skillet over high heat.  Add beef and sear until brown on all sides, about 6 minutes.  Transfer skillet with beef to oven.  Roast until meat thermometer inserted into center of roast registers 125 degrees for medium-rare, about 30 minutes.  Let beef stand 10 minutes.

Cut beef into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Spoon chile butter over and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Gaia, a beautifully restored house-turned-restaurant, located in one of the country's oldest cities, blends Mexican and Mediterranean cooking.  One of the best dining spots is upstairs overlooking the patio and garden.  If you get a chance, take a peek at the bottom of the pool.  Legend has it that the mosaic of the fertility goddess was created by Mexican artist Diego Rivera for Mario Moreno (known as Cantinflas), the famous Mexican actor who once lived in the home.

At Gaia, french fries sprinkled with cayenne pepper accompany the beef.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  3               cups  coarsely-chopped peeled raw beets - -- (from 1 1/2 lbs)
  2               cups  chopped red onions
  3                     celery stalks -- coarsely chopped
  1                cup  chopped red cabbage
  3        tablespoons  finely chopped seeded jalapeÒo chiles
  5               cups  low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
                        Tortilla chips
                        Sour cream

Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add beets, onions, celery, cabbage, and chiles; sautÈ until celery is soft, about 10 minutes.  Add 5 cups broth and lime juice; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover and simmer until vegetables are very tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes.

Working in small batches, puree soup in blender until smooth.  Return soup to pot; season to taste with salt and pepper.  Thin with more broth by 1/4 cupfuls, if desired.  Ladle soup into bowls and top with tortilla chips and sour cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Ana writes; "My great-grandmother, Josefina, was a highly regarded butcher, and she taught me the communal style of cooking that Mexico is known for.  That's one of the reasons I opened my own cooking school, La Villa Bonita ó to show others how authentic Mexican cuisine is prepared, as opposed to the usual tacos, burritos, and Tex-Mex dishes."

My husband, Robb, and I also run our own restaurant, Reposado.  He insisted that we open the place because he thought my recipes deserved a wider audience.  At the restaurant I like to experiment ó the menu at Reposado is nouvelle Mexican ó but at my cooking school I feature more traditional recipes.  Working at both places gives me the chance to show off both cooking styles.

When beets are cooked as they are in this recipe, they turn a bright fuchsia color.  Wear disposable plastic gloves when working with beets.  Puree only one or two cups of hot soup at a time, holding the top of the blender firmly to keep it from flying off.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  This cake is good sprinkled with powdered sugar or topped with vanilla frosting.

Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2             medium  red onions -- chopped
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- chopped
  1             medium  green bell pepper -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  4          teaspoons  ground cumin
  1            package  dried black beans - (16 oz)
  1         tablespoon  chopped canned chipotle chiles*
  7               cups  hot water
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2          teaspoons  coarse kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  plain nonfat yogurt
     1/2           cup  chopped seeded plum tomatoes
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro

* Chipotle chiles canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets and many supermarkets.

Heat olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and both bell peppers and sautÈ until beginning to brown, about 8 minutes.  Add garlic and cumin; stir 1 minute.  Transfer mixture to 6-quart slow cooker.  Add beans and chipotles, then 7 cups hot water.  Cover and cook on high until beans are very tender, about 6 hours.  Transfer 2 cups bean mixture to blender; puree until smooth.  Return puree to remaining soup in slow cooker.  Stir in lime juice, salt, and pepper.

Ladle soup into bowls.  Spoon dollop of yogurt into each bowl.  Sprinkle with tomatoes and cilantro and serve.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  Add richness to slow-cooker soups by using a mixture of half broth and half water instead of only water.

Comments:  A dollop of yogurt adds a creamy richness and cuts the heat of the chiles.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SYRUP ===
  4               cups  water
  4                     cones piloncillo* - (abt 14 oz) -- coarsely chopped
  1                     orange -- quartered
     1/2         large  lime
  3                     cinnamon sticks
  1         tablespoon  aniseed
                        === BU—UELOS ===
     3/4           cup  water
     3/4           cup  orange juice
  1              large  egg
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  lard -- melted, cooled
  1         tablespoon  dark rum
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  5               cups  all-purpose flour -- more or less
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

* Mexican raw sugar shaped into hard cones.  Smaller chunks are sometimes labled panocha.  If neither is available, substitute an equal weight of packed dark brown sugar.

For Syrup:  Combine all ingredients in heavy large saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until piloncillo cones dissolve, about 5 minutes.  Increase heat and boil until syrup thickens enough to coat spoon thinly, about 20 minutes.  Strain syrup into bowl.  (Syrup can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm before using.)

For BuÒuelos:  Combine 3/4 cup water, 3/4 cup juice, 1 egg, 3 tablespoons sugar, 3 tablespoons lard, 1 tablespoon rum, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in large bowl; whisk to blend well.  Gradually add 5 cups flour, stirring until soft, slightly sticky dough forms.  Add more flour by tablespoonfuls if dough is very sticky.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rest 1 hour.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface.  Divide dough in half.  Divide each half into 8 equal pieces.  Shape each piece into round ball.  Roll out each piece to 6-inch round.  Let dough rounds rest 15 minutes.

Pour enough vegetable oil into heavy large pot to reach depth of 1 inch.  Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 365 to 370 degrees.  Fry dough rounds, 2 at a time, until golden and puffed, turning rounds occasionally with tongs, about 2 minutes.  Transfer buÒuelos to paper towels to drain.  Arrange buÒuelos on platter.  Drizzle generously with warm syrup.  Serve, passing remaining syrup separately.

This recipe yields 16 buÒuelos.

Comments:  Founded in 1912 in the city's historic district, CafÈ Tacuba is a Mexico City institution.  The beautiful Talavera tiles that decorate the 19th-century colonial-style building are worth a visit in and of themselves.  The extensive menu offers a little something for everyone ó from huevos rancheros for breakfast to roast beef for dinner.  The popular buÒuelos (sweet fritters) are particularly delicious.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  4             slices  Italian bread, 1 1/2" thk -- crusts removed,
                        and each slice quartered
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme -- plus
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  5               cups  thinly-sliced kale - (packed)
                        = (about 1 large bunch)
  1                can  vegetable broth - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                can  diced tomatoes with green
                        pepper and onion in juice - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                can  cannellini - (15 oz) -- drained
                        = (white kidney beans)

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add bread and 1 teaspoon thyme; cook until bread is golden on both sides, turning with tongs, about 2 minutes total.  Transfer croutons to bowl; sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Add remaining 4 tablespoons oil, garlic, and crushed red pepper to same pot; sautÈ over medium heat 30 seconds.  Add kale and broth; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until kale wilts, about 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes with juice, beans, and remaining 1 tablespoon thyme.  Cover and simmer 15 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Ladle ragout into shallow bowls.  Top with croutons and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serve With:  Romaine salad with sliced oranges, black olives, and balsamic vinaigrette.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  To cut fresh kale easily, roll leaves into cylinders and slice crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide strips.

Comments:  The oversize croutons add a nice crunch to this warming dish, which is a cross between a soup and a stew.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
  1                cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  unsalted margarine - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  4              large  eggs
  2               cups  coarsely grated peeled carrots - (packed)
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour 12-cup Bundt pan.  Sift first 5 ingredients into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar and margarine in large bowl until well blended.  Beat in eggs.  Add sifted dry ingredients; beat until blended.  Stir in carrots.  Beat in lemon juice and lemon peel.  Transfer batter to prepared pan.

Bake carrot ring until tester inserted near center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.  Cool carrot ring in pan on rack 15 minutes.  Turn ring out onto platter and serve warm.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome and let stand at room temperature.  Rewarm in 350 degrees oven 10 minutes before serving.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Wolf Blitzer's family serves this moist, not-too-sweet Bundt cake as a side dish.  A warm slice would also be delicious for breakfast.  Use the large holes of a box grater to prepare the carrots.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN ===
  5               cups  water
  6                     chicken thighs with skin and bones
     1/4         large  white onion
  3                     garlic cloves -- halved
  3              large  fresh cilantro sprigs
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        === SAUCE ===
  1 2/3           cups  shelled pepitas (pumpkin seeds)
  6              whole  black peppercorns
  12            ounces  tomatillos -- husked, rinsed,
                        and coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped white onion
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  3             medium  serrano chiles -- chopped with seeds
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  6        tablespoons  corn oil

For Chicken:  Bring all ingredients to boil in large pot.  Reduce heat; simmer uncovered until chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes.  Transfer chicken to bowl; cover to keep warm.  Reserve chicken broth in pot; spoon off fat from surface.

Meanwhile, Begin Sauce:  Heat heavy large skillet over medium-low heat.  Add pepitas; stir frequently until seeds puff and begin to pop, about 15 minutes (do not brown).  Transfer to dish; cool.  Set aside 2 tablespoons pepitas for garnish.  Working in batches, finely grind remaining pepitas with peppercorns in spice mill or coffee grinder.

Puree tomatillos, next 5 ingredients, and 1/2 cup reserved chicken broth in blender until almost smooth.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add tomatillo mixture and simmer until sauce is thick and reduced to 1 cup, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.

Heat remaining 4 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add ground pepita mixture.  Stir constantly until mixture resembles very coarse paste and begins to color in spots, about 9 minutes.  Add tomatillo mixture; stir 1 minute.  Add 2 cups reserved chicken broth and bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce is thick, stirring constantly, about 3 minutes longer.  Season sauce to taste with salt.  Spoon some sauce onto platter.  Top with chicken.  Spoon remaining sauce over.  Garnish with reserved 2 tablespoons pepitas.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Serve With Classic Red Rice and tortillas.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  water
  6                     chicken thighs with skin and bones
  1              small  white onion -- quartered
  6                     garlic cloves -- halved
     3/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  3                     carrots -- peeled, diced
  3             medium  red-skinned potatoes
                        Ancho-Guajillo Chile Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  corn oil -- more or less
  12                    corn tortillas - (5" to 6" dia)
  1                cup  crumbled queso fresco
  1                cup  sliced white onion
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced radishes
  3                     pickled jalapeÒo chiles -- halved
  6        tablespoons  crema mexicana*
                        = (or sour cream)
  12                    romaine lettuce leaves

* Cultured Mexican cream with a slightly nutty flavor and consistency of thin sour cream.

Bring first 5 ingredients to boil in large pot.  Reduce heat; simmer gently until chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes.  Cool chicken in broth 30 minutes, then transfer chicken to bowl and cool completely (reserve broth for another use).

Cook carrots in pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer carrots to another bowl.  Add potatoes to same pot and boil until tender, about 35 minutes.  Drain.  Cool potatoes, then peel and cut into 3/4-inch cubes; add to bowl with carrots.

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Bring Ancho-Guajillo Chile Sauce to simmer in large saucepan.  Reduce heat to low and keep warm.

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium heat.  Place 1/2 cup warm chile sauce in medium bowl.  Dip chicken pieces into sauce to coat, allowing excess to drip back into bowl.  Add chicken pieces to skillet and fry until heated through, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer chicken to rimmed baking sheet and keep warm in oven.

Pour 1/4 cup oil into same skillet; heat over medium-high heat.  Add potatoes and carrots; sautÈ until heated through, about 6 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer potatoes and carrots to 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish.  Season with salt.  Keep warm in oven.

Heat 1/2 cup oil in same skillet over medium heat.  Quickly dip 1 tortilla into warm chile sauce to coat, then carefully slide tortilla into hot oil (mixture will splatter).  Cook 10 seconds per side.  Using tongs, transfer tortilla to baking sheet; fold tortilla in half.  Keep warm in oven.  Repeat.

Place 2 tortillas on each plate.  Top with some of warm chile sauce, then potatoes and carrots.  Sprinkle with cheese, sliced onion, radishes, and jalapeÒos; top with crema.  Arrange 2 lettuce leaves alongside.  Place chicken atop lettuce and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

       Chiles Stuffed With Eggs, Bacon With Chihuahua Cheese Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  whipping cream -- or more if needed
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-grated queso chihuahua*- (packed) -- abt 6 oz
  6              large  fresh poblano chiles - (abt 4 oz ea)
  12            ounces  bacon slices -- coarsely chopped
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
  16             large  eggs -- beaten to blend
  2                     dried guajillo chiles -- seeded, and
                        sliced very thinly into strips
                        Fresh cilantro sprigs
                        Corn tortilla chips
                        Sliced tomatoes

* Melting cheese available in balls, braids, or rounds.  Sometimes labeled queso asadero or queso oaxaca.  Substitute mozzarella or Monterey Jack.

Bring 1 1/2 cups cream to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat; whisk in cheese.  Boil sauce until reduced to 1 cup, whisking occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.  Before serving, rewarm over low heat, and thin with cream by tablespoonfuls if desired.)

Char poblano chiles over gas flame or in broiler until blackened.  Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes.  Peel chiles, leaving stem intact.  Cut 1 slit lengthwise down side of each chile; carefully remove seeds.

Cook bacon in large skillet over medium-high heat until brown and crisp.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain.  Pour off drippings from skillet.  Add butter to same skillet and melt over medium heat.  Add eggs and stir gently until softly set, about 4 minutes.  Mix in bacon.  Season eggs with salt and pepper.

Spoon eggs into roasted chiles through slit.  Arrange 1 stuffed chile on each plate.  Spoon warm cheese sauce over.  Garnish with guajillo chile strips, cilantro, tortilla chips, and tomatoes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Translated, Las Ventanas al ParaÌso means "Windows to Paradise."  With an ocean view from nearly every room, four infinity pools that seem to stretch to the sea, and a personal escort to your room (no front desk), the name is no exaggeration.  The peacefulness is a sharp contrast to the bustle of Los Cabos, just outside the property's doors.  If you can bear to venture outside your beautiful room, try the resort's two restaurants ó the Sea Grill, where you'll find contemporary Mexican offerings like this breakfast version of chiles rellenos, and The Restaurant, which uses local ingredients to create delicious Mediterranean-inspired dishes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TORTES ===
  4             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
     3/4           cup  sliced almonds -- toasted
  12                    amaretti cookies - (1 1/2" dia)*
                        = (Italian macaroons, abt 2.6 oz total)
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3              large  eggs
                        === TOPPING ===
     3/4           cup  chilled whipping cream
  1 1/2      teaspoons  powdered sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  2                     amaretti cookies -- crumbled

* Amaretti cookies are available in two sizes.  The larger ones (used in this recipe) are bundled in pairs in colorful wrappers, while slightly smaller ones are packaged and unwrapped in sealed plastic bags.  If using the smaller cookies, measure by weight (2.6 ounces total), not count.

For Tortes:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter four 3/4-cup custard cups or soufflÈ dishes.  Dust with flour; tap out excess.  Line bottom of cups with parchment paper rounds.  Place on rimmed baking sheet.

Stir chocolate in top of double boiler set over simmering water until melted and smooth.  Using on/off turns, blend almonds, amaretti, cinnamon, and salt in processor until finely ground.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Add butter, sugar, and eggs to processor; mix until blended and smooth, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, about 3 minutes.  Add cookie mixture and melted chocolate.  Using on/off turns, process just until blended.

Divide batter among custard cups.  Bake until tops of tortes are dry and puffed and tester inserted into centers comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 30 minutes.  Transfer cups to rack; cool 15 minutes.  Run small knife around edges of cups to release tortes.  Turn tortes out onto rack and turn right side up; cool.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Wrap in plastic and store at room temperature.)

For Topping:  Beat together cream, sugar, and almond extract in medium bowl until cream holds peaks. (Can be made 4 hours ahead; refrigerate.)

Place 1 torte on each of 4 plates.  Top with dollop of whipped cream, sprinkle with crumbled amaretti, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 tortes.

* Amaretti cookies are available in two sizes.  The larger ones (used in this recipe) are bundled in pairs in colorful wrappers, while slightly smaller ones are packaged and unwrapped in sealed plastic bags.  If using the smaller cookies, measure by weight (2.6 ounces total), not count.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Tortes:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter four 3/4-cup custard cups or soufflÈ dishes.  Dust with flour; tap out excess.  Line bottom of cups with parchment paper rounds.  Place on rimmed baking sheet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir chocolate in top of double boiler set over simmering water until melted and smooth.  Using on/off turns, blend almonds, amaretti, cinnamon, and salt in processor until finely ground.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Add butter, sugar, and eggs to processor; mix until blended and smooth, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, about 3 minutes.  Add cookie mixture and melted chocolate.  Using on/off turns, process just until blended.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide batter among custard cups.  Bake until tops of tortes are dry and puffed and tester inserted into centers comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 30 minutes.  Transfer cups to rack; cool 15 minutes.  Run small knife around edges of cups to release tortes.  Turn tortes out onto rack and turn right side up; cool.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Wrap in plastic and store at room temperature.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Topping:  Beat together cream, sugar, and almond extract in medium bowl until cream holds peaks. (Can be made 4 hours ahead; refrigerate.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 1 torte on each of 4 plates.  Top with dollop of whipped cream, sprinkle with crumbled amaretti, and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 tortes.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  chopped walnuts
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sweetened flaked coconut -- lightly toasted
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  6             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped
  2               cups  semisweet chocolate chips - (abt 12 oz) -- divided
  4          teaspoons  instant coffee crystals
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  4              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  peanut butter chips

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with aluminum foil or parchment paper.  Combine chopped walnuts, flour, toasted coconut, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl and stir until well blended.

Combine butter, chopped unsweetened chocolate, and 1 cup chocolate chips in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over low heat until butter and chocolate are melted and smooth.  Remove saucepan from heat.

Whisk instant coffee crystals and vanilla extract in medium bowl until coffee crystals dissolve.  Add sugar and eggs.  Using electric mixer, beat until mixture thickens, about 2 minutes.  Beat in melted chocolate mixture, then chopped walnut mixture.  Stir in remaining 1 cup chocolate chips and peanut butter chips.  Mound 2 tablespoons dough for each cookie onto prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.

Bake cookies until puffed and cracked but still soft in center, about 15 minutes.  Let cookies cool on sheets 10 minutes.  Using spatula, transfer cookies to rack and cool.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 28 cookies.

Comments:  Marty writes; "Even though I am a professional chef ó at the Valley Brook Golf Club in New Jersey ó when I cook at home I make dishes that are good but fast.  I took two years to perfect the recipe for my chewy chocolate cookies.  They're so good that they are now a signature item on the club's menu."

Butterscotch chips could easily stand in for the peanut butter chips.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CINNAMON SUGAR ===
  1                cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
                        === CHURRO BATTER ===
  1                cup  whole milk
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  4              large  eggs
  3               cups  canola oil -- for frying
                        Spiced Hot Chocolate -- (see recipe)

For Cinnamon Sugar:  Whisk all ingredients in medium bowl to blend.

For Churro Batter:  Bring first 4 ingredients to boil in heavy medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves and butter melts.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Add flour; stir vigorously with wooden spoon until shiny dough mass forms, about 1 minute.  Transfer to large bowl; cool 5 minutes.

Using electric mixer, beat in eggs, 1 at a time; continue beating until smooth, shiny, sticky paste forms.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Cover and let stand at room temperature.)

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat to 350 degrees.  Working in batches, spoon batter into pastry bag fitted with large star tip.  Pipe batter into hot oil in 3 1/2- to 4-inch-long ribbons (use knife if necessary to cut batter at end of star tip) and allow batter to slide into oil.  Fry churros until brown and cooked through in center, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer to paper towels.  Cool 5 minutes, then toss in cinnamon sugar to coat.  Serve warm with Spiced Hot Chocolate.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  peeled whole tomatoes in juice - -- (14 1/2 oz), drained
  3        tablespoons  chopped white onion
  2              small  garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/4           cup  corn oil
  1                cup  medium-grain white rice
  1                cup  hot water
  1             medium  carrot -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/3" pieces
     1/3           cup  shelled fresh peas or frozen
     1/3           cup  fresh corn kernels or frozen
  6                     fresh cilantro sprigs -- tied together with
                        kitchen twine
  2                     serrano chiles - (to 3) -- halved lengthwise
  1           teaspoon  salt

Puree tomatoes, onion, and garlic in blender until smooth.

Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add rice; stir until rice is pale golden, about 1 minute.  Stir in tomato puree, then 1 cup hot water, carrot, peas, corn, cilantro sprigs, chiles, and salt.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until almost all liquid is absorbed, about 12 minutes.

Uncover and cook until rice is tender and all liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes longer.  Remove from heat, cover, and let stand 5 minutes.  Discard cilantro and chiles.  Fluff rice with fork.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  In Mexico, this popular rice dish is usually made with vine-ripened tomatoes.  For best results, use good-quality canned tomatoes or, in the summer, shop for tomatoes at a farmers' market if you don't grow your own.  Simple grilled meats or tomato-sauced main dishes pair perfectly with red rice.

Comments:  In Mexico, this popular rice dish is usually made with vine-ripened tomatoes.  For best results, use good-quality canned tomatoes or, in the summer, shop for tomatoes at a farmers&apos; market if you don&apos;t grow your own.  Simple grilled meats or tomato-sauced main dishes pair perfectly with red rice.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unsweetened shredded coconut* - (abt 3 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  unsalted butter - (3 sticks) -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/4      teaspoons  coarse kosher salt

  2 2/3           cups  all-purpose flour

* Available at natural foods stores and some supermarkets.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Spread coconut on rimmed baking sheet.  Bake until coconut is light golden, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Cool completely.

Using electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in large bowl until well blended.  Mix in salt and vanilla.  Beat in flour in 2 additions.  Stir in toasted coconut.  Gather dough together; divide in half.  Flatten each half into disk; wrap each in plastic and chill at least 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Keep chilled.  Soften slightly at room temperature before rolling out.)

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.  Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured work surface to scant 1/4-inch thickness.  Using 1 3/4- to 2-inch-diameter cookie cutters, cut dough into rounds.  Transfer cookies to prepared baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart.  Gather dough scraps and reroll; cut out additional cookies.  Repeat procedure with remaining dough disk until all of dough is used.

Bake cookies until light golden, about 20 minutes.  Cool on baking sheets 10 minutes.  Transfer cookies to racks and cool completely.  (Can be made ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature up to 1 week.)

This recipe yields about 6 1/2 dozen cookies.

Comments:  This recipe yields enough cookies to make the crust for the Tropical Cheesecake and the crumbs and garnish for the Banana-Cream Parfaits (see recipes).

  2               cups  freshly-ground corn masa dough for
                        tortillas (abt 17 oz)
                        = (or make masa dough with 1 3/4 cups masa
                        harina [corn tortilla mix; abt 8 1/2 oz]
                        mixed with 1 cup plus 2 tbspns warm water)
                        Warm water -- as needed

Place fresh masa or masa harina mixture in large bowl.  Add warm water to dough by tablespoonfuls as needed, kneading until dough is soft, smooth, and pliable but not sticky.  Shape 3 tablespoons dough into ball for each tortilla and arrange on sheet of foil; cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying.

Place 1 large griddle or skillet over medium-low heat; place second large griddle or skillet over medium-high heat.  Cut two 8-inch rounds from 1 heavy-duty resealable plastic bag.  Place 1 plastic round on bottom half of tortilla press; place 1 dough ball in center.  Top with second plastic round.  Close press, flattening dough to 5-inch round (about 1/8 inch thick).  If tortilla thickness is uneven, lift dough round in plastic and rotate 180 degrees.  Press tortilla lightly to even out.

Peel off top sheet of plastic.  Use bottom plastic round to transfer tortilla to 1 hand with part of tortilla dangling off; peel off plastic round.  Hold hand with tortilla over cooler griddle.  Let dangling portion of tortilla catch at front half of griddle and slowly sweep hand backward, easing tortilla onto griddle without wrinkling.  Cook tortilla until it looks slightly dry at edges and starts to release from griddle surface, about 45 seconds.  Lift tortilla with fingers and place, uncooked side down, on hotter griddle.  Cook until brown spots appear on bottom, about 1 minute.  On same griddle, turn tortilla over again.  Cook until bottom browns and parts of tortilla puff up, about 1 minute longer.  Transfer tortilla to cloth-lined basket and cover with cloth or wrap tortilla in large sheet of foil and keep warm in 250 degrees oven.  Repeat with remaining dough balls, adding tortillas to basket or foil packet.  (Tortillas can be made 2 hours ahead.  Wrap in aluminum foil.  Rewarm in 300 degrees oven 15 minutes.)

This recipe yields 12 tortillas.

Comments:  Packaged tortillas are available everywhere, but homemade ones have better flavor and a more tender texture.

Comments:  Juana writes; "Growing up in Cuernavaca, just outside Mexico City, I remember my grandmother cooking elaborate Mexican meals every day.  My mother continued that tradition, but not in such an all-consuming manner.  For her it was a great joy to plan a menu and then invite people to help with the preparation.

"The women in my life taught me the beauty of a good meal.  I still use many of their recipes today, but unlike my grandmother I don't spend an entire day in the kitchen.  Fortunately, my husband and kids like to cook, so I've found a balance between my grandmother's time-intensive recipes and my mother's practicality. "

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CREPES ===
  2 1/2           cups  whole milk
  5              large  eggs
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted, and
                        cooled slightly
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Additional melted butter -- for frying
                        === SAUCE ===
  3               cups  cajeta
     3/4           cup  whole milk
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  Cognac or brandy
  2               cups  pecans -- toasted, chopped

For Crepes:  Combine first 6 ingredients in blender and blend until smooth.  Let stand 1 hour at room temperature.  Blend again before using.

Brush 8- to 9-inch-diameter nonstick skillet lightly with melted butter.  Heat over medium-high heat.  Pour scant 1/4 cupful batter into skillet, tilting to allow batter to coat bottom of skillet.  Cook until crepe is golden on bottom, about 1 minute.  Turn crepe over and cook until brown on bottom, about 45 seconds.  Transfer to paper towel.  Repeat with remaining batter, making about 24 crepes and stacking crepes between paper towels.  Cool.

For Sauce:  Combine cajeta, milk, and butter in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until sauce is reduced to 2 3/4 cups, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in Cognac.

Place 1 crepe on work surface.  Spread with 1 tablespoon sauce.  Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon chopped pecans.  Fold crepe in half over filling, then in half again, forming triangle.  Repeat with remaining crepes, sauce, and pecans.  Arrange crepes in two 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dishes.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill crepes and remaining sauce separately.  Rewarm sauce just until pourable before continuing.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Pour remaining sauce over crepes.  Bake until heated through, about 15 minutes.  Sprinkle with any remaining pecans and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Cajeta (or dulce de leche, as it is known in other Latin American countries) is a thick caramel sauce traditionally made with goat's milk, though cow's milk is also commonly used.  If you can't find cajeta, you can substitute dulce de leche, now available in many supermarkets (look for it next to the ice cream sauces).  Cajeta is sold at Mexican and Latin American markets.

For Crepes:  Combine first 6 ingredients in blender and blend until smooth.  Let stand 1 hour at room temperature.  Blend again before using.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush 8- to 9-inch-diameter nonstick skillet lightly with melted butter.  Heat over medium-high heat.  Pour scant 1/4 cupful batter into skillet, tilting to allow batter to coat bottom of skillet.  Cook until crepe is golden on bottom, about 1 minute.  Turn crepe over and cook until brown on bottom, about 45 seconds.  Transfer to paper towel.  Repeat with remaining batter, making about 24 crepes and stacking crepes between paper towels.  Cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Sauce:  Combine cajeta, milk, and butter in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until sauce is reduced to 2 3/4 cups, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in Cognac.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 1 crepe on work surface.  Spread with 1 tablespoon sauce.  Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon chopped pecans.  Fold crepe in half over filling, then in half again, forming triangle.  Repeat with remaining crepes, sauce, and pecans.  Arrange crepes in two 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dishes.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill crepes and remaining sauce separately.  Rewarm sauce just until pourable before continuing.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Pour remaining sauce over crepes.  Bake until heated through, about 15 minutes.  Sprinkle with any remaining pecans and serve.

Comments:  Cajeta (or dulce de leche, as it is known in other Latin American countries) is a thick caramel sauce traditionally made with goat&apos;s milk, though cow&apos;s milk is also commonly used.  If you can&apos;t find cajeta, you can substitute dulce de leche, now available in many supermarkets (look for it next to the ice cream sauces).  Cajeta is sold at Mexican and Latin American markets.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PICADILLO ===
  1              pound  boneless country-style pork ribs -- cut into 1" cubes
  1                can  whole tomatoes in juice - -- (14 1/2 to 16 oz)
  2                     canned chipotle chiles -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     2/3           cup  chopped white onion
  1              large  garlic clove -- chopped
     1/4           cup  raisins
  2          teaspoons  apple cider vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        === DOUGH SHELLS ===
  2 1/2           cups  freshly-ground corn masa dough for
                        tortillas - (abt 26 oz)
                        = (or make masa dough with 2 1/4 cups
                        masa harina [corn tortilla mix; abt 9 oz]
                        mixed with 1 1/2 cups warm water)
  2        tablespoons  lard or solid vegetable shortening
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Warm water -- (optional)
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
     1/4           cup  slivered almonds -- toasted

For Picadillo:  Place pork in heavy medium saucepan.  Add pinch of salt and enough cold water to cover by 1/2 inch.  Bring to simmer over medium heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently, uncovered, until meat is tender, about 1 hour 10 minutes.  Cool meat in broth.  Using slotted spoon, transfer meat to work surface; discard broth.  Shred meat coarsely into large bowl.

Place tomatoes with juices and chiles into blender and puree.  Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ 3 minutes.  Add garlic and sautÈ 1 minute.  Add pork and sautÈ until browned, about 10 minutes.  Mix in raisins, vinegar, pepper, and cinnamon, then tomato puree.  Simmer until picadillo is thick, stirring often, about 6 minutes.  Season to taste with salt.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Rewarm over low heat before using.)

For Dough Shells:  Combine fresh masa or masa harina mixture, lard, flour, baking powder, and salt in large bowl.  Knead well, adding more warm water by tablespoonfuls as needed until dough is soft, smooth, and pliable but not sticky.  Divide dough into 12 equal pieces; shape into balls.  Place on sheet of foil.  Cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying.

Flatten balls with moistened fingertips to 2 1/2- by 3/4-inch disks.  Heat heavy large griddle or skillet over medium-high heat.  Place 3 disks on griddle.  Cook until outsides are light brown but insides are still soft and uncooked, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer disks to baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining disks.

Using greased knife, cut each disk horizontally in half; turn so uncooked sides are up.  Using fingertips, flatten uncooked center of each and pinch edge of soft dough between fingertips to form 1/4- to 3/8-inch-high rim.

Pour enough oil into large skillet to reach depth of 1/2 inch.  Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 350 to 360 degrees.  Fry 4 dough shells at a time until lightly browned and crunchy outside but still tender inside, about 1 minute.  Using slotted spoon, transfer shells to paper towels to drain.  Spoon warm filling into each shell.  Sprinkle with almonds and serve.

This recipe yields about 24 boats.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  cold water
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  oriental sesame oil
  2               cups  mung bean sprouts
  8             ounces  dried Chinese egg noodles*
  4        tablespoons  peanut oil -- divided
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2              large  green onions -- white and pale
                        green parts minced, tops cut 1" pieces
  2             medium  carrots -- cut into
                        matchstick-size strips
  4             ounces  snow peas -- cut on diagonal
                        into matchstick-size strips
  6             ounces  Chinese barbecued pork -- cut into
                        matchstick-size strips

* Thin, spaghetti-like noodles, available at Asian markets and in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets.

Stir cornstarch and 1 tablespoon cold water in small bowl to blend.  Mix in soy sauce, sugar, and sesame oil.

Blanch bean sprouts in large pot of boiling salted water 10 seconds.  Using large slotted skimmer or sieve, transfer sprouts to colander.  Rinse under cold water to cool quickly.  Add noodles to same pot of boiling water and cook until just tender but still firm to bite, about 5 minutes.  Drain well; rinse with cold water and drain again, tossing to release as much water as possible.

Heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil in heavy large wok or skillet over medium-high heat.  Add ginger, garlic, and minced green onions.  SautÈ 1 minute.  Add carrots, snow peas, and pork.  Stir-fry until carrots are just crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.  Mix in bean sprouts, noodles, and green onion tops.  Stir-fry 1 minute.  Stir cornstarch mixture to reblend and add to wok.  Cook until sauce thickens, stirring often, about 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer noodle mixture to large bowl and cool.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add noodle mixture.  Cook until bottom of noodle cake is brown and crusty, occasionally pressing to compact and shaking pan to prevent sticking, about 5 minutes.  Turn cake out onto rimless baking sheet, browned-side up.  Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet and heat.  Slide noodle cake back into skillet, browned-side up.  Cook until bottom is brown and crusty, about 6 minutes.  Slide noodle cake out onto platter.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 8 first-course or 4 main-course servings.

Market Tip:  Chinese barbecued pork is often available at the Chinese take-out section of some supermarkets.  It is also sold by the pound at Chinese restaurants.

Comments:  Mung bean sprouts, commonly known simply as bean sprouts, are available in the produce section of most supermarkets.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  boneless country-style pork ribs
  2               cups  water -- or more if needed
  1 1/2           cups  fresh orange juice
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  2          teaspoons  fine sea salt
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
     1/4           cup  brandy
                        Warm corn tortillas
                        Avocado Salsa -- (see recipe)
                        Fresh tomato salsa

Cut pork pieces crosswise into thirds.  Cut off any big chunks of fat from pork and reserve; leave small pieces of fat attached to pork.  Combine pork, reserved fat, 2 cups water, and next 4 ingredients in deep 12-inch skillet.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until pork is tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour 45 minutes, adding more water by 1/4 cupfuls if necessary to keep pork partially submerged.

Uncover; boil pork mixture until liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes.  Stir in brandy; boil until liquid evaporates and meat browns and begins to get crisp, stirring often, about 15 minutes.  Cool meat slightly.  Discard any loose pieces of fat.  Tear meat into strips; return to skillet.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Add 2 tablespoons water to skillet.  Cover and rewarm pork over medium-low heat, stirring, about 5 minutes.  Season with more salt, if desired.  Transfer to bowl.  Serve with warm tortillas, Avocado Salsa, and tomato salsa.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  In Uruapan and other parts of Michoac·n, large copper cauldrons made in Santa Clara del Cobre are used to fry delicious carnitas in pork lard.  This recipe has been adapted for the home cook: Meaty pork ribs are boiled, then fried in their own fat until browned.  Use either purchased fresh tomato salsa or Tomato, Onion, And Serrano Chile Salsa (see recipe).  Accompany the carnitas with Classic Red Rice (see recipe) and beans.

Cut pork pieces crosswise into thirds.  Cut off any big chunks of fat from pork and reserve; leave small pieces of fat attached to pork.  Combine pork, reserved fat, 2 cups water, and next 4 ingredients in deep 12-inch skillet.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until pork is tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour 45 minutes, adding more water by 1/4 cupfuls if necessary to keep pork partially submerged.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Uncover; boil pork mixture until liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes.  Stir in brandy; boil until liquid evaporates and meat browns and begins to get crisp, stirring often, about 15 minutes.  Cool meat slightly.  Discard any loose pieces of fat.  Tear meat into strips; return to skillet.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add 2 tablespoons water to skillet.  Cover and rewarm pork over medium-low heat, stirring, about 5 minutes.  Season with more salt, if desired.  Transfer to bowl.  Serve with warm tortillas, Avocado Salsa, and tomato salsa.

Comments:  In Uruapan and other parts of Michoac·n, large copper cauldrons made in Santa Clara del Cobre are used to fry delicious carnitas in pork lard.  This recipe has been adapted for the home cook: Meaty pork ribs are boiled, then fried in their own fat until browned.  Use either purchased fresh tomato salsa or Tomato, Onion, And Serrano Chile Salsa (see recipe).  Accompany the carnitas with Classic Red Rice (see recipe) and beans.

Although this sandwich tastes great with a croissant, any bread can be used.

                        oz] mixed with 1 cup plus 2 tbspns warm
                        water)
  2        tablespoons  lard or solid vegetable shortening
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Warm water -- as needed
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

For Filling:  Puree tomatoes in blender.  Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until beginning to brown, about 6 minutes.  Add garlic and sautÈ 30 seconds.  Mix in olives, chiles, and dried herbs, then tomato puree.  Reduce heat to medium.  Simmer until most liquid is absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Using plastic as aid, fold dough over filling, peel back plastic, and seal edges.  Flip turnover onto hand; peel off bottom plastic.  Place turnover on foil-lined sheet.  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.

Pour enough oil into large skillet to reach depth of 3/4 inch.  Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 375 degrees.  Fry 3 turnovers at a time until deep golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer to paper towels to drain.  Arrange turnovers on platter and serve.

  8             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  7        tablespoons  water -- or more if needed
  1 1/2           cups  unsalted butter - (3 sticks) -- room temperature
  4               cups  powdered sugar -- divided
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel

                        Chocolate curls -- for garnish

* Dried lavender blossoms are available at natural foods stores and at some specialty foods stores and farmers' markets.

For Cake:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Butter and flour two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line bottoms of pans with parchment paper rounds.  Stir chocolate in top of double boiler set over simmering water until smooth.  Remove from over water.  Cool to barely lukewarm.

Sift flour and next 4 ingredients into medium bowl.  Whisk milk and yogurt to blend in small bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat brown sugar, butter, and lavender in large bowl until smooth.  Beat in eggs, 1 at a time.  Beat in melted chocolate until smooth.  Mix in dry ingredients alternately with milk mixture in 3 additions each.  Divide batter between prepared pans.

Bake cakes until tester inserted into centers comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 15 minutes.  Turn cakes out onto racks; remove parchment and cool completely.

For Buttercream Frosting:  Stir 8 ounces chocolate in top of double boiler set over simmering water until smooth.  Cool until barely lukewarm but still pourable.  Mix cocoa powder and 7 tablespoons water in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until smooth and thick but still pourable, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if necessary.  Cool.

Beat butter, 1/3 cup powdered sugar, and orange peel in large bowl to blend.  Add melted chocolate, vanilla, and salt; beat until smooth.  Beat in cocoa mixture.  Gradually add remaining 3 2/3 cups powdered sugar and beat until frosting is smooth.  Mix in Grand Marnier.

Place 1 cake layer on platter.  Spread 1 1/2 cups frosting over top of cake.  Top with second cake layer.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake, swirling decoratively.  Mound chocolate curls in center of cake.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome and refrigerate.  Let cake stand at room temperature 2 hours before serving.)

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  A subtle hint of lavender accents this lovely dessert.  It can also be left out if you prefer.

For Cake:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Butter and flour two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line bottoms of pans with parchment paper rounds.  Stir chocolate in top of double boiler set over simmering water until smooth.  Remove from over water.  Cool to barely lukewarm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sift flour and next 4 ingredients into medium bowl.  Whisk milk and yogurt to blend in small bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat brown sugar, butter, and lavender in large bowl until smooth.  Beat in eggs, 1 at a time.  Beat in melted chocolate until smooth.  Mix in dry ingredients alternately with milk mixture in 3 additions each.  Divide batter between prepared pans.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake cakes until tester inserted into centers comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 15 minutes.  Turn cakes out onto racks; remove parchment and cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Buttercream Frosting:  Stir 8 ounces chocolate in top of double boiler set over simmering water until smooth.  Cool until barely lukewarm but still pourable.  Mix cocoa powder and 7 tablespoons water in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until smooth and thick but still pourable, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if necessary.  Cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat butter, 1/3 cup powdered sugar, and orange peel in large bowl to blend.  Add melted chocolate, vanilla, and salt; beat until smooth.  Beat in cocoa mixture.  Gradually add remaining 3 2/3 cups powdered sugar and beat until frosting is smooth.  Mix in Grand Marnier.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 1 cake layer on platter.  Spread 1 1/2 cups frosting over top of cake.  Top with second cake layer.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake, swirling decoratively.  Mound chocolate curls in center of cake.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome and refrigerate.  Let cake stand at room temperature 2 hours before serving.)

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Fish (Ocean)
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRAVLAX ===
  1           teaspoon  whole white peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  coriander seeds
  2        tablespoons  sea salt
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1                     skin-on salmon fillet - (abt 16 oz)
  1                cup  chopped fresh dill -- divided
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  honey mustard
  1         tablespoon  distilled white vinegar
  3        tablespoons  grapeseed oil or canola oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR SERVING ===
                        Mini pumpernickel or brioche toasts
                        Dill sprigs

For Gravlax:  Heat all peppercorns and coriander seeds in small skillet over medium-high heat until spices are fragrant and seeds jump slightly, shaking skillet frequently, about 2 minutes.  Crush spices in mortar with pestle or transfer to work surface, cover with kitchen towel (not terry cloth), and crush with mallet or bottom of heavy pan.  Transfer spices to small bowl.  Mix in salt and sugar.

Using small sharp knife, poke 12 small holes through skin of salmon.  Rub 1/3 of spice mixture over skin.  Sprinkle 1/3 cup chopped dill in bottom of 7- by 7- by 2-inch or 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Place salmon, skin-side down, atop dill.  Rub remaining spice mixture into top of salmon.  Press 2/3 cup chopped dill onto salmon.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly onto fish.  Place plate or another pan atop plastic.  Place heavy cans on plate.  Refrigerate 2 to 3 days.

For Sauce:  Whisk mustard and vinegar in small bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in oil.  Stir in chopped dill and salt.  Season with ground black pepper.  (Sauce can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Scrape spices and dill off both sides of salmon (some spice mixture will remain).  Using knife with long thin blade, thinly slice salmon diagonally at 45-degree angle from top of fillet toward skin.

Arrange toasts on platter; top with salmon slices, sauce, and dill sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

What To Drink:  Champagne (or sparkling wine) is a classic aperitif, and versatile enough to pair nicely with the salmon's slightly sweet mustard sauce.

Comments:  Start the gravlax at least two days in advance (the sauce can also be prepared ahead of time, leaving just quick assembly on the day of the party).

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     fresh poblano chiles
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

  4                     filet mignons, abt 1 1/2" to 2" thk - -- (6 oz ea)

Char chiles over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Peel and seed chiles; slice thinly.

Heat both oils in large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until translucent, about 2 minutes.  Add poblanos, cream, and epazote, if desired; simmer until rajas thicken slightly, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt.

Meanwhile, prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Sprinkle steaks with salt.  Grill steaks to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Transfer to plates; top with rajas and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The mild flavor of the meat is revved up with rich rajas con crema, a traditional dish of roasted poblano strips in cream.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              slice  foie gras p‚tÈ or mousse - (4 oz) -- cut into 4 pieces
  4              large  eggs
  4        tablespoons  whipping cream
  4                     thin slices black truffle -- (optional), cut
                        into slivers
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh tarragon
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  2             slices  firm white sandwich bread -- toasted, buttered,
                        and quartered

Lightly butter four 4-ounce ramekins or soufflÈ dishes.  Cut each piece of p‚tÈ into 4 cubes.  Divide p‚tÈ cubes among prepared dishes.  Crack 1 egg into each dish, keeping yolks whole.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Drizzle 1 tablespoon cream over each egg.  Sprinkle truffle slivers over, if desired.  Sprinkle with tarragon and parsley.  Cover each dish tightly with foil.

Fill large skillet with water to depth of 1/2 inch.  Bring to simmer over medium heat.  Add ramekins.  Cook until egg whites are firm and yolks are still runny, about 8 minutes.  Remove ramekins from water; remove foil and wipe ramekins dry.  Serve on small plates with toasts.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Market Tip:  Foie gras p‚tÈ and mousse are sold at specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.  Fresh black truffles (in jars) are sold at Italian markets and specialty foods stores; the most flavorful are European winter black truffles.

Comments:  Decadent and inimitably French, this recipe was inspired by Jacques Drouot, manager of Le DÙme in Paris.  Any leftover fresh truffle can be shaved over scrambled eggs, pasta, or risotto.  Jarred truffles are an option, too, but don't have the same intensity of flavor.  Or the truffles can be omitted altogether.

Lightly butter four 4-ounce ramekins or soufflÈ dishes.  Cut each piece of p‚tÈ into 4 cubes.  Divide p‚tÈ cubes among prepared dishes.  Crack 1 egg into each dish, keeping yolks whole.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Drizzle 1 tablespoon cream over each egg.  Sprinkle truffle slivers over, if desired.  Sprinkle with tarragon and parsley.  Cover each dish tightly with foil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill large skillet with water to depth of 1/2 inch.  Bring to simmer over medium heat.  Add ramekins.  Cook until egg whites are firm and yolks are still runny, about 8 minutes.  Remove ramekins from water; remove foil and wipe ramekins dry.  Serve on small plates with toasts.

Market Tip:  Foie gras p‚tÈ and mousse are sold at specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.  Fresh black truffles (in jars) are sold at Italian markets and specialty foods stores; the most flavorful are European winter black truffles.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Decadent and inimitably French, this recipe was inspired by Jacques Drouot, manager of Le DÙme in Paris.  Any leftover fresh truffle can be shaved over scrambled eggs, pasta, or risotto.  Jarred truffles are an option, too, but don&apos;t have the same intensity of flavor.  Or the truffles can be omitted altogether.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  6                     green serrano chiles
  1              slice  from medium-size white onion, 3/4"-thick

Comments:  Serrano chiles give this Mexican sauce its bite and light green color.  Use it on warm tortillas or grilled meats.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped white onion
  3              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  16                    uncooked jumbo shrimp - (abt 1 lb) -- deveined, with
                        shells left intact

Puree 1/2 cup oil, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in blender until almost smooth.  Place shrimp in small bowl.  Stir in oil mixture.  Let shrimp marinate 1 hour.

Heat remaining 1/4 cup oil in heavy large skillet over high heat.  Add shrimp with marinade and sautÈ just until shrimp are opaque in center, about 4 minutes.  Divide shrimp and marinade from skillet among 4 plates and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Offer this with the Mexican White Rice (see recipe) cooked with two whole serrano chiles (remove the chiles before serving the rice).  To devein the shrimp while leaving the shells intact, use kitchen shears or scissors to cut down the center of each shell from the head end of the shrimp toward the tail.  Open the shell slightly and remove the vein using the tip of a small, sharp knife.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
  2                     fresh poblano chiles
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  apple cider vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves
                        === SALAD ===
  2              small  beets
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1 1/2         pounds  green beans -- trimmed, and
                        cut diagonally into 1" pieces
  3               cups  baby spinach leaves
  1              small  white onion -- sliced paper-thin
  5              large  radishes -- sliced paper-thin

For Dressing:  Char chiles directly over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes.  Peel, seed, and coarsely chop chiles.

Combine chiles, orange juice, oil, vinegar, and garlic in blender.  Blend until mixture is smooth and thick.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover; chill until dressing is cold, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

For Salad:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Wrap each beet tightly in foil; place directly on oven rack.  Roast beets until tender when pierced with knife, about 50 minutes.  Unwrap beets and cool completely, then peel.  Coarsely grate beets into medium bowl.  Toss with lime juice.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover and let stand at room temperature at least 1 hour.

Cook green beans in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain; transfer to large bowl of ice water to cool.  Drain again and pat dry.

Toss green beans, spinach, onion, and radishes in large bowl with enough dressing to coat.  Season with salt and pepper.  Divide salad among plates; top with beets.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The green beans and the poblano chiles in the salad dressing may be the only ingredients that are indigenous to Mexico, but the colorful combination of vegetables, with their contrasting textures, results in a fitting accompaniment to any Mexican dinner.

Unwrap beets and cool completely, then peel.  Coarsely grate beets into medium bowl.  Toss with lime juice.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover and let stand at room temperature at least 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook green beans in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain; transfer to large bowl of ice water to cool.  Drain again and pat dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Toss green beans, spinach, onion, and radishes in large bowl with enough dressing to coat.  Season with salt and pepper.  Divide salad among plates; top with beets.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The green beans and the poblano chiles in the salad dressing may be the only ingredients that are indigenous to Mexico, but the colorful combination of vegetables, with their contrasting textures, results in a fitting accompaniment to any Mexican dinner.

            Grilled Whole Fish With Roasted Tomato-Chile Sauce

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  2             pounds  ripe tomatoes
  3                     serrano chiles -- stemmed
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped white onion
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
                        === FISH ===
  1              whole  red snapper - (3 to 3 1/2 lbs) -- head and scales
                        removed, fish cleaned, butterflied
     1/4           cup  canola oil
  1           teaspoon  dried Mexican oregano
  2          teaspoons  fresh lime juice
  12                    warm corn tortillas - (5" to 6" dia)

For Sauce:  Line heavy large skillet with foil.  Place tomatoes and chiles in skillet; cook over medium-high heat until skins begin to blister and blacken in spots, turning occasionally, about 20 minutes for tomatoes and 10 minutes for chiles.  Remove from heat and cool slightly.  Peel tomatoes; transfer to processor.  Add chiles, onion, and garlic.  Blend until coarse puree forms.  Transfer sauce to bowl.  Stir in cilantro, parsley, and salt.  (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead.  Cover and chill.)

For Fish:  Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler.  Rinse fish inside and out with cold water; pat dry.  Open fish flat, like a book.  Rub fish inside and out with oil; sprinkle inside with oregano, salt, and pepper.  If grilling, place fish, opened flat, in grill basket.  If broiling, place fish, opened flat, on oiled rimmed baking sheet.  Grill or broil fish just until opaque in center, about 6 minutes per side.

Using spatula, transfer fish to platter.  Sprinkle with lime juice; serve with tomato sauce and warm corn tortillas.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Although you can broil the fish, it is at its best when cooked outside (placing the fish in a grill basket makes it easier to turn over on the barbecue).  Ask the fishmonger to remove the head and scales and to clean and butterfly the fish.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            medium  tomatillos - (abt 1 1/4 lbs) -- husked, rinsed
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped white onion
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
  4                     serrano chiles -- seeded, minced
                        = (abt 2 tbspns)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2             pounds  avocados - (abt 3 large) -- peeled, pitted,
                        and coarsely chopped

Preheat broiler.  Line rimmed baking sheet with foil.  Place tomatillos on prepared baking sheet.  Broil until tomatillos are just blackened in spots and tender, about 8 minutes per side.

Combine onion, cilantro, chiles, and lime juice in large bowl.  Add roasted tomatillos and any juices from baking sheet to onion mixture.  Using fork, mash coarsely.  Add avocados and mash with fork until mixture is very coarsely pureed and some chunks remain.  Season guacamole to taste with salt.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Cover and chill.)

This recipe yields about 4 cups.

Comments:  Use Haas avocados if available; their buttery creaminess makes for the best guacamole.

  1           teaspoon  salt

Preheat broiler.  Line rimmed baking sheet with foil.  Arrange tomatillos, onion, garlic, and chile on prepared baking sheet.  Broil until vegetables blacken in spots, about 5 minutes per side for chile and about 10 minutes per side for tomatillos, onion, and garlic.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried pinto beans -- rinsed
  10              cups  cold water -- or more if needed
  2               cups  chopped green onions - (abt 8)
  1         tablespoon  lard or corn oil -- plus
     1/3           cup  lard or corn oil
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped white onion
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2               cups  coarsely-grated queso manchego* - (packed) -- abt 8 oz
                        = (or Monterey Jack cheese)
                        Warm corn tortillas

* Light yellow, semi-soft mild cheese that is different from the aged Spanish cheese of the same name.  Substitute mild cheddar, Monterey Jack, or Muenster.

Place beans in heavy large pot.  Add 10 cups water, green onions, and 1 tablespoon lard.  Bring to boil over high heat, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover partially, and simmer until beans are just tender, about 55 minutes.  Mix in 1 teaspoon fine sea salt.  Cover partially and continue to simmer until beans are very soft, adding more water by cupfuls if water level falls below top of beans, about 20 minutes longer.

Heat remaining 1/3 cup lard in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add white onion and sautÈ until beginning to brown, about 8 minutes.  Add garlic; stir 1 minute.  Using slotted spoon, transfer beans to skillet.  Mash with potato masher to coarse, lumpy puree.  Mix in enough bean cooking liquid (about 1/2 cup) to moisten.  Mix in cheese.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool 30 minutes.  Cover beans and liquid separately and refrigerate.  Rewarm beans over low heat, mixing in bean cooking liquid by 1/4 cupfuls if dry.)

Serve beans warm with tortillas.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Frijoles meneados are an ideal addition to any meal featuring tacos, and they are especially good alongside a grilled steak.  In Mexico's frontier region, flour tortillas would be used to scoop up the last remaining bean on the plate.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ¡RBOL CHILE SAUCE ===
  2                     garlic cloves -- unpeeled
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds
  2               cups  dried ·rbol chiles* -- stemmed
                        = (abt 1 1/2 oz)
  2               cups  boiling water
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
                        === SOUP ===
  3 1/2         pounds  pigs' feet - (abt 4) -- split, and
                        rinsed under cold water
                        = (or 3 1/2 lbs meaty pork neck bones)
  2             pounds  boneless country-style pork ribs -- cut 2" pieces,
                        and fat trimmed
  1              pound  meaty pork neck bones
  12              cups  water
  3              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
  1         tablespoon  fine sea salt
  8               cups  drained canned white hominy
                        = (from about five 15-oz cans)
  3                     limes -- cut into wedges
  2               cups  thinly-sliced green cabbage
  1                cup  chopped white onion
  1                cup  thinly-sliced radishes

* Thin, red, 3-inch-long dried chile that is very hot.

For ¡rbol Chile Sauce:  Cook garlic cloves in heavy small skillet over medium-low heat until beginning to soften and blacken in spots, turning occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Cool and peel garlic.  Transfer to small bowl.  Add sesame seeds to same skillet.  Stir over medium-low heat until golden, about 6 minutes.  Add sesame seeds to same bowl.

Combine chiles and 2 cups boiling water in medium bowl.  Let stand until chiles soften and water is cool, about 2 hours.  Drain, reserving soaking liquid.  Chop chiles and place in blender with seeds.  Add 1 cup reserved soaking liquid; puree until almost smooth.  Add allspice, garlic, and sesame seeds; puree until smooth, adding more soaking liquid by 1/4 cupfuls to thin puree if desired.  Pour puree into strainer set over bowl; press on solids in strainer to extract as much liquid as possible for sauce.

For Soup:  Place pigs' feet, boneless pork pieces, and neck bones in very large pot.  Add 12 cups water.  Bring to boil, skimming any gray foam from surface.  Add garlic and salt; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered until pork is tender, about 1 hour 45 minutes.  Using tongs, transfer pigs' feet, boneless pork pieces, and bones to bowl.  Cool.

Pull meat in small chunks from pigs' feet and neck bones; discard bones and cartilage.  Shred boneless pork pieces coarsely.  Return all meat to broth in pot.  Add hominy; simmer soup 20 minutes to blend flavors, skimming any foam from surface.  Season soup to taste with more salt.  (Sauce and soup can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill sauce.  Cool soup slightly.  Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.  Rewarm soup before serving.)

Ladle soup into bowls.  Pass sauce, limes, cabbage, onion, and radishes alongside to add to soup.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  This dish is similar to the original white pozole that was created in the 18th century.  Some regions now specialize in red and green versions.  If you don't have a Mexican market nearby, you may have to order the pigs' feet and pork neck bones from your butcher up to one week before you plan to make this (ask the butcher to split the pigs' feet).  If substituting pork neck bones for pigs' feet, you'll need a total of 4 1/2 pounds of neck bones for the soup.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  mahi-mahi fillets -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1/4"-thick strips
  1 1/2           cups  fresh lime juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried Mexican oregano
     1/2                red onion -- thinly sliced
  4                     jalapeÒo chiles -- seeded

  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
                        Saltine crackers -- for serving

Combine fish, lime juice, and oregano in large glass bowl.  Sprinkle with salt.  Chill until fish turns opaque, stirring occasionally, about 50 minutes.

Strain almost all lime juice from fish; return fish to bowl.  Stir in onion, minced and sliced jalapeÒos, coconut, and cilantro.  Season with salt.  Chill at least 20 minutes and up to 2 hours.  Serve in Martini glasses.  Pass crackers separately.

This recipe yields 6 first-course servings.

Comments:  The fish is marinated in fresh lime juice (and therefore partly "cooked").

  1           teaspoon  dried Mexican oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pound  lean ground beef
  1              pound  lean ground pork
  1                cup  finely-chopped seeded tomatoes - -- (abt 4 medium)
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh mint
                        === SAUCE ===
  4             medium  serrano chiles -- stemmed
  2                     garlic cloves -- unpeeled
  4               cans  diced tomatoes in juice - (14 1/2 oz ea)
     1/4           cup  canola oil
  1                cup  water

For Sauce:  Line heavy small skillet with foil; add chiles and garlic.  Cook over medium-high heat until skins begin to blister and blacken, turning frequently, about 15 minutes.  Cool garlic slightly, then peel.  Working in batches, puree tomatoes with juices, whole chiles, and garlic in blender until almost smooth.  (Meatballs and puree can be prepared 6 hours ahead.  Keep meatballs refrigerated.  Cover and refrigerate puree.)

Heat oil in heavy large wide pot over medium-high heat.  Add tomato puree, 1 cup water, and salt; bring to boil.  Carefully add meatballs; bring to simmer.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until meatballs are cooked through, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.  Uncover and boil gently until liquid is reduced to sauce consistency, stirring occasionally, about 18 minutes.

Spoon Mexican White Rice into 6 shallow bowls.  Top rice with meatballs and tomato-serrano sauce and serve.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  8                     skinless boneless chicken breast halves - -- (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
  1 1/2         pounds  assorted wild mushrooms -- sliced
                        = (such as oyster, crimini, and
                        stemmed shiitake)
  1 1/2           cups  low-salt chicken broth
     2/3           cup  pitted Kalamata olives
  3                     plum tomatoes -- seeded, diced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  chopped shallot
  1         tablespoon  drained capers
  2        tablespoons  chilled butter - (1/4 stick)
  1                cup  teardrop tomatoes (red and yellow)
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  3        tablespoons  pine nuts -- toasted
                        Caper berries -- halved (optional)

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large skillet over high heat.  Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.  Working in 2 batches, add chicken to skillet.  Cook until brown and just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to ovenproof plate and place in oven to keep warm.  Discard oil from skillet.

Add 3 tablespoons oil to same skillet over high heat.  Add mushrooms; sautÈ until wilted and beginning to brown, about 3 minutes.  Add broth; boil until almost all liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes.  Add olives, plum tomatoes, garlic, shallot, and capers.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until liquid is reduced by half, about 7 minutes.  Add butter; stir until melted.  Mix in teardrop tomatoes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Spoon mushroom mixture over chicken.  Sprinkle parsley and pine nuts over.  Garnish with caper berries, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Market Tip:  Capers are flower buds from the caper bush, and caper berries are the fruit.  They are about the size of an olive, and are usually pickled and sold in jars.  They can be found at Italian markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks)
     1/4           cup  corn oil
  16            slices  French bread, 3" x2" x 1/2"
                        = (from abt three 6" to 7"-long French
                        rolls)
  2               cups  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2           cups  water
  3                     canela sticks
                        = (or cinnamon sticks)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  aniseed
     1/2           cup  raisins
     1/3           cup  blanched slivered almonds
     1/4           cup  unsalted dry-roasted peanuts
  4             ounces  queso manchego* -- thinly sliced,
                        and at room temperature
                        Crema mexicana** -- (optional)
                        = (or sour cream)

* Light yellow, semi-soft mild cheese that is different from the aged Spanish cheese of the same name. Substitute mild cheddar, Monterey Jack, or Muenster.

** Cultured Mexican cream with a slightly nutty flavor and consistency of thin sour cream.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Melt 4 tablespoons butter in small saucepan over medium-low heat.  Whisk in corn oil.  Brush large rimmed baking sheet with some of butter mixture.  Arrange bread slices on sheet.  Brush bread generously with remaining butter mixture.  Bake bread slices 10 minutes; turn slices over and bake until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes longer.  Cool.  Arrange bread in 15- by 10- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Maintain oven temperature.

Bring brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups water, canela sticks, aniseed, and 6 tablespoons butter to boil in medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Boil until syrup is reduced to 2 cups, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.  (Bread and syrup can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover bread and store at room temperature.  Cover and chill syrup.  Rewarm syrup before using.)

Gradually pour warm syrup over bread slices, allowing some of syrup to be absorbed before adding more.  Sprinkle raisins, almonds, and peanuts over.  Cover dish with foil and bake until bread is slightly softened and syrup is bubbling, about 25 minutes.  Place 2 bread slices on each plate; spoon some of syrup, raisins, and nuts over.  Top each with queso manchego.  Serve with crema mexicana, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  In Mexico, this popular Lenten dessert is typically made with the versatile bolillos, or small bread rolls.  Here, the bread is baked instead of sautÈed before it is combined with the other ingredients.  This bread pudding is traditionally served as a dessert, but the unusual addition of savory garnishes ó roasted peanuts and aged cheese ó also makes it a wonderful breakfast or brunch dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CREPES ===
  2               cups  whole milk
  3              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- melted, cooled
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  2               cups  sifted all-purpose flour
                        Additional melted butter
                        === MUSHROOM FILLING ===
     1/3           cup  corn oil
  2               cups  chopped white onions
  1              pound  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, and
                        caps thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh epazote
                        = (or fresh cilantro)
  4          teaspoons  finely-chopped garlic
                        === SAUCE ===
  6              large  fresh poblano chiles
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
     1/4           cup  chopped white onion
  1              small  garlic clove -- minced
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  warm whole milk
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  1                cup  coarsely-grated queso manchego* - -- (abt 4 oz)
                        = (or Muenster cheese)
  3        tablespoons  corn oil
     1/2           cup  fresh corn kernels
                        Fresh cilantro sprigs

* Light yellow, semi-soft mild cheese that is different from the aged Spanish cheese of the same name.  Substitute mild cheddar, Monterey Jack, or Muenster.

For Crepes:  Blend milk, eggs, 2 tablespoons melted butter, and salt in blender 5 seconds.  Add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, blending batter until smooth after each addition.  Let rest 1 to 2 hours.  Reblend batter 5 seconds before using.

Heat nonstick skillet with 7- to 8-inch-diameter bottom over medium-high heat; brush with melted butter.  Pour 3 tablespoons batter into skillet; swirl skillet to coat bottom evenly.  Cook until bottom of crepe is golden, about 30 seconds.  Loosen edges gently with spatula and turn crepe over.  Cook until bottom is brown in spots, about 30 seconds.  Turn crepe out onto paper towel.  Repeat, making about 16 crepes and stacking between paper towels.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Wrap and chill.)

For Mushroom Filling:  Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and sautÈ until translucent, about 3 minutes.  Add mushrooms, epazote, and garlic.  SautÈ until mushrooms are brown and mushroom liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

For Sauce:  Char chiles directly over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes.  Peel, seed, and thinly slice chiles.

Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion; sautÈ until soft, about 2 minutes.  Add garlic; stir 30 seconds.  Stir in flour (mixture may be firm).  SautÈ 1 minute longer.  Whisk in warm milk and bring to boil, whisking constantly.  Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until sauce thickens, whisking occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Pour sauce into blender.  Add cream and half of roasted chiles (reserve remaining chiles for garnish).  Blend sauce until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Whisk over medium heat until just warm before continuing.)

Brush small baking sheet with oil.  Arrange 1 crepe, brown spots up, on work surface.  Place 2 packed tablespoons filling in center.  Fold crepe in half.  Fold in half again, forming triangle.  Place filled crepe on prepared sheet.  Repeat with 11 more crepes and all of filling.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with foil and chill.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Pour 1/4 cup sauce into center of each of 6 ovenproof plates.  Top each with 2 filled crepes.  Pour 1/4 cup sauce over.  Sprinkle with cheese.  Bake until cheese melts, about 12 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add reserved poblano chiles and corn; sautÈ until heated through, about 2 minutes.  Sprinkle with salt.

Garnish crepes with sautÈed chiles and corn, then cilantro sprigs, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Wild mushrooms stand in for cuitlacoche (corn fungus), which is a delicacy in Mexico.

* Light yellow, semi-soft mild cheese that is different from the aged Spanish cheese of the same name.  Substitute mild cheddar, Monterey Jack, or Muenster.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Crepes:  Blend milk, eggs, 2 tablespoons melted butter, and salt in blender 5 seconds.  Add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, blending batter until smooth after each addition.  Let rest 1 to 2 hours.  Reblend batter 5 seconds before using.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat nonstick skillet with 7- to 8-inch-diameter bottom over medium-high heat; brush with melted butter.  Pour 3 tablespoons batter into skillet; swirl skillet to coat bottom evenly.  Cook until bottom of crepe is golden, about 30 seconds.  Loosen edges gently with spatula and turn crepe over.  Cook until bottom is brown in spots, about 30 seconds.  Turn crepe out onto paper towel.  Repeat, making about 16 crepes and stacking between paper towels.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Wrap and chill.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Mushroom Filling:  Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and sautÈ until translucent, about 3 minutes.  Add mushrooms, epazote, and garlic.  SautÈ until mushrooms are brown and mushroom liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Sauce:  Char chiles directly over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes.  Peel, seed, and thinly slice chiles.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion; sautÈ until soft, about 2 minutes.  Add garlic; stir 30 seconds.  Stir in flour (mixture may be firm).  SautÈ 1 minute longer.  Whisk in warm milk and bring to boil, whisking constantly.  Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until sauce thickens, whisking occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Pour sauce into blender.  Add cream and half of roasted chiles (reserve remaining chiles for garnish).  Blend sauce until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Whisk over medium heat until just warm before continuing.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush small baking sheet with oil.  Arrange 1 crepe, brown spots up, on work surface.  Place 2 packed tablespoons filling in center.  Fold crepe in half.  Fold in half again, forming triangle.  Place filled crepe on prepared sheet.  Repeat with 11 more crepes and all of filling.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with foil and chill.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Pour 1/4 cup sauce into center of each of 6 ovenproof plates.  Top each with 2 filled crepes.  Pour 1/4 cup sauce over.  Sprinkle with cheese.  Bake until cheese melts, about 12 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add reserved poblano chiles and corn; sautÈ until heated through, about 2 minutes.  Sprinkle with salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Garnish crepes with sautÈed chiles and corn, then cilantro sprigs, and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Wild mushrooms stand in for cuitlacoche (corn fungus), which is a delicacy in Mexico.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
  1 1/4         pounds  tomatillos -- husked, rinsed
  1                     jalapeÒo chile -- stemmed, halved,
                        and seeded
     1/3           cup  fresh cilantro - (packed)
  3                     garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2         large  white onion -- sliced
     3/4           cup  low-salt chicken broth
     3/4      teaspoon  sugar -- more or less
  1 1/2         pounds  queso oaxaca* -- cut into 6 portions
                        Warm corn tortillas

* Melting cheese available in balls, braids, or rounds.  Sometimes labeled queso asadero or queso chihuahua.  Substitute mozzarella or Monterey Jack.

Bring 2 cups water to boil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add tomatillos and jalapeÒo chile and cook until tomatillos are tender, about 7 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer tomatillos and chile to blender.  Add 1/2 cup cooking liquid, cilantro, and garlic.  Puree until sauce is almost smooth.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes.  Add tomatillo sauce.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce thickens, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Mix in broth, then sugar; season sauce with salt and pepper.

Heat heavy large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add cheese and cook until slightly browned, about 1 minute per side.  Bring tomatillo sauce to simmer.  Add cheese to sauce and cook until cheese begins to melt, about 2 minutes.  Transfer cheese with sauce to shallow platter or divide cheese and sauce among 6 individual gratin dishes.  Serve with tortillas.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  If you arrive for breakfast at the refined La Olla Restaurant & Bar, head to the rooftop dining area, where you can survey the city as you dine in the shade of an umbrella.  No matter what you order, be sure to try the cheese with green salsa, which is served with fresh, homemade tortillas.  When you're done with your feast, you can walk to the historic Santo Domingo church or the zÛcalo (the central square).

  1 3/4           cups  sugar -- divided
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  4          teaspoons  grated orange peel -- divided
  8              large  navel oranges
  2               cups  chilled heavy whipping cream
     1/2           cup  coarsely-crushed amaretti cookies* -- (Italian macaroons)
     1/4           cup  apricot jam -- melted

* Available at Italian markets and some supermarkets.

For Cream Filling:  Bring milk and orange peel to simmer in heavy medium saucepan; remove from heat.  Using electric mixer, beat yolks in large bowl to blend.  With machine running, add sugar and beat until mixture is light yellow and thick, about 4 minutes.  Add flour, beating until well combined.  Gradually beat in hot milk mixture.

Return custard to same saucepan.  Cook over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens, stirring constantly, about 3 minutes.  Remove from heat; whisk in butter and vanilla.  Transfer cream filling to medium bowl; press plastic wrap onto surface.  Refrigerate cream filling overnight.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

For Syrup:  Bring sugar and 1 cup water to boil in small saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar.  Boil 5 minutes, swirling pan occasionally.  Cool syrup slightly.  Stir in Grand Marnier.  Cover; chill until cold.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep chilled.)

For Cake:  Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line each pan with parchment paper round.  Bring milk and butter almost to boil in small saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into medium bowl.

Using electric mixer, beat eggs in large bowl on high speed 2 minutes.  Gradually beat in 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Beat until mixture is light yellow and thick, scraping down sides occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Reduce speed to medium-high; add vanilla.  Gradually beat in hot milk mixture in steady stream.  Immediately add dry ingredients and beat until just blended, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl (batter will be thin).  Mix in 3 teaspoons orange peel.  Quickly divide batter between prepared pans.

Bake until cakes are golden, pull away from sides of pans, and spring back when pressed in center, about 30 minutes.  Cool in pans on rack 10 minutes.  Invert cakes; peel off parchment paper.  Turn cakes right-side up on rack and cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Wrap in plastic and let stand at room temperature.)

Using small sharp knife, cut off peel and white pith from oranges.  Working over strainer set over large bowl, cut between membranes to release segments.  Transfer orange segments to paper towels to drain.

Beat cream and 1/4 cup sugar in large bowl until cream holds peaks.  Fold 1/2 cup whipped cream into cream filling, then fold in crushed amaretti and remaining 1 teaspoon grated orange peel.

Using serrated knife, cut each cake layer horizontally in half, creating 4 layers.  Place 1 layer on plate, cut-side up; brush generously with syrup (about 6 tablespoons).  Spread 3/4 cup filling over.  Arrange 1 layer of orange segments (about 20) over filling.  Repeat layering twice more with cake, syrup, filling, and orange segments.  Top with remaining cake layer, cut-side down.  Brush cake with syrup.

Fill pastry bag fitted with large star tip with 1 cup whipped cream.  Spread remaining whipped cream over top and sides of cake.  Pipe cream in rosettes around top edge of cake.  Cover center with orange segments.  Brush oranges with melted apricot jam.  Refrigerate cake 3 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Similar to zuppa inglese (an Italian trifle), this impressive dessert layers an amaretti-and-cream filling and orange segments between syrup-soaked sponge cake.  Many of the components can be made ahead; start with the filling so that it can chill overnight.

  1 1/2           cups  crumbled chilled soft fresh goat cheese - -- (abt 7 oz)
  6        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  2               cups  freshly ground corn masa dough for
                        tortillas - (abt 17 oz)
                        = (or make masa dough with 1 3/4 cups
                        masa harina [corn tortilla mix; abt 8 1/2
                        oz] mixed with 1 cup plus 2 tbspns warm
                        water)
  2        tablespoons  lard or solid vegetable shortening
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Warm water -- as needed
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Roasted-Tomatillo And Lime Salsa -- (see recipe)
                        Sliced fresh radishes

Mix goat cheese and cilantro in medium bowl for filling.  Cover; chill.

Combine fresh masa or masa harina mixture, lard, and salt in large bowl.  Knead until well blended, adding warm water by teaspoonfuls as needed until dough is soft but not sticky.  Divide into 12 equal portions; shape each into ball.  Arrange on sheet of foil; cover.

Cut two 8-inch rounds from heavy-duty resealable plastic bag.  Place 1 plastic round on bottom half of tortilla press.  Place 1 dough ball in center; top with second plastic round.  Close tortilla press, gently flattening dough to 4-inch round about 1/4 inch thick.  Peel off top plastic.  Arrange 2 tablespoons goat cheese filling in strip in center of dough round.  Using bottom plastic as aid, fold up sides of dough over filling.  Using moistened fingertips, mold dough into oval, sealing filling inside.  Arrange, seam-side down, on sheet of aluminum foil.  Repeat with remaining masa balls and filling.

Heat 2 heavy large ungreased griddles or skillets over medium heat.  Arrange 6 cakes in each.  Cook until cakes are pale golden, 8 minutes per side.  Transfer masa cakes to baking sheet.  (Masa cakes can be made 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Pour vegetable oil into each griddle to depth of 1/8 inch.  Heat over medium-high heat 2 minutes.  Add 6 masa cakes to each griddle.  Fry until masa cakes are heated through and golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.

Arrange masa cakes on platter.  Spoon some tomatillo salsa over.  Garnish with radishes.  Serve with remaining salsa.

This recipe yields 12 cakes.

Comments:  Traditionally these rustic cakes are made with a mashed bean filling.  The goat cheese called for here adds a contemporary twist.

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain.  Return pasta to same pot.  Add sauce; toss over medium heat until coated.  Transfer to large bowl.  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup cheese and 1 tablespoon parsley.  Serve, passing remaining 1 cup cheese separately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Butternut squash and a variety of beans give this vegetarian dish its hearty texture.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Easy Tart Crust -- (see recipe)
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  4              large  firm-but-ripe Bosc pears -- peeled, quartered,
                        cored, each quarter cut lengthwise into 3
                        slices
  3        tablespoons  chopped husked toasted hazelnuts
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped imported milk chocolate
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped bittersweet or
                        semisweet chocolate (not unsweetened)
  6        tablespoons  raw sugar -- divided
     1/4      teaspoon  coarse sea salt -- (optional)

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Place large sheet of parchment paper on work surface.  Place crust dough atop parchment; roll out dough to 14-inch round.  Transfer parchment with dough to large unrimmed baking sheet.

Whisk egg and cream in small bowl.  Brush center 10 inches of dough with some of egg glaze, leaving 2-inch plain border.  Arrange pear slices in concentric circles atop glaze on dough.  Sprinkle hazelnuts and both chocolates, then 4 tablespoons raw sugar over pears.

Fold dough border over filling to form 11-inch round, pleating loosely and pinching to seal any cracks in dough.  Brush crust with egg glaze; sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons raw sugar, then with 1/4 teaspoon sea salt, if desired.

Bake crostata until crust is deep golden and pears are tender, about 40 minutes.  Transfer baking sheet to rack.  Run long thin knife under crust to free from parchment.  Cool to lukewarm on parchment on sheet.  Using large tart pan bottom as aid, transfer crostata to platter.  Serve lukewarm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  For best results, use Bosc pears.  They hold their shape well when baked.  Top with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

                         Pinto Bean Enfrijoladas

Recipe By     :Luis Miguel LÛpez AlanÌs, Morelia, Mexico
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2               cups  chopped onions
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cans  pinto beans - (15 to 16 oz ea) -- drained
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk -- or more if needed
  1 1/2           cups  water -- or more if needed
  1           teaspoon  minced serrano chile with seeds
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  dried Mexican oregano
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
  12                    corn tortillas - (5 1/2" to 6" dia)
  2 1/4           cups  crumbled queso ranchero*
                        Chopped fresh cilantro
                        Sour cream

* Mildly salty cheese that crumbles easily; also labled queso fresco or queso casero.  Queso cotija or mild feta can be used instead.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Oil 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and garlic and sautÈ until onions are golden, about 8 minutes.  Add beans, 1 1/2 cups milk, and 1 1/2 cups water; simmer until onions are tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Mash beans coarsely in skillet.  Mix in chile and all spices; season with salt and pepper.  Add more milk or water by 1/4 cupfuls to thin bean mixture to slightly soupy consistency.

Heat remaining 1/4 cup oil in another large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 1 tortilla at a time; cook until tortilla softens, about 30 seconds per side.  Transfer tortilla to work surface.  Place 1 heaping tablespoon cheese in center of each tortilla; fold in half.  Place in prepared dish, overlapping tortillas slightly.  Top with bean sauce.

Bake until enfrijoladas are heated through and sauce is bubbling, about 20 minutes.  Sprinkle with remaining queso ranchero and cilantro.  Serve with sour cream.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Luis writes; "Although I grew up in Mexico, it was in Chicago of all places that I learned to cook Mexican food.  During the two years I lived there, I missed my country's food so much that I wrote to my mother in Zit·cuaro and asked her to send me recipes so I could cook for myself.

"Now I work as a tour guide in Michoac·n, my home state, where I lead tours on Morelia's colonial history and architecture, and show tourists the ParicutÌn Volcano and monarch butterfly sanctuaries.  And sometimes I do restaurant and market tours.  Whenever business slows down, I enjoy cooking for my family.  Of course, what I make depends on what my wife, VerÛnica, has in mind.  Thanks to her, I've learned more great recipes, like the enfrijoladas from her home state, Tlaxcala, and her lively avocado and tomatillo salsa."

Enfrijoladas are a popular breakfast dish in Mexico.

  3             pounds  red-skinned potatoes
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  5                     fresh poblano chiles -- seeded, peeled,

Comments:  Juana writes; "Growing up in Cuernavaca, just outside Mexico City, I remember my grandmother cooking elaborate Mexican meals every day.  My mother continued that tradition, but not in such an all-consuming manner.  For her it was a great joy to plan a menu and then invite people to help with the preparation.

"The women in my life taught me the beauty of a good meal.  I still use many of their recipes today, but unlike my grandmother I don't spend an entire day in the kitchen.  Fortunately, my husband and kids like to cook, so I've found a balance between my grandmother's time-intensive recipes and my mother's practicality. "

Comments:  Juana writes; &quot;Growing up in Cuernavaca, just outside Mexico City, I remember my grandmother cooking elaborate Mexican meals every day.  My mother continued that tradition, but not in such an all-consuming manner.  For her it was a great joy to plan a menu and then invite people to help with the preparation.
</DirT>
<DirT>
&quot;The women in my life taught me the beauty of a good meal.  I still use many of their recipes today, but unlike my grandmother I don&apos;t spend an entire day in the kitchen.  Fortunately, my husband and kids like to cook, so I&apos;ve found a balance between my grandmother&apos;s time-intensive recipes and my mother&apos;s practicality. &quot;

     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        === THICKENERS ===
  3        tablespoons  canola oil
  1              slice  bread 3" by 2" by 1" from firm French roll
  3                     corn tortillas - (5" to 6" dia) -- coarsely chopped
  6             ounces  Mexican chocolate -- chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped piloncillo**
                        = (or packed dark brown sugar)
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth -- if necessary

* Mexican cinnamon sticks with a delicate, floral flavor.

** Mexican raw sugar shaped into hard cones.  Smaller chunks are sometimes labeled panocha.  If neither is available, substitute an equal weight of packed dark brown sugar.

For Turkey:  Combine all ingredients in large pot.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until turkey is just cooked through, skimming foam, about 35 minutes.  Transfer turkey to bowl; cover and chill.  Strain and reserve broth in pot.

For Chiles:  Heat 1/2 cup lard in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, fry all chiles until beginning to blister and change color, about 15 seconds per side (do not burn).  Using tongs and shaking off excess lard, transfer chiles to another large pot.  Add 4 cups reserved turkey broth; bring to boil.  Reduce heat; simmer uncovered until chiles are very soft, about 35 minutes.  Strain liquid into 4-cup measuring cup; add enough reserved turkey broth to measure 4 cups.  Chop chiles.  Working in batches, puree chiles and 4 cups chile broth in blender until smooth.

Heat remaining 1/2 cup lard in same pot over medium heat until almost smoking.  Press chile puree through large mesh strainer into pot (mixture will sputter and bubble vigorously).  Stir until puree thickens enough to form path on bottom of pot when wooden spoon is drawn across, about 15 minutes.  Remove chile puree from heat.

For Nuts And Seeds:  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add almonds and stir until color deepens, about 1 minute.  Add pecans and peanuts; stir 1 minute.  Add pepitas; stir 30 seconds.  Transfer to blender.  Add sesame seeds to skillet; stir 1 minute.  Transfer 2 tablespoons sesame seeds to small bowl and reserve for garnish.  Place remaining 1 tablespoon sesame seeds in blender with nuts.  Add 1/2 cup reserved turkey broth and blend until thick puree forms.  Add nut-and-seed puree to pot with chile puree.  Cook over very low heat, stirring often, while preparing fruits.

For Fruits:  Heat 1/4 cup oil in same skillet over high heat.  Add plantain and sautÈ until golden, about 3 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels.  Add tomatillos and tomatoes to skillet; sautÈ until slightly softened, mashing with fork.  Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until thickened, stirring often, about 25 minutes.  Add raisins and plantain; simmer 10 minutes, stirring often.  Cool slightly.

Working in batches, puree tomatillo mixture in blender with 2 cups reserved turkey broth.  Strain mixture through sieve into chile-nut puree, pressing on solids to extract as much mixture as possible; discard solids in sieve.  Continue cooking puree over very low heat while preparing flavorings, stirring often.

For Flavorings:  Cook onion and garlic cloves in dry heavy medium skillet over medium heat until beginning to brown and soften, turning often, about 15 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Coarsely chop onion; peel garlic.  Place in blender.

Stir cloves in same skillet over medium-high heat until fragrant, about 20 seconds.  Transfer cloves to spice mill or coffee grinder; add peppercorns and next 7 ingredients.  Grind finely.  Add to blender.  Add 1 cup reserved turkey broth; blend until smooth.  Stir spice mixture into chile-nut puree.  Simmer mole over very low heat 30 minutes to blend flavors while preparing thickeners, stirring often (mole will bubble thickly).

For Thickeners:  Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add bread slice; fry until golden, about 1 1/2 minutes per side.  Transfer to blender.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and tortillas to skillet; sautÈ 2 minutes.  Transfer to blender with bread.  Add 2 cups reserved turkey broth; blend until smooth.  Add to mole; simmer 10 minutes.

Add chocolate and piloncillo to mole; simmer over low heat 20 minutes, stirring often, scraping bottom of pot and adding more turkey broth (or chicken broth if necessary) by 1/2 cupfuls if mole is too thick (up to 2 cups more broth may be needed).  Season with salt.  Continue simmering over low heat until streaks of oil form on mole surface, about 10 minutes longer.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cool slightly.  Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.  Rewarm over low heat, stirring and adding more broth if desired, before continuing.)

Cut turkey into 1/3-inch-thick slices.  Add to hot mole; simmer until turkey is heated through, about 10 minutes.  Arrange turkey slices on platter.  Spoon mole over; sprinkle with sesame seeds.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Mole is very time-consuming to make, but you can begin up to three days ahead.  The results are well worth the effort.  In Mexico, this is served with rice or unfilled tamales.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MAPLE CARAMEL ===
  1                cup  maple sugar
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
     3/4           cup  heavy whipping cream
     1/4           cup  bourbon
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === PUMPKIN CUSTARD ===
  3               cups  whipping cream
  2 1/4           cups  canned pure pumpkin
  1           teaspoon  ground allspice
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  sugar
  9              large  egg yolks
                        === PROFITEROLES ===
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  whole milk
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  4              large  eggs
  1              large  egg yolk
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Lightly-sweetened whipped cream
  1                cup  pecans -- toasted, chopped

For Maple Caramel:  Stir sugar and butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until blended and smooth.  Whisk in cream.  Bring to boil, stirring until caramel bits dissolve.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in bourbon and vanilla; simmer 1 minute.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

For Pumpkin Custard:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Whisk cream and next 6 ingredients in heavy large saucepan.  Bring to simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat.  Whisk sugar and egg yolks in medium bowl.  Gradually stir hot pumpkin mixture into egg yolk mixture.

Pour pumpkin custard into 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass baking dish; cover with foil.  Place dish in 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan.  Fill baking pan with enough hot water to come halfway up sides of dish.  Bake until custard is set in center, about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Cool completely.  Cover and chill until cold, at least 4 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.)

For Profiteroles:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.  Bring 1/2 cup water, milk, butter, sugar, and salt to boil in heavy large saucepan.  Stir in flour; cook over medium-high heat, stirring vigorously, until dough is smooth and pulls away from sides of pan, about 1 minute.  Transfer hot mixture to standing mixer.  Beat dough with paddle attachment at medium speed until slightly cool, about 3 minutes.  Add 3 eggs, 1 at a time, beating until blended after each addition.  Beat in egg yolk until blended.

Spoon 16 mounds of batter about the size of large eggs onto prepared sheets, spacing about 2 inches apart.  Beat remaining egg in small bowl to blend.  Brush tops of profiteroles lightly with beaten egg.  Bake 15 minutes.  Reduce oven to 375 degrees.  Continue baking until puffed and dark golden brown, about 30 minutes longer.  Transfer to rack to cool completely.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Store in airtight container in freezer.  Remove from freezer a few hours before continuing.)

Rewarm caramel sauce.  Using serrated knife, slice profiteroles horizontally in half.  Spoon rounded 1/3 cup filling into bottom half of each profiterole.  Cover with top halves.  Drizzle with sauce.  Spoon dollop of whipped cream atop profiteroles.  Sprinkle with chopped pecans and serve.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  Don't have a standing mixer with a paddle attachment?  Use a handheld mixer instead.

For Maple Caramel:  Stir sugar and butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until blended and smooth.  Whisk in cream.  Bring to boil, stirring until caramel bits dissolve.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in bourbon and vanilla; simmer 1 minute.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Pumpkin Custard:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Whisk cream and next 6 ingredients in heavy large saucepan.  Bring to simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat.  Whisk sugar and egg yolks in medium bowl.  Gradually stir hot pumpkin mixture into egg yolk mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour pumpkin custard into 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass baking dish; cover with foil.  Place dish in 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan.  Fill baking pan with enough hot water to come halfway up sides of dish.  Bake until custard is set in center, about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Cool completely.  Cover and chill until cold, at least 4 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Profiteroles:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.  Bring 1/2 cup water, milk, butter, sugar, and salt to boil in heavy large saucepan.  Stir in flour; cook over medium-high heat, stirring vigorously, until dough is smooth and pulls away from sides of pan, about 1 minute.  Transfer hot mixture to standing mixer.  Beat dough with paddle attachment at medium speed until slightly cool, about 3 minutes.  Add 3 eggs, 1 at a time, beating until blended after each addition.  Beat in egg yolk until blended.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon 16 mounds of batter about the size of large eggs onto prepared sheets, spacing about 2 inches apart.  Beat remaining egg in small bowl to blend.  Brush tops of profiteroles lightly with beaten egg.  Bake 15 minutes.  Reduce oven to 375 degrees.  Continue baking until puffed and dark golden brown, about 30 minutes longer.  Transfer to rack to cool completely.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Store in airtight container in freezer.  Remove from freezer a few hours before continuing.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rewarm caramel sauce.  Using serrated knife, slice profiteroles horizontally in half.  Spoon rounded 1/3 cup filling into bottom half of each profiterole.  Cover with top halves.  Drizzle with sauce.  Spoon dollop of whipped cream atop profiteroles.  Sprinkle with chopped pecans and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 16 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Test-Kitchen Tip:  Don&apos;t have a standing mixer with a paddle attachment?  Use a handheld mixer instead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- thawed
                        = (half of 17.3-oz pkg)
  3             medium  Golden Delicious apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and very thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- melted
  3        tablespoons  cinnamon sugar
                        = (or 3 tbspns sugar mixed with
                        a scant 1/2 tspn ground cinnamon)
     1/4           cup  apricot jam -- melted

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line baking sheet with parchment paper.  Unfold pastry on parchment paper.  Using tines of fork, pierce 1/2-inch border around edge of pastry, then pierce center all over.

Arrange apples atop pastry in 4 rows, overlapping apple slices and leaving border clear.  Brush apples with melted butter; sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.

Bake 30 minutes.  Brush melted jam over apples.  Bake tart until golden, about 8 minutes longer.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This dessert is as impressive as it is simple.  And any number of variations would be equally tempting.  Try using a mixture of apples and pears, substituting ground ginger for the cinnamon, or sprinkling the warm tart with finely chopped pecans.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Easy Tart Crust -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  raisins
     1/4           cup  medium-dry Sherry
                        = (such as amontillado)
  2        tablespoons  water
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  30             whole  almonds -- toasted
                        Coarse sea salt -- as needed

Lightly butter 30 mini-muffin cups.  Roll out crust on lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness.  Using floured 2 3/4- to 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut out rounds.  Gather dough scraps and reroll, cutting out additional rounds for total of 30.  Press each dough round firmly over bottom and up sides of prepared mini-muffin cups.  Freeze 20 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake crusts until golden, occasionally pressing on bottom and sides of crusts with spoon if crusts bubble and slide down sides of cups, about 25 minutes.  Transfer pans to rack and cool crusts in pans while making filling.  Maintain oven temperature.

Combine raisins, Sherry, 2 tablespoons water, and pinch of salt in heavy small saucepan.  Bring to boil.  Remove from heat; let stand uncovered until liquid is almost absorbed, about 10 minutes.  Stir cream into raisin mixture; bring to boil.  Remove from heat.  Whisk eggs, sugar, 1 tablespoon oil, cinnamon, and vanilla in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in hot raisin-cream mixture.  Return mixture to saucepan.  Stir constantly over medium-low heat until mixture thickens slightly to sauce consistency, about 6 minutes (do not boil).

Spoon raisin custard into tartlet crusts, dividing equally.  Bake tartlets until filling is just barely set but still moves slightly in center when pans are shaken gently, about 10 minutes.  Cool completely in pans on rack.  Run small sharp knife around crust edges to loosen; gently remove from pans.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

Toss almonds with remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in small bowl.  Top each tartlet with 1 almond and sprinkle lightly with sea salt.  Place tartlets on plates and serve.

This recipe yields about 30 tartlets.

Comments:  Any size mini-muffin pan can be used to bake the tartlets, but the nonstick variety works best.

Return mixture to saucepan.  Stir constantly over medium-low heat until mixture thickens slightly to sauce consistency, about 6 minutes (do not boil).

Spoon raisin custard into tartlet crusts, dividing equally.  Bake tartlets until filling is just barely set but still moves slightly in center when pans are shaken gently, about 10 minutes.  Cool completely in pans on rack.  Run small sharp knife around crust edges to loosen; gently remove from pans.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Toss almonds with remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in small bowl.  Top each tartlet with 1 almond and sprinkle lightly with sea salt.  Place tartlets on plates and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 30 tartlets.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Any size mini-muffin pan can be used to bake the tartlets, but the nonstick variety works best.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (28 oz) -- well drained,
                        and juices reserved
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped white onion
  3              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  3              small  bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  dried Mexican oregano
     1/4           cup  chopped pitted green olives
  2        tablespoons  raisins
  2        tablespoons  drained capers
  6                     red snapper fillets - (4 to 5 oz ea)
  3                     pickled jalapeÒo chiles -- halved lengthwise

Place drained tomatoes in medium bowl.  Using potato masher, crush tomatoes to coarse puree.  Drain again, reserving juices.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and stir 30 seconds.  Add garlic and stir 30 seconds.  Add tomato puree and cook 1 minute.  Add bay leaves, parsley, oregano, and 1/4 cup reserved tomato juices.  Simmer until sauce thickens, about 3 minutes.  Add olives, raisins, capers, and all remaining reserved tomato juices.  Simmer until sauce thickens again, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Spread 3 tablespoons sauce in bottom of 15- by 10- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Arrange fish atop sauce.  Sprinkle fish lightly with salt and pepper.  Spoon remaining sauce over.  Bake uncovered until fish is just opaque in center, about 18 minutes.  Using long spatula, transfer fish with sauce to plates.  Garnish with pickled jalapeÒo halves.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  In a traditional Veracruzan household, you would find papas cambray (roasted tiny white potatoes) and a bowl of savory white rice served alongside.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  water
  2               cups  long-grain white rice
  6                     lemon peel strips, 2" by 1/2" -- (yellow part only)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  5               cups  whole milk -- or more if needed
  1                cup  sweetened condensed milk
  1                cup  evaporated milk
  2                     canela sticks
                        = (or cinnamon sticks)
  2                     vanilla beans -- split lengthwise
     3/4           cup  brown raisins or golden raisins
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        Ground cinnamon
                        Grated peel from 1 lemon
                        Additional canela sticks -- (optional)
                        = (or cinnamon sticks)

Bring 2 cups water to boil in medium saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add rice; let stand 15 minutes.  Pour rice into strainer and drain, then rinse rice under cold running water until water runs clear.

Bring 4 cups water to boil in large saucepan.  Add rice, lemon peel strips, and salt and return to boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is almost tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain.  Discard lemon peel.

Combine 5 cups milk, sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and 2 canela sticks in heavy large saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla beans; add beans.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium and boil gently until mixture thickens and is reduced to 2 3/4 cups, about 30 minutes.  Stir in rice, raisins, and sugar.  Stir until raisins are plump and flavors blend, about 5 minutes.

Spoon pudding into bowls.  Sprinkle with ground cinnamon and grated lemon peel.  Garnish with canela sticks, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Mexican cooks prefer Ceylon cinnamon, a less pungent variety than the cassia cinnamon sold in U.S. markets.  In Latin American markets, it will simply be labeled canela (Spanish for "cinnamon").  In supermarkets or specialty foods stores, look for Ceylon or Sri Lanka cinnamon.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  small tomatillos - (abt 8) -- husked, rinsed
  1              large  jalapeÒo chile -- stemmed
  10             large  fresh mint leaves
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped white onion

Preheat broiler.  Line baking sheet with aluminum foil.  Arrange tomatillos and jalapeÒo chile on prepared baking sheet.  Broil until tomatillos and jalapeÒo chile are soft and blackened in spots, about 5 minutes per side.

Cool; transfer tomatillos, jalapeÒo chile, and any juices on baking sheet to blender.  Add fresh mint and lime juice; blend to coarse puree.  Transfer mixture to bowl; mix in chopped onion.  Season salsa with salt.

This recipe yields about 1 cup.

Comments:  This tart, mildly spicy, and bright green salsa is so delicious that you might want to double the recipe to have extra on hand.  It's great mixed into guacamole or veggie sautÈs (for a little tangy kick).  Or try it as a topping for anything from nachos to scrambled eggs to baked potatoes.

This recipe is an accompaniment for Oval Masa Cakes With Goat Cheese Filling.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BEEF ===
  1                     flank steak - (abt 1 lb)
  1                     white onion -- quartered
  1         tablespoon  fine sea salt
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, crushed
  4              whole  black peppercorns
  1                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  dried Mexican oregano
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  3        tablespoons  distilled white vinegar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  dried Mexican oregano
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  2              large  tomatoes -- cut into wedges
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced red onion
  2                     romaine lettuce hearts -- cored, and
                        leaves quartered crosswise
  6                     radishes -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  2                     avocados -- halved, peeled,
                        pitted, and sliced
                        Bowl of corn tortilla chips

For Beef:  Place steak in large pot.  Add enough water to cover steak by 2 inches (about 10 cups).  Add onion, salt, garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaf.  Bring to boil over high heat, skimming any foam from top of cooking liquid.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Add oregano.  Simmer un-covered until steak is tender, adding more water to cover steak if necessary, about 1 1/2 hours.  Cool slightly.  Refrigerate uncovered until meat and liquid are cold, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.

Remove steak from liquid, reserving liquid.  Trim excess fat.  Cut steak crosswise into 3 pieces, then shred coarsely.  Transfer beef to large bowl.  Add enough cooking liquid to bowl to cover beef completely.

For Vinaigrette:  Whisk vinegar, lime juice, oregano, salt, and pepper in small bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in oil.  (Shredded beef and vinaigrette can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately; chill.  Bring vinaigrette to room temperature and rewhisk before using.)

For Assembly:  Combine tomatoes, red onion, and 3 tablespoons vinaigrette in medium bowl; toss to coat.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Drain all cooking liquid from shredded beef.  Add lettuce, radishes, and cilantro to bowl with beef.  Mix in enough of remaining vinaigrette to coat.  Season salad to taste with salt and pepper.

Divide salad among plates; surround with tomato mixture.  Garnish with avocado slices.  Serve with corn chips.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Not truly a salad but a dish of seasoned cold shredded meat, a salpicÛn is usually eaten folded into hot tortillas or piled onto crispy tostadas.  It is a refreshing party dish ideal for a summer buffet.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MINT PESTO ===
     1/2           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  feta cheese - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  Parmesan cheese - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-chopped jalapeÒo chile
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  fresh mint leaves - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === SHRIMP ===
  24             large  uncooked shrimp - (abt 2 lbs) -- peeled, deveined,
                        and tails left intact
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  24                    woody 4"-long rosemary sprigs

For Mint Pesto:  Combine first 7 ingredients in processor.  Using on/off turns, process until mixture is smooth.  Add mint leaves and lemon juice; process until smooth, stopping occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl.  Gradually add oil and process until mint pesto is smooth and creamy.  (Can be made 1 day ahead; cover and refrigerate.)

For Shrimp:  Preheat broiler.  Sprinkle shrimp with salt and pepper.  Whisk oil, garlic, and parsley in medium bowl to blend.  Add shrimp; toss to coat.  Let stand at room temperature 15 minutes.  Arrange shrimp in single layer on broiler pan.  Broil until opaque in center, about 2 minutes per side.

Transfer to large bowl; sprinkle with lemon juice and toss with 1/2 cup mint pesto.  Starting at base end of rosemary, skewer 1 shrimp on each sprig.  Arrange on platter and serve.

This recipe yields 24 shrimp.

What To Drink:  Pinot Grigio.

Comments:  Rosemary sprigs double as flavoring agents and skewers in this beautiful hors d'oeuvre.  Only half of the pesto is used for this recipe; toss the remainder with pasta or spread thinly on crostini or grilled chicken breasts.

For Shrimp:  Preheat broiler.  Sprinkle shrimp with salt and pepper.  Whisk oil, garlic, and parsley in medium bowl to blend.  Add shrimp; toss to coat.  Let stand at room temperature 15 minutes.  Arrange shrimp in single layer on broiler pan.  Broil until opaque in center, about 2 minutes per side.

Mix in shrimp, scallops, and lobster.  Cover; simmer until seafood is just cooked through, adding water by 1/4 cupfuls if paella is dry, about 6 minutes.  Uncover; simmer until noodles are tender, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon parsley.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     bags fresh spinach leaves - (10 oz ea)
  3                     red bell peppers
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  3             medium  leeks -- thinly sliced
                        = (white and pale green parts - 3 cups)
  1              large  shallot -- chopped (1/4 cup)
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  whipping cream
  4              large  eggs
  1                cup  part-skim ricotta cheese
     1/2           cup  grated Swiss cheese
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Heat large deep nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Working in batches (about 10 cups at a time), sautÈ fresh spinach in dry skillet until bright green and wilted, about 2 minutes per batch.  Transfer spinach to strainer.  Squeeze spinach dry; roll in kitchen towel to remove excess water.

Char peppers directly over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag; let stand 10 minutes.  Peel, seed, and slice peppers into 1/4-inch-wide strips.

Melt butter with oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add leeks, shallot, and garlic; cook until soft, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Whisk cream and eggs in large bowl to blend.  Whisk in all cheeses, salt, and pepper.  Stir in spinach, leek mixture, and 2/3 of roasted red peppers (reserve 1/3 of peppers for topping).  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish.  Transfer spinach mixture to prepared dish.  Bake gratin until knife inserted into center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.  Arrange remaining red pepper strips decoratively atop gratin and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Creamed spinach gets a makeover with three cheeses and a vibrant garnish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  12            ounces  poblano chiles - (abt 4 medium)
  1                can  whole tomatoes in juice - (15 1/2 oz) -- drained
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2               cups  crumbled queso fresco - (abt 8 oz)
                        = (or feta cheese)
                        === DOUGH ===
  2               cups  freshly-ground corn masa dough for
                        tortillas - (abt 17 oz)
                        = (or make masa dough with 1 3/4 cups
                        masa harina [corn tortilla mix; abt 8 1/2
                        oz] mixed with 1 cup plus 2 tbspns warm
                        water)
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Warm water -- as needed
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

For Filling:  Char poblano chiles directly over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes.  Peel, seed, and slice chiles into 1/4-inch strips.

Place tomatoes in processor; chop coarsely.  Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add tomatoes and cook 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add chiles; cook until mixture thickens, stirring often, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat; mix in cheese.  Season with salt.

For Dough:  Combine fresh masa or masa harina mixture, flour, baking powder, and salt in large bowl.  Knead to blend well, adding warm water by tablespoonfuls as needed until dough is soft but not sticky.  Divide dough into 10 equal portions; roll each into ball.  Place balls on sheet of aluminum foil.  Cover balls of dough with plastic wrap to prevent drying.

Cut two 8-inch rounds from heavy-duty resealable plastic bag.  Place 1 round on bottom half of tortilla press.  Place 1 dough ball in center; top with second plastic round.  Close tortilla press, gently flattening dough to 4-inch round about 1/4 inch thick.  Peel off top plastic.  Lift bottom plastic and peel dough round off.  Place on sheet of waxed paper.  Shape remaining 9 balls into 4-inch rounds.

Line baking sheet with aluminum foil.  Heat heavy large griddle or skillet over medium heat.  Place two 4-inch rounds at a time on griddle or skillet.  Cook until just light brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer gorditas to prepared baking sheet.  (Filling and gorditas can be made 2 hours ahead.  Cover loosely; let stand at room temperature.)

Pour enough oil into heavy large skillet to reach depth of 1/2 inch.  Attach deep-fry thermometer.  Heat oil over medium heat to 325 degrees to 350 degrees.  Fry 2 or 3 gorditas at a time until crisp and slightly puffed, 30 seconds per side.  Transfer to paper towels to drain.

Cut halfway around edge of each gordita to make opening.  Gently squeeze sides to open shell.  Spoon about 1/4 cup filling into each opening.  Arrange gorditas on platter; serve warm.

This recipe yields 10 gorditas.

Bring brown sugar, 1 cup water, and orange juice to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Boil until syrup reduces to 2 cups, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and whisk in cinnamon.

Combine remaining 1 cup water, butter, sugar, and salt in medium saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until butter melts.  Remove saucepan from heat and add flour.  Using wooden spoon, stir until smooth.  Return saucepan to heat and stir until mixture thickens and comes away from sides of saucepan, about 2 minutes.  Transfer mixture to large bowl.  Cool 5 minutes.  Using electric mixer, add eggs 1 at a time, beating until dough is thick and smooth after each addition.

Add enough oil to heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 2 inches.  Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 375 degrees.  Working in batches, add 1 heaping teaspoonful batter to oil for each fritter.  Fry until golden and tripled in size, about 8 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer fritters to paper towels to drain.

Mound fritters on serving platter.  Dust with powdered sugar and drizzle with cinnamon syrup.  Serve, passing remaining syrup separately.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Juana writes; "Growing up in Cuernavaca, just outside Mexico City, I remember my grandmother cooking elaborate Mexican meals every day.  My mother continued that tradition, but not in such an all-consuming manner.  For her it was a great joy to plan a menu and then invite people to help with the preparation.

"The women in my life taught me the beauty of a good meal.  I still use many of their recipes today, but unlike my grandmother I don't spend an entire day in the kitchen.  Fortunately, my husband and kids like to cook, so I've found a balance between my grandmother's time-intensive recipes and my mother's practicality. "

Juana serves these fritters for dessert, but they make a great breakfast dish, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  4        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
  3               cups  pecans - (abt 10 oz) -- divided
  6              large  eggs
  2               cups  sugar
  2               cups  dark corn syrup
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Lightly-sweetened whipped cream

For Crust:  Blend flour and salt in processor 10 seconds.  Add butter; cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 4 tablespoons ice water; blend just until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if mixture is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic; chill 1 hour.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep chilled.  Soften slightly at room temperature before rolling out.)

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coarsely chop 2 cups pecans and reserve.  Spread 1 cup pecans on rimmed baking sheet.  Toast in oven until nuts are aromatic and darker in color, about 12 minutes.  Cool, then grind nuts finely in processor.  Maintain oven temperature.

Roll out crust on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round (crust will be thin).  Transfer crust to 10-inch-diameter pie dish.  Fold overhang under, forming high-standing rim.  Crimp edges decoratively.  Freeze crust 20 minutes.

Whisk eggs in large bowl until frothy.  Add sugar, corn syrup, melted butter, vanilla, salt, and ground toasted pecans; whisk until blended.  Mix in chopped pecans.  Pour filling into crust.

Bake pie until crust is golden and filling is puffed and set (center may still move when dish is shaken), about 1 hour 10 minutes.  Transfer to rack and cool at least 3 hours.  (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)  Cut pie into wedges and serve slightly warm or at room temperature with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 1 pie.

Comments:  Toasting the pecans before adding them to the filling deepens the flavors in the pie.

  6                     dried guajillo chiles -- stemmed

  12                    white corn tortillas - (5" to 6" dia)
     2/3           cup  corn oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  corn oil
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped plum tomatoes
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/4         small  white onion
  2              large  garlic cloves
  1                     large sprig fresh epazote
                        = (or 2 large fresh cilantro sprigs)
  1              pinch  baking soda
  4               cups  low-salt chicken broth
     1/2           cup  crumbled queso fresco
  1              small  avocado -- peeled, pitted,
                        and diced
     1/4           cup  crema mexicana*
                        = (or sour cream)

* Cultured Mexican cream with a slightly nutty flavor and consistency of thin sour cream.

Cut slit in 1 long side of each chile; pull open.  Remove seeds and membranes; press chiles flat.  Cut pasilla chiles into 1- by 1/4-inch strips.

Cut 6 tortillas into 1- by 1/4-inch strips.  Heat 2/3 cup oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat until very hot.  Working in batches, add tortilla strips to skillet; toss until crisp and golden, about 1 minute.  Using slotted spoon, transfer strips to paper towels.

One at a time, fry 6 whole tortillas in oil until golden and almost crisp, about 30 seconds per side.  Transfer to paper towels.

Working in batches, add guajillo chiles to skillet; press with spatula until chiles begin to blister, about 10 seconds per side.  Transfer to paper towels.  Add pasilla chile strips to skillet; stir 10 seconds.  Transfer to paper towels to drain.

Combine tomatoes and next 5 ingredients in heavy large pot.  Coarsely crumble whole tortillas, then guajillo chiles into pot.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium; cover and simmer until water is almost absorbed and chiles are soft, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes.

Working in 3 batches, puree mixture in blender until smooth, adding 1/4 cup broth to each batch.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add tomato mixture; stir until thick and deeper in color, about 2 minutes.  Add 3 1/4 cups broth; bring to boil.  Simmer 8 minutes to develop flavors.  Season with salt.

Ladle soup into bowls.  Garnish each serving with tortilla strips, chile strips, cheese, diced avocado, and crema.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  MarÌa writes; "I came to the United States as an exchange student, after spending the first 18 years of my life in MÈrida, Yucat·n.  On school vacations I would go home and cook with my mother and sisters so that I wouldn't lose my touch.  My mother was a skilled cook, and I was lucky to have learned at her side.  Her food was so popular in our neighborhood that she sold portions of our daily meals to other families.  With nine well-fed kids, she said we were her best advertisement.

"I still take great pride in the food of my homeland.  Yucatecan cuisine is known for its Mayan influence, and the essential ingredients we use ó limes, spices, avocados, tomatoes, peppers ó make for wonderful flavors.  Now that ground spices are readily available and vegetables can be quickly chopped in a food processor, preparing traditional Mexican dishes is easier than ever."

This dish is the Yucatecan version of huevos rancheros.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  8             ounces  Coconut Shortbread Cookies -- (see recipe)
                        = (abt 30 cookies)
                        === FILLING ===
  2           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  8             ounces  fromage blanc* -- room temperature
                        = (or fresh whole-milk ricotta cheese**)
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  4              large  eggs
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Unsweetened coconut chips*** -- lightly toasted
                        Cut-up fresh tropical fruits

* Fromage blanc is sold at cheese stores, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

** Fresh ricotta cheese is sold at Italian markets and some supermarkets.

*** Unsweetened coconut chips are available at natural foods stores and some supermarkets.

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Finely grind cookies in processor.  Press crumbs (about 1 1/2 cups) over bottom (not sides) of 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 1/2-inch-high sides (layer will be thin).  Bake until crust is crisp, about 10 minutes.  Cool on rack while preparing filling.  Maintain oven temperature.

For Filling:  Using electric mixer, beat first 3 ingredients in large bowl until smooth.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean.  Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, just until blended.  Pour filling over crust in pan (mixture will not fill pan).  Bake cake until filling is just set and puffed around edges, about 45 minutes (cake may crack).

For Topping:  Whisk first 3 ingredients in small bowl to blend; spread over top of hot cake.  Return cake to oven and bake 5 minutes.  Run small knife between top edge of cake and pan.  Chill cake uncovered overnight.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover; keep chilled.)

Release pan sides.  Sprinkle toasted coconut chips around top edge of cake.  Serve cake with tropical fruits.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  The shortbread cookie crumbs will hold together in the pan without any additional butter.  Fromage blanc gives this cheesecake a light and silky texture.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  water
  9             ounces  piloncillo*
  1                cup  distilled white vinegar
  1              piece  canela - (abt 2")**
                        = (or cinnamon stick}
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6              large  ancho chiles
  1              pound  red-skinned potatoes
  1              pound  ahi tuna steaks, 1" thick
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped white onion
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro
  4             ounces  mixed baby greens
  1              large  avocado -- halved, pitted,
                        peeled, and cut into 12 slices

* Mexican raw sugar shaped into hard cones.  Smaller chunks are sometimes labeled panocha.  If neither is available, substitute and equal weight of packed dark brown sugar.

** Mexican cinnamon sticks with a delicate, floral flavor.

Bring 3 cups water and piloncillo to boil in medium saucepan.  Add white vinegar, canela, and salt; simmer until piloncillo has dissolved, stirring often, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Add chiles and soak until softened, occasionally pressing to submerge, about 1 hour; drain.  Pat chiles dry; slit lengthwise and remove seeds.

Cook red-skinned potatoes in pot of boiling salted water until skewer easily pierces centers, about 35 minutes.  Drain.  Cool, peel, and cut potatoes into 1-inch cubes.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Season tuna with salt.  Grill until light brown at edges but pink in center, about 3 minutes per side.  Cut tuna into 1-inch cubes.  Whisk together 1/4 cup oil and next 5 ingredients in large bowl.  Fold in potatoes and tuna.  Season with salt.  Fill chiles with tuna-potato mixture.

Whisk remaining 1/4 cup oil, apple cider vinegar, and cilantro in medium bowl.  Season with salt.  In large bowl, toss greens with 2 tablespoons vinaigrette to coat.  Divide salad among plates.  Top with chiles and avocado slices; drizzle with some of remaining vinaigrette.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This is more sweet than spicy, because the chiles are softened in brown sugar and vinegar before stuffing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dried Great Northern beans
  4               cups  water
     1/2         small  onion -- quartered
  2                     fresh 4"-long rosemary sprigs
  1                cup  drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped shallots
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
     1/2           cup  boiling water -- or more if needed
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish
                        Toasted pita triangles -- for serving

Place beans in medium saucepan.  Add enough cold water to cover beans by 3 inches.  Let stand overnight.

Drain beans well.  Return to saucepan.  Add 4 cups water, onion, and rosemary sprigs.  Bring to boil; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until beans are soft, about 1 hour 45 minutes.  Discard rosemary sprigs.  Drain beans and onion; cool to room temperature.

Using on/off turns, puree drained beans and onion, sun-dried tomatoes, shallots, and chopped rosemary in processor until smooth, stopping occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl.  Add 3 tablespoons oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper.  Puree until blended.  With machine running, gradually add 1/2 cup boiling water.  Thin with more water by tablespoonfuls if necessary.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Transfer white bean puree to wide shallow bowl; drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with parsley.  Garnish with lemon wedges.  Serve with toasted pita triangles.

This recipe yields 4 cups.

Comments:  A twist on hummus, this sunset-colored dip also makes a delicious sandwich spread.  Allow time for soaking the beans overnight.

Drain beans well.  Return to saucepan.  Add 4 cups water, onion, and rosemary sprigs.  Bring to boil; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until beans are soft, about 1 hour 45 minutes.  Discard rosemary sprigs.  Drain beans and onion; cool to room temperature.

<DirT>
Using on/off turns, puree drained beans and onion, sun-dried tomatoes, shallots, and chopped rosemary in processor until smooth, stopping occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl.  Add 3 tablespoons oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper.  Puree until blended.  With machine running, gradually add 1/2 cup boiling water.  Thin with more water by tablespoonfuls if necessary.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

<DirT>
Transfer white bean puree to wide shallow bowl; drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with parsley.  Garnish with lemon wedges.  Serve with toasted pita triangles.

This recipe yields 4 cups.

Comments:  A twist on hummus, this sunset-colored dip also makes a delicious sandwich spread.  Allow time for soaking the beans overnight.

Market Tip:  Not all supermarkets have lamb shanks on hand, so call ahead in case you need to order them.

Comments:  If an herbes de Provence blend isn't available, use a combination of dried thyme, basil, savory, and fennel seeds.  Dried porcini can be found at Italian markets, specialty foods stores, and many supermarkets.
