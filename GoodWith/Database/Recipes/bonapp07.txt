  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  cake flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  3        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening -- frozen, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  5        tablespoons  chilled whole milk -- or more if needed
                        === TOPPING ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  old-fashioned oats
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  4                     Golden Delicious apples - (8 to 9 oz ea) -- peeled, quartered,
                        cored, sliced 1/4" thick, each slice
                        cut crosswise into 3 pieces
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  3        tablespoons  apricot preserves
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  whipping cream -- for glaze

For Crust:  Blend first 4 ingredients in processor.  Add butter and shortening; using on/off turns, process until butter is reduced to pea-size pieces.  Add 5 tablespoons milk and blend until moist clumps form, adding more milk by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic; chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

For Topping:  Combine first 4 ingredients in medium bowl.  Gradually add butter, stirring until moist clumps form.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

For Filling:  Stir apples, sugar and lemon juice in large bowl to blend.

To Assemble:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Roll out dough on lightly floured sheet of parchment paper to 14-inch round, occasionally lifting and turning dough to prevent sticking.  Transfer dough on parchment to rimless baking sheet.

Leaving 2-inch plain border, spread preserves over center of dough.  Sprinkle preserves with 3/4 cup topping mixture.  Spoon apple mixture over topping, mounding slightly in center; sprinkle apples with remaining topping.  Using parchment as aid, fold dough border in over apple filling (border will not cover filling completely).  Press border firmly to hold shape and keep in place.  Carefully peel back parchment.  Brush border generously with glaze.

Bake pie until crust is set, about 25 minutes.  Reduce temperature to 325 degrees.  Bake until apples are tender, covering topping loosely with foil if browning too quickly, about 40 minutes longer.  Cool pie on baking sheet at least 30 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This free-form apple pie is shaped and cooked on a baking sheet-eliminating the need for a pie dish.  Using milk instead of water in the crust makes it tender.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     Granny Smith apple -- seeded, peeled,
                        and cut into 1/4"-thick slices
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  4              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  whole milk
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- plus
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/4      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Toss apple slices with lemon juice in medium bowl.

Whisk eggs and milk in large bowl to blend.  Add flour, 1 tablespoon sugar and salt; whisk until batter is almost smooth (small lumps of flour will remain).

Mix brown sugar, cinnamon and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in small bowl.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in each of two 6-inch ovenproof nonstick skillets over medium heat.  Pour half of batter into each skillet.  Arrange half of apple slices evenly over batter in each skillet.

Transfer skillets to oven and bake until pancakes are set around edges but still wet in center, about 8 minutes.  Remove from oven; sprinkle half of brown sugar mixture over each pancake.  Dot each with 1 tablespoon butter.  Using spatula, carefully turn pancakes over.  Return to oven.  Bake until pancakes rise, sugar mixture melts to sauce consistency and top of pancakes is golden, about 6 minutes.  Invert onto plates.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  During a summer trip to Santa Fe, Joan Coulliette of Sandy, Utah, had a wonderful baked apple pancake for breakfast at Atalaya restaurant.

The restaurant has closed, but we were able to get the recipe for the pancakes.

            Baked Grits With Ham, Wild Mushrooms And Parmesan

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 3/4           cups  water
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  corn grits -- see * Note
     3/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese - (abt 3 oz)
     1/2           cup  grated white cheddar cheese - (packed)
  4        tablespoons  butter - (1/2 stick)
  1              large  egg
  4               cups  assorted fresh wild mushrooms -- sliced
                        = (such as chanterelle, morel, stemmed
                        shiitake or oyster)
     1/2           cup  matchstick-size strips country ham
  2        tablespoons  minced shallot
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Corn grits, also known as polenta, are available at Italian markets, natural foods stores and some supermarkets.  If unavailable, substitute 1 cup regular yellow cornmeal, and simmer about 10 minutes.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Butter 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Bring 4 3/4 cups water and salt to boil in heavy medium pot.  Add corn grits to boiling water in thin steady stream, stirring constantly.  Reduce temperature and simmer grits until thick, stirring frequently, about 20 minutes.

Pour cooked grits into large mixing bowl.  Whisk in 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, grated cheddar cheese and 2 tablespoons butter. Season grits to taste with pepper.  Whisk in egg.  Transfer to prepared baking dish.  Place dish in large roasting pan.  Fill roasting pan with enough hot water to come halfway up sides of baking dish.  Bake until grits are firm to touch, about 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add assorted mushrooms, ham and minced shallot and sautÈ until mushrooms are tender, about 4 minutes.  Add white wine and cook until almost all liquid is absorbed, about 3 minutes.  Add whipping cream and cook until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.  Stir in fresh thyme.  Season mixture to taste with salt and pepper.

Spoon baked corn grits onto plates.  Top with mushroom and ham mixture.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "Recently I had dinner at Highlands Bar & Grill in Birmingham, Alabama.  To say I was dazzled by the baked grits is not overstating the case," writes Mary Lane Stiglets of Jackson, Mississippi.  "This divine and truly southern recipe should be printed in your magazine for all to enjoy."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  25                    garlic cloves -- unpeeled
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
  1                cup  olive oil, preferably extra-virgin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh rosemary

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place unpeeled garlic cloves in baking dish.  Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss to coat.  Cover dish tightly with foil and bake until garlic is golden brown and tender, about 45 minutes.  Cool.

Squeeze garlic between fingertips to release cloves.  Transfer garlic cloves to blender.  Add vinegar and rosemary and puree herb mixture until smooth.  With machine running, gradually add remaining 1 cup olive oil.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Dipping oil can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Let stand 15 minutes at room temperature and whisk before using.)

This recipe yields about 2 cups.

Comments:  Ami Askins of San Diego, California tried a garlicky dipping oil at Grappa in Park City, Utah.  And although bottles of the oil are sold at the restaurant, she'd like to be able to make it fresh at home.

Try this versatile dipping oil with bite-size pieces of your favorite breads -- or drizzled over sliced tomatoes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  1              pound  purchased frozen semisweet
                        chocolate chip cookie dough -- thawed
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  5              large  egg yolks
  7               cups  whole milk
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  1         tablespoon  dark rum
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  3             medium  bananas -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2"-thick slices
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar
                        Chocolate curls -- (optional)

Spray 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish with nonstick spray.  Arrange 3/4 of cookie dough in prepared dish (reserve remaining dough for another use).  Press dough evenly onto bottom and up sides of dish, building high-standing dough edge on rim of dish.  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup nuts; press nuts into dough.  Pierce dough all over with toothpick.  Freeze crust 1 hour.

Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Fold 36-inch-long piece of foil lengthwise into thirds, forming 36- by 4-inch strip.  Place pie dish on baking sheet.  Stand foil strip snugly around dish, protecting outer edge of crust; secure overlap with paper clip.  Bake crust until golden and dry to touch, about 25 minutes.  Cool completely.

Meanwhile, whisk 1/3 cup sugar, cornstarch, and salt to blend in heavy medium saucepan.  Whisk in yolks; gradually add milk, whisking until smooth.  Whisk over medium-high heat until custard thickens and boils, about 6 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in butter, rum, and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Transfer to large bowl; cool to lukewarm, whisking occasionally, about 45 minutes.

Spread 1 cup custard in crust.  Top with 3 sliced bananas, then remaining custard, covering bananas completely.  Chill pie until filling sets, about 2 hours.  Beat cream, powdered sugar and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla in medium bowl to peaks.  Spread cream over pie.  Refrigerate at least 1 and up to 8 hours.  Garnish pie with chocolate curls, if desired.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Spray 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish with nonstick spray.  Arrange 3/4 of cookie dough in prepared dish (reserve remaining dough for another use).  Press dough evenly onto bottom and up sides of dish, building high-standing dough edge on rim of dish.  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup nuts; press nuts into dough.  Pierce dough all over with toothpick.  Freeze crust 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Fold 36-inch-long piece of foil lengthwise into thirds, forming 36- by 4-inch strip.  Place pie dish on baking sheet.  Stand foil strip snugly around dish, protecting outer edge of crust; secure overlap with paper clip.  Bake crust until golden and dry to touch, about 25 minutes.  Cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, whisk 1/3 cup sugar, cornstarch, and salt to blend in heavy medium saucepan.  Whisk in yolks; gradually add milk, whisking until smooth.  Whisk over medium-high heat until custard thickens and boils, about 6 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in butter, rum, and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Transfer to large bowl; cool to lukewarm, whisking occasionally, about 45 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread 1 cup custard in crust.  Top with 3 sliced bananas, then remaining custard, covering bananas completely.  Chill pie until filling sets, about 2 hours.  Beat cream, powdered sugar and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla in medium bowl to peaks.  Spread cream over pie.  Refrigerate at least 1 and up to 8 hours.  Garnish pie with chocolate curls, if desired.  Cut into wedges and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4           cups  cake flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- plus a pinch
  1                cup  mashed ripe bananas - (abt 2 large)
     1/4           cup  buttermilk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract -- plus
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  unsalted butter - (3 sticks) -- room temperature
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
  2              large  eggs
  2           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  powdered sugar
  2              large  bananas -- peeled, sliced

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly butter three 8-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides; dust pans with flour.

Combine cake flour, baking soda, baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt in medium bowl.  Mix mashed bananas, buttermilk and 1 teaspoon vanilla in another medium bowl.

Using electric mixer, beat 1/2 cup butter and sugar in large bowl until blended.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating to blend after each addition.  Add dry ingredients alternately with banana mixture in 3 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients and beating just until blended after each addition.  Divide batter equally among prepared pans.

Bake cakes until tops are just beginning to color and tester inserted into center comes out with a few crumbs attached, about 20 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Using small knife, cut around cakes to loosen; turn cakes out onto racks and cool completely.

Beat cream cheese and remaining 1 cup butter in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Beat in remaining 1 tablespoon vanilla and pinch of salt.  Gradually beat in powdered sugar.  Cover and refrigerate frosting until firm enough to spread, about 15 minutes.

Place 1 cake layer on platter.  Spread 1/2 cup frosting over top.  Place half of sliced bananas evenly over frosting, leaving 1/4-inch border at edge.  Place second cake layer on work surface.  Spread 1/4 cup frosting over top.  Place cake layer, frosting-side down, atop bananas.  Spread 1/2 cup frosting over top.  Place remaining half of sliced bananas evenly over frosting, leaving 1/4-inch border at edge.  Place third cake layer on work surface.  Spread 1/4 cup frosting over top.  Place cake layer, frosting-side down, atop bananas.  Spread remaining frosting over sides and top of cake.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Let stand 1 hour at room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3 1/2         pounds  beef back ribs or short ribs
  7 1/4           cups  beef stock or canned beef broth
  6        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2                     bay leaves
  2               cups  chopped carrots - (abt 2 med)
  1                cup  chopped onion
  2               cups  chopped zucchini - (abt 2 med)
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped mushrooms - (abt 6 oz)
  1                cup  chopped tomatoes - (abt 2 med)
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  butter -- room temperature
  1 1/2         pounds  beef tenderloin steaks -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1            package  frozen puff pastry (17 1/4 oz) -- thawed
  1              large  egg -- beaten for glaze

Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over high heat.  Add beef ribs and brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Add beef stock, tomato paste and bay leaves and bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until liquid is reduced to 4 cups, about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Discard ribs.

Add carrots and onion to pot.  Simmer until carrots are tender, about 10 minutes.  Add zucchini, mushrooms and tomatoes and simmer 8 minutes.  Mix flour and 2 tablespoons butter in small bowl until paste forms.  Stir paste into stock mixture; simmer until gravy thickens, about 3 minutes.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Before continuing, rewarm over medium heat, stirring frequently.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Butter six 1 1/4-cup custard cups or soufflÈ dishes.  Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Sprinkle beef tenderloin pieces with salt and pepper.  Add beef to skillet and cook just until outside of beef is brown, about 1 minute per side.  Transfer beef to prepared custard cups, dividing equally.  Ladle vegetable gravy over beef in cups, dividing equally.

Roll out 1 puff pastry sheet on floured surface to 12-inch square.  Using small plate as guide, cut out three 5 1/2-inch rounds from sheet.  Repeat with remaining pastry sheet.  Brush edges of pastry rounds with egg glaze.  Place 1 round, glazed-side down, atop each filled custard cup; press overhang firmly to outside of each cup.  Cut 3 vents in each pastry round.  Brush pastry with remaining egg glaze.

Bake beef tenderloin pies until pastry is golden brown and puffed, about 15 minutes.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Brian Preinfalk of Show Low, Arizona, says thereís nothing heíd rather eat on a cold winter day than one of the beef pot pies at Creaseyís Restaurant in the nearby ski resort town of Pinetop.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  4          teaspoons  baking powder

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh marjoram
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- thinly sliced
  5                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2           cups  diced seeded plum tomatoes
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped pitted Kalamata or
                        other brine-cured black olives

Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Sprinkle chicken on both sides with salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon marjoram.  Add to skillet; sautÈ until golden, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer chicken to plate.

Add 1 tablespoon oil to skillet.  Add bell pepper; sautÈ 2 minutes.  Add garlic; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add tomatoes; sautÈ until juices are released, about 3 minutes.  Stir in olives and 2 tablespoons marjoram.

Comments:  Spoon some of the sauce over noodles that have been tossed with Parmesan cheese; serve with a salad of balsamic-dressed mesclun and with crusty bread.  Almond cookies and grapes are a simple finale.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  warm water -- (105 to 115 degrees)
  1 3/4           cups  sugar
  2          envelopes  dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour - (about)
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  ground cinnamon
  1                cup  chopped pecans
  1                cup  pecan halves

Combine 1 1/2 cups warm water and 1/4 cup sugar in large bowl.  Sprinkle yeast over and let stand until foamy, about 6 minutes.  Mix in vegetable oil and salt.  Add enough flour, 1 cup at a time, to form soft dough.  Turn dough out onto floured work surface.  Knead dough until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if sticky, about 10 minutes.

Lightly oil another large bowl.  Place dough in bowl; turn to coat with oil.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap, then cover with kitchen towel.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.  Beat butter, cinnamon and remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar in medium bowl to blend.

Turn dough out onto floured work surface (do not punch down).  Roll out or press dough gently to 16- by 10-inch rectangle.  Using spatula, spread 1 cup butter mixture evenly over dough.  Sprinkle with chopped pecans.  Starting at 1 long side, roll up dough jelly-roll style, forming log.  Pinch seam and ends to seal.  Cut log crosswise into 12 equal pieces.

Spread remaining butter mixture over bottom of 15- by 10- by 2-inch metal baking pan.  Sprinkle 1 cup pecan halves evenly over butter mixture in pan.  Arrange rolls, cut-side down, in prepared pan, spacing evenly.  Cover pan with plastic wrap.  Let rolls rise in warm draft-free area until light and puffed, about 30 minutes.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Bake cinnamon rolls uncovered until tops are golden brown, about 35 minutes.

Remove pan from oven.  Using sharp knife, cut around sides of pan.  Place large baking sheet over pan.  Using oven mitts as aid, hold baking sheet and pan together and turn over, releasing cinnamon rolls onto sheet.  Serve cinnamon rolls warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 12 rolls.

Comments:  The most delectable cinnamon rolls Karen Cabral of San Antonio ever tasted are those at the Pecan St. Bakery & Cafe in Blanco, Texas.

Categories    : Custards                        Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  instant coffee crystals
  4              large  egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  brandy
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  3        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Arrange six 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups in 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan.

Combine cream and 1/4 cup sugar in heavy medium saucepan; bring almost to simmer, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Remove from heat; add coffee and whisk to dissolve.  Whisk egg yolks in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in warm cream mixture, then brandy and vanilla.  Strain custard into 4-cup measuring cup; pour into ramekins, dividing equally.  Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.

Bake custards until center moves only slightly when pan is gently shaken, about 35 minutes.  Remove custards from pan.  Chill until cold, at least 3 hours, then cover and keep chilled overnight.

Preheat broiler.  Arrange custards on baking sheet.  Press 1/2 tablespoon brown sugar through strainer onto each custard, forming even layer.  Broil 6 inches from heat source until sugar melts, bubbles and caramelizes, watching carefully and rotating sheet for even browning, about 4 minutes.  Refrigerate custards until sugar topping hardens, at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The fabulous texture and perfect balance of coffee and brandy flavors in the custard are enhanced with a crunchy brown-sugar topping.  Bake the custards a day ahead so that they chill fully before the topping is broiled.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     cooked Dungeness crab - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  5             quarts  water
  1             bottle  clam juice - (8 oz)
  1              large  onion -- halved

  3              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground turmeric
  4               cups  peeled 1" pieces butternut squash -- (abt 1 3/4 lbs)
  1                     potato - (10 oz) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     red bell pepper -- cut 1/4" strips
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- cut 1/4" strips
  1                     green bell pepper -- cut 1/4" strips
  1 1/2         pounds  bay scallops
  1 1/2           cups  frozen green peas -- thawed

Clean crab and crack; remove meat.  Reserve shells and crab butter (gray-green coating inside crab shell).  Refrigerate crab meat.  Place shells and crab butter in 8- to 10-quart stockpot.  Add water, clam juice, onion halves, carrot, thyme and cayenne.  Boil over medium heat until liquid is reduced to 9 cups, about 1 1/2 hours.  Strain stock.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Add chopped onion and garlic and sautÈ until tender, about 6 minutes.  Add curry powder and ground turmeric and stir 1 minute.  Add crab stock, butternut squash and potato.  Simmer until vegetables are very tender, about 35 minutes.  Transfer mixture to blender in batches and puree until smooth.  Return to Dutch oven.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.  Rewarm before continuing.)

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in large skillet.  Add all bell peppers and sautÈ until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.  Add bay scallops and sautÈ until almost cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Add reserved crab meat and green peas and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Ladle squash puree into bowls.  Top with seafood mixture and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A spectacular one-dish meal that gets its rich flavor from homemade crab stock.  The stock is simple to make and does not require a lot of time.  Potato helps thicken the soup; butternut squash adds color.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16                    garlic cloves -- peeled, halved
  4          teaspoons  corn oil
  1                cup  shelled pumpkin seeds
  2                     lamb racks - (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 lbs ea) -- trimmed, halved
     1/2           cup  crumbled feta cheese - (abt 3 oz)
     1/2           cup  chopped drained oil-packed
                        sun-dried tomatoes
     1/2           cup  chopped brine-cured olives
                        = (such as Kalamata)

Fill hole in each lamb rack with feta mixture, dividing equally.

Transfer lamb to prepared baking sheet.  Spread mustard over rounded side of lamb; press 1/4 of pumpkin seed coating into mustard on each lamb rack half.  Roast lamb until meat thermometer inserted near center of lamb registers 135 degrees for medium-rare, about 25 minutes.  Let lamb rest 15 minutes.

Spoon 1/3 cup Chipotle Sauce onto each plate.  Place 1 lamb rack half atop sauce on each plate.  Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  At the restaurant, the lamb is served with cilantro-corn mashed potatoes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks)
     1/4           cup  coffee liqueur
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  7              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
                        Powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Line bottom of pan with parchment paper.

Stir chocolate, butter, coffee liqueur, and vanilla in heavy large saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth.  Cool to lukewarm.  Using electric mixer, beat eggs and 1 cup sugar in large bowl until thick and pale, and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted, about 6 minutes.  Fold 1/3 of egg mixture into lukewarm chocolate mixture.  Fold remaining egg mixture into chocolate mixture.

Place prepared pan on baking sheet.  Transfer batter to prepared pan.  Bake until tester inserted into center comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 55 minutes.  Cool 5 minutes.  Gently press down edges of cake.  Cool completely in pan.  (Cake can be prepared up to 1 day ahead.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before continuing.)

Run knife around pan sides to loosen cake.  Remove sides of pan; transfer cake to platter.  Remove parchment paper.  Sprinkle cake with powdered sugar and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  "On the last night of a holiday in Costa Rica, my sweetheart and I had a candlelit dinner at CafÈ Mundo in downtown San JosÈ," writes Elizabeth Florence of New York City.  "We dined on the front porch of a Victorian house surrounded by tropical flowers.  The chocolate cake we had that evening was just incredible.  Would chef and owner Ray Johnson part with his recipe?"

Serve this with coffee ice cream or whipped cream, if desired.  Beaten eggs make this cake lighter in texture than most other flourless chocolate cakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  dried porcini mushrooms -- see * Note
  2               cups  hot water
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pound  fresh crimini mushrooms -- chopped
     1/2         pound  fresh portobello mushrooms -- stemmed, dark
                        gills scraped off, chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     bay leaf
     1/3           cup  dry Marsala
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  fusilli pasta
  1                cup  beef stock or canned beef broth
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - (3 oz)
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
                        Additional grated Parmesan cheese -- for serving

* Note:  Dried porcini mushrooms are available at Italian markets, specialty foods stores and many supermarkets.

Place porcini mushrooms in small bowl.  Pour 2 cups hot water over.  Let stand until mushrooms soften, about 25 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to work surface and coarsely chop.  Discard soaking liquid.

Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add porcini, crimini and portobello mushrooms, minced garlic and bay leaf.  SautÈ until mushrooms are brown and tender, stirring often, about 10 minutes.  Add Marsala and simmer until almost all liquid evaporates, scraping up browned bits, about 1 minute.  Season mushroom mixture to taste with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat.  (Mushroom mixture can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain well.

Mix beef stock and whipping cream into mushroom mixture and simmer 3 minutes.  Add 1 cup Parmesan cheese, butter and drained pasta; toss to coat.  Cook until sauce coats pasta, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve, passing additional grated Parmesan separately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "Mi Piaci, a local restaurant, serves a pasta entrÈe with wild mushrooms called Fusilli alla Boscaiola," says Karen Mungioli, of Dallas, Texas.  "Its flavors reminded me of a dish I had in Italy recently.  Iíd love to try my hand at preparing this authentic-tasting recipe in my home kitchen."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GNPCCHI ===
  1 1/2         pounds  russet potatoes - (abt 2 med)
  1              large  egg yolk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  grated nutmeg
  7        tablespoons  all-purpose flour - (about)
                        === MUSHROOM SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  12            ounces  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, sliced
     1/2           cup  sliced shallots
  1 3/4           cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh sage
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  3               cups  coarsely-chopped arugula
     1/2      teaspoon  white truffle oil - (optional) -- see * Note
     1/3           cup  grated Parmesan cheese

* Note:  Available at Italian markets, specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.

For gnocchi: Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Pierce potatoes with fork.  Bake until tender, about 1 hour.  Cool slightly; cut potatoes in half and scoop pulp into large bowl.  Mash potatoes well.  Mix in egg yolk, salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Mix in enough flour to form firm, slightly elastic dough.

Turn out onto lightly floured surface.  Divide dough into 4 equal portions.  Gently roll 1 portion between hands and work surface to form 1/2-inch-thick rope about 18 inches long.  Cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces.  Roll each piece over tines of dinner fork to make grooves in gnocchi.  Arrange gnocchi in single layer on floured baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining 3 portions of dough.

Working in small batches, cook gnocchi in large pot of boiling salted water until gnocchi rise to top and are tender, about 5 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi to large baking pan.  (Gnocchi can be prepared ahead.  Let stand 1 hour at room temperature, or cover and refrigerate up to 2 days.)

For Mushroom Sauce:  Cook butter and olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat until butter begins to brown, about 2 minutes.  Add mushrooms and shallots and sautÈ until golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Add stock and sage; simmer until liquid is slightly reduced, about 8 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Add gnocchi to sauce in skillet and cook until heated through, about 1 minute.  Add arugula and stir until wilted.  Divide equally among bowls.  Drizzle with truffle oil, if desired.  Sprinkle with cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "On the last night of a teachers' conference in Boulder, Colorado, I had dinner with some colleagues at a delightful little restaurant called Dandelion," says Cindy Chassee of Wyoming, Michigan.  "We sat on the patio and shared a memorable gnocchi and wild mushroom dish."

Gnocchi, tender potato dumplings, aren't difficult to make.  A hint of truffle oil intensifies the flavors in the sauce, which would also go well with other types of pasta.

For gnocchi: Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Pierce potatoes with fork.  Bake until tender, about 1 hour.  Cool slightly; cut potatoes in half and scoop pulp into large bowl.  Mash potatoes well.  Mix in egg yolk, salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Mix in enough flour to form firm, slightly elastic dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn out onto lightly floured surface.  Divide dough into 4 equal portions.  Gently roll 1 portion between hands and work surface to form 1/2-inch-thick rope about 18 inches long.  Cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces.  Roll each piece over tines of dinner fork to make grooves in gnocchi.  Arrange gnocchi in single layer on floured baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining 3 portions of dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Working in small batches, cook gnocchi in large pot of boiling salted water until gnocchi rise to top and are tender, about 5 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi to large baking pan.  (Gnocchi can be prepared ahead.  Let stand 1 hour at room temperature, or cover and refrigerate up to 2 days.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Mushroom Sauce:  Cook butter and olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat until butter begins to brown, about 2 minutes.  Add mushrooms and shallots and sautÈ until golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Add stock and sage; simmer until liquid is slightly reduced, about 8 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add gnocchi to sauce in skillet and cook until heated through, about 1 minute.  Add arugula and stir until wilted.  Divide equally among bowls.  Drizzle with truffle oil, if desired.  Sprinkle with cheese.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  &quot;On the last night of a teachers&apos; conference in Boulder, Colorado, I had dinner with some colleagues at a delightful little restaurant called Dandelion,&quot; says Cindy Chassee of Wyoming, Michigan.  &quot;We sat on the patio and shared a memorable gnocchi and wild mushroom dish.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
Gnocchi, tender potato dumplings, aren&apos;t difficult to make.  A hint of truffle oil intensifies the flavors in the sauce, which would also go well with other types of pasta.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  This spicy curry is wonderful spooned over basmati rice and paired with green beans.  For dessert, dust sliced bananas with cinnamon sugar, then broil and serve with a scoop of butter pecan ice cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  eggs
  6              ounce  purchased graham cracker crumb crust -- (8" to 9" dia)
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1            package  frozen unsweetened blueberries - (16 oz)
     3/4           cup  blueberry jam

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Separate 1 egg, placing white in small bowl and yolk in large bowl.  Beat white with fork until very foamy; brush over inside of crust several times to coat (discard remaining white).

Add 1 1/4 cups sugar, butter, and lemon peel to bowl with egg yolk.  Using electric mixer, beat mixture until blended and smooth.  Beat in remaining 3 eggs, 1 at a time.  Beat in flour, then buttermilk and lemon juice.  Pour into prepared crust.

Bake until filling is golden on top and set in center, about 45 minutes.  Cool pie, then chill until cold, at least 2 hours.

Toss berries, jam, and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in large bowl to blend.  Let toping stand until berries thaw and juices form, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours.

Cut around crust to loosen.  Cut pie into wedges.  Serve, spooning topping over.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A purchased crust and frozen blueberries make this pie a snap to put together.

            Mixed Greens With Goat Cheese And Candied Almonds

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CANDIED ALMONDS ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  1 1/2           cups  slivered almonds -- toasted
                        === DRESSING ===
  4               cups  apple cider
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  grated onion
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  poppy seeds
  1                cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SALAD ===
  2                     bags mixed salad greens - (5 oz ea)
  12            ounces  soft fresh goat cheese -- crumbled

For Almonds:  Place foil on work surface.  Stir sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until mixture turns deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 9 minutes.  Mix in almonds.  Immediately pour out onto foil, separating almonds with fork.  Cool completely (mixture will harden).

For Dressing:  Boil apple cider in heavy large saucepan until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 23 minutes.  Transfer to medium bowl and chill until cold.  Add vinegar, onion, mustard and poppy seeds.  Gradually whisk in olive oil.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.

Toss greens, cheese and almonds in bowl with enough dressing to coat; serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  "Last year I spent the holidays in Arizona with my aunt and uncle, who took me to a restaurant in Scottsdale called CREW," writes Lisa C. Holley of Washington, D.C.  "I loved the goat cheese and mixed-green salad with candied nuts, and have looked for similar recipes on-line.  I havenít found anything nearly as good."

The candied almonds in this recipe are also delicious as a snack on their own -- or sprinkled over ice cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     round sourdough loaves - (8 oz ea)
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted, plus

  2 1/2           cups  chopped leeks/ white and pale green parts
  2 1/2           cups  chopped red onions
  6              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1              large  shallot -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/4           cups  dry Sherry
  7               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh thyme

Boil mixture until very thick, scraping up browned bits, about 5 minutes.

Gradually mix in stock; add thyme and rosemary and bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 30 minutes.  Add cream; simmer until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Place 1 bread bowl on each plate.  Place bread lid alongside.  Ladle soup into bread bowls and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  old-fashioned oats
  1 1/4           cups  whole wheat flour
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts
     1/2           cup  dry nonfat milk powder
     1/4           cup  shelled unsalted sunflower seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  honey
     3/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     3/4      teaspoon  maple extract

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

Combine old-fashioned oats, flour, golden brown sugar, almonds, walnuts, milk powder, sunflower seeds and salt in 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan.  Whisk vegetable oil, 1/2 cup water, honey, vanilla extract and maple extract in medium bowl to blend.  Add to dry ingredients in pan and stir to coat well.

Bake until granola is golden and crunchy, stirring frequently, about 45 minutes.  Cool completely.  (Granola can be prepared up to 2 weeks ahead.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 4 cups.

Comments:  "While on vacation in central Utah, I stayed in Bicknell at a wonderful place called The Lodge at Red River Ranch," writes Nancy Schmauder of University Place, Washington.  "The granola was a breakfast treat worth getting up for."

This crunchy granola has a touch of sweetness from honey and brown sugar.  It makes a great breakfast served with milk, or a good snack eaten plain.  Note that it can be made up to two weeks ahead.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts
                Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  4               cups  frozen sliced peaches - (abt 1 3/4 lbs) -- thawed
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine peaches, sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon in large bowl; toss to blend well.  Transfer filling to 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass baking dish.

For Topping:  Sift flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder and salt into large bowl. Whisk cream, egg and vanilla in small bowl to blend.  Add cream mixture to flour mixture, stirring until very soft dough forms.

Using 1/4-cup measure, drop dough atop filling in 9 mounds, spacing apart.  Brush mounds with melted butter.  Blend remaining 1 tablespoon sugar with cinnamon in small cup; sprinkle over mounds.

Bake dessert until filling bubbles and topping is golden brown, about 50 minutes.  Cool 15 minutes.  Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Like cobbler, but even better.  This is crowned with cinnamon shortcakes -- slightly crisp on the outside and delicate within -- that require no kneading or rolling.  We call for frozen peach slices, so this is a year-round treat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2         pound  bay scallops
  10            ounces  uncooked shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/3         pounds  tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
  1                cup  chopped fresh basil
                        = (or 1 tbspn dried basil)
     3/4           cup  bottled clam juice
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/2         pound  penne -- freshly cooked

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add scallops and shrimp and sautÈ until just cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer seafood to bowl.

Add garlic to same skillet; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add tomatoes and half of basil; simmer until sauce thickens, about 10 minutes.  Increase heat to medium-high.  Add clam juice and cream and simmer until thickened to sauce consistency, about 6 minutes.

Comments:  If you're feeling extravagant, try replacing the scallops with half a pound of lobster.  Or substitute a pound of cubed chicken for the seafood and chicken broth for the clam juice.

                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  poblano chilies - (abt 12 large) -- see * Note
  7 1/2         pounds  pork butt country-style strips -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  6               cups  coarsely-chopped onions
  12             large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  dried oregano
  2        tablespoons  ground cumin
  10              cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (28 oz)

* Note:  Fresh green chilies, often called pasillas, are available at Latin American markets.

Char chilies over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag; let stand 10 minutes.  Peel and seed chilies.  Cut into 1-inch pieces.

Place pork in large bowl.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Add flour and toss to coat.  Heat 4 tablespoons oil in heavy large wide pot over high heat.  Working in batches and adding more oil as needed, cook pork until brown on all sides, about 6 minutes per batch.  Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to large bowl.

Reduce heat to medium.  Add onions to same pot and stir until tender, about 6 minutes.  Add garlic, oregano and cumin; stir 2 minutes.  Return pork and any accumulated juices to pot; add stock, chilies and tomatoes with juices and bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until chili thickens and meat is very tender, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  "A good newspaper review of the Cosmos Cafe in Houston convinced me to try out the restaurant and particularly the owners award-winning green chili," says Janice E. Bryant of Humble, Texas.  "It was everything chili should be -- hearty and hot with a great kick from poblano chilies."

Serve the chili with warm corn tortillas, and pass bowls of chopped fresh cilantro, chopped green onions and sour cream for garnishes.  This recipe can easily be halved for a smaller crowd.

Place pork in large bowl.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Add flour and toss to coat.  Heat 4 tablespoons oil in heavy large wide pot over high heat.  Working in batches and adding more oil as needed, cook pork until brown on all sides, about 6 minutes per batch.  Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to large bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reduce heat to medium.  Add onions to same pot and stir until tender, about 6 minutes.  Add garlic, oregano and cumin; stir 2 minutes.  Return pork and any accumulated juices to pot; add stock, chilies and tomatoes with juices and bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until chili thickens and meat is very tender, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Comments:  &quot;A good newspaper review of the Cosmos Cafe in Houston convinced me to try out the restaurant and particularly the owners award-winning green chili,&quot; says Janice E. Bryant of Humble, Texas.  &quot;It was everything chili should be -- hearty and hot with a great kick from poblano chilies.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve the chili with warm corn tortillas, and pass bowls of chopped fresh cilantro, chopped green onions and sour cream for garnishes.  This recipe can easily be halved for a smaller crowd.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  4               cups  fresh rhubarb in 1/2"-thk slices -- (from about 2 lbs)
  1                cup  raspberry preserves with seeds
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- thawed
                        = (half of a 17.3-oz package)
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
                        Vanilla ice cream

Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add rhubarb.  Cover and simmer until rhubarb is tender and falling apart, about 10 minutes.  Add preserves and 1/4 cup sugar.  Cook uncovered until very thick and reduced to 2 cups, stirring frequently, about 35 minutes.  Refrigerate filling uncovered until cold, at least 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and keep refrigerated.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Roll out pastry on lightly floured surface to 16- by 12-inch rectangle.  Cut pastry in half lengthwise, forming two 16- by 6-inch rectangles.

Place 1 rectangle on prepared baking sheet.  Leaving 1-inch plain border, spoon filling onto pastry.  Brush border with egg glaze.  Top with second rectangle; press edges firmly to seal.  Brush edges with glaze.  Fold edges over, forming 1/2-inch border.  Press border with tines of fork to seal.  Brush top of pastry with glaze; sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar.  Using sharp knife, cut 1 1/2-inch crosswise slits down center of pastry at 2-inch intervals, exposing filling.

Bake pastry until golden brown, about 25 minutes.  Cool pastry on sheet to lukewarm, about 45 minutes.  Cut crosswise into 6 pieces. Serve with ice cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This modern take on a classic French dessert saves time by using frozen puff pastry.

                Risotto With Mushrooms And Sugar Snap Peas

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  canned vegetable broth
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  arborio rice
                        = (or medium-grain white rice)
  1                cup  chopped mushrooms
     3/4           cup  sugar snap peas -- cut 1/2" pieces
     1/2           cup  chopped red bell pepper
     1/3           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh mint
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine broth and wine in saucepan.  Bring to simmer over medium heat.  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add rice; stir 2 minutes.  Stir in all but 1/4 cup broth-wine mixture.  Stir constantly for 2 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Simmer until rice is tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.

Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms, sugar snap peas and bell pepper; sautÈ until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Stir into risotto along with cheese and mint.  Mix in enough remaining broth mixture if needed to moisten.  Season risotto with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Accompany the risotto with a lettuce and radicchio salad, and pass a basket of poppy-seed breadsticks.  A strawberry tart would be a nice way to end the meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             quarts  water
  2               cups  salt
  2               cups  brown sugar - (packed)
  1                     onion -- quartered
  1                     orange -- quartered
  12             whole  star anise
  10                    garlic cloves -- crushed
     1/2           cup  sliced fresh ginger
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  Chinese five-spice powder -- see * Note
  6               cups  cold water
  2              whole  ducks - (6 lbs ea)
                        Honeyed-Mango Chutney Sauce -- (see recipe)

* Note:  Available at Asian markets and specialty foods stores, and in the spice section of some supermarkets.

Bring first 10 ingredients to boil in large pot; boil 30 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in 6 cups cold water.  Cool completely.  Add ducks to brine, immersing entirely.  Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours and up to 18 hours.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Place rack in roasting pan.  Remove ducks from brine and drain well.  Pat dry with paper towels.  Place ducks on rack in pan.  Roast ducks 45 minutes.  Remove excess fat from pan with baster.  Continue roasting until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, about 1 hour longer.  Let rest 30 minutes.

Cut each duck in half and transfer each half to plate.  Spoon Honeyed-Mango Chutney Sauce alongside and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The business card from Tante Louise reads: "A very special restaurant" -- and it truly is.  This romantic spot has been going strong for 27 years.  Owner Corbin Douglass is known for fulfilling all sorts of requests, from ensuring that guests are seated at their favorite table in front of the fireplace to presenting an engagement ring on the dessert cart.  Chef Duy Pham changes the contemporary French menu seasonally.  The following dish was inspired by roast Peking duck, a Sunday tradition in Phamís family.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  ground cumin
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed) -- plus
  1         tablespoon  golden brown sugar
  3             pounds  boneless center-cut pork rib roast
  3               cups  ruby Port
     1/4           cup  chopped shallots
  1 3/4           cups  beef stock or canned beef broth
  1 3/4           cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1                     fresh thyme sprig
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chipotle-Glazed Apples -- (see recipe)

Mix first 4 ingredients and 1/2 cup brown sugar in small bowl.  Rub spice mixture over pork.  Place in large glass baking dish.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Transfer pork to large roasting pan.  Reserve juices in glass dish.  Roast pork until thermometer inserted into center registers 155 degrees, about 1 hour 45 minutes, basting with reserved juices from glass dish every 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine Port, shallots and remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar in heavy medium saucepan.  Boil until syrupy, about 25 minutes.  Add both stocks and thyme.  Boil until reduced to 1 1/4 cups, about 30 minutes.  Strain sauce.  Return to saucepan.  Mix any pan drippings from pork into sauce (do not scrape roasting pan).  Add butter; whisk until melted.  Season with salt and pepper.

Cut pork into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Divide among 6 plates.  Spoon Chipotle-Glazed Apples alongside, dividing equally.  Spoon sauce over and around pork.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  At the restaurant, this dish is served with cilantro mashed potatoes.  The pork has to marinate overnight, so begin preparing the recipe a day ahead.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place tomatoes, eggplant, onion and garlic on large baking sheet.  Brush vegetables with oil.  Roast until vegetables are tender and brown in spots, about 45 minutes.  Remove from oven.

Scoop eggplant from skin into heavy large saucepan; discard skin.  Add remaining roasted vegetables and thyme to same saucepan.  Add 4 cups chicken stock and bring to boil.  Reduce heat to simmer.  Cook until onion is very tender, about 45 minutes.  Cool slightly.

Working in batches, puree soup in blender until smooth.  Return soup to saucepan.  Stir in cream.  Bring to simmer, thinning with more stock, if desired.  Season soup with salt and pepper.  Ladle into bowls.  Sprinkle with goat cheese; serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The recipe calls for one cup of cream, but the soup tastes equally delicious without it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  red-skinned sweet potatoes (yams) -- cut 1 1/4"-long
                        by 1/2"-wide by 1/2"-thick strips
  2              large  fennel bulbs -- cored, and
                        cut into 1/3"-thick wedges
  1              large  celery root (celeriac) -- peeled, and
                        cut 1 1/4"-long by 1/2"-wide by
                        1/2"-thick strips
  20             large  garlic cloves -- peeled
  1         tablespoon  dried sage leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  2            bunches  green onions -- cut 1" pieces
     1/3           cup  vegetable stock or canned vegetable broth -- more or less

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine first 5 ingredients in large bowl.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.  Add olive oil and toss to coat.

Spread vegetables out on large rimmed baking sheet.  Roast vegetables until almost tender, stirring occasionally, about 50 minutes.

Mix green onions and stock into vegetables.  Bake until vegetables are just tender, about 15 minutes longer.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  "As a confirmed New Englander, I was surprised to find a terrific seafood restaurant in Phoenix: Steamers Genuine," says Barbara J. Johnson of Worcester, Massachusetts.  "The baked halibut was perfectly complemented by roasted vegetables and potatoes au gratin.  I know how to make the fish, but I wouldn't know where to start with the other two dishes."

This side dish and the "Potato Gratin With White Cheddar Cheese" (see recipe) would also be good with roast chicken or beef.

Comments:  A crisp white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc, would be nice with this dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cans  chopped clams - (6 1/2 oz ea) -- with juices
  3             ounces  salt pork -- cut 1/3" pieces
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  water
  1              pound  red-skinned potatoes -- unpeeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1                     bay leaf -- broken in half
  3 1/2           cups  whole milk
  10            ounces  bay scallops
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Salt -- to taste

Drain clams, reserving juices.  SautÈ salt pork in heavy large pot over medium heat until golden, about 7 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to paper towels.

Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from pot.  Add onion to pot; sautÈ until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add flour; stir 1 minute.  Gradually mix in water and clam juices.  Bring to boil, stirring often.  Add potatoes, thyme and bay leaf.

Reduce heat; cover pot and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.  Discard bay leaf.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill chowder, clams and salt pork separately.  Bring chowder to simmer before continuing.)

Add milk to chowder and bring to simmer, stirring occasionally.  Add scallops and reserved clams and simmer until scallops are opaque, about 2 minutes.  Season with white pepper and salt.  Ladle chowder into bowls.  Garnish with salt pork.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  The early Yankees often cooked local shellfish in milk-based chowders with potatoes.  True to their English heritage, the colonists planted kitchen gardens with as many herbs as they could cultivate, which they put into all kinds of dishes, including chowders.

Melt butter with olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add minced garlic cloves and sautÈ 1 minute.  Increase heat to high, add sliced mushrooms and sautÈ until just beginning to soften, about 5 minutes.

Add tomato paste and stir 30 seconds.  Add dry white wine and fresh lemon juice and bring to boil.  Add shrimp and sliced green onions and stir 1 minute.  Add scallops and stir until shrimp and scallops are cooked through, about 3 minutes.

Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  New England has a large Portuguese population.  Their numbers are most concentrated in Massachusetts fishing centers, such as New Bedford, Glouchester and Providencetown, where they've had an important influence on the cuisine.  One of their specialties is fried scallops, Portuguese-style -- a sautÈ of bay scallops in butter with garlic and parsley.  We've elaborated on the basic dish by adding shrimp, mushrooms, green onions and a white wine sauce.  Serve it over rice, and offer buttered peas or broccoli on the side.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     flour tortillas - (6" to 7" dia)
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  8        tablespoons  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  4               cups  whole milk
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
     1/2           cup  honey
  8              large  egg yolks
     1/3           cup  sour cream
  1 1/2    tablespoons  tequila
                        Purchased caramel sauce -- warmed
                        Purchased chocolate sauce -- warmed
                        Sliced bananas
  1                cup  pecans -- toasted

Cut 4 tortillas in half, then crosswise into thin strips.  Cut remaining 4 tortillas into quarters.  Add enough oil to heavy medium skillet to reach depth of 1/2 inch.  Heat oil over medium heat to 350 degrees.

Working in batches, fry tortilla strips, then tortilla quarters until golden and crisp, about 1 1/2 minutes per batch.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels.  Drain.

Mix 5 tablespoons sugar and ground cinnamon in small bowl.  Sprinkle mixture onto all sides of tortillas.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Store tortillas airtight at room temperature.)

Combine milk and cinnamon sticks in heavy large saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Bring to simmer.  Remove from heat; cover and let steep 30 minutes.

Add honey to milk mixture; return to simmer.  Whisk yolks and 3 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in hot milk mixture.  Return mixture to saucepan and stir over medium heat until custard thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 3 minutes (do not boil).   Strain into large bowl.  Whisk in sour cream and tequila.  Refrigerate until cold, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours.

Transfer custard to ice cream maker; process according to manufacturer's instructions.  Fold in fried tortilla strips; process 3 minutes.  Transfer to covered container; freeze until firm.  (Ice cream can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep frozen.)

Place 2 scoops ice cream in bowls.  Garnish each with 2 fried tortilla quarters.  Top with sauces and bananas, and sprinkle with pecans.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Sopaipillas are crisp fried breads traditionally topped with honey; cinnamon and sugar are sometimes added to make a great dessert.  In this recipe, fried tortillas approximate the texture of true sopaipillas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  20            ounces  spaghetti - (1 1/4 lbs)
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        === TOMATO SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
  2               cans  diced tomatoes in juice - (14 1/2 oz ea)
  1              pinch  sugar
     2/3           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
     1/3           cup  red wine
  1         tablespoon  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === MEATBALLS ===
  1              pound  lean ground beef
     1/3           cup  fresh breadcrumbs made from white bread
     1/4           cup  diced canned mild green chilies
     1/4           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
     1/4           cup  chopped green bell pepper
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  fennel seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme

For Tomato Sauce:  Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add garlic and sautÈ 1 minute.  Add crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes with juices and sugar.  Simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add stock and wine.  Simmer uncovered until reduced to 5 cups, about 20 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in butter.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cool.  Cover and chill.)

For Meatballs: Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine beef, breadcrumbs, chilies, 1/4 cup tomato sauce, pine nuts, onion, bell pepper, egg, tomato paste, garlic, salt, pepper, fennel and thyme in large bowl; mix well.  Using 1 heaping tablespoon for each, form mixture into balls; transfer to 2 baking sheets.  Bake until cooked through, about 15 minutes.

Bring tomato sauce to simmer.  Add meatballs and simmer 1 minute.

Meanwhile, cook spaghetti in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite.  Drain well, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.

Transfer cooked spaghetti to large serving bowl.  Add tomato sauce and meatballs and toss to coat.  Add reserved cooking liquid to spaghetti by tablespoonfuls to moisten if necessary.  Serve, passing Parmesan separately.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Located in a century-old coal warehouse that stoked the train coming from Albuquerque, the Zia Diner is in the National Register of Historic Places -- and on many lists of favorite neighborhood restaurants.  Regulars fuel up with such popular dishes as chicken-fried steak and meat loaf with green chilies and pine nuts.  The latter provided the inspiration for another Zia Diner classic: spaghetti with chili and pine nut meatballs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cans  black beans - (15 oz ea) -- drained well
  6                     green onions -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped seeded red bell pepper
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced seeded jalapeÒo chili
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  yellow cornmeal -- plus
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
  6        tablespoons  olive oil - (about)
                        Sour cream
                        Purchased salsa

Place drained beans in large bowl.  Using hand masher, mash beans coarsely.  Mix in green onions, bell pepper, cilantro, garlic, jalapeÒo and cumin.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Mix in egg and 2 tablespoons cornmeal.

Place remaining 1 cup cornmeal in small dish.  Drop heaping 1 tablespoon of bean mixture into cornmeal; turn to coat.  Flatten into 1/2-inch-thick cake.  Repeat with remaining bean mixture and cornmeal, forming 18 cakes.

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Working in batches, fry bean cakes until firm and crisp, adding more oil as needed, about 6 minutes per side.  Drain bean cakes on paper towels.  Transfer to platter.  Serve warm with sour cream and salsa.

This recipe yields 18 cakes.

Comments:  "I attended a function that featured wonderful hors díoeuvres -- among them, spicy black bean cakes -- from chef Matthias Radits of The Breakers in Palm Beach," writes Ruth Acteson of Lantana, Florida.  "Do you suppose he would share his recipe?"

The chef serves these little cakes with a mango-avocado salsa, but a purchased salsa would make a fine substitute.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken thighs -- cut 1 1/2" pieces
  8             ounces  fully-cooked hot link sausages - (abt 3) -- cubed
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1              large  green bell pepper -- chopped
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 1/4 oz)
  1            package  frozen sliced okra - (10 oz)
     3/4           cup  long-grain white rice
  1              pound  bay scallops
  8             ounces  uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add chicken and sausage and sautÈ until brown, about 8 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer mixture to bowl.

Add onion and bell pepper to pot.  SautÈ until soft and brown, about 6 minutes.  Add flour and stir until golden, about 5 minutes.  Gradually whisk in chicken broth, then diced tomatoes with their juices.  Bring to boil.

Mix in chicken mixture, okra and rice.  Reduce heat to medium; cook uncovered until rice is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Mix scallops and shrimp into pot.  Cover and cook until seafood is cooked through, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, about 10 minutes.  Season to taste with cayenne, salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This recipe combines the best of two classic New Orleans dishes -- gumbo and jambalaya.

Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  onion -- peeled, quartered
  1              large  carrot -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- coarsely chopped
  10                    garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     standing rib roast

Puree onion, carrot, celery, garlic cloves, oil, flour, rosemary, salt and pepper in processor.  Place beef in roasting pan.  Rub beef with vegetable and herb puree, covering completely.  Let beef stand 1 hour at room temperature.

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Roast beef 20 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees.  Continue roasting beef until thermometer inserted into center registers 125 degrees, about 1 hour 45 minutes longer.  Remove roast from oven.  Let stand 20 minutes.  Slice roast and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  "During my first trip west of the Mississippi, I had dinner at an extraordinary restaurant called The Fort, in Morrison, Colorado," says Marcia Walsh of Westford, Massachusetts.  "I enjoyed both the ambience and the food, especially the rib roast."

The vegetable-herb coating gives the roast extra flavor.  This is an easy holiday entrÈe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  powdered sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
     1/2           cup  currant jelly -- or more if needed
  60             small  strawberries - (about) -- stemmed
                        = (from about 4 baskets)

Sift flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat butter, sugar, vanilla extract and orange peel in large bowl until fluffy.  Add flour mixture and beat just until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch-thick round.  Using 3- to 3 1/4-inch cutter, cut out cookies.  Transfer cookies to prepared baking sheet.  Gather dough and reroll to 1/4-inch thickness; cut out more cookies.  Bake until cookies are light brown at edges, about 15 minutes.  Cool on sheet.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

Whisk 1/2 cup currant jelly in small saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth.  Place 8 shortbread cookies on plates; brush generously with currant jelly (reserve remaining cookies for another use).  Brush bottom of 1 strawberry with currant jelly; set strawberry, currant jelly-side down, in center of 1 cookie.  Brush bottom of more strawberries with currant jelly and arrange around center strawberry.  Brush top of all strawberries with currant jelly to glaze.  Repeat with remaining cookies and strawberries.  (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  If you bake the shortbread cookies ahead, these lovely individual tarts, topped with fresh berries and glazed with jelly, can be ready in minutes.  An empty eight-ounce can of crushed pineapple makes a convenient cutter for the cookies.  Serve some lightly whipped cream on the side, if you like.

                        === TORTE ===
  4              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  grated lime peel
     1/2           cup  dark rum
  1                     frozen all-butter pound cake - (16 oz) -- thawed
  2           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
                        === COMPOTE ===
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lime peel

                        and diced
                        Lime slices

For Torte:  Whisk eggs, 3/4 cup sugar, lime juice and lime peel in heavy medium saucepan to blend.  Whisk over medium-high heat until mixture thickens and just comes to boil, about 6 minutes.  Transfer lime curd to small bowl; press plastic wrap directly onto surface.  Chill until very cold, at least 3 hours and up to 3 days.

Line 9 1/4- by 5 1/4- by 2 3/4-inch loaf pan with 2 layers of plastic wrap, leaving long overhang.  Stir rum and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in small bowl until sugar dissolves.  Trim brown layer from outside of cake.  Cut cake horizontally into 3 equal layers.  Beat cream cheese in large bowl until fluffy; gently fold in cold lime curd.

Trim bottom cake layer to fit pan bottom; reserve cake trimmings.  Brush layer on both sides with 1/3 of rum syrup.  Place in pan; spread 1 1/2 cups lime curd mixture over top.  Brush second cake layer on both sides with 1/3 of rum syrup.  Place in pan; spread remaining lime curd mixture over top.  Brush third cake layer on both sides with remaining rum syrup.  Place on lime curd mixture; press to adhere.  Press reserved cake trimmings around sides.  Cover torte with plastic overhang.  Refrigerate torte at least 1 and up to 2 days.

For compote:  Stir first 4 ingredients in large bowl until sugar dissolves.  Mix in mangoes.  Cover; chill up to 1 day.

Using plastic as aid, lift torte out of pan and unwrap.  Cut crosswise into 12 slices.  Arrange slices on plates.  Top with compote.  Garnish with lime slices.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Check the supermarket produce section for fresh peeled and sliced mangoes.  Youíll need about four cups of diced mangoes.

Comments:  "Last night I ate at Siaís in Duluth, Georgia," writes Debra Mager of Norcross, Georgia.  "The first thing I did this morning was sit down to write this request for their recipe for yellow tomato soup with chipotle chilies and bacon.  It was terrific -- the yellow tomatoes made such a nice change."

Chipotle chilies give this soup smoky flavor.
