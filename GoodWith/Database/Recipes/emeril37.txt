  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  12            medium  to small oysters -- shucked, drained
  12                    scallops -- side muscle removed
  12            slices  bacon -- halved crosswise

Preheat the broiler.  In a shallow bowl, combine the wine, garlic, and pepper sauce.  Add the oysters and scallops and toss to coat.  Let marinate for 10 minutes.

Place the bacon flat on a work surface and scrape with the back of a knife to prevent from shrinking while cooking.  Place 1 oyster or scallop on each piece of bacon and roll up to enclose.  Secure with a toothpick and place on a foil-lined baking sheet.

Place on the top rack of the oven and broil, until the bacon is crisp and the edges of the oysters have curled, turning once to cook both sides evenly.

Remove from the oven and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda

  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  buttermilk or sour cream
  4        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  chopped peeled cored sweet apples
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts
                        === STREUSEL TOPPING ===
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped walnuts -- plus

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease a 12-cup muffin tin and set aside.

Into a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, and melted butter.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 3/4           cups  chicken stock - (to 4)
  4        tablespoons  butter
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1                cup  Carnaroli or Arborio rice
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  finely-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus
                        extra for garnish
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh herbs
                        = (such as basil, thyme, parsley or
                        chives)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     eggs
     1/3           cup  cubed mozzarella, cheddar, muenster or
                        Swiss cheese
     1/3           cup  chopped ham, prosciutto, pepperoni,
                        salami, or other fully-cooked meat or
                        sausage
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
     1/2           cup  flour
  1                cup  dry Italian bread crumbs
                        Essence -- to taste
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        Tomato sauce -- as accompaniment

To make the basic risotto for the arancini, in a saucepan bring stock to a simmer.  Cover and set aside to keep hot.  In a heavy Dutch oven or large saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the chopped onion and saute until transparent, about 4 minutes.  Add rice and cook, stirring constantly, until rice is opaque and fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the white wine and cook, stirring, until absorbed.

While continually stirring, begin adding the stock in 1/2 cup increments, allowing the liquid to become completely absorbed between additions.  Cook until the rice is just tender and the risotto is creamy, about 20 minutes.  Add the grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, heavy cream, herbs and salt and pepper and stir to combine well.  Transfer to a mixing bowl or baking dish and allow to cool completely.  Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.

When ready to "raid the refrigerator" and make the arancini, remove the chilled risotto from the refrigerator and stir in 1 of the eggs.  Using a small scoop or large spoon, divide the risotto into approximately 3 tablespoon portions.  Using your hands, form the portions into rough ball shapes.

Press a hole into the center of each risotto ball and stuff the center with some of the cheese and the chopped ham.  Press the opening closed and roll the ball between your hands until it is smooth.  Set aside while you prepare the other arancini.

In a large saucepan, heat 2 inches of oil until a deep-fry thermometer reads 360 degrees.  Place the flour, remaining 2 eggs and bread crumbs in 3 separate bowls.  Season each with Essence to taste.  Using a fork, lightly beat the eggs.  One by one, lightly dredge each risotto ball in the flour, then the beaten egg mixture, then the bread crumbs, so that each ball is completely coated.

Transfer to a plate or baking sheet until you are ready to fry the arancini.  Fry the balls in batches, a few at a time, turning once during cooking so that they are evenly browned, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to paper-lined plates to drain briefly, then serve immediately.  Serve with Parmesan cheese and some tomato sauce.

This recipe yields about 16 arancini.

To make the basic risotto for the arancini, in a saucepan bring stock to a simmer.  Cover and set aside to keep hot.  In a heavy Dutch oven or large saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the chopped onion and saute until transparent, about 4 minutes.  Add rice and cook, stirring constantly, until rice is opaque and fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the white wine and cook, stirring, until absorbed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While continually stirring, begin adding the stock in 1/2 cup increments, allowing the liquid to become completely absorbed between additions.  Cook until the rice is just tender and the risotto is creamy, about 20 minutes.  Add the grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, heavy cream, herbs and salt and pepper and stir to combine well.  Transfer to a mixing bowl or baking dish and allow to cool completely.  Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to &quot;raid the refrigerator&quot; and make the arancini, remove the chilled risotto from the refrigerator and stir in 1 of the eggs.  Using a small scoop or large spoon, divide the risotto into approximately 3 tablespoon portions.  Using your hands, form the portions into rough ball shapes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Press a hole into the center of each risotto ball and stuff the center with some of the cheese and the chopped ham.  Press the opening closed and roll the ball between your hands until it is smooth.  Set aside while you prepare the other arancini.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large saucepan, heat 2 inches of oil until a deep-fry thermometer reads 360 degrees.  Place the flour, remaining 2 eggs and bread crumbs in 3 separate bowls.  Season each with Essence to taste.  Using a fork, lightly beat the eggs.  One by one, lightly dredge each risotto ball in the flour, then the beaten egg mixture, then the bread crumbs, so that each ball is completely coated.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer to a plate or baking sheet until you are ready to fry the arancini.  Fry the balls in batches, a few at a time, turning once during cooking so that they are evenly browned, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to paper-lined plates to drain briefly, then serve immediately.  Serve with Parmesan cheese and some tomato sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 16 arancini.

  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  lightly-toasted sesame seeds
  6             ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, and
                        thinly sliced
  4                     green onions, green tops only -- cut 1" pieces
  1              large  carrot -- peeled, and
                        cut into 2"-long matchstick strips
     1/2         large  red pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into thin strips
                        Steamed rice -- as accompaniment
                        === SAUTEED SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  sliced shittake mushrooms
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2         tablespoon  sake
  1                     orange -- zested, juiced

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Cut 4 large squares of heavy aluminum foil large enough to hold 1 flounder fillet and one-quarter of the vegetables.  Lightly butter 1 side of each and set on a work surface.

Lay the fish flat in a baking dish.  In a bowl, whisk together the sake, soy sauce, lime juice, ginger, sesame oil, honey, and sesame seeds.  Pour over the fish and let marinate for up to 30 minutes.  Arrange 1 fish fillet on each sheet of aluminum foil and top with one-quarter of the mushrooms, onions, carrots, peppers, and marinade.  Wrap tightly and place on a baking sheet.

Bake until the fish is cooked through and the vegetables are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and unwrap each package.  Transfer the fish and vegetables to 4 large plates and top with the cooking juices.  Serve with Sauteed Shiitakes and hot steamed rice.

For the Sauteed Shiitake Mushrooms:  Place a saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the oil and heat.  When the oil is hot, add the mushrooms and saute until they begin to give up their liquid, about 4 minutes.  Add the sesame oil, soy sauce, sake, and orange juice and zest and cook for 2 minutes.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     firm-ripe California avocados -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                cup  cold heavy cream
  4              dozen  oysters on the half shell
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
  4             ounces  golden whitefish caviar
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh chives -- for garnish
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  bacon -- chopped
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  6             ounces  sharp cheddar cheese -- grated (1 1/2 cups)
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  heavy cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a medium skillet, cook the bacon, stirring, until crisp, about 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain well on paper towels.

Into a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.  Cut in the butter, cheese, green onions, and pepper with a pastry blender or fork, and work just until it starts to form lumps and come together.  Add the bacon.  Add 1 cup of the cream and work just until it becomes a sticky dough, being careful not to overwork.

Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and pat until it comes together.  Form into 2 large circles, about 7 inches in diameter and 3/4-inch thick and cut each into 8 wedges with a sharp knife.

Transfer to baking sheet with a spatula, leaving 1/2-inch space between each wedge.  Paint the tops of the wedges lightly with the remaining 2 tablespoons of cream and bake until golden brown, 22 to 23 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool slightly on the baking sheet.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 16 scones.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  bacon -- diced
  1              pound  lean beef chuck -- cut bite size
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
  1                     carrot -- peeled, grated
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
  2          teaspoons  dill seeds
  2                     bay leaves
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar -- plus more to taste
  2             quarts  water
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2         pounds  red beets -- greens tops
                        removed, roasted and grated
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              large  russet potato -- peeled, diced
  6               cups  shredded green cabbage
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh dill

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Place the bacon in a Dutch oven or stockpot and cook, stirring, over medium-high heat until the fat begins to render, about 3 minutes.  Add the beef and cook, stirring, until brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Remove the meat from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

To the fat in the pan, add the onions and carrots, and stir to coat.  Cook until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, oregano, dill seeds, and bay leaves and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the red wine vinegar and stir to deglaze the pan.  Return the meat to the pot and add the water, salt, and pepper and bring to boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer partially covered until the beef is tender, about 2 hours.

Meanwhile, place the beets on a baking sheet and brush with the oil.  Roast until tender and can be pierced easily with a knife, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.  Trim the stem and root ends and remove the skins.  Coarsely grate and set aside.

When the meat is tender and falling apart, add the beets, potatoes, and cabbage.  Simmer over low heat for another 30 minutes.  Season with additional red wine vinegar, salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.

Ladle borscht into bowls and garnish with a dollop of sour cream and pinch of fresh dill.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Channa dal (split peas)
  3               cups  water
  3                     cloves
     1/2                inch cinnamon stick
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  turmeric powder
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  cardamom powder
  3        tablespoons  mustard oil
                        = (or 3 tbspns vegetable oil with 2 tspns
                        dry mustard powder)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  minced green chili
     1/2      teaspoon  red chili flakes
                        === STEAMED BASMATI RICE ===
  1                cup  Basmati rice
  2               cups  water -- plus
                        additional for washing
                        === EGGPLANT FITTERS ===
  1                     eggplant - (abt 16 oz)
  1                cup  mustard oil
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  turmeric
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper

Rinse the peas several times to thoroughly remove any dirt or debris.  Put the peas in a deep, heavy-bottomed pot along with the water, cloves, cinnamon, salt, turmeric, sugar, and cardamom powder.

Bring to a boil, stirring well to keep the peas from lumping.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until peas are cooked tender but still separate, about 10 minutes total.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.  When it is hot add the cumin, minced green chili and red chili flakes and heat until aromatic, 20 to 30 seconds.  Pour this perfumed oil over the peas and stir to combine.

Serve the dal hot over Steamed Basmati Rice and top with Eggplant Fritters.

For the Eggplant Fitters:  Cut off and discard stem and bottom end of the eggplant.  Cut eggplant crosswise into 3/4-inch slices, then cut slices into 3/4-inch strips.

Place strips in a colander, sprinkle with salt, and toss.  Set colander over a bowl or in the sink and let eggplant stand for at least 1 1/2 hours, preferably for 2 to 3, stirring it a couple of times.  Rinse eggplant under cold, running water, rubbing the strips lightly in your hands.  Shake colander to drain.  Lay strips on a triple thickness of paper towels; cover with another triple layer of towels.

Using your palms, press each eggplant strip very firmly until it looks green and translucent and feels firm and leathery when pressed between fingertips.  Repeat pressing process on fresh toweling if eggplant has not yet reached this stage.  Repeat with remaining eggplant strips.

Heat the oil in a large, heavy saute pan to 360 degrees.

Combine flour, salt, turmeric, cayenne and coat eggplant batons with the mixture, shaking off any excess.  Place as many of the batons in the pan as will fit loosely without overcrowding.  Fry, turning, until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and transfer to paper towels to drain.  Season with salt.

For the Steamed Basmati Rice:  First, wash the rice by putting it in a large bowl and filling it with cold water.  Let the rice settle to the bottom and then pour off the water, which will be cloudy.  Repeat until the water runs clear.

Next, soak the rice in the 2 cups of water.  Allow the rice to soak for 1/2 hour and then drain, reserving the water for cooking.

To cook put the reserved water into a large, heavy-bottomed pan with a tight-fitting lid, and bring to a boil.  Add the soaked rice and stir carefully with a narrow stirring implement (so that the rice is not crushed) until the water comes to a second boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer, partially covered, until most of the water is absorbed, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Cover the pan tightly and reduce heat to lowest possible level and let rice steam for 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Rinse the peas several times to thoroughly remove any dirt or debris.  Put the peas in a deep, heavy-bottomed pot along with the water, cloves, cinnamon, salt, turmeric, sugar, and cardamom powder.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring to a boil, stirring well to keep the peas from lumping.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until peas are cooked tender but still separate, about 10 minutes total.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.  When it is hot add the cumin, minced green chili and red chili flakes and heat until aromatic, 20 to 30 seconds.  Pour this perfumed oil over the peas and stir to combine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve the dal hot over Steamed Basmati Rice and top with Eggplant Fritters.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Eggplant Fitters:  Cut off and discard stem and bottom end of the eggplant.  Cut eggplant crosswise into 3/4-inch slices, then cut slices into 3/4-inch strips.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place strips in a colander, sprinkle with salt, and toss.  Set colander over a bowl or in the sink and let eggplant stand for at least 1 1/2 hours, preferably for 2 to 3, stirring it a couple of times.  Rinse eggplant under cold, running water, rubbing the strips lightly in your hands.  Shake colander to drain.  Lay strips on a triple thickness of paper towels; cover with another triple layer of towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using your palms, press each eggplant strip very firmly until it looks green and translucent and feels firm and leathery when pressed between fingertips.  Repeat pressing process on fresh toweling if eggplant has not yet reached this stage.  Repeat with remaining eggplant strips.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the oil in a large, heavy saute pan to 360 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine flour, salt, turmeric, cayenne and coat eggplant batons with the mixture, shaking off any excess.  Place as many of the batons in the pan as will fit loosely without overcrowding.  Fry, turning, until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and transfer to paper towels to drain.  Season with salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Steamed Basmati Rice:  First, wash the rice by putting it in a large bowl and filling it with cold water.  Let the rice settle to the bottom and then pour off the water, which will be cloudy.  Repeat until the water runs clear.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Next, soak the rice in the 2 cups of water.  Allow the rice to soak for 1/2 hour and then drain, reserving the water for cooking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To cook put the reserved water into a large, heavy-bottomed pan with a tight-fitting lid, and bring to a boil.  Add the soaked rice and stir carefully with a narrow stirring implement (so that the rice is not crushed) until the water comes to a second boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer, partially covered, until most of the water is absorbed, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Cover the pan tightly and reduce heat to lowest possible level and let rice steam for 10 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     skinless boneless chicken breast halves - -- (abt 6 oz ea)
  1                cup  Blue Cheese Butter Spread -- plus
  2        tablespoons  Blue Cheese Butter Spread -- (listed below)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  5          teaspoons  clarified butter -- or vegetable oil
  1                     loaf French bread -- cut thin rounds
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  Tawny Port
     3/4           cup  chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
                        Fresh watercress -- rinsed, patted dry,
                        and tough stems removed
                        === BLUE CHEESE BUTTER SPREAD ===
  4             ounces  blue cheese - (about 1 cup) -- softened
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  chopped lightly-toasted pecans
  2          teaspoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Insert a thin, sharp knife into the thick side of each chicken breast and make a horizontal pocket, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side.  Cut thick pieces, 3 or 4 tablespoons each, from the refrigerated blue cheese butter and insert into the chicken pockets.  Pull the chicken flesh around the butter to enclose the filling.  Seal with toothpicks, as necessary.

Lightly salt and pepper both sides of the chicken.  Place the flour in a shallow dish and lightly dust the chicken, shaking to remove any excess.  In a large skillet, heat the clarified butter over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and sear until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes on the top side.  Turn and place in the oven and bake until the chicken is cooked through, about 12 minutes.  Remove from the oven, transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm.

As a snack, spread the remaining blue cheese butter, leftover from the 1 cup, evenly onto the French bread rounds and place on a baking sheet.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Bake until golden brown and bubbly, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven.

Remove the chicken from the oven.  Add the shallots and garlic to the fat remaining in the pan from the cooked chicken and cook over medium-high heat, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the port and bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by half, stirring to deglaze the pan.  Add the chicken stock and lemon juice and cook until reduced by half.  Reduce the heat to medium-low.  Whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, adding each piece before the previous one has been completely incorporated.  Continue until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, removing the pan from the heat periodically to prevent the sauce from getting too hot and breaking.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of Blue Cheese Butter, whisking until completely incorporated and the sauce is smooth.  Return the chicken and any accumulated juices to the pan.  Cook until the chicken is warmed through, about 1 minute.

Divide the chicken and pan sauce among 4 large dinner plates.  Garnish with the parsley and serve.

Place the toasted bread on a separate platter with watercress.

For the Blue Cheese Butter Spread:  In a bowl, cream together all the ingredients.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Place mixture on a large sheet of plastic wrap.  Form into a fat cylinder and roll up in the plastic wrap, pushing and tucking in as you go to form a tight log.  Refrigerate or freeze until needed.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  salt
     1/4           cup  Essence -- plus
  2        tablespoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1              quart  buttermilk
  1              whole  chicken -- cut into 8 pieces
  2               cups  flour
                        Peanut oil -- for frying

Combine the salt, 1/4 cup of the Essence and sugar in a large plastic container or non-reactive stockpot.  Add the buttermilk and stir to completely dissolve the salt and sugar.  Immerse the chicken, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.

Combine the flour and remaining 2 tablespoons Essence in a medium brown paper bag; shake to combine.

Heat 4 inches of oil to 375 degrees in a large cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven.

Remove the chicken from the buttermilk and shake to remove excess.  Add the chicken in batches to the flour and shake to completely coat.  Remove and shake to remove excess flour.  Place on a wire rack set over a baking sheet to rest until ready to fry.

Fry the chicken in batches, skin-side down, until golden brown and cooked through, about 8 minutes.  Turn and fry until golden brown on the second side, about 8 minutes longer.  Remove and drain on paper towels.

(Note: An even oil temperature is key to the success of this recipe; a clip-on candy/deep-fry thermometer should be kept in the pot at all times.  And the temperature should register at least 325 degrees during the cooking process.)

Serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

           Butternut Squash Gnocchi With Balsamic Brown Butter

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     butternut squash - (abt 2 lbs) -- halved lengthwise,
                        seeds and fibers removed
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh sage
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more as needed
                        === BALSAMIC BROWN BUTTER ===
  2             sticks  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  3        tablespoons  chiffonade fresh sage
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === GARNISHES ===
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
                        Shaved Parmesan

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Rub the cut slices of the squash with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and season with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the white pepper.  Set the squash, cut-side down, on a baking sheet and roast until tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Remove from the oven.  When cool enough to handle, scoop the flesh from the squash and place in a large bowl, discarding the skin.  Mash into a chunky puree with a potato masher, then let cool, about 15 minutes.

Add the remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, remaining 1/4 teaspoon white pepper, oregano, chopped sage and nutmeg, and work into the warm squash.  Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and using your hands, work into a smooth, soft dough.  Cover the dough with a damp kitchen towel and let rest for 30 to 45 minutes.

Turn onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 4 equal portions.  Roll each portion between your palms into a long rope, about 3/4-inch thick.  If the rope won't hold together, return it to the bowl with the remaining dough and work in more flour, 1 teaspoon at a time, as needed.  Cut each rope of dough into 3/4-inch long pieces.  Press each piece against the tines of a floured fork, then drop into the lightly floured surface.  (Gnocchi also can be placed in a single layer on a lightly floured baking sheet and refrigerated for several hours.  Alternately, the gnocchi can be frozen for 1 hour then transferred to an airtight container and frozen for up to 1 month.)

In a large pot, bring 4 quarts of water and the remaining 2 teaspoons of salt to a low boil.

Add the gnocchi in batches and cook just until they float to the top, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes (or 3 minutes for frozen gnocchi.)

For the Balsamic Brown Butter:  In a medium saucepan, cook the butter over medium heat until brown bits form and it has a nutty aroma, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the shallots, balsamic vinegar, and sage.  Stir well.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.

Remove the gnocchi from the water with a slotted spoon and dry on towels.  Transfer to a large serving dish and gently toss to coat with the balsamic butter.  Garnish with black pepper, parsley, chives, and shaved Parmesan.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  2          teaspoons  butter
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1                can  chopped tomatoes - (28 oz) -- and their juices
     3/4           cup  cream - (to 1)
  1         tablespoon  apple cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        === ROLLS ===
  1               head  cabbage -- cored, and
                        scalded in hot water until soft and easy
                        to separate
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
     1/2         pound  ground beef
     1/2         pound  ground pork
  1                cup  cooked long-grain white rice
  2          teaspoons  Essence -- recipe follows
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     egg

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

To make the sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes and cream and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Add the vinegar and sugar and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning to taste.

Separate the cabbage leaves and remove the hard spine from each leaf.  Spread on paper towels and pat dry.  Set aside.

To make the stuffing, in a medium skillet melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until very wilted and starting to caramelize, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

Lay the cabbage leaves, rib-side down, on a flat work surface.  Spread a thin layer of the sauce over the bottom of a baking dish.  In a large bowl, combine the beef, pork, rice, Essence, salt, pepper, egg, and cooked onions.  Mix well with a heavy wooden spoon or your hands.

One at a time, spoon the filling into the center of the cabbage leaves, about 1/4 cup in each, depending upon the size of the leaves.  Roll each into a neat cylinder and place in a layer on the sauce in the baking dish.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients, stacking the cabbage packages, as necessary.  Pour the remaining sauce over the rolls, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake until the meat is cooked through and the rolls are tender, about 2 hours.  Remove from the oven and serve the rolls with the sauce spooned over the top.

This recipe yields about 1 dozen.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  4 1/2      teaspoons  granulated sugar
  5              large  eggs
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     3/4           cup  cane syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  lightly-toasted pecan pieces -- chopped
     1/3           cup  fresh orange juice
  4          teaspoons  minced orange zest
  2        tablespoons  brandy
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly grated nutmeg
  5               cups  cubed (1/2") day-old white bread -- crusts removed
                        === ESPRESSO CREME ANGLAISE ===
  2               cups  heavy cream
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  instant espresso coffee
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  brandy
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9-inch square baking dish with the butter and dust with 4 1/2 teaspoons of the sugar.

Whisk together the eggs, cream, brown sugar, remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, syrup, and vanilla in a large bowl.  Add the pecans, orange juice, zest, brandy, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and mix well.  Add the bread cubes and let soak for at least 1 hour, or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 8 hours.

Pour into the prepared pan, and bake until the pudding is set in the center and golden, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes.  To serve, cut into equal portions and top with the Espresso Creme Anglaise.

For the Espresso Creme Anglaise:  Bring the cream to a gentle boil in a medium saucepan.  Remove from the heat.

In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until slightly thickened and lemon-colored.  Whisk 1/2 cup of the hot cream into the egg mixture.  Whisk in the coffee powder, and cinnamon.  In a slow, steady stream, gradually add the egg mixture to the pan of hot cream.  Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 2 to 3 minutes.

Remove from the heat and strain into a clean bowl through a fine mesh strainer, pressing against the strainer with the back of a spoon.  Add the brandy and vanilla, and stir to blend.  Serve immediately.  If not serving immediately, press plastic wrap on the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate.  (Makes 3 cups)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Bread pudding has long been a staple dessert in south Louisiana simply because the cooks there are frugal and never waste anything.  The pudding was usually made with day-old bread, milk, butter, and eggs, but we've been experimenting and found that the addition of the cane syrup and pecans, both local ingredients, is fantastic.  The rich, silky smooth creme anglaise kicked up with espresso is a perfect topping for the pudding.

In a shallow dish or bowl, mix eggs with milk and lightly beat.  Season with salt and pepper.  Place the bread in the egg mixture, and turn so the bread soaks up the eggs.

Serve warm with caviar and creme fraiche.  Garnish with chopped chives and optional toppings.  These can also be prepared in advance and passed around on trays.

This recipe yields about 4 to 5 dozen.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     3/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1              pound  thinly-sliced bacon

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line a broiler pan with aluminum foil, and position broiler rack on top of pan.  Lightly coat the rack with the vegetable oil.

Combine the brown sugar and cayenne in a shallow dish, stirring to mix well.  Press 1 side of each slice of bacon firmly into the spiced sugar to coat well.

Bake until the bacon is crisp and the sugar is bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes.  Transfer to paper towels to drain briefly, then to a plate or serving dish to cool.  (Can be made several hours ahead.)  Serve warm or at room temperature.

     1/2      teaspoon  dried sage
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  cloves
  6             ounces  Havarti cheese -- cut 6 equal portions
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  1                     baguette -- cut 1/4"-thk rounds
                        === POACHED EGGS ===
  6              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  distilled white vinegar
                        === TASSO CREAM SAUCE ===
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
     1/4         pound  tasso -- cut small dice
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions
  1           teaspoon  hot sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped fresh parsley

In a large bowl, combine all the sausage making ingredients.  Using a meat grinder, or in batches in a food processor, grind the mixture together.  Form into 12 equal portions, flattening slightly into patties, to measure about 3 inches in diameter.  Place a piece of cheese on top of 6 of the patties and top with the remaining patties, pinching the meat together to seal the cheese completely.

Preheat a grill.  In a large skillet or saute pan, heat 1/4-inch of oil over medium-high heat.  Add the stuffed sausage patties and cook until brown on both sides and the meat is cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and drain on paper towels.

Brush the sliced bread with some vegetable oil.  Place the bread on the grill and cook until toasted with grill marks.  Remove and set aside.

For the Poached Eggs:  Pour cold water into a 10-inch saute pan to a depth of about 2 inches.  Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat so that the surface of the water barely shimmers.  Add the vinegar.  Break 4 of the eggs into individual saucers, then gently slide them out one at a time into the water and, with a large spoon, lift the white over the yolk.  Repeat the lifting once or twice to completely enclose each yolk.  Poach until the whites are set and the yolks feel soft when touched gently, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and either serve immediately, or place in a shallow pan or large bowl of cold water.  Repeat with the remaining eggs, adding more water as needed to keep the depth at 2 inches, and bringing the water to a simmer before adding the eggs.

To serve, place 1 grilled bread round on 6 plates.  Top with 1 sausage patty and 1 poached egg.  Drizzle 2 tablespoons of Tasso Cream Sauce over each egg and garnish with the chopped parsley.  Serve immediately.

For the Tasso Cream Sauce:  In a large saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the tasso and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the shallots and garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the cream and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat slightly and simmer until reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the green onions, hot sauce, lemon juice, and salt.  Add the butter and cook, stirring, until incorporated and thick.  Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  cold sour cream
  1                cup  cold heavy cream
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  very finely-grated lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === BLUEBERRY SYRUP ===
  1                cup  fresh or thawed frozen blueberries
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Cream Biscuits -- (see recipe)

Chill a medium mixing bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer in the refrigerator.  Prepare an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.

In the cold bowl, beat the cream cheese at medium speed until soft and smooth.  Gradually add the sugar 1/4 cup at a time beating well after each addition.  Beat in the sour cream and the cream.  Add the lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla and beat just until thick and smooth.  Cover and refrigerate until very cold (2 to 3 hours).  Wash and re-chill the beaters.

Using the chilled beaters and gradually increasing the mixer speed from low to medium, beat the mixture until creamy, about 2 minutes.  Pour into ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.

To serve, Place a warm Cream Biscuit in the bottom footed coupe bowls.  Top with ice cream and Blueberry Syrup and serve.

For the Blueberry Syrup:  In a saucepan, combine the ingredients and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer until thickened to desired consistency.  Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature before serving with the Cheesecake Ice Cream.  If thinner syrup is desired, strain through a fine mesh strainer while still hot.  (Makes about 1 cup)

This recipe yields about 1 quart.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  bacon fat or vegetable oil
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef
  2               cups  chopped yellow onion
  1                cup  chopped green bell pepper
  4          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  dried Mexican oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (15 oz)
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2               cups  water
                        === CHILI CON QUESO ===
     1/2         pound  fresh poblano or Anaheim chiles
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  chopped white onions
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1              large  tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
  1                cup  milk or cream
  1 1/2           cups  grated Cheddar
  1                cup  grated Pepper Jack
                        Multi-colored Tortilla Chips -- for accompaniment

Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat.  Add the meat and stir with a long-handled wooden spoon to break up the pieces.  Cook, stirring, until the meat is brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Add the onion, green bell pepper, garlic, chili powder, Essence, salt, cumin, oregano, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes.

Put the whole tomatoes in a large mixing bowl and squeeze them with your hands to break them into pieces.  Add the squeezed tomatoes and their juices, the tomato paste, sugar, and water to the pot.  Stir well and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the chili from sticking to the bottom of the pot.  Remove the pot from the heat, ladle into a large bowl and swirl the Chili con Queso into the middle.  Serve immediately with tortilla chips for dipping.

For the Chili con Queso:  Roast the peppers by placing them on an open gas flame, turning them frequently with tongs until all sides are charred black, about 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternately, the peppers can be roasted under a broiler, or on top of a gas or charcoal grill.)  Place the blackened peppers in a plastic or paper bag, and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.  Peel the peppers, split in half lengthwise, and discard the seeds and the stems.  Roughly chop and set aside.

In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the onions and cayenne cook, stirring, until very soft, about 6 minutes.  Add the flour and stir until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and chopped chilies, and cook for 1 minute.  Slowly add the milk or cream and stir until thick, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the cheeses and cook, stirring, until melted and well incorporated.

Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Serve immediately with chips, or swirled into the Chili con Carne.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Place the blackened peppers in a plastic or paper bag, and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.  Peel the peppers, split in half lengthwise, and discard the seeds and the stems.  Roughly chop and set aside.

In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the onions and cayenne cook, stirring, until very soft, about 6 minutes.  Add the flour and stir until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and chopped chilies, and cook for 1 minute.  Slowly add the milk or cream and stir until thick, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the cheeses and cook, stirring, until melted and well incorporated.

Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Serve immediately with chips, or swirled into the Chili con Carne.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  light brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  ground red chilies
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     pork loin - (2 to 2 1/2 lbs)
     1/4           cup  corn oil
  1                cup  chopped white onions
  2                     poblano peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        and roughly chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  3                     plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and roughly chopped
  10            ounces  tomatillos -- peeled, and
                        roughly chopped
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/2           cup  tequila
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
                        === CILANTRO OIL ===
  2               cups  fresh cilantro - (packed) -- tough stems removed
  1                cup  canola oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne

In a bowl, mix together the sugar, chilies, salt, oregano, thyme, and pepper.  Rub evenly onto the pork, cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  Remove from the refrigerator and let meat come to room temperature.

Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the pork and sear until the meat is browned on all sides.  Remove the meat from the pan.  Add the onions, peppers, and garlic, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, tomatillos, and bay leaf, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the lime juice, tequila, and cilantro, stir well, and bring to a boil.  Return the meat to the pan.  Lower the heat, cover, and simmer until the meat is tender, 45 minutes, stirring and basting occasionally.  Remove from the heat.  Transfer the pork to a platter and tent to keep warm.

Transfer the contents of the pan to a blender and puree on high speed.  Return to the cooking pan and cook until thickened.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.

Spoon the sauce onto a platter.  Carve the meat and arrange on top of the sauce.  Drizzle with the cilantro oil and serve immediately.

For the Cilantro Oil:  Bring a medium pot of water to a boil.  Add the cilantro and blanch for 10 seconds.  Remove and shock in an ice bath.  Pat dry well on paper towels, squeezing to remove any excess water.  Roughly chop and transfer to a blender.  With the machine running, add the oil, salt, and cayenne and process until smooth.  Transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate overnight.  Strain through a fine mesh strainer, pressing against the solids with the back of a spoon to extract as much oil as possible.  Transfer to a squirt bottle and refrigerate until needed, for up to 2 weeks.  Bring to room temperature before using.  (Makes 2 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  jumbo lump crabmeat
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  chopped green onions (tops only)
     1/4           cup  sliced almonds
  4              large  flour tortillas
  1              pound  Brie -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
                        === CHILI-APPLE GLAZE ===
  2                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and roughly chopped
  1                cup  apple cider vinegar
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced seeded jalapeno
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  minced chives -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the crabmeat in a bowl and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Add the green onions and toss gently to combine.  Cover and refrigerate.

Spread the almonds on a small baking sheet and toast until golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Remove from oven and allow to cool.

Place the tortillas on a work surface.  Spread 1/4 cup of the crabmeat mixture evenly over half of each tortilla.  Place 5 to 6 slices of the Brie on top of the crabmeat.  Fold the remaining half of the tortilla over, forming a half-moon shape.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large griddle or skillet over medium heat.  When smoking hot, carefully lay the quesadilla in the oil.  Fry on 1 side until golden brown, about 2 minutes, turn with a spatula and cook until golden brown on the second side and the cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove and repeat with the remaining quesadillas, adding more oil as needed.  To serve, cut each quesadilla into 4 triangles.

Spread 1/4 cup of the Chile-Apple Glaze on each plate, and top with quesadilla quarters.  Garnish with the toasted almonds and chopped chives.

For the Chili-Apple Glaze:  In a small saucepan, combine the apples, vinegar, sugar, shallots, jalapeÒo, and garlic.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the apples are translucent and soft and the vinegar has reduced by half, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool for at least 10 minutes.  Once cool, transfer to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth, about 1 minute.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder -- plus
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- plus
                        more for sprinkling on top

  1                cup  heavy cream - (to 1 1/2)
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- melted and cooled

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.  Slowly add 1 cup of the cream, stirring with a rubber spatula, to form a smooth dough.  Add up to 1/2 cup additional cream if mixture is too dry, being careful not to overwork the dough or the biscuits will be tough.

Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and pat into a square, about 3/4-inch thick.  With a 2-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter, cut into 12 circles, gathering the scraps and gently patting out again, if necessary.  Dip each round into the melted butter to coat on all sides.  Place on an ungreased baking sheet and srinkle the tops with a little more sugar.  Bake until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve hot.

This recipe yields 12 biscuits.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  chopped dandelion leaves - (abt 1/2 lb)
  2               cups  baby red leaf lettuce
  1                cup  chopped escarole or frisee
  1                cup  sliced Belgian endive
     1/2           cup  thinly sliced radishes
  3                     hard boiled eggs -- roughly chopped
  4                     strips apple-smoked bacon -- cut 3/4" dice
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  grated peeled apples
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
                        === FRIED POTATOES ===
  2             pounds  baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled, and
                        cut into uniform 1/2" cubes
  3               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
  1           teaspoon  salt

In a large bowl, combine the dandelions, red lead lettuce, escarole, endive, radishes, and eggs, and toss to mix.

In a skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat, stirring, until crisp and brown.  Add the vinegar and sugar, and cook, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Add the apples and stir to combine.  Season with the salt and pepper, and add the oil.  Remove from the heat and pour the hot dressing over greens mixture and mix thoroughly.  Top with the Fried Potatoes.

Adjust the seasoning, to taste, and serve immediately.  (Dressing can be prepared ahead and reheated, stirring constantly to keep from sticking to saucepan.  If it thickens too much, add a little water.)

For the Fried Potatoes:  In a medium, heavy saucepan, place the potatoes in enough salted water to cover by 1-inch.  Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are slightly tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and drain on paper towels.

Heat the oil in a large, deep, heavy pot or an electric deep fryer to 360 degrees.  Add the potatoes and fry, turning to brow evenly, for 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season lightly with salt, to taste, and serve warm in the salad.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat, stirring, until crisp and brown.  Add the vinegar and sugar, and cook, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Add the apples and stir to combine.  Season with the salt and pepper, and add the oil.  Remove from the heat and pour the hot dressing over greens mixture and mix thoroughly.  Top with the Fried Potatoes.

Adjust the seasoning, to taste, and serve immediately.  (Dressing can be prepared ahead and reheated, stirring constantly to keep from sticking to saucepan.  If it thickens too much, add a little water.)

For the Fried Potatoes:  In a medium, heavy saucepan, place the potatoes in enough salted water to cover by 1-inch.  Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are slightly tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and drain on paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the oil in a large, deep, heavy pot or an electric deep fryer to 360 degrees.  Add the potatoes and fry, turning to brow evenly, for 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season lightly with salt, to taste, and serve warm in the salad.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  sweetened condensed milk - (14 oz)
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  2              large  egg yolks
  1 1/2          pints  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

Fill a large pot 3/4-full with water.  Place the unopened can of condensed milk in the water, making sure it is covered completely, and carefully bring to a gentle boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 3 hours, adding more water as necessary.  Remove from the heat and let sit until completely cool.  Watch the can carefully to make sure it does not start to bulge.  If the can does begin to bulge, remove from the heat and let cool.  Once cool, punch a small hole in the top of the can, return to the heat, and continue cooking.  Although this is a traditional way to make this recipe, we suggest using the method below as a safe alternative to cooking an unopened can of condensed milk.

Pour the condensed milk into the top of a double boiler set over simmering water.  Cook, stirring every 5 minutes, until a caramel color is achieved, about 2 to 3 hours.  Or, preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Pour the condensed milk into a baking dish and cover with foil.  Place the pan in a larger pan.  Fill the larger pan with enough water to come halfway up the sides of the baking dish with the condensed milk.  Bake until caramelized, about 2 hours.

In a clean saucepan, combine the brown sugar and 1/4 cup water.  Bring to a boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

In a metal bowl set over a pot of simmering water, whisk together the warm syrup and egg yolks.  Whisk constantly until the mixture is a thick, pale yellow and reaches the ribbon stage.  Remove the bowl from the heat, and beat with an electric mixer on low speed until cool.  Whisk in the condensed milk, heavy cream, vanilla and salt.  Strain through a fine mesh sieve into a clean container.  Cover with plastic, pressing down onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming.  Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours.

Transfer to the bowl of an ice cream machine and process according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

  20                    jumbo shrimp - (abt 2 lbs) -- shelled, leaving
                        tail and connecting shell segment,

  1                     lemon -- cut into wedges,

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a large baking dish and set aside.

Place the crabmeat in a large bowl and season with the Essence.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

In a large skillet, melt 4 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, celery, and bell peppers and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes.  Add the parsley and the garlic, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Remove from heat and let cool.

Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of the flaky, buttery cracker crumbs over the stuffed shrimp and drizzle with the remaining melted butter.  Bake until golden, about 20 minutes.

While the shrimp are baking, heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  When the pan is hot, add the olive oil.  Add the garlic and crushed red pepper and cook, stirring continuously, for 1 minute.  Add the kale and saute until the kale is just wilted, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Place the kale on 4 plates.  Remove the shrimp from the oven and divide among plates, on top of the kale.  Garnish with parsley and lemon wedges.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 entree or 8 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FRIED SHRIMP ===

                        === SERVICE ===
  8             pieces  lightly-buttered toasted white bread -- halved diagonally
                        === COCKTAIL SAUCE ===
  1                cup  ketchup
  1         tablespoon  prepared horseradish
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  hot sauce
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === KICKED UP TARTAR SAUCE ===
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced jalapeÒo
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  2        tablespoons  minced yellow onion
  1                cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Hot sauce -- to taste
                        === FINISH ===
                        French fried potatoes -- as accompaniment
                        Dill Pickle Slices -- as accompaniment
                        Lemon wedges -- as accompaniment
                        Chopped parsley -- for garnish

For the Fried Shrimp:  Place the shrimp in a bowl with the hot sauce and toss to coat.  Let marinate for 30 minutes.

Preheat a large pot with vegetable oil to come 4 inches up the sides to 375 degrees.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, masa, and Essence, and toss to coat.  Add the shrimp in batches, turning to coat evenly, and shaking to remove any excess.  Fry in batches in the oil, turning to cook evenly.  Cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels and season, to taste, with Essence.

For the Fried Softshell crabs:  Place the crabs in a bowl with the hot sauce and toss to coat.  Marinate for 30 minutes.  Combine the flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the Essence in a medium bowl.  In a second bowl, combine the bread crumbs with the remaining 3 teaspoons of Essence.  In a third bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk to make an egg wash.

Preheat a large pot with vegetable oil to come 4 inches up the sides to 375 degrees.

Remove the crabs from the hot sauce and dredge in batches first in the flour, then the egg wash, letting any excess drip off.  Dredge the coated crabs in the bread crumbs, turning to coat evenly on both sides.  Hold the body of the crab with the claws and legs hanging down over the hot oil and carefully drop it in.  Fry until golden brown, turning with tongs to brown evenly, 3 to 4 minutes per side, depending upon the size.  (The crabs will float to the surface of the oil when they are cooked.)  Remove and drain on paper towels and season lightly with Essence.

To serve, arrange 2 slices of buttered toast across each of 4 plates.  Top with the fried shrimp and soft-shell crabs, and place a large dollop of cocktail sauce and tartar sauce to the sides.  Arrange French fried potatoes, dill pickle slices, and lemon wedges to the sides and serve immediately, garnished with parsley.

For the Cocktail Sauce:  In a small bowl, combine all of the ingredients and stir to blend well.  It will keep, covered and refrigerated, up to 1 week.  (Makes 1 cup)

For the Kicked Up Tartar Sauce:  Put the egg, mustard, garlic, lemon juice, parley, and onion in a blender or food processor and process until smooth, about 15 seconds.  With the processor running, pour the oil through the feed tube in a steady stream.  Add the Worcestershire, season with salt, pepper, and hot sauce, and pulse to blend.  Cover and let sit for 1 hour in the refrigerator before serving.  Use within 24 hours.  (Makes about 1 1/3 cups)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  shaker dried corn
                        = (or fresh or frozen corn kernels)
     1/2         pound  salt pork -- diced
  3               cups  chopped yellow onions
  1           teaspoon  celery salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1                     bay leaf
  3               cups  diced peeled baking potatoes, like russets
  8               cups  chicken stock -- or more as necessary
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions (green tops only)

If using dried corn, place in a large bowl and cover with lukewarm water by 1-inch.  Soak for 18 to 24 hours.  Drain well before using.

In a large saucepan, cook the diced pork over medium-high heat until golden brown and the fat is rendered.  Add the onions, celery salt, and cayenne, and cook until onions are soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and bay leaf and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the potatoes and drained corn, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.  Add the milk and cream, and simmer for 5 minutes.

Remove from the heat and discard the bay leaf.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Ladle into soup bowls and garnish each serving with the green onions.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  loaf Italian bread, abt 5" wide -- cut 1/2"-thk slices
  1              pound  fresh mozzarella -- sliced crosswise
     1/2         pound  pancetta -- sliced crosswise
  6               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  Essence -- divided
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1                cup  fine dry bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  Italian seasoning
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
  1                cup  very finely grated Parmesan -- garnish
     1/2           cup  minced fresh Italian parsley

Place 12 metal or wooden skewers on a work surface.

Make 3 sandwiches by layering the bread, cheese, and pancetta 3 times, with bread on both ends.  Cut each sandwich into fourths and run a skewer through the center of each.  (If frying in a pot instead of a deep fryer, arrange the stacks toward one end to fry more uniformly.)

Preheat the oil to 350 degrees in a heavy, deep pot or deep fryer.

In a shallow dish, combine the flour with 1 tablespoon of the Essence.  In a second dish, combine the bread crumbs with the remaining tablespoon of Essence.  In a third dish, beat the eggs with 1/4 cup of water.

One at a time, dip each skewer in the flour, then the eggs, then the bread crumbs, shaking to remove any excess.  Fry, turning with tongs, until golden brown and the cheese melts, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Arrange on a platter and while still hot, sprinkle with Parmesan and parsley.

Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 to 12 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sliced hulled fresh strawberries
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chopped macadamia nuts
                        === MACERATED STRAWBERRIES ===
  1              quart  fresh strawberries -- rinsed, hulled,
                        and sliced
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar - (to 1/3) -- or more to taste
                        = (depending upon the sweetness of the
                        berries)
  1         tablespoon  Grand Marnier
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated orange peel
                        === SWEETENED WHIPPED CREAM ===
  1                cup  cold heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  confectioners' sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and set aside.

Place the strawberries in a blender or food processor, and puree on high speed.  In a large bowl, beat together the eggs, sugar, and oil.  Add the strawberries and whisk until well blended.

Into a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.  Fold into the strawberry mixture, blending until moistened.  Fold in the nuts, being careful not to overmix.  Pour into the prepared pan and bake until a tester inserted into the middle comes out clean, about 50 minutes.  Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack.  Let sit for 10 minutes, then turn onto the wire rack to cool completely.

For the Macerated Strawberries:  In a bowl, combine all the ingredients and stir.  Cover and let soak in the refrigerator for 2 hours.

Using a large serrated knife, cut the cooled shortcake in half horizontally.  Place the bottom half, cut-side up on a decorative cake plate.  Spread half of the macerated strawberries across the cake and top with the other cake half.  Spread the whipped cream across the top piece and top with the remaining strawberries.  Serve immediately.

For the Sweetened Whipped Cream:  In a bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks start to form.  Add the sugar and whip until stiff peaks start to form, being careful not to overwhip.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Into a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.  Fold into the strawberry mixture, blending until moistened.  Fold in the nuts, being careful not to overmix.  Pour into the prepared pan and bake until a tester inserted into the middle comes out clean, about 50 minutes.

Using a large serrated knife, cut the cooled shortcake in half horizontally.  Place the bottom half, cut-side up on a decorative cake plate.  Spread half of the macerated strawberries across the cake and top with the other cake half.  Spread the whipped cream across the top piece and top with the remaining strawberries.  Serve immediately.

For the Sweetened Whipped Cream:  In a bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks start to form.  Add the sugar and whip until stiff peaks start to form, being careful not to overwhip.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.

          Garlic Roasted Pork Loin With Raspberry Chipotle Glaze

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RASPBERRY CHIPOTLE GLAZE ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  small-diced onion
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  chipotle chiles in adobo -- chopped
  2              pints  fresh raspberries -- rinsed
     1/2           cup  raspberry vinegar
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === GARLIC ROASTED PORK LOIN ===
  2 1/2         pounds  boned pork loin - (to 3 1/2)
  8              large  garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        sliced in half lengthwise
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh sage
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              bunch  watercress -- rinsed, patted dry,
                        and tough stems discarded
                        Wild Rice And Dried Cranberry Dressing -- (see recipe)

For the Glaze:  In a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft and slightly caramelized, 4 minutes.  Add the garlic to the pan and saute for 1 minute.  Add the chipotles and cook, stirring continuously, for 1 minute.  Add the raspberries and cook until soft, 2 to 3 minutes.

Add the vinegar and stir to deglaze the pan.  Add the sugar and salt, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until thickened and reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer, pressing on the solids with the back of a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible.

For the Pork Loin: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Place a large roasting pan over 2 burners over medium-high heat.  Add oil to coat the bottom and heat.  Season the pork loin with salt and pepper.  Place the loin in the roasting pan and sear on all sides until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.

In a food processor, combine the garlic, rosemary, sage, and thyme.  Process until smooth.  Add enough oil to make the mixture a good, spreadable consistency.  Season with salt and pepper.

Remove the pork from the heat.  Carefully rub the garlic/herb mixture over the pork loin.

Roast until an instant read thermometer inserted into the center of the roast registers an internal temperature of 140 degrees, 40 to 45 minutes.  Five minutes before removing the roast from the oven, evenly spread the glaze over the top.  Remove from the oven and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm.  Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.

Line a large bowl or platter with watercress.  Arrange the Wild Rice And Dried Cranberry Dressing on top and serve.  Slice the pork loin and place on top of the rice dressing.  Drizzle with leftover glaze.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

For the Glaze:  In a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft and slightly caramelized, 4 minutes.  Add the garlic to the pan and saute for 1 minute.  Add the chipotles and cook, stirring continuously, for 1 minute.  Add the raspberries and cook until soft, 2 to 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the vinegar and stir to deglaze the pan.  Add the sugar and salt, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until thickened and reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer, pressing on the solids with the back of a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Pork Loin: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a large roasting pan over 2 burners over medium-high heat.  Add oil to coat the bottom and heat.  Season the pork loin with salt and pepper.  Place the loin in the roasting pan and sear on all sides until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a food processor, combine the garlic, rosemary, sage, and thyme.  Process until smooth.  Add enough oil to make the mixture a good, spreadable consistency.  Season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the pork from the heat.  Carefully rub the garlic/herb mixture over the pork loin.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast until an instant read thermometer inserted into the center of the roast registers an internal temperature of 140 degrees, 40 to 45 minutes.  Five minutes before removing the roast from the oven, evenly spread the glaze over the top.  Remove from the oven and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm.  Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Line a large bowl or platter with watercress.  Arrange the Wild Rice And Dried Cranberry Dressing on top and serve.  Slice the pork loin and place on top of the rice dressing.  Drizzle with leftover glaze.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             sticks  unsalted butter -- plus
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  3               cups  grated carrots
  1                cup  chopped toasted pecans
                        === PECAN CREAM CHEESE ICING ===
  8             ounces  cream cheese
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  1                     box confectioners' sugar - (1 lb)
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  chopped toasted pecans

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Butter 3 (9-inch) cake pans with 1 tablespoon of the butter and set aside.  In a large bowl, cream the butter with an electric mixer.  Add the sugar, and beat.  In a medium bowl or on a piece of parchment, combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt, and mix well.

Add the dry ingredients, alternating with the eggs, beating well after the addition of each.  Add the vanilla extract and mix.  Add the carrots and beat on medium speed until well incorporated, about 2 minutes.  Fold in the nuts.  Divide between the 3 cake pans and bake until set and a cake tester inserted into the middle comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let rest in the cake pans for 10 minutes.  Invert onto wire racks, remove from the pans, and let cool.

For the Pecan Cream Cheese Icing:  In a large bowl, cream together the cream cheese and butter until light and fluffy.  Add the sugar gradually, beating constantly.  Add the vanilla and pecans.

When the cake is cool, place 1 cake layer on a cake plate or stand.  Spread the top with cream cheese frosting and top with a second and third cake layer, spreading the icing between each layer.  Spread the icing around the sides of the cake and let harden slightly before serving.  To serve, cut into wedges.

This recipe yields 1 cake, 8 to 10 servings.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried salt cod -- cut 4" pieces
  3             medium  baking potatoes/ like russets -- peeled, cubed
  1           teaspoon  turmeric powder
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1              large  egg
     1/2           cup  whole milk
  1         tablespoon  Essence -- plus
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1                cup  dry bread crumbs
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        === SABLADA ===
     1/2        medium  onion -- sliced thinly
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
     1/2           cup  small-diced cucumber
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Lay the salt cod flat in a non-reactive pan or dish.  Add enough water to cover the fish by 1-inch.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 6 hours refrigerated.  Drain and rinse the fish under cold running water.  Place the fish on a flat work surface covered with paper towels, and press each piece firmly with your hands.  Pat dry with fresh paper towels and return to the soaking pan.  Repeat the soaking and rinsing process 3 more times, for a total of 4 times in all.  Place the rinsed salt cod in an airtight container until ready to use, and refrigerate for up to 1 week.

Place the soaked cod in a saucepan, add enough cold water to cover and bring to a simmer over medium heat.  Lower the heat slightly and barely simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking liquid.  Transfer to a bowl and flake with a fork, removing any bones or skin.  Finely chop and reserve.

Meanwhile, boil the potatoes in salted water to cover by 1-inch until tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain and transfer to a bowl and mash.  Add the chopped fish, turmeric, chili powder, cayenne, lime juice, and the 2 tablespoons reserved cooking liquid.

In a medium bowl, combine the egg, milk, and 1 teaspoon of the Essence.  In a second bowl, season the bread crumbs with the remaining 1 tablespoon of Essence.  With slightly damp hands, shape the fish mixture into small balls (about 1-inch in diameter) for an appetizer portion or large balls (about 2-inches in diameter) for entree portions.  One at a time, drop in the egg wash then the seasoned bread crumbs to coat evenly, shaking to remove any excess.  Transfer to a baking sheet and refrigerate until completely cool.

Fill a large pot or electric fryer halfway with vegetable oil and heat 360 degrees.  Add the fish balls in batches and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Serve hot with Sablada.

For the Sablada:  Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and mix well.

This recipe yields 6 entree or 12 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sheet prepared puff pastry
  4             ounces  mild creamy goat cheese -- softened
  2        tablespoons  lavender honey
  2                     ripe firm pears -- cored, and
                        thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  6             ounces  fresh blackberries
  4          teaspoons  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  confectioners' sugar

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to a rectangle about 8 by 12 inches.  Fold the edges of the long sides over about 1 1/2 inches to make an edge on the tart.  Score the edges lightly with a small knife, being careful not to cut all the way through the dough.  Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

In a small bowl, mash the goat cheese with the honey.  Spread the cheese evenly across the pastry inside the scored border.  Arrange the pears and blackberries decoratively across the top of the cheese.  Sprinkle evenly with the sugar and bake until the pastry is golden and the fruit is soft, 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove the tart from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool before serving.

In a bowl, whip together the cream and sour cream.  Add the sugar and whip until soft peaks just start to form.  To serve, cut the tart and serve the cream on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to a rectangle about 8 by 12 inches.  Fold the edges of the long sides over about 1 1/2 inches to make an edge on the tart.  Score the edges lightly with a small knife, being careful not to cut all the way through the dough.  Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, mash the goat cheese with the honey.  Spread the cheese evenly across the pastry inside the scored border.  Arrange the pears and blackberries decoratively across the top of the cheese.  Sprinkle evenly with the sugar and bake until the pastry is golden and the fruit is soft, 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove the tart from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool before serving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl, whip together the cream and sour cream.  Add the sugar and whip until soft peaks just start to form.  To serve, cut the tart and serve the cream on the side.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  store-bought yeast-raised coffee cake
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- softened
  1 3/4           cups  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  1                     egg
  3        tablespoons  light corn syrup
  3        tablespoons  water
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 3/4           cups  flour
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

Generously butter 1 (9- by 13-inch) baking pan.

Cut the coffee cake into 2-inch pieces and press pieces in the baking pan to form a snug single layer.  In a bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat the butter, sugar, and salt until very smooth.  Add the egg, then beat in the corn syrup until smooth.  Add the water and vanilla and, when incorporated, lower the speed to low and add the flour, mixing until just combined.

Using a fork, pierce the coffee cake all over.  Pour the gooey butter batter over the top of the cake pieces, using the back of a spoon or a spatula to spread evenly.  Let stand for 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Bake until the butter is bubbly and golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes, being careful not to over bake, as the cake will not be gooey.

Cool to room temperature, cut into squares, and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar to serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  This is a dish native to St. Louis.  Apparently it originated during the Great Depression in the German section in the southern part of town.  It almost always starts with store-bought or leftover yeast coffee cake or danishes that are cut up and fit into a buttered pan.  The "gooey butter" part comes from the topping, which is poured over the cake pieces and then baked.

           Greek-Style Stuffed Artichokes With Avgolomono Sauce

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  salt -- plus
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4             medium  artichokes -- rinsed well, top
                        third removed, and leaf tips trimmed
  2                     lemons -- cut into wedges
  1 1/2         pounds  lamb sausage -- removed from
                        casings and crumbled
  2               cups  chopped yellow onions
     1/4           cup  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh oregano
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  2               cups  fine dry bread crumbs
  1                cup  crumbled feta cheese
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice -- plus
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  4          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  2              large  eggs

Fill a large pot 3/4 full with water.  Add 1/4 cup of the salt and bring to a boil.  Rub the cut sides and bottoms of the artichokes with the lemon wedges.  Squeeze the juice from the lemons into the boiling water.  Add the artichokes and lemon wedges, weight with a heavy dish or bowl, and simmer, partially covered, until the bottoms are tender and can be pierced with a sharp knife and an outer leaf pulls out easily, 15 to 18 minutes.  Reserve 2/3 cup of the cooking liquid for the sauce.  Drain the artichokes upside down in a colander.

Cook the sausage in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, stirring, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the onions to the fat in the pan and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, oregano, and parsley, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and let sit until cool enough to handle.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

When the artichokes are cool enough to handle, gently press back the center leaves so the inner choke and prickly leaves are revealed.  Pull out the cone of undeveloped white leaves in the center and gently scrape out the hairy choke with a spoon so as not to damage the heart.

In a large bowl combine the bread crumbs, feta cheese, 6 tablespoons of the olive oil, the water, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, the Essence, remaining teaspoon of salt, the red pepper, and the cooled sausage mixture.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Gently pull the artichoke leaves outward to make space between the leaves.  Fill these gaps with the sausage-bread stuffing, pushing down to pack lightly.  Place the artichokes in a large baking dish and drizzle the tops with the remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil.  Bake uncovered until the bread crumbs develop a nice golden brown crust, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove the artichokes from the oven and let cool slightly before serving.

To make the sauce, in a small saucepan bring the reserved 2/3 cup of artichoke cooking liquid to a boil.  In a bowl whisk together the eggs and remaining 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  Whisking constantly, add about half of the hot liquid to the egg mixture in a stream, then add back to the saucepan with the remaining hot liquid.  Whisk until thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, 2 to 3 minutes, being careful not to let boil.  Strain through a strainer into a clean bowl.

To serve, arrange the artichokes on a large platter or 4 individual plates.  Drizzle the hot sauce over the artichokes and serve immediately, reserving any remaining sauce for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHRIMP-LEMON BUTTER SAUCE ===
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                     lemon -- quartered, chopped
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- plus
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  5             ounces  raw peeled deveined shrimp -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        === POMPANO ===
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  Essence
  4                     boned pompano fillets - (5 to 6 oz ea)
                        === LEMON-BRAISED LEEKS ===
  1              large  leek -- well rinsed, trimmed
  2               cups  strained shrimp or fish stock
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
                        Peel from 1/2 lemon -- coarsely chopped
  2                     bay leaves
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat a grill to medium-high.

Shrimp-Lemon Butter Sauce:  Combine the wine, lemons, shallots, and garlic in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced by half, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally and mashing the lemons with the back of a spoon to break up into pieces.  Add the cream and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.

Whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, adding each piece before the previous one has been completely incorporated.  Continue until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, removing the pan from the heat periodically to prevent the sauce from getting too hot and breaking.  Add the salt and pepper, and whisk to blend.

Remove from the heat and strain, pressing down with the whisk, through a fine mesh strainer, into a small bowl.  Fold in the parsley and cover to keep warm.

Season the shrimp with the Essence.  Melt the remaining 1 teaspoon of butter in a medium-non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the shrimp and cook, stirring, until pink and cooked through, about 3 minutes.

Remove from the heat and fold into the sauce.  Serve immediately with the pompano.

Combine the oil and Essence in a small bowl, and lightly rub both sides of each fillet with the mixture.

Place the fish, flesh-side down on the grill and cook for 2 minutes.  Turn the fillets 1/4-turn to make decorative grill marks and cook an additional 2 minutes.  Turn and cook skin-side down until fish flakes easily, about 4 minutes.

Remove from the grill and place on 4 serving plates.  Top with the butter sauce, and serve immediately.  (Alternately, the fish can be cooked in the oven.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place the seasoned fish on a non-stick baking sheet and roast until golden brown and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.)

Lemon-Braised Leeks:  Trim the leeks, discarding the green tops.  Cut into thin strips and place in a bowl of ice water.  Soak for 5 minutes to remove any grit, then drain.  Place in a clean bowl of ice water and soak again for 5 minutes.  Drain well.

Combine the stock, wine, lemon peel, bay leaves, and pepper in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low.  Add the leeks and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let the leeks sit in the poaching liquid for 10 to 15 minutes.

Drain in a fine mesh strainer.  Discard the bay leaves and reserve the poaching liquid, as desired, for another use.  Set aside the leeks until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Preheat a grill to medium-high.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Shrimp-Lemon Butter Sauce:  Combine the wine, lemons, shallots, and garlic in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced by half, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally and mashing the lemons with the back of a spoon to break up into pieces.  Add the cream and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, adding each piece before the previous one has been completely incorporated.  Continue until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, removing the pan from the heat periodically to prevent the sauce from getting too hot and breaking.  Add the salt and pepper, and whisk to blend.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the heat and strain, pressing down with the whisk, through a fine mesh strainer, into a small bowl.  Fold in the parsley and cover to keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season the shrimp with the Essence.  Melt the remaining 1 teaspoon of butter in a medium-non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the shrimp and cook, stirring, until pink and cooked through, about 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the heat and fold into the sauce.  Serve immediately with the pompano.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the oil and Essence in a small bowl, and lightly rub both sides of each fillet with the mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the fish, flesh-side down on the grill and cook for 2 minutes.  Turn the fillets 1/4-turn to make decorative grill marks and cook an additional 2 minutes.  Turn and cook skin-side down until fish flakes easily, about 4 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the grill and place on 4 serving plates.  Top with the butter sauce, and serve immediately.  (Alternately, the fish can be cooked in the oven.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place the seasoned fish on a non-stick baking sheet and roast until golden brown and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lemon-Braised Leeks:  Trim the leeks, discarding the green tops.  Cut into thin strips and place in a bowl of ice water.  Soak for 5 minutes to remove any grit, then drain.  Place in a clean bowl of ice water and soak again for 5 minutes.  Drain well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the stock, wine, lemon peel, bay leaves, and pepper in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low.  Add the leeks and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let the leeks sit in the poaching liquid for 10 to 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain in a fine mesh strainer.  Discard the bay leaves and reserve the poaching liquid, as desired, for another use.  Set aside the leeks until ready to serve.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  chopped lemon zest
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  whole black peppercorns
                        Salt -- to taste
  8                     lamb T-bones - (6 oz ea)
                        === FARMSTAND HERB JELLY ===
  4             sprigs  mint -- plus 10 leaves
                        = (like pineapple, apple, or
                        chocolate mint)
  1              sprig  rosemary
  1 1/2           cups  white wine verjus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  2          teaspoons  unflavored gelatin

Preheat a grill.

In a spice grinder, process the lemon zest, garlic, and peppercorns to make a dry rub.  Transfer to a bowl.  Lightly salt and rub the lemon spice onto both sides of the T-bones.  Grill the T-bones to desired temperature, about 1 1/2 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Remove from the grill and serve immediately with the Herb Jelly.

For the Farmstand Herb Jelly:  In a medium saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, combine the mint sprigs, rosemary, verjus, sugar, and salt.  Bring just to a boil.  Set aside, covered, to steep until the herbs flavor the liquid, about 30 minutes.  Strain the liquid and discard the herbs.  Pour 1/4 cup of the infused liquid into a bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the surface and set aside to let it "bloom" for about 5 minutes.  Reheat the remaining liquid and whisk it into the gelatin mixture until evenly dissolved.

Pour the verjus mixture into a small gratin dish and refrigerate until thickened and almost set about, 20 minutes.  Chiffonade the mint leaves, and stir into the aspic.  Refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes more.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  cooked good quality ham
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4               cups  dried tart apples
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  2               cups  flour
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  3        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  milk -- more or less

Place the ham and salt in a large pot and cover with water.  Bring to boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until the ham is tender, about 2 hours.

Place the apples in large bowl, cover with water, and soak for 2 to 3 hours.  When the ham is tender, add the apples and their soaking liquid to the pot.  Add the brown sugar and onions, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 hours.

Into a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper.  Add the egg and melted butter, and enough milk to make a moist, fairly stiff batter.

Uncover the ham and apples, and bring the cooking liquid to a boil.  Drop the batter by tablespoonfuls into the boiling liquid.  Cover tightly and simmer for 12 to 15 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

To serve, transfer the ham to a large platter and let sit for 5 minutes.  Carve thinly and spoon the dumplings around the meat.  Serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  16            slices  bacon
                        === HAM HOCK GRAVY ===
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
  1                cup  chopped green bell peppers
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1                cup  dry red wine
  2             medium  ham hocks - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  6               cups  veal stock
                        = (or rich beef stock)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a large, heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the Andouille and cook, stirring, until brown, about 3 minutes.  Add the onions, bell peppers, and celery and cook, stirring often, until tender, about 4 minutes.  Add garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and the black pepper, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the corn bread and chicken stock and cook, stirring, until the corn bread is soft, about 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and mix in the parsley.  Let cool for about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, with a thin sharp knife, cut a slit into the side of the pork chops about 2 1/2-inches across and 1-inch deep.  Season the chops on both sides with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and the Essence.  Then stuff each chop with about 1/2 cup of the cooled corn bread stuffing.  (The chops will be very full.)

Wrap 4 slices of bacon around each chop, making sure that each end of bacon overlaps the next, so that the chop is completely wrapped.  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a very large heavy ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Carefully lay the chops in the pan.  Cook until the bacon is crispy, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 20 minutes.

Remove from the oven.  Transfer the chops to a platter and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm and serve with Ham Hock Gravy.

For the Ham Hock Gravy:  In a Dutch oven or large, heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, bell peppers, and celery, and cook, stirring, until they begin to caramelize, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the tomato paste, stir well to combine, and cook until it begins to brown, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Add the red wine and cook, stirring, to deglaze the pan and loosen any bits clinging to the bottom.  Add the ham hocks and veal stock, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until reduced by half, 2 hours and 45 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Remove the ham hocks and set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the flour, whisking constantly, until smooth and starting to thicken, about 2 minutes.  Continue to cook, constantly stirring with a wooden spoon until the roux has a nutty aroma and becomes a light peanut butter color, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.

Whisk the cooled roux into the hot gravy and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes until thickened.  Cover to keep warm.

Remove the fat and skin from the ham hocks and discard.  Remove the meat from the bone and finely chop.  Return the meat to the gravy, add salt and pepper to taste, and keep covered until ready to serve with the stuffed pork chops.  (Makes 2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     live 1-pound lobsters
  8             ounces  unsalted butter - (2 sticks)
  1 1/2           cups  dry Sherry -- divided
                        = (either amantillado or fino)
  6               cups  whole milk
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh parsley

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Plunge the lobsters head first into the boiling water, in batches, if necessary, and cook, covered, for 5 minutes.  Transfer the lobsters with tongs to a large bowl filled with ice water to cool.  When the lobsters are cool enough to handle, crack the shells, remove the tail and claw meat, and coarsely chop.  Reserve the shells.  Tightly cover the meat and refrigerate.

In a large Dutch oven, melt 4 ounces (1 stick) of butter over medium-high heat.  Add the shells and cook, stirring, until they turn bright red, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add 1 cup of the Sherry and bring to a boil.  Cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.  Add the milk, cream, paprika, salt, and pepper, and return to the boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.  Cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight for the flavors to develop.

Remove the milk and shell mixture from the refrigerator and strain into a clean container through a fine mesh strainer.  Set aside.

In a large, heavy pot, melt the remaining 4 ounces (1 stick) of butter over medium-high heat.  Add the chopped lobster meat and cook, stirring, until lightly colored, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the remaining 1/2 cup of Sherry and increase the heat to high.  Cook, stirring, to deglaze the pan and until reduced by half.  Add the strained milk mixture and bring to a low boil.  Simmer, stirring, until heated through.

Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Spoon into bowls and garnish with chopped fresh parsley.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
  1              pound  shrimp -  (21/25 count) -- peeled, deveined,
                        and butterflied
  2          teaspoons  Emeril's Asian Spice Blend -- (listed below)
  1           teaspoon  lime juice
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  cold water
  8             ounces  katafi (shredded phyllo pastry) -- defrosted, and
                        covered with damp towel - (half 16-oz box)
  1              large  Bibb lettuce head -- separated into
                        leaves, tough stem ends removed,
                        washed and spun dry
                        Chinese pickled vegetables -- chopped
                        === KICKED UP HOISIN SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  distilled white vinegar
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic -- chopped
  1              small  red Szechuan chile pepper -- stem removed,
                        and finely chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped yellow onions
     1/4           cup  chopped celery
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh cilantro
  1                cup  store-bought hoisin sauce
                        === EMERIL'S ASIAN SPICE BLEND ===
  1         tablespoon  five spice powder
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  cayenne

In a wok, preheat the oil to 375 degrees.

In a baking dish, toss the shrimp with the Asian spice and lime juice.

In a bowl, sift together the flour, cornstarch and salt.  Gradually add the water, whisking until the batter is smooth and thick enough to lightly coat the back of a spoon.  Place the shrimp in the batter and toss to coat.

Unroll the katafi, a small amount at a time, and cut into lengths the same size as the shrimp, about 4-inches.  Spread the cut katafi on a work surface and cover with a damp towel to keep from drying out.  One at a time, lay the shrimp on the cut katafi and roll to completely wrap inside.  In batches, add to the oil and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.

To serve, place the shrimp in the lettuce cups.  Drizzle with the hoisin sauce and sprinkle with the pickled vegetables.  Serve immediately.

For the Emeril's Asian Spice Blend:  In a small bowl, blend all the ingredients.  Keep in an airtight container until ready to use.

                Kibbeh With Yogurt-Garlic Sauce (Lebanon)

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === OUTER SHELLS ===
  1 1/2           cups  fine bulgur wheat
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef
  1 1/2           cups  roughly-chopped yellow onions
  3          teaspoons  ground cumin
  2 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === STUFFING ===
     1/2         pound  ground beef
     3/4          cups  finely-chopped yellow onions
     1/3           cup  pine nuts -- lightly toasted
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Chopped parsley -- for garnish
                        === YOGURT GARLIC SAUCE ===
  1                cup  strained plain yogurt
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh mint leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

To make the outer shells, place the bulgur wheat in a bowl and cover with water.  Let sit for 20 minutes then drain in a strainer, pressing to extract the excess liquid.

In a large bowl, blend the beef, onions, cumin, salt, and pepper to a paste.  Add the strained bulgur wheat and mix well.  Process again, in batches, in a food processor until smooth and pliable enough to work like a dough, adding a little ice water if needed.

To make the stuffing, in a large skillet, cook the meat, stirring, over medium-high heat until browned, about 4 minutes.  Add the onions, salt, allspice, pepper, and cinnamon, and cook, stirring, until tender, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the pine nuts.  Let sit until cool enough to handle.

To make the final dish, with wet hands, shape the raw meat-bulgur mixture into egg-sized balls.  Make a hole down the center of each ball with an index finger to make a deep cup with a pointed bottom.  Stuff each ball with about 1 tablespoon of the stuffing.  Press down on the sides and top to enclose the filling and reshape into a smooth egg with a pointed top.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients, wetting your hands frequently.

Preheat the oil to 360 degrees.

In batches, add the kibbeh balls to the hot oil and cook until golden brown and the meat is cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Serve hot or at room temperature, with the Yogurt-Garlic Sauce for dipping.

For the Yogurt-Garlic Sauce:  In a medium bowl, whisk the yogurt until smooth and creamy.  Add the remaining ingredients and whisk to combine.  (Makes 1 cup)

This recipe yields 1 1/2 to 2 dozen.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     loaf Ciabatta bread -- halved lengthwise
  2 1/2           cups  Emeril's Basic Tomato Sauce -- (listed below)
                        = (or store-bought pizza or pasta sauce)
  2 1/2           cups  coarsely-grated mozzarella cheese
  6              large  leftover meatballs -- sliced thin rounds
     1/2                yellow onion -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  red pepper flakes
     1/4           cup  grated fresh Parmesan cheese
                        === EMERIL'S BASIC TOMATO SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     3/4           cup  chopped yellow onions
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/8      teaspoon  ground black pepper
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz) -- broken into pieces
                        and their juices
  1                can  tomato sauce - (15 oz)
  4          teaspoons  tomato paste
  1                cup  chicken stock or water
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place the 2 bread halves on a large baking sheet.  Spread the tomato sauce evenly over both halves and top each with the Mozzarella cheese.  Arrange the meatballs over the cheese and top with sliced onions, red pepper flakes and mozzarella cheese.  Bake until the cheese is bubby, the bread is toasted, and the onions are wilted and start to color, about 20 minutes.

For the Emeril's Basic Tomato Sauce:  Heat the olive oil in a medium pot over medium heat.  Add the onions, garlic, salt, basil, oregano and black pepper, and cook, stirring, until soft, 4 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and their juices, the tomato paste, water, and sugar, and stir well.  Bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered until thickened and fragrant, about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning to taste.  Use as needed to top pasta or pizza.  (Makes 5 cups)

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

                        === FRIED FISH ===
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground fenugreek
     1/2           cup  olive or canola oil - (to 1)
  3        tablespoons  pine nuts
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced yellow onions
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  turmeric
  1 1/2           cups  long-grain white rice
  3               cups  water
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  4                     mild firm white fish fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish
                        Pomegranate molasses
                        Chili oil
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish
                        === HOMEMADE TAHINI ===
  4               cups  sesame seeds
     1/4           cup  olive oil - (to 1/2)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

For the Tarator:  Place the Homemade Tahini, 1/4 cup water, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, the garlic, salt, cumin, and cayenne in a blender and process on high speed.  With the machine running, continue adding more water 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time until it becomes a smooth sauce with the consistency of mayonnaise.  Add the parsley and process to incorporate.  Adjust seasoning, to taste, with additional lemon juice or spices.  Transfer to another container.

For the Fried Fish:  In a small bowl, combine the black pepper, ginger, cumin, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and fenugreek.  Stir to combine.

In a medium pot, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the pine nuts and cook, stirring, until golden brown and fragrant.  Remove with a slotted spoon.  Add the onions and fry, stirring, until golden.  Add the rice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, turmeric, and 1/4 teaspoon of the mixed spices.  Cook, stirring, until fragrant and the rice is coated with oil, 1 minute.  Add the water.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer without stirring until the water is absorbed and the rice is fluffy, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let sit without stirring for 10 minutes.  While the rice is cooking, cook the fish.

In a large saute pan, heat enough oil to come 1/2-inch up the sides of the pan over high heat until hot but not smoking.

In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, remaining spice blend, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Dredge the fish fillets in the seasoned flour to coat on both sides, shaking to remove any excess.  Add to the hot oil in batches, if necessary, and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side, shaking the pan to prevent the fish from sticking.  Remove and drain on paper towels.

Fluff the rice with a fork and add the fried pine nuts, stirring to incorporate.  Divide among 4 plates and top with the fish.  Spoon the sauce over the fish, garnish with parsley and drizzle with pomegranate molasses and chili oil.  Serve with lemon wedges, and serve immediately.

For the Homemade Tahini:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Spread the sesame seeds on a shallow baking tray and bake, shaking frequently, until fragrant, 5 to 7 minutes.  Do not brown.  Cool.  Put the sesame seeds in a blender or food processor fitted with the metal blade.  Add 1/4 cup of the vegetable oil.  Process to a smooth paste, about 3 minutes.  Add more oil as necessary to bring the paste to a thick pouring consistency.  Tahini will keep, refrigerated, in a tightly covered container for several months.  (Makes approximately 4 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

          Lentils With Bulgur Wheat And Caramelized Onions - ...

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dry green lentils -- rinsed, picked over
  3               cups  water
  1                cup  bulgur wheat
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  yellow onion -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  grated nutmeg
  1              pinch  allspice
  3              large  onions -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley - (to 1/2) -- for garnish
                        === PITA BREADS ===
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2               cups  warm water -- abt 110 degrees
  5               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 6)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
                        = (or vegetable oil)

In a medium pot, combine the lentils and water.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, cover, and simmer until still firm and almost done, 15 to 18 minutes.  Add the bulgur wheat and 1/2 teaspoon salt, cover, and remove from the heat.  Let sit until the bulgur is tender and the water is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes, adding more water if the wheat seems dry.

In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the chopped onions and cook, stirring, until very soft, 5 minutes.

Add the garlic, cumin, cinnamon, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, black pepper, nutmeg, and allspice, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the lentil and bulgur wheat mixture and stir well to combine.  Remove from the heat.

In a large skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive over medium heat.  Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized to a very dark brown color, 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Transfer the lentil and bulgur wheat mixture to a platter and top with the caramelized onions.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley, to taste.  Serve either hot or at room temperature, with pita bread.

For the Pita Breads:  In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in 1/4 cup of the water.  Set aside until foamy, about 5 minutes.

Into a large bowl, sift 5 cups of the flour and the salt, and make a well in the center.  Pour the yeast into the center well and mix the yeast into the flour, working in the remaining water.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead into a soft, pliable dough.  Continue working the dough until it is smooth and shiny, 10 to 15 minutes, adding more flour as necessary.

Knead 2 tablespoons of the oil into the dough and work the dough over itself into a smooth ball.  Pour the remaining tablespoon of oil into a large bowl.  Place the dough in the bowl, cover with a damp kitchen cloth, and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees at least 30 minutes before baking.  Lightly oil a heavy baking sheet.

Punch down the dough and lightly knead for 2 minutes.  Divide into 8 to 12 equal portions, depending upon your preference, and roll into balls.  Flatten and roll with a rolling pin to about 1/4-inch thickness.  Place on a lightly floured surface, cover with a lightly floured kitchen cloth and let rise until doubled in size, 30 to 40 minutes.

Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and bake until puffed and golden, about 5 minutes.  Turn and bake on the second side, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool on wire racks.  Repeat with the remaining dough.  (Makes 8 to 12 breads)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Transfer the lentil and bulgur wheat mixture to a platter and top with the caramelized onions.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley, to taste.  Serve either hot or at room temperature, with pita bread.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Pita Breads:  In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in 1/4 cup of the water.  Set aside until foamy, about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Into a large bowl, sift 5 cups of the flour and the salt, and make a well in the center.  Pour the yeast into the center well and mix the yeast into the flour, working in the remaining water.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead into a soft, pliable dough.  Continue working the dough until it is smooth and shiny, 10 to 15 minutes, adding more flour as necessary.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Knead 2 tablespoons of the oil into the dough and work the dough over itself into a smooth ball.  Pour the remaining tablespoon of oil into a large bowl.  Place the dough in the bowl, cover with a damp kitchen cloth, and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees at least 30 minutes before baking.  Lightly oil a heavy baking sheet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Punch down the dough and lightly knead for 2 minutes.  Divide into 8 to 12 equal portions, depending upon your preference, and roll into balls.  Flatten and roll with a rolling pin to about 1/4-inch thickness.  Place on a lightly floured surface, cover with a lightly floured kitchen cloth and let rise until doubled in size, 30 to 40 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and bake until puffed and golden, about 5 minutes.  Turn and bake on the second side, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool on wire racks.  Repeat with the remaining dough.  (Makes 8 to 12 breads)

  2             sprigs  cilantro
  2                     live lobsters - (1 1/2 lbs ea)
                        === FRIED ONION SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  2             medium  onions -- peeled, and
                        sliced thinly, plus
  1 1/2           cups  finely-chopped onions
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh ginger
  4                     cardamom pods -- bruised
  1                     cinnamon stick - (2")
  1         tablespoon  ground coriander
  1 1/2      teaspoons  paprika
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  ground turmeric
     1/4      teaspoon  fennel seeds -- crushed
  1 1/2           cups  chopped seeded fresh ripe tomatoes
  2               cups  reserved lobster stock
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2         tablespoon  chopped cilantro leaves -- plus
                        additional sprigs for garnish
                        Reserved lobster meat -- from above
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley

To make the Lobster And Sauce Base:  To cook the lobsters, in a large pot, bring the water, wine, orange juice, 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice, the celery, onions, carrots, salt, to taste, peppercorns, thyme, parsley, smashed garlic, bay leaves, cayenne, and cilantro to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the lobsters.  Return to a simmer and cook until the lobster shells turn red, about 5 minutes.  Remove the lobsters with tongs and place in an ice bath to stop the cooking.

When cool enough to handle, remove the tail and claw meat from the shells, chop, and set aside; reserve the shells and juices.  Add the lobster shells and any juices to the pot, and bring to a boil.  Cook until the liquid is reduced to 2 cups, about 1 hour.  Strain the cooking liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean pot and keep warm.

To make the Sauce:  Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.  Heat the oil in a large saute pan over high heat.  Add the onion slices and fry, stirring, until dark brown about 9 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven.

In a separate pan, add the chopped onions to the oil remaining in the pan and fry until they caramelized, about 7 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Reduce the heat to medium and add the cardamom, cinnamon, coriander, paprika, cumin, cayenne, turmeric, and fennel seeds.  Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 15 seconds.  Add the tomatoes and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thickened and the oil begins to separate, 5 to 6 minutes.

In a small saucepan, bring the reserved lobster stock to a boil.  Add to the sauce and stir to combine.  Reduce the heat and simmer until reduced to a thick gravy, about 8 minutes.  Add the cream, butter, and 2 tablespoons of the chopped cilantro leaves, stir, and cook for 1 minute.  Add the lobster meat and simmer until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Transfer to a large decorative platter and serve, garnished with the sliced fried onions, parsley, and cilantro sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

       Maple Ice Cream With Candied Walnuts, Nutty Chocolate Sauce

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Grade A or B maple syrup
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  whole milk
  1              pinch  salt
  4              large  egg yolks
     3/4      teaspoon  maple extract
  4          teaspoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  chopped walnut pieces
     1/2           cup  chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  shredded coconut
                        Waffle or sugar cones
                        === NUTTY CHOCOLATE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  4             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  Nocello
                        = (or other nut-flavored liqueur)

In a small saucepan, bring the maple syrup to a simmer and cook until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, milk, reduced maple syrup, and a pinch of salt.  Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.  Remove from the heat.

Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl.  Whisk 1 cup of the hot cream into the egg yolks.  Gradually add the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream, to the hot cream.  Return to medium-low heat and cook, whisking, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container.  Whisk in the maple extract.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to keep a skin from forming.  Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours.

Remove from the refrigerator and pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine.  Freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.  Line a baking sheet with waxed paper and set aside.

In a medium skillet, combine the butter and brown sugar.  Cook, stirring, over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved.  Add the nuts and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until toasted and evenly coated, about 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Spread the coated nuts on the prepared baking sheet, stirring with a fork to keep from clumping.

When ready to serve, remove the ice cream from the freezer and let soften at room temperature for 10 minutes.  Spread on a flat work surface and mix the candied walnuts, chocolate chips, and coconut into the ice cream.  Scoop into cones and drizzle with Nutty Chocolate Sauce.  Serve immediately.

For the Nutty Chocolate Sauce:  In a small, heavy saucepan, bring the cream to a bare simmer over low heat.  Place the chocolate pieces in a medium bowl.  Remove the cream from the heat and whisk slowly into the chocolate.  Add the liqueur and continue whisking until the chocolate melts and the sauce thickens.

Serve the chocolate sauce warm, or let cool to room temperature.  (Makes 3/4 cup)

This recipe yields 1 quart, 4 to 6 servings.

In a small saucepan, bring the maple syrup to a simmer and cook until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, milk, reduced maple syrup, and a pinch of salt.  Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.  Remove from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl.  Whisk 1 cup of the hot cream into the egg yolks.  Gradually add the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream, to the hot cream.  Return to medium-low heat and cook, whisking, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container.  Whisk in the maple extract.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to keep a skin from forming.  Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the refrigerator and pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine.  Freeze according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions.  Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.  Line a baking sheet with waxed paper and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium skillet, combine the butter and brown sugar.  Cook, stirring, over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved.  Add the nuts and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until toasted and evenly coated, about 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Spread the coated nuts on the prepared baking sheet, stirring with a fork to keep from clumping.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, remove the ice cream from the freezer and let soften at room temperature for 10 minutes.  Spread on a flat work surface and mix the candied walnuts, chocolate chips, and coconut into the ice cream.  Scoop into cones and drizzle with Nutty Chocolate Sauce.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Nutty Chocolate Sauce:  In a small, heavy saucepan, bring the cream to a bare simmer over low heat.  Place the chocolate pieces in a medium bowl.  Remove the cream from the heat and whisk slowly into the chocolate.  Add the liqueur and continue whisking until the chocolate melts and the sauce thickens.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve the chocolate sauce warm, or let cool to room temperature.  (Makes 3/4 cup)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 1 quart, 4 to 6 servings.

  2                     apples, such as Golden Delicious or
                        Granny Smith -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/2" thick
  2                     pears, such as Anjou -- peeled, and

  2                     plums -- pitted, and
                        sliced 1/2" thick
  1                cup  strawberries -- rinsed, patted dry,
                        hulled and quartered
     1/2           cup  blackberries -- rinsed, patted dry
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2           cup  sugar or maple syrup -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar or maple syrup
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1              pinch  salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Basic Sweet Pie Crust -- (listed below)
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream -- plus
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  1         tablespoon  orange liqueur or brandy -- plus
  1           teaspoon  orange liqueur or brandy
                        === BASIC SWEET PIE CRUST ===
  8             ounces  flour
                        = (abt 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4         pound  cold butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/4" pieces
  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  3        tablespoons  ice water

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  In a large mixing bowl combine the apples, pears, nectarines, plums, strawberries, and blackberries with the lemon juice and cornstarch and toss to combine.  Add 1/2 cup sugar, cloves, nutmeg, and salt and stir well.  Butter a deep pie dish or a 9- by 12-inch baking dish with 1/2 tablespoon of the butter.  Transfer the fruit mixture to the buttered dish, and dot the top of the fruit mixture with the remaining tablespoon of butter.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the pie crust to a thickness of 1/8-inch and transfer to the top of the fruit mixture.  Trim the edges flush with the edges of the dish, and brush the pastry with 1 tablespoon of heavy cream.  Sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of sugar.  Using the tip of a sharp knife, cut several steam vents in the top of the pastry.

Bake the pandowdy, uncovered, until the pastry is lightly golden, about 30 minutes.  Remove the pandowdy from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Use the edge of a metal spatula to cut the crust into 1-inch squares, then press the crust down into the filling.  Return the pandowdy to the oven and bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes longer.  Let cool 15 to 20 minutes before serving.

When ready to serve, in a large bowl, whip the remaining 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream to soft peaks with the confectioners' sugar.  Add the orange liqueur and continue to whip to firm peaks.  Serve the pandowdy warm, with a dollop of the whipped cream on top, or pass the whipped cream at the table.

For the Basic Sweet Pie Crust:  Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large bowl.  Using your fingers, work in the butter and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add 2 tablespoons of ice water and work with your fingers until the water is incorporated and the dough comes together.  Add more water as needed to make a smooth dough, being careful not to over mix.  Form the dough into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.  (Makes 1 (9- or 10-inch) pie crust)

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  A Pandowdy is an early American dessert made with sliced fruit and topped with a pastry crust that is cut up and pressed back into the fruit mixture during the last minutes of baking.  The final product appears "dowdy" ? hence, its name.  Here we make a version with a summery mix of fruit, but keep in mind that any fruit would work just fine.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1               pint  fresh blackberries -- plus
                        extra for garnish
     1/2           cup  white balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh mint
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh tarragon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  light olive oil
  6               cups  mixed greens -- well washed,
                        and spun dry
  12                    endive spears
     1/4           cup  roughly-chopped toasted pistachios
  4             ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
  1                     avocado -- peeled, seeded,
                        and thinly sliced

In a large skillet, heat the oil over a medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the blackberries and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with the vinegars and cook until reduced by half, about 30 seconds.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a blender.  Add the sugar, mint and tarragon, and process to a smooth paste.  Add the salt and pepper.

With the machine running, add the light olive oil through the feed tube and process until smooth.  Strain through a fine mesh sieve into a clean bowl and refrigerate until completely cool, about 1 hour.

To make the salads, in a large bowl, combine the greens with the endive and pistachios and toss with the vinaigrette until lightly coated.  Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

To plate, divide the tossed greens among 4 plates and top with the goat cheese.  Arrange 3 endive spears and the avocado slices decoratively around the edges, and serve.  Garnish with extra blackberries.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  sifted cocoa powder (for chocolate
                        cupcakes)
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              large  egg -- cracked into a
                        small cup or saucer
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  hot water
                        === OOEY-GOOEY FILLING ===
  6             ounces  cream cheese
     1/4           cup  sugar
  6             ounces  bittersweet chocolate chips
     1/4           cup  flaked sweetened coconut
                        === CHOCOLATE SAUCE ===
  1                cup  heavy cream
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line 1 (12-cup) muffin tin with 12 paper muffin-tin liners and place 4 paper muffin-tin liners inside another muffin tin.  Add 2 tablespoons of water to each of the paperless muffin wells.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.  Add the remaining ingredients, adding the hot water last.  Beat with an electric mixer until smooth.  Divide the batter evenly among the paper muffin-tin liners.

For the Ooey-Gooey Filling:  In a small bowl, beat the cream cheese with the sugar.  Fold in the chocolate chips and coconut.  Drop the cream cheese mixture into the center of the cupcakes.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the cupcakes rise and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.  Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.  Drizzle chocolate sauce over cupcakes when serving.

For the Chocolate Sauce:  In a small, heavy saucepan, bring the cream to a bare simmer over low heat.  Place the chocolate pieces in a medium bowl.  Add the cream into the chocolate and let sit for 3 minutes.  Add the vanilla and whisk until the chocolate melts and the sauce thickens.

This recipe yields 16 cupcakes.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     slabs pork spare ribs - (abt 3 lbs ea)
  2        tablespoons  liquid crab boil
  2          teaspoons  salt -- plus
  1         tablespoon  salt
  3                     bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  paprika
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  cayenne
                        === SOUTHWESTERN BARBECUE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  3        tablespoons  chopped chipotle chiles in adobo -- with adobo sauce
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  4               cups  tomato sauce
     1/2           cup  molasses
  2          teaspoons  dry mustard
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === DEEP FRIED PORK RINDS ===
     1/2         pound  pork rinds -- cut 2" squares
                        Essence -- to taste
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1              quart  vegetable oil -- for frying

Place the ribs in a large Dutch oven or stockpot.  Cover with water and add the crab boil, 2 teaspoons of the salt, and the bay leaves.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and drain.

In a bowl, combine the sugar, paprika, chili powder, black pepper, remaining tablespoon of salt, and cayenne.  Pat the ribs dry and rub well with the spice mixture.

Lightly oil the grill rack on a barbecue grill, and preheat to medium-low (about 250 to 275 degrees).  Arrange the ribs on the rack and cover (with foil or upside down hotel pan).  Cook, turning every 20 minutes, until tender, about 2 hours, replenishing charcoal as needed.  During the last 20 minutes of cooking time, baste the ribs with the Southwestern Barbecue Sauce, turning twice.  Remove the ribs from the grill and serve the ribs with remaining sauce and fried pork rinds.

For the Southwestern Barbecue Sauce:  In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook until the onions are lightly caramelized, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and chiles, and cook for 1 minute.  Deglaze the pan with the vinegar and lime juice and cook until the liquid is reduced by half, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the adobo sauce, tomato sauce, molasses, mustard, bay leaves and salt.  Bring to a simmer and cook until thick, stirring occasionally, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain.  (Makes 4 cups)

For the Deep Fried Pork Rinds:  Heat the oil in a large pot or in a deep-fryer to 360 degrees.  Fry the pork rinds until puffed and golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the oil and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

         Prosciutto, Brie, And Pear Sandwiches, Mixed Green Salad

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  ten-inch loaf French or Italian bread -- ends discarded,
                        cut into 16 (1/2") thick slices
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  2          teaspoons  white truffle oil
                        = (or extra-virgin olive oil)
  1              pinch  salt
  8             ounces  Brie -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  thinly-sliced Prosciutto di Parma
  2                     ripe pears -- cored, and
                        thinly sliced
                        === GREENS SALAD WITH WARM VINAIGRETTE ===
  1                     slab bacon - (7 oz) -- cut into lardons
                        = (1/4" by 1/4" by 1" pieces)
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallot
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Creole mustard
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  mixed salad greens

Preheat a waffle iron or other hot sandwich maker.  In a small bowl, cream together the softened butter, oil, and salt.  Spread about 1 teaspoon of the butter mixture onto 1 side of 8 slices of the bread with an off-set spatula.  Place the bread, buttered-side down on the cutting board.  Layer the inside of each slice with cheese, prosciutto, and pears.  Top with the remaining bread slices, and spread with the butter mixture.

Transfer to the waffle iron and cook in batches until golden brown and the cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.

To make the salad:  In a hot skillet, add the lardons and cook until the fat is rendered.  Remove lardons from the pan with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate.

To the skillet with the fat, add shallots and saute.  Add red wine vinegar and mustard and stir the dressing to emulsify.  Add the chives and season with salt and pepper.  Drizzle the dressing over the salad greens and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Remove sandwiches from the waffle iron and transfer to plates.  Cut in half diagonally and serve hot.  Plate with salad and garnish with lardons.

This recipe yields 8 sandwiches, 4 to 8 servings.

Preheat a waffle iron or other hot sandwich maker.  In a small bowl, cream together the softened butter, oil, and salt.  Spread about 1 teaspoon of the butter mixture onto 1 side of 8 slices of the bread with an off-set spatula.  Place the bread, buttered-side down on the cutting board.  Layer the inside of each slice with cheese, prosciutto, and pears.  Top with the remaining bread slices, and spread with the butter mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer to the waffle iron and cook in batches until golden brown and the cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the salad:  In a hot skillet, add the lardons and cook until the fat is rendered.  Remove lardons from the pan with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To the skillet with the fat, add shallots and saute.  Add red wine vinegar and mustard and stir the dressing to emulsify.  Add the chives and season with salt and pepper.  Drizzle the dressing over the salad greens and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove sandwiches from the waffle iron and transfer to plates.  Cut in half diagonally and serve hot.  Plate with salad and garnish with lardons.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 sandwiches, 4 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4               cups  thinly sliced yellow onions
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  3        tablespoons  Madras curry powder
  1                cup  thinly-sliced lemongrass -- wrapped in
                        cheesecloth
  4               cups  fish stock
  1                can  unsweetened coconut milk - (14 oz)
  2             pounds  red snapper fillets -- cut 2" cubes
  3 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  1                cup  julienned red bell pepper
  1                cup  julienned yellow bell pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro leaves -- plus
                        more for garnish
  3               cups  water
  2               cups  jasmine rice

In a Dutch oven or large pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring until translucent and slightly caramelized, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring for 1 minute.  Add the curry powder and cook, stirring constantly, until the curry is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes.  Add the lemongrass sachet, fish stock, and coconut milk and bring to a boil.  Cook until the volume is reduced by half, about 20 minutes.

Reduce the heat to medium, season the snapper on both sides with 3 teaspoons of the salt, and add to the pot with the brown sugar, red and yellow bell peppers.  Cook for 10 minutes.  Add the cilantro, stir, and remove from the heat.  Cover to keep warm until ready to serve.

Meanwhile, in a 2-quart saucepan, combine the water, rice and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and bring to a boil.  Cover and reduce the heat to low.  Simmer until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let sit for at least 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork.

To serve, spoon the rice into large bowls and ladle the curry on top.  Garnish with additional chopped cilantro and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  red cherry tomatoes -- halved
  1              pound  yellow cherry tomatoes
     1/2         pound  small green heirloom tomatoes -- quartered
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  slivered garlic
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  chiffonade fresh basil leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh oregano leaves
  1              pound  angel hair pasta
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  8             ounces  whole-milk ricotta salata -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  toasted pine nuts
     1/2           cup  grated Pecorino

Remove from the heat and transfer to a large serving bowl.

Toss with the pine nuts and Pecorino cheese.  Garnish with additional herbs, as desired, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     flank steaks - (abt 2 1/2 lbs ea) -- butterflied, and
                        pounded thin

  6             slices  raw bacon or pancetta -- cut 1/4" strips
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced onions
  3                     bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1                cup  Argentine red wine
  6               cups  beef stock
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish
                        === GRILLED EGGPLANT ===
  2             medium  Italian eggplants - (10 to 12 oz ea) -- ends trimmed,
                        and cut into 3/4" rounds
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh oregano
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SALSA CRIOLLA ===
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3             medium  tomatoes -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  2             medium  onions -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  finely chopped fresh parsley
  1                     hot green pepper, or to taste -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped

Generously season both sides of the meat with the Essence, salt, and pepper.  Lay steaks out on a clean surface with the grain running horizontally toward you in order to slice the cooked Matambre across the grain for more tender meat.  Scatter 1 tablespoon of the garlic over both steaks and cover with spinach leaves, leaving a 1/2-inch margin.  Top each steak with the carrots and eggs, and sprinkle with cayenne pepper.  Carefully roll the meat over the filling in a tight, jelly-roll style and secure closed with kitchen string.

In a heavy Dutch oven or casserole, cook the bacon until the fat is rendered and brown, about 4 minutes.  Remove the bacon and drain on paper towels.

Add the rolled steaks to the hot bacon fat and cook until browned on all sides, about 3 minutes.  Remove the steaks and set aside.

Add the onions to the fat in the pan and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of garlic, the bay leaves and thyme, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Deglaze the pan with the red wine, scraping the bottom and sides to loosen the browned particles.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.

Add the steaks to the pan and reduce to a simmer.  Cover and slowly simmer until the meat is fork-tender, about 1 1/2 hours, turning meat once halfway through.  Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes before removing the kitchen strings and carving.

Return the baking dish to the heat and bring to a boil.  Cook until reduced and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.  Remove the reduced sauce from the heat, add the reserved bacon, and adjust the seasonings, to taste.

To serve, arrange the carved meat on 4 or 6 large plates.  Spoon a little of the thickened sauce over the meat and top with the onions.  Garnish with the chopped parsley and serve with the Salsa Criolla and Grilled Eggplant on the side.

For the Grilled Eggplant:  Place the eggplant in a colander and toss with the salt.  Let sit over a bowl and stand for 1 to 2 hours, tossing occasionally.

Preheat the grill.  In a large bowl, mix the olive oil, basil, oregano, garlic, and red pepper flakes.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Toss the eggplant rounds in the oil mixture and grill until marked and golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes.  Remove the eggplant from the grill and serve immediately.

For the Salsa Criolla:  In a mixing bowl, mash the garlic and the salt with the back of a fork to form a paste.  Stir in the red wine vinegar.  Whisk in the extra virgin olive oil slowly to form an emulsion.  Add the black pepper, and whisk.  Add the tomatoes, onions, pepper, and parsley.  Toss to coat and set aside 30 minutes before serving.  Adjust the seasoning to taste.

Serve at room temperature with the Matambre or other beef dishes.  (Makes about 4 cups)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Generously season both sides of the meat with the Essence, salt, and pepper.  Lay steaks out on a clean surface with the grain running horizontally toward you in order to slice the cooked Matambre across the grain for more tender meat.  Scatter 1 tablespoon of the garlic over both steaks and cover with spinach leaves, leaving a 1/2-inch margin.  Top each steak with the carrots and eggs, and sprinkle with cayenne pepper.  Carefully roll the meat over the filling in a tight, jelly-roll style and secure closed with kitchen string.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a heavy Dutch oven or casserole, cook the bacon until the fat is rendered and brown, about 4 minutes.  Remove the bacon and drain on paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the rolled steaks to the hot bacon fat and cook until browned on all sides, about 3 minutes.  Remove the steaks and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the onions to the fat in the pan and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of garlic, the bay leaves and thyme, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Deglaze the pan with the red wine, scraping the bottom and sides to loosen the browned particles.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the steaks to the pan and reduce to a simmer.  Cover and slowly simmer until the meat is fork-tender, about 1 1/2 hours, turning meat once halfway through.  Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes before removing the kitchen strings and carving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the baking dish to the heat and bring to a boil.  Cook until reduced and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.  Remove the reduced sauce from the heat, add the reserved bacon, and adjust the seasonings, to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, arrange the carved meat on 4 or 6 large plates.  Spoon a little of the thickened sauce over the meat and top with the onions.  Garnish with the chopped parsley and serve with the Salsa Criolla and Grilled Eggplant on the side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Grilled Eggplant:  Place the eggplant in a colander and toss with the salt.  Let sit over a bowl and stand for 1 to 2 hours, tossing occasionally.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the grill.  In a large bowl, mix the olive oil, basil, oregano, garlic, and red pepper flakes.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Toss the eggplant rounds in the oil mixture and grill until marked and golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes.  Remove the eggplant from the grill and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Salsa Criolla:  In a mixing bowl, mash the garlic and the salt with the back of a fork to form a paste.  Stir in the red wine vinegar.  Whisk in the extra virgin olive oil slowly to form an emulsion.  Add the black pepper, and whisk.  Add the tomatoes, onions, pepper, and parsley.  Toss to coat and set aside 30 minutes before serving.  Adjust the seasoning to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve at room temperature with the Matambre or other beef dishes.  (Makes about 4 cups)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4         pound  sweet Italian sausage -- casings removed
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onions
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped carrots
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped celery
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced orange zest
     1/2           cup  long-grain white rice
     1/4           cup  golden raisins
  2        tablespoons  toasted almond slivers
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  chicken stock
  2               cups  apricot jam
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1                cup  fresh orange juice
  8                     boned (except for the knuckle or joint at
                        bottom of the drumstick) chicken legs, the
                        thigh and the drumstick all in 1 piece
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes.  Add the onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of orange zest and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Add the rice and stir until it turns opaque, about 3 minutes. Stir in the raisins, almonds, parsley, thyme, cinnamon, and salt.  Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Stir, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.  Remove the rice from the heat and let sit for 10 minutes.  Fluff with a fork and spread on a baking sheet to cool.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Meanwhile, in a saucepan make the glaze by combining the jam, remaining 1/2 teaspoon orange zest, sugar, and orange juice.  Whisk to combine and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes.  Set aside to cool.

Season the chicken legs lightly with salt and pepper.  Place on a baking sheet and divide the stuffing between the legs, about 1/4 to 1/3 cup each.

Pull the skin up around the filling and secure shut with a toothpick.  Coat with the apricot glaze and bake until the chicken is tender and cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes, re-applying the glaze twice.  Remove from the oven and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

In a saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes.  Add the onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of orange zest and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the rice and stir until it turns opaque, about 3 minutes. Stir in the raisins, almonds, parsley, thyme, cinnamon, and salt.  Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Stir, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.  Remove the rice from the heat and let sit for 10 minutes.  Fluff with a fork and spread on a baking sheet to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, in a saucepan make the glaze by combining the jam, remaining 1/2 teaspoon orange zest, sugar, and orange juice.  Whisk to combine and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes.  Set aside to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season the chicken legs lightly with salt and pepper.  Place on a baking sheet and divide the stuffing between the legs, about 1/4 to 1/3 cup each.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pull the skin up around the filling and secure shut with a toothpick.  Coat with the apricot glaze and bake until the chicken is tender and cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes, re-applying the glaze twice.  Remove from the oven and serve immediately.

              Shabu Shabu With Sesame Dipping Sauce (Japan)

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  beef or chicken stock
  1 3/4           cups  finely-chopped green onions
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1              pound  highly-marbled beef sirloin -- thinly sliced
  1              small  white Chinese cabbage -- cut bite size
     1/2         pound  shiitake mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and stems trimmed
  12                    thin asparagus spears -- tough ends removed
                        Steamed white rice -- for serving
                        === SESAME DIPPING SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  sesame paste
     1/2           cup  shoyu (Japanese soy sauce)
  2        tablespoons  mirin
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes

Around the table, set each place with 1 small bowl and 1 pair of chopsticks.

In a large pot, combine the stock, green onions, ginger, and garlic and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.  Remove from the heat and keep warm.

Arrange the beef and vegetables on a large platter.  Cover and chill until ready to cook.

At serving time, pour stock into a shabu-shabu cooker, close lid, and fill chimney with glowing coals.  (Alternately, use a table-top cooker or electric frying pan.)  Place in the center of the table within easy reach of everyone.  Keep the stock simmering throughout the meal, adding more as necessary.

To serve, remove the lid on the shabu-shabu cooker.  In turn, each guest picks up ingredients with a pair of chopsticks and holds in the boiling stock until just done.  The cooked ingredients then are dipped in the individual's sauce bowl and eaten with rice.

Note: Care should be taken not to overcook meat and vegetables.  Steak should be pale pink when cooked and vegetables tender but still crisp.

When all the meat and vegetables are eaten the stock is ladled into the individual bowls and served as soup.  The bowls should be lifted to the lips, Japanese fashion, rather than using a spoon.

For the Sesame Dipping Sauce:  Put the sesame paste into a bowl and slowly stir in the shoyu, mirin and red pepper flakes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BRAISED FENNEL ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  2              heads  fennel -- slice lengthwise
                        into 1/4" thick slices
  1                cup  white wine
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        === SOLE ===
  4                     sole fillets, abt 3/4" thk -- rinsed well,
                        and patted dry
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  Champagne
  1 1/4           cups  dry white wine -- divided
  1                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
                        Water -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped shallots
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh tarragon
  1                cup  halved seedless white grapes

For the Braised Fennel:  In a saute pan, add the butter and melt.  Add the shallots and garlic and saute until translucent, about 2 minutes.  Add the fennel and toss to coat well.  Add the white wine and lemon juice and cover.  Cook until the fennel is very tender, about 15 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Lightly season both sides of the fillets with salt and white pepper.

Combine the Champagne, 1 cup of the wine, bay leaf, lemon juice, and black peppercorns in a large, shallow saute pan.  Arrange the fillets in a single layer in the pan and if necessary, add enough water to come up the sides of the fish, up to 1 cup.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the fish is just barely cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove with a spatula and place in a baking dish.  Cover to keep warm.  Bring the poaching liquid to a boil and reduce by half.  Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container and let cool.

In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and garlic, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the flour and cook, stirring, constantly to form a light roux, 2 minutes.  Gradually whisk in 1/2 cup of reduced cooking liquid and the remaining 1/4 cup wine, and cook over low heat, whisking, until well incorporated and thick.  Remove from the heat and add the cream, whisking.  Return to the heat and cook, whisking, until thickened and reduced slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat, add the tarragon, and adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Preheat the broiler.  Pour the sauce and grapes over the fish fillets and run under the broiler until golden brown and bubbly, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Divide the fennel, fillets, sauce and grapes among 4 dinner plates and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the Braised Fennel:  In a saute pan, add the butter and melt.  Add the shallots and garlic and saute until translucent, about 2 minutes.  Add the fennel and toss to coat well.  Add the white wine and lemon juice and cover.  Cook until the fennel is very tender, about 15 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly season both sides of the fillets with salt and white pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the Champagne, 1 cup of the wine, bay leaf, lemon juice, and black peppercorns in a large, shallow saute pan.  Arrange the fillets in a single layer in the pan and if necessary, add enough water to come up the sides of the fish, up to 1 cup.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the fish is just barely cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove with a spatula and place in a baking dish.  Cover to keep warm.  Bring the poaching liquid to a boil and reduce by half.  Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container and let cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and garlic, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the flour and cook, stirring, constantly to form a light roux, 2 minutes.  Gradually whisk in 1/2 cup of reduced cooking liquid and the remaining 1/4 cup wine, and cook over low heat, whisking, until well incorporated and thick.  Remove from the heat and add the cream, whisking.  Return to the heat and cook, whisking, until thickened and reduced slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat, add the tarragon, and adjust the seasoning, to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the broiler.  Pour the sauce and grapes over the fish fillets and run under the broiler until golden brown and bubbly, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Divide the fennel, fillets, sauce and grapes among 4 dinner plates and serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  bacon -- cut 1/2" pieces
                        Vegetable oil
  1 1/2         pounds  beef chuck or sirloin -- cubed
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1 1/2           cups  chopped yellow onions
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  8             ounces  button mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        stems trimmed, and sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1             bottle  dark beer - (12 oz)
  2               cups  beef stock
  1                     bay leaf
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
  2          teaspoons  fresh thyme
                        Pastry top -- (listed below)
  1              large  egg -- beaten, for glaze
                        Lightly dressed salad greens -- as accompaniment
                        English farmhouse cheeses -- as accompaniment
                        = (such as Double Gloucester, Huntsman,
                        Cheshire, Wensleydale, Lancashire)
                        Fresh hot bread -- as accompaniment
                        === PASTRY TOP ===
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  5        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  2        tablespoons  cold water

In a large skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until browned.  Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.

Season the beef with the Essence.  Add enough oil to the pan to equal 2 tablespoons of fat and heat over medium-high.  When hot, add the beef (in batches, if necessary to prevent overcrowding).  Cook until brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the pan and add the onions, adding more oil as needed.  Cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until wilted and starting to brown, 4 to 5 minutes.

Add the salt, pepper, flour, and Worcestershire, and stir well.  Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the beer and stock, and stir to deglaze the pan.  Bring to a boil and add the bay leaf, parsley, and thyme, and return the meat to the pan.  Lower the heat, cover, and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender, about 1 hour.  Remove from the heat, discard the bay leaf, and adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Roll out the pastry crust on a lightly floured surface into a circle large enough to cover the top of the baking dish.

Add the cooked bacon to the meat mixture.  Pour into a large, round, deep-dish, ceramic, baking pan.  Place the pastry crust on top of the baking dish, crimping around the sides to seal.  Cut a vent hole in the center with a small sharp knife.  Brush with the beaten egg and bake until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.

Remove from the oven and serve with salad, assorted cheeses, and hot bread.

For the Pastry Top:  Into a medium bowl, sift together the flour and salt.  Add the butter and work in with fingertips until coarse crumbs form.  Add enough cold water 1 teaspoon at a time to form a smooth dough, being careful not to overwork the dough.  Cover and let rest, refrigerated for 30 minutes before rolling out.  (Makes 1 crust)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     rabbit - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- cut into pieces
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
     1/4           cup  chopped celery
     1/4           cup  chopped carrots
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2          teaspoons  tomato paste
  1                cup  chopped seeded tomatoes
  2                     bay leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1                cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  veal stock
  8             ounces  wild mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        stems trimmed, and tops sliced
                        = (such as wood ear, shiitake, morel, or
                        chanterelle)
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  12            ounces  pappardelle (wide flat pasta strips)
                        = (or fettuccini)

Season the rabbit on all sides with the Essence, then lightly dust with the flour, shaking to remove any excess.  In a large Dutch oven or pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the rabbit and cook until brown on all sides.  Transfer to a plate.

In the fat remaining in the pan, add the onions, celery, and carrots, and cook, stirring, until soft, 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes, bay leaves, and thyme and cook for 1 minute.  Add the red wine and veal stock and cook, stirring, to deglaze the pan.  Add the mushrooms, parsley, basil, and cooked rabbit and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the meat is cooked through and falls from the bones, about 2 hours.

Remove the pan from the heat.  Remove the thyme sprigs and bay leaves, and discard.  Remove the rabbit and place on a cutting board and let cool slightly.  Remove the meat from the bones and shred.  Return the meat to the pan and return to a simmer.  Simmer until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.  Add the butter and stir until incorporated.  Remove from the heat.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the pasta and cook until just al dente, 8 to 9 minutes.  Add the pasta to the pot with the sauce.  Toss to coat.

To serve, divide among pasta bowls, sprinkle with cheese and additional parsley, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

        Stuffed Roasted Peppers In Roasted Garlic-White Wine Broth

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              heads  garlic
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/8      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  4              large  red bell peppers
     1/2         pound  buffalo mozzarella -- sliced thin
                        lengthwise
     1/4           cup  finely-sliced fresh basil leaves
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2               cups  dry white wine
  6             ounces  angel hair pasta
                        Shaved Parmesan -- for serving

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cut the top quarter from each head of garlic and set on a foil-lined baking sheet.  Drizzle 2 teaspoons of the oil over the tops and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/8 teaspoon of the pepper.  Place on the pan, cut-side down, and roast until the cloves are tender, but still firm enough to slice, 30 to 35 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.  Squeeze the garlic cloves from the pod, and cut into slivers.

Roast the peppers by placing them on an open gas flame, turning frequently with tongs until all sides are charred black, 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternately, the peppers can be roasted under a broiler, or on top of a gas or charcoal grill.)  Place the blackened peppers in a plastic or paper bag, and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Peel the peppers, make a slit down 1 side, and open flat.  Remove the seeds and the stems.  Season each pepper with a pinch of salt and pepper.  Lay the peppers flat.  Place the mozzarella and basil inside and roll together into a spiral.  Place in a baking dish and bake for 5 minutes, to heat through.

In a large skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and the butter and melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the roasted garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the white wine and cook for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat.

Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil.  Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 7 minutes if dried, or 2 minutes if fresh.  Drain in a colander.  Add the drained pasta to the white wine mixture with the basil and toss to coat evenly.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Place the pasta in serving bowls.  Top the pasta with the peppers and sprinkle with shaved Parmesan.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Boiled Artichoke hearts -- cut 1/2" dice
                        = (Boiled Artichokes listed below)
     1/2           cup  roughly-chopped brine-cured black olives
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     skinless turbot fillets
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === TOMATO-CAPER BEURRE BLANC ===
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced shallots
     1/2           cup  white wine
  2             sticks  cold unsalted butter -- cut tbspn size
     1/4      teaspoon  hot sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  small capers -- rinsed, drained
     1/2           cup  small diced seeded tomatoes
                        === BOILED ARTICHOKES ===
  1             gallon  water
  4                     bay leaves
  3        tablespoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  whole black peppercorns
  4              large  globe artichokes - (abt 10 oz ea)
  1                     lemon -- cut in half

For the Boiled Artichokes:  Bring the water, bay leaves, salt, and peppercorns to a boil in a large pot.

With a small, sharp knife, trim the tough outer skin from the artichoke stems and remove the bottom row of leaves.  Add the artichokes and lemons and return to a boil.  Place 2 small, heavy plate on top of the artichokes, lower the heat, and cook at a low boil until the artichokes are tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain in a colander and let the artichokes sit until cool enough to handle.

Remove the large outer leaves from the artichokes and discard the spiky inner leaves.  With a spoon, scrape the hairy choke from the hearts and discard.  Reserve the leaves for another use.  (Makes 4 artichoke hearts)

In a bowl, combine the artichoke hearts, olives, olive oil, parsley, shallots, garlic, oregano, lemon peel, salt, and pepper and toss well.  Let marinate for 2 hours at room temperature.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Lightly season the fish on both sides with salt and white pepper.  Set on a parchment-lined baking sheet, skin-side up.  Spoon 1/4 of the artichoke mixture on the bottom half of each fillet. Fold the top half of the fillet over the filling.  Bake until the fish is done, 12 to 15 minutes.

For the Beurre Blanc:  Combine the shallots and wine in a medium saute pan, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced in volume by half, about 2 minutes.  Whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, adding each piece before the previous one has been completely incorporated.  Continue until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, removing the pan from the heat periodically to prevent the sauce from getting too hot and breaking.  Remove from the heat and season with the hot sauce and salt.  Stir in the capers and tomatoes, and stir well.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.

Remove from the oven and transfer the fish with a spatula to 4 large plates.  Spoon the Tomato- Caper Beurre Blanc over the fish and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the Boiled Artichokes:  Bring the water, bay leaves, salt, and peppercorns to a boil in a large pot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With a small, sharp knife, trim the tough outer skin from the artichoke stems and remove the bottom row of leaves.  Add the artichokes and lemons and return to a boil.  Place 2 small, heavy plate on top of the artichokes, lower the heat, and cook at a low boil until the artichokes are tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain in a colander and let the artichokes sit until cool enough to handle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the large outer leaves from the artichokes and discard the spiky inner leaves.  With a spoon, scrape the hairy choke from the hearts and discard.  Reserve the leaves for another use.  (Makes 4 artichoke hearts)
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl, combine the artichoke hearts, olives, olive oil, parsley, shallots, garlic, oregano, lemon peel, salt, and pepper and toss well.  Let marinate for 2 hours at room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly season the fish on both sides with salt and white pepper.  Set on a parchment-lined baking sheet, skin-side up.  Spoon 1/4 of the artichoke mixture on the bottom half of each fillet. Fold the top half of the fillet over the filling.  Bake until the fish is done, 12 to 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Beurre Blanc:  Combine the shallots and wine in a medium saute pan, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced in volume by half, about 2 minutes.  Whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, adding each piece before the previous one has been completely incorporated.  Continue until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, removing the pan from the heat periodically to prevent the sauce from getting too hot and breaking.  Remove from the heat and season with the hot sauce and salt.  Stir in the capers and tomatoes, and stir well.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the oven and transfer the fish with a spatula to 4 large plates.  Spoon the Tomato- Caper Beurre Blanc over the fish and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  4          teaspoons  granulated sugar
  8              large  egg yolks
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  1                cup  mashed cooked sweet potatoes

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Arrange 8 (1/2-cup) ramekins or custard cups in a large metal baking pan.

In a medium saucepan, heat the heavy cream.  Add the brown sugar, and 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar.  Bring to a bare simmer over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Remove from the heat.

In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs until frothy and lemon-colored.  Slowly add 3/4 cup of the hot cream, whisking constantly.  Add the egg mixture to the remaining hot cream, and whisk.  Add the vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and potatoes, and whisk until smooth.  Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a large bowl.  Divide among the prepared custard cups.

Add enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the cups.  Bake until the custards are just set in the center but not stiff, 45 minutes to 55 minutes.  Remove from the oven and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 3 hours or overnight.

Sprinkle each custard with 1/2 teaspoon of the remaining sugar.  Using a blow torch, caramelize the sugar.  (Alternately, preheat the broiler, and broil until the sugar melts and caramelizes, watching closely to avoid burning and rotating the cups, 1 to 2 minutes.)  Place on small dessert plates and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               cups  bulgur (cracked wheat)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2         pound  ground lamb
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1                cup  minced yellow onions
     1/3           cup  pine nuts
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1                cup  finely-chopped seeded tomatoes
  1                cup  finely-chopped peeled seeded cucumber
  1                cup  finely-chopped parsley
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh mint leaves
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped green onions
     1/4                fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     Hearts romaine lettuce leaves

Place the bulgur wheat in a large bowl and pour in enough hot water (about 3 cups) to cover generously.  Let stand until the grains soften, about 15 minutes.  Drain well in a fine mesh strainer, pressing out excess water.  Return the bulgur to same large bowl.

In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the lamb and Essence, and cook, stirring, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes.  Add the cumin, salt, pepper, and cinnamon, and cook, stirring, for 20 seconds.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the cumin and pine nuts and cook until lightly toasted.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

Transfer the meat mixture with a slotted spoon to the bulgur, leaving any fat in the skillet.  Add the remaining ingredients, except the lettuce leaves, and toss to combine.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Arrange the lettuce leaves around the rim of a platter.  Spoon the tabbouleh in the center and use the leaves as scoops.  Serve cold or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the lamb and Essence, and cook, stirring, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes.  Add the cumin, salt, pepper, and cinnamon, and cook, stirring, for 20 seconds.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the cumin and pine nuts and cook until lightly toasted.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

Transfer the meat mixture with a slotted spoon to the bulgur, leaving any fat in the skillet.  Add the remaining ingredients, except the lettuce leaves, and toss to combine.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.

     1/4           cup  minced red bell peppers

  3        tablespoons  minced cilantro
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced mint
  1           teaspoon  wasabi powder
  1           teaspoon  water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil

In a medium skillet, heat the remaining 1/4 cup oil over medium-high heat.  When the oil is hot, add the wonton strips and quickly pan-fry until golden, stirring constantly.  Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Season with Essence.

  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil

  1 1/2           cups  snow pea pods -- stringed
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced fresh porcini mushroom caps

Lightly coat the chicken strips in the cornstarch, shaking to remove any excess.  Set aside.  In a large pot or wok, preheat the oil to 360 degrees.

Let cool to room temperature.

For the Gingered Stir-Fried Vegetables:  In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, sesame oil and sugar, and set aside.

                        === TOMATO-HERB BREAD ===
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda

  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  oil from the sun-dried tomatoes

     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  4 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh basil
  4 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh parsley
  3          teaspoons  chopped fresh oregano
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  grated Provolone
     1/4           cup  Parmesan
                        == OLIVE-RICOTTA SPREAD TEA SANDWICHES ==
                        Tomato-Herb Bread -- (listed above)
  1                cup  fresh ricotta -- drained
  2             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  chopped kalamata olives
  6             ounces  baby spinach -- rinsed, spun dry,
                        and stems removed
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced capacolla
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced bresaola
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced salami
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced soppresata

For the Tomato Herb Bread:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a 4- by 8-inch loaf pan and set aside.

Into a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda.  In a small bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, sugar, and oil.  Add to the dry ingredients and whisk to combine.  Whisk in the tomatoes, onions, basil, parsley, oregano, and garlic.  Add the cheese and stir to combine.

Pour into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes in the pan.  Turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.  Cut the ends from the Tomato-Herb Bread and discard or reserve for another use.  Cut the remaining loaf into 16 thin slices.

For the Ricotta Herb Spread:  In the bowl of a food processor, blend the ricotta, cream cheese, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper on high speed until smooth.  Add the olives and pulse to blend.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.

Spread the ricotta mixture evenly over 8 bread slices.  Spread several spinach leaves across the filling in 1 layer.  Add cold cuts.  Top with remaining bread and press to seal.  Cut each sandwich in half diagonally.  Serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

For the Tomato Herb Bread:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a 4- by 8-inch loaf pan and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Into a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda.  In a small bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, sugar, and oil.  Add to the dry ingredients and whisk to combine.  Whisk in the tomatoes, onions, basil, parsley, oregano, and garlic.  Add the cheese and stir to combine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes in the pan.  Turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.  Cut the ends from the Tomato-Herb Bread and discard or reserve for another use.  Cut the remaining loaf into 16 thin slices.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Ricotta Herb Spread:  In the bowl of a food processor, blend the ricotta, cream cheese, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper on high speed until smooth.  Add the olives and pulse to blend.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the ricotta mixture evenly over 8 bread slices.  Spread several spinach leaves across the filling in 1 layer.  Add cold cuts.  Top with remaining bread and press to seal.  Cut each sandwich in half diagonally.  Serve.

                     Warm Spicy Butter-Poached Shrimp

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  large shrimp - (10/15 count) -- peeled, deveined
  2        tablespoons  hot red pepper sauce
  2        tablespoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  3        tablespoons  water
  1              pound  unsalted butter - (4 sticks) -- cut into pieces
  4          teaspoons  finely-grated lemon zest
  2                     bay leaves
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, smashed
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1               dash  hot red pepper sauce
                        Chopped parsley -- for garnish
                        Chopped green onions -- for garnish
  1                     baguette -- as accompaniment

Place the shrimp in a large glass bowl or baking dish.  Add the hot sauce and Essence and toss to coat evenly.  Refrigerate for 1 hour, turning occasionally.

In a large saucepan, bring 3 tablespoons of water to a boil.  Reduce the heat to very low, and whisk in all the butter piece by piece until emulsified.  Add the lemon zest, bay leaves, salt, cayenne, and garlic clove, and stir to combine.  Add the shrimp and cook gently over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes.

Add the Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and hot sauce, and stir to combine.  Remove from the heat and discard the bay leaves and garlic clove.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Transfer the shrimp to 4 large, shallow bowls.  Spoon some of the butter sauce over each portion, and garnish with the parsley and green onions.  Serve with slices of bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The secret to this is using a saucepan, not a skillet or saute pan, and cooking over very low heat - don't be impatient.  This is very rich, so it's best served as an appetizer.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  cubed watermelon
  1                cup  fresh raspberries
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  creme de cassis

  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Mint leaves -- for garnish

In a blender, puree the watermelon, raspberries, sugar, creme de cassis, and lemon juice in batches until smooth.  Strain through a fine sieve into a large metal baking pan, pressing down to extract as much juice as possible.

Freeze, stirring every 30 minutes with a fork to break up the forming ice crystals, until firm but not completely frozen, 2 to 3 hours.  To serve, scrape with a fork and spoon into footed coupe glasses.

Preheat a fryer to 350 degrees.  Thoroughly dry the mint leaves with paper towels.  Place the mint in the fryer and fry for 15 seconds, just to crisp up.  Remove and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.  Garnish with the mint and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened, plus
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  4              large  eggs
  3               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  6               cups  cubed (1/2") day-old bread
  6             ounces  white chocolate -- chopped
  1                cup  fresh blueberries
     1/2           cup  dried blueberries
                        === AMARETTO CREAM SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  Amaretto liqueur
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar

For the Bread Pudding:  Preheat the oven to 350 degree.  Butter a 10- by 14-inch baking dish with the softened butter.  Whisk the eggs in a large bowl.  Whisk in the cream, milk, brown sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon.  Add the bread, chocolate, blueberries, and dried blueberries and stir well, then mix in the melted butter.

For the Amaretto Cream Sauce:  In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the Amaretto and whisk until smooth.

In a medium saucepan, scald cream over medium heat.  Add the Amaretto slurry to the hot cream and whisking constantly, bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and cook, whisking for 30 seconds.  Remove from the heat and add the sugar.  Whisk until dissolved.  Let cool to room temperature before serving with the bread pudding.

Serve warm.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  5        tablespoons  all-purpose flour -- plus
  1           teaspoon  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  cocoa powder -- plus
  1           teaspoon  cocoa powder
  4          teaspoons  crushed pistachios

In a stainless steel bowl set over a saucepan of boiling water, combine the egg yolks, Grand Marnier, sugar, and orange zest, and whisk to incorporate.  Whisking constantly and removing from the heat from time to time, cook until the mixture has thickened and coats the back of a spoon into a sabayon, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.

Fold the whipped cream into the cooled sabayon, then fold in the melted chocolate.  Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 6 hours.  Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip.

To serve, place 1 tuile cup in the center of 8 dessert plates.  Pipe (or alternately spoon) 1/4 cup of the mousse into the cups and garnish with the mint sprigs and powdered sugar.  Serve.

For the Chocolate-Pistachio Tuile Cups:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.  Invert 8 shot glasses or tea cups on the counter.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg whites, sugar, and pistachios until just combined.  Add the butter and vanilla, and whisk.  Add the flour and cocoa powder, and whisk.  Drop the batter by 1 1/2 tablespoonfuls onto the baking sheet, about 4 inches apart.  Using a small spatula or the back of a spoon, spread the batter out to form a thin 4 1/2 -inch circle (the batter needs to be a thin, even coat because the cookies will not spread when cooked).  Bake for 12 to 13 minutes, or until a deep brown.  Remove from the oven.

With a thin spatula, quickly remove the cookies 1 at a time from the baking sheet and drape on top of a ramekin to create a cup shape.  (If the cookies become too brittle, replace on the baking sheet and place in the oven for 10 seconds to soften.)  Cool completely on the glasses, then gently lift off and transfer to a platter until ready to use.  (Makes 8 cookies)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  water
  2               cups  wild rice
  2          teaspoons  butter
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  medium barley
  1                cup  dried cranberries
                        = (or dried cherries)
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
  1         tablespoon  rice wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
     1/4           cup  chopped shallots
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
  1                cup  roughly-chopped pecans -- toasted
  1              large  orange -- segmented, and
                        cut into 3/4" dice

In a large saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.  Add the rice, 1 teaspoon of butter, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and stir.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender (but not split), 40 to 45 minutes.  Drain, rinse, and drain again, and transfer to a large bowl.

In a separate large saucepan, bring the remaining 4 cups of water to a boil.  Add the barley, remaining 1 teaspoon of butter, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and stir.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the barley is tender but retains a crunch, about 40 minutes.  Drain, rinse well, and drain the barley.  Add the barley to the wild rice.

In a small bowl, place the dried cranberries.  Pour in enough boiling water to cover by 1-inch and let sit until plump, about 5 minutes.  Drain the cranberries and add to the barley/wild rice mixture.

In a small bowl, whisk together the orange juice, vinegar, mustard, pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Slowly add the oil in a thin stream, whisking to emulsify.  Add the green onions, shallots, parsley, and orange zest, and whisk to incorporate.  Pour over the rice and toss to coat.  Add the pecans and orange pieces, and toss.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  mild-flavored honey - (to 8)
  5        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  grated lemon zest
  2           teaspoon  lemon pulp
  2        tablespoons  plum sauce
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     3/4         pound  boneless skinless chicken breast -- butterflied
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/3           cup  cooking oil
