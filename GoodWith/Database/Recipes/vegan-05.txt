                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  soy Italian-style "sausage" links -- cut into thirds
  1              large  onion -- quartered, and
                        thinly sliced
  6             medium  bell peppers -- cut long strips
                        = (3 each green and red, or 2 each
                        green, red and yellow)
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  6              small  hero rolls -- split
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2               cans  diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz ea)

Drain tomatoes, reserving 1/2 cup liquid.  Set aside.

In large skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Add "sausage" and cook, turning often, until golden, about 5 minutes.  Add onion and cook until tender, stirring often, about 5 minutes.  Stir in bell peppers and garlic.  Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes.

Stir in tomatoes, reserved tomato liquid, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper and sugar until well combined.  Cover and cook until flavors are blended, about 5 minutes.  Spoon into hero rolls and serve open-faced.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Here's a delicious way to showcase colorful bell peppers.  If you prefer a spicier dish, add a minced fresh hot chile when adding the bell peppers.

Spoon the sausage-bell pepper mixture into small hero rolls and serve open-faced, garnished with some black olives and baby carrots.  End the meal with sliced fresh pears topped with a dollop of low-fat vanilla yogurt or soy yogurt.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Orange-Tofu Cream -- (see recipe)
                        Warm Raspberry Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  unbleached white flour
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        Salt -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  pure maple syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  plain soy milk
     3/4           cup  grated unsweetened coconut
  3        tablespoons  cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  cinnamon -- plus
  2          teaspoons  cinnamon
  1                cup  pecans
  4             medium  tart apples
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2           cup  chopped dates
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
                        Vegetable oil -- for pan frying
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- for garnish

There are three parts to this apple-pie-like dessert: the Orange-Tofu Cream (make first so it can chill); the Warm Raspberry Sauce (make second and keep it hot in a double boiler); and the croquettes (make last so they're served hot).

In medium bowl, mix flour, nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.  In separate small bowl, mix maple syrup, vanilla and soy milk.  Slowly add liquid mixture to dry ingredients, stirring with wooden spoon until batter is smooth.  Set aside.

In shallow bowl, mix coconut, cornmeal, 1 tablespoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Set aside.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spread pecans on baking sheet; toast 8 minutes, then chop and set aside.  Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees.

Grate apples into medium bowl.  (You should have about 2 1/2 cups.)  Add lemon juice and toss to mix.  Transfer apples to strainer and squeeze out excess water; return to medium bowl.  Add pecans, dates, remaining 2 teaspoons cinnamon, ginger and 1/8 teaspoon salt.  Toss to mix well.

Using heaping tablespoonfuls, form mixture into balls, then squeeze tightly to compress and remove as much liquid as possible.  Dip in soy milk mixture, roll in coconut mixture and set on plate.

In large skillet, heat 1/4 inch vegetable oil over medium-high heat.  When oil is hot but not smoking, add croquettes in batches.  Cook until croquettes are browned, about 45 seconds per side.  Transfer to plate lined with paper towels to remove excess oil.  Place cooked croquettes in oven to keep warm.

To serve, spoon about 1 1/2 tablespoons Warm Raspberry Sauce onto dessert plate.  Place 3 croquettes on sauce.  Top croquettes with dollop of Orange-Tofu Cream.  Drizzle sauce over cream.  Garnish with mint sprigs.  Repeat with remaining croquettes, cream and sauce.

This recipe yields 12 croquettes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  rolled oats
  1 1/2           cups  rice flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  brown rice syrup
  1                cup  apricot all-fruit spread
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
     1/3           cup  blanched -- slivered almonds
  1                cup  almonds - (6 oz)
     1/2           cup  poppy seeds

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In small skillet, toast poppy seeds over medium-high heat, stirring often until seeds change color slightly, 2 to 3 minutes; set aside.  Place almonds on baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, 8 to 10 minutes.  Lightly brush two baking sheets with oil or line with parchment paper; set aside.

In food processor, finely grind toasted almonds and oats.  Transfer mixture to large bowl.  Add rice flour, toasted poppy seeds, salt, cinnamon and cardamom and mix to blend.

In medium bowl, mix oil, rice syrup, apricot spread and almond extract until blended.  Add to dry ingredients and stir just until blended (batter will be sticky).

Roll 1 tablespoon dough into a ball and flatten to form a cookie about 1 3/4 inches in diameter.  (It's helpful to dip hands and utensils in water when working with this sticky dough.)  Press a cluster of blanched, slivered almonds (about 5) into centers of each cookie.  Place cookies on prepared baking sheets, spacing about 1 inch apart.  Bake until bottoms are lightly browned, about 12 minutes.  Allow cookies to cool in pans for several minutes, then remove to wire racks to cool completely.

This recipe yields 5 dozen.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In small skillet, toast poppy seeds over medium-high heat, stirring often until seeds change color slightly, 2 to 3 minutes; set aside.  Place almonds on baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, 8 to 10 minutes.  Lightly brush two baking sheets with oil or line with parchment paper; set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In food processor, finely grind toasted almonds and oats.  Transfer mixture to large bowl.  Add rice flour, toasted poppy seeds, salt, cinnamon and cardamom and mix to blend.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In medium bowl, mix oil, rice syrup, apricot spread and almond extract until blended.  Add to dry ingredients and stir just until blended (batter will be sticky).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll 1 tablespoon dough into a ball and flatten to form a cookie about 1 3/4 inches in diameter.  (It&apos;s helpful to dip hands and utensils in water when working with this sticky dough.)  Press a cluster of blanched, slivered almonds (about 5) into centers of each cookie.  Place cookies on prepared baking sheets, spacing about 1 inch apart.  Bake until bottoms are lightly browned, about 12 minutes.  Allow cookies to cool in pans for several minutes, then remove to wire racks to cool completely.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16                    tiny new potatoes - (1 1/2" to 2" dia)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                can  artichoke hearts - (14 oz) -- drained, chopped
     1/2           cup  light mayonnaise dressing or salad
                        dressing
     1/4           cup  finely-shredded Parmesan cheese
  1               dash  ground red pepper
     1/4           cup  snipped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  finely-shredded lemon peel
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced

Cut off the top one-third of each potato.  Using a melon baller, hollow out the potatoes, leaving 1/4-inch shells.  Cut a thin slice off the bottom of each potato so it will sit without tipping.  (Discard potato trimmings, or cook and use to make potato salad or mashed potatoes.)  Lightly brush potatoes all over with oil.  Place in a shallow baking pan; set aside.

For filling, in a medium bowl combine the artichoke hearts, mayonnaise dressing, Parmesan cheese, and ground red pepper.  Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling into each potato shell.

Bake in a 450 degree oven about 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender and filling is golden brown.  Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine the parsley, lemon peel, and garlic.  Sprinkle the parsley mixture over the potatoes.

This recipe yields 16 pieces.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  extra-firm tofu -- drained, cubed
  1              whole  egg or 2 egg whites
  2                     egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  ground turmeric
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper - (to 1/4)
     1/4      teaspoon  sea salt
                        = (or 1 tspn tamari)
     1/2           cup  unsweetened tomato sauce
     1/2           cup  onion -- cut in rings
  2               cups  chopped asparagus
  1                cup  yellow bell pepper strips
  1 1/3      teaspoons  olive oil

In medium bowl, mash tofu with fork.  Add egg and egg whites, turmeric, pepper and salt and mix well.  Set aside.  In small saucepan, gently warm tomato sauce over low heat.

In steamer basket, layer vegetables.  Set basket in 1 1/2-quart pot filled with 1/2-inch water.  Cover and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium and steam until just tender, 5 to 6 minutes.  With large, slotted spoon, immediately transfer vegetables to serving plate.

In 9-inch skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until oil sizzles.  (Pan must be hot or eggs will stick.)  Tilt skillet to coat evenly.

Pour in tofu-egg mixture all at once, then reduce heat to medium-low.  As eggs begin to set up, push cooked portion aside with a spatula, then let uncooked portion run under.  Repeat as eggs start to set up.  Cook until eggs are cooked throughout but still glossy and moist, 3 to 4 minutes.

Remove pan from heat.  Transfer to plate and serve with tomato sauce.

     1/4        medium  ripe avocado
  3        tablespoons  palm sugar - (packed)
                        = (or light brown sugar)
     3/4           cup  plain soy milk
  4                     ice cubes

Comments:  In the Philippines, this pale green drink is made with condensed milk.  Here, soy milk and a dash of fresh lime juice turn it into a lively breakfast smoothie.  It's particularly recharging after a morning workout.  Asian food stores sell palm sugar, as do some supermarkets (check the Thai food section), though you can substitute brown sugar.

Comments:  In the Philippines, this pale green drink is made with condensed milk.  Here, soy milk and a dash of fresh lime juice turn it into a lively breakfast smoothie.  It&apos;s particularly recharging after a morning workout.  Asian food stores sell palm sugar, as do some supermarkets (check the Thai food section), though you can substitute brown sugar.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  vanilla soy milk
  1                cup  uncooked kasha
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  shredded Fuji or Golden Delicious apple
     1/4           cup  chopped skinned hazelnuts*
     1/2           cup  soy sour cream
  3        tablespoons  dark brown sugar - (lightly packed)

* To toast hazelnuts, preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spread nuts in pie pan and bake until fragrant and their skins have cracked, about 7 minutes.  Immediately place warm nuts in dish towel, wrap up and rub vigorously.  The friction will remove most of the skin.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat 8-inch baking dish with cooking spray.

In medium saucepan, combine soy milk with 1 1/2 cups water.  Cook over medium-high heat until liquid is almost boiling.  Stir in kasha.

Bring mixture to a boil, then remove from heat.  Add cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and shredded apple.  Pour mixture into prepared pan.  Sprinkle evenly with chopped hazelnuts.

Bake until pudding is almost set, about 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, mix together sour cream and sugar.  Spread mixture over top of hot pudding.  Return to oven and bake until pudding is set but still moist and top is covered with creamy glaze, about 10 minutes.  Spoon into wide, shallow bowls like pasta bowls and serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 192 Cal; 4g Prot; 9g Total Fat (4 Sat. Fat); 26g Carb.;mg Chol; 235mg Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Comments:  This soy version of a classic will warm you on brisk mornings.  Double the recipe and eat the leftovers the next day.

  8             ounces  seitan
  2               cups  sliced button or cremini mushrooms
  1                jar  tomato sauce - (25 oz)
  1              pound  extra-firm tofu -- drained
                        = (or part-skim ricotta)
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh basil
                        = (or 5 1/2 tspns dried basil)
  2         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  4           teaspoon  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  12            ounces  dry ziti
     1/2           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bring large pot of salted water to a boil for pasta.

In food processor, puree tofu, basil, lemon juice, 2 teaspoons olive oil, salt to taste and pepper until consistency resembles ricotta cheese.  Or, if using ricotta, mix by hand.

Add ziti to boiling water; stir to prevent sticking.  Cook according to package directions until just tender.  Drain and return to pot.

Spread several tablespoons of tomato-seitan mixture in a 13- by 9-inch baking dish, making sure to evenly coat bottom and sides to prevent sticking.

In a very large bowl, combine drained pasta, tofu "cheese," remaining tomato-seitan mixture and parsley.  Fold gently to combine all ingredients.

Spread evenly in baking dish and bake 15 minutes.  Serve hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped - (1 cup)
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped - ( 1/2 cup)
  1              small  red or green bell pepper -- diced - (1/2 cup)
  3               cups  thinly-sliced mushrooms - (8 oz)
  1             medium  garlic clove -- minced
  3               cups  low-sodium vegetable broth or water
  1 1/2           cups  uncooked basmati rice
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1              large  green cabbage -- cored
  2             pounds  fresh sauerkraut
  3 1/2           cups  prepared tomato sauce

In large saucepan, heat oil over medium-low heat.  Add onion, celery and bell pepper; season with salt.  Cover and cook 5 minutes.  Stir in mushrooms and garlic.  Cover and cook 5 minutes.

Stir in broth and rice; season with freshly ground pepper.  Increase heat and bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and fluff rice with fork.  Stir in parsley; set aside.

In large pot, bring 1 inch water to a boil.  Place cabbage in water, cored-side down.  Cover and cook 5 minutes.  Remove cabbage from pot.  As soon as possible -- using fork if necessary to grab leaves -- peel off first 4 leaves.  Return cabbage to pot, cover and cook 5 minutes; peel off 4 more leaves.  You will need 8 leaves.  Cover leaves with plastic wrap.  (Reserve remaining cabbage for soup.)  When leaves are cool enough to handle, carve off as much tough ridge as you can from center of leaves, cutting flush with leaf.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Drain sauerkraut in colander.  Rinse briefly then squeeze out most of liquid.  Place sauerkraut in even layer in medium to large shallow casserole (13- by 9-inch).  Top with 2 cups tomato sauce.

Place about 3/4 cup of rice in center of each leaf.  Fold up sides and place stuffed leaves, seam-side down, in casserole.  Spoon remaining 1 1/2 cups tomato sauce over cabbage.  Cover with foil and bake until bubbly and heated through, about 45 minutes.  Check after 30 minutes and if it seems too liquidy, remove foil during last 10 to 15 minutes of baking.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  These stuffed cabbage leaves are nestled in a layer of sauerkraut and tomato sauce.  Try to find a good size cabbage so you will end up with large leaves, and then you can add plenty of filling to each.  This dish can be entirely assembled up to 24 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate, then bring to room temperature before baking.

In large saucepan, heat oil over medium-low heat.  Add onion, celery and bell pepper; season with salt.  Cover and cook 5 minutes.  Stir in mushrooms and garlic.  Cover and cook 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir in broth and rice; season with freshly ground pepper.  Increase heat and bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and fluff rice with fork.  Stir in parsley; set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In large pot, bring 1 inch water to a boil.  Place cabbage in water, cored-side down.  Cover and cook 5 minutes.  Remove cabbage from pot.  As soon as possible -- using fork if necessary to grab leaves -- peel off first 4 leaves.  Return cabbage to pot, cover and cook 5 minutes; peel off 4 more leaves.  You will need 8 leaves.  Cover leaves with plastic wrap.  (Reserve remaining cabbage for soup.)  When leaves are cool enough to handle, carve off as much tough ridge as you can from center of leaves, cutting flush with leaf.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Drain sauerkraut in colander.  Rinse briefly then squeeze out most of liquid.  Place sauerkraut in even layer in medium to large shallow casserole (13- by 9-inch).  Top with 2 cups tomato sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place about 3/4 cup of rice in center of each leaf.  Fold up sides and place stuffed leaves, seam-side down, in casserole.  Spoon remaining 1 1/2 cups tomato sauce over cabbage.  Cover with foil and bake until bubbly and heated through, about 45 minutes.  Check after 30 minutes and if it seems too liquidy, remove foil during last 10 to 15 minutes of baking.  Serve hot.

Comments:  These stuffed cabbage leaves are nestled in a layer of sauerkraut and tomato sauce.  Try to find a good size cabbage so you will end up with large leaves, and then you can add plenty of filling to each.  This dish can be entirely assembled up to 24 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate, then bring to room temperature before baking.

  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/3           cup  chopped onion
  2             slices  tempeh "bacon" -- diced
  2               cups  thinly-sliced small red-skinned potatoes
     1/2           cup  white wine

                        === MARINADE FOR HIJIKI (optional) ===
     1/4           cup  tamari or soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  apple juice

     1/4      teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
                        === CROQUETTES ===
  1              ounce  dried hijiki
  1              pound  firm or extra-firm tofu
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- finely chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  soy mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  prepared horseradish
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2           cups  plain bread crumbs
                        Vegetable oil -- if pan-frying
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish
                        Tartar Sauce -- (see recipe)

Make seasoning mix:  In small bowl, combine all ingredients.  Reserve 1 teaspoon mix to add to breading.

Rinse hijiki.  If using marinade, mix all ingredients and 1/4 cup water in medium bowl and add hijiki.  If not using marinade, cover hijiki with water.  Soak 20 minutes.  Remove from marinade or water and chop.

Put tofu on plate lined with two layers of paper towels.  Place another two layers of paper towels over tofu.  Set plate over towels and place heavy can on plate to press out excess water from tofu.  In medium bowl, crumble tofu.  Set aside.

In large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, 1 minute.  Add garlic, bell pepper, celery and seasoning mix and stir well.  Stir in hijiki and cook, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes.  Stir in parsley.  Remove from heat.

Transfer vegetables to bowl containing tofu.  Add mustard, mayonnaise, horseradish, hot pepper sauce, lemon juice and 1 cup bread crumbs and stir well.  Form into round patties, using 1/3 cup of mixture for each.

Place remaining 1/2 cup bread crumbs in shallow bowl and stir in reserved 1 teaspoon seasoning mix.  Lightly dredge croquettes in breading so both sides are evenly coated.

To bake:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Coat baking sheet with cooking spray.  Arrange croquettes on prepared sheet.  Bake until lightly browned, about 15 minutes per side.

To pan-fry:  In large skillet, heat 1/4 inch vegetable oil over medium-high heat.  When oil is hot but not smoking, add croquettes in batches.  Cook until croquettes are browned, about 1 to 2 minutes per side.  Transfer to plate lined with paper towels to remove excess oil.

Serve croquettes garnished with lemon wedges and Tartar Sauce.

This recipe yields 16 croquettes.

Comments:  These cakes can be baked or pan-fried.  Hijiki, with a slightly anise flavor, is a dried seaweed that is reconstituted in water and used as a vegetable.  Here, we used our special marinade for that purpose.  To prepare in advance, brown croquettes and place in covered container in refrigerator.  To serve, warm in preheated 350 degree oven.

Comments:  These cakes can be baked or pan-fried.  Hijiki, with a slightly anise flavor, is a dried seaweed that is reconstituted in water and used as a vegetable.  Here, we used our special marinade for that purpose.  To prepare in advance, brown croquettes and place in covered container in refrigerator.  To serve, warm in preheated 350 degree oven.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  kudzu
     2/3           cup  Sucanat
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  1 3/4           cups  coconut milk -- divided
                        === CRUST ===
     2/3           cup  whole-wheat pastry flour
     2/3           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  pure maple syrup
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped pecans -- plus
  1                cup  pecan halves
     1/2           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  agar flakes

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Brush 8-inch pie plate with oil.

Make crust:  In medium bowl, sift together flours, cinnamon and salt.  In small bowl, whisk oil and syrup.  With rubber spatula or wooden spoon, fold liquid into flour mixture just until blended (don't over mix).  Roll dough into ball and cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate 40 minutes.

Place dough between two sheets of parchment paper; sprinkle with flour as needed.  Roll into 10-inch circle.  Remove top sheet of parchment; place your hand under bottom sheet and flip dough into pie plate.  Pierce bottom of crust with fork to form several steam holes.  Bake 15 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool on wire rack.

Spread 1 cup chopped pecans on one half of baking sheet and 1 cup pecan halves on other half; keep separate.  Bake until lightly toasted, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from oven and set aside.

In medium saucepan, bring 1/2 cup water and agar to a simmer over medium heat.  Tilt pan toward you and whisk vigorously until agar dissolves, about 3 minutes.  Stir in 1 1/2 cups of the coconut milk.  Dissolve kudzu in remaining 1/4 cup coconut milk.  Add to agar mixture; stir well.  Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until somewhat thickened.

In small saucepan, dissolve Sucanat in 1/4 cup water.  Place over medium heat and bring to a boil.  When the syrup bubbles, lift pan and swirl it.  Cook, lifting and swirling, 8 minutes.  Whisk caramelized Sucanat into coconut milk mixture.  Add chopped pecans, vanilla and lemon peel; stir well.  Remove from heat and cool 20 minutes.

Pour filling into crust; top with pecan halves.  Chill for several hours, or until set.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Per Serving: 409 Cal; 5g Prot; 29g Total Fat (9 Sat. Fat); 36g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 60mg Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  Sucanat, the dehydrated juice of sugar cane, is the sweetener in this refrigerator pie.  Unlike refined white sugar, it retains all the vitamins and minerals present in raw sugar cane.  I usually opt for liquid sweeteners (rice syrup, barley malt or maple syrup) in desserts, but a granulated sweetener works best when making a caramel sauce.  I suggest making this pie a day in advance.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1            package  quick-rising dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated sugar
     2/3           cup  hot water
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
                        === Topping ===
                        Onions -- peeled, sliced
  3          teaspoons  oil -- divided
  1           teaspoon  salt -- divided
                        Dried currants -- as needed
                        Vinegar -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Spinach -- as needed
                        Toasted pine nuts -- as needed

Begin topping:  In large skillet, heat 2 teaspoons oil over medium heat.  Add onions and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring often, until very tender and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.  To prevent scorching, adjust heat and add water as necessary.

In food processor fitted with metal blade, make dough:  Combine flour, cornmeal, yeast, salt and sugar and pulse on/off to mix.  In measuring cup, combine 2/3 cup hot water (120 to 130 degrees) and 2 teaspoons oil.  With motor running, gradually pour hot liquid through food processor feed tube.  Process until dough forms ball, then process 1 minute to knead.  The dough should be quite soft.  If it seems dry, add 1 to 2 tablespoons warm water; if too sticky, add 1 to 2 tablespoons flour.  Transfer dough to lightly floured surface and knead a few times.  Lightly coat large sheet of plastic wrap with cooking spray and place, sprayed-side down, over dough.  Let dough rest 20 to 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, place baking stone or inverted baking sheet on bottom rack of oven to heat.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  (Heat baking stone for 25 minutes before baking; heat baking sheet for 10 minutes.)

In small bowl, cover currants with hot water.  Set aside to soak about 20 minutes.  Drain and stir currants into onions.  Stir in vinegar and pepper.

In small baking pan, spread pine nuts and toast in oven until lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes.

In large wide pot, cook spinach with just the water that clings to leaves over medium-high heat, stirring often, until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain in colander.  Rinse with cold water and squeeze out excess moisture.  Place in medium bowl and add remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.

Assemble flatbread:  Coat baking sheet with cooking spray and dust with cornmeal.  On lightly floured surface, use rolling pin to roll dough into 16- by 12-inch rectangle, slightly less than 1/4-inch thick.  Transfer dough to prepared sheet.  Roll edges under to finish rim of crust.  Brush remaining 1 teaspoon oil over rim of crust.  Scatter spinach over crust.  Top with caramelized onion mixture and sprinkle with toasted pine nuts.  Lightly coat topping with cooking spray.

Place baking sheet on heated baking stone and bake until bottom of crust is golden and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes.  Transfer to cutting board and use pizza cutter to cut into 8 rectangles.  Serve hot or warm.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 229 Cal; 7g Prot; 6g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 40g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 585mg Sod.; 6g Fiber.

Comments:  This delicate flatbread is an example of a coca, a pizza-like speciality of Catalonia in northeastern Spain.  It is hearty enough to serve as a meal, but you can also cut it into smaller rectangles to serve as tapas or appetizers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  hazelnuts - (5 oz)
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  6            squares  unsweetened chocolate - (6 oz) -- coarsely chopped
  2               cups  sugar
  4              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for coating

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Spread hazelnuts on baking sheet and bake until skins blister and nuts are fragrant, 12 to 13 minutes.  Slide nuts onto a kitchen towel, fold towel over and rub vigorously to remove skins; don't be concerned if little bits adhere to nuts.  Cool nuts thoroughly.

In top of double boiler set over barely simmering water, melt chocolate with butter, stirring until smooth.  Remove top pan from water and let cool.

When nuts are thoroughly cool, put them in food processor with 1/4 cup of sugar and pulse on/off to finely grind nuts; set aside.

In large bowl, beat remaining 1 3/4 cups sugar and eggs with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes.  Beat in vanilla and cooled chocolate mixture.  Stir in nuts.

In medium bowl, mix flour, baking powder and salt.  Add to batter, about half at a time, beating well after each addition (dough will be very soft).  Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Grease two large baking sheets or line with parchment paper.  Pinch off pieces of dough and roll into 1 1/2-inch balls.  Roll in confectioners' sugar, coating well, then place on prepared baking sheets, spacing about 3 inches apart.  Bake until puffy and seem underdone when poked, about 13 minutes.  Transfer baking sheets to wire racks and cool 10 minutes, then remove cookies to rack and cool completely.

This recipe yields ?? cookies.

Per Cookie: 112 Cal; 2g Prot; 6g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 14g Carb.; 23mg  Chol; 29mg  Sod.; 1g Fiber.

Comments:  What you get, essentially, is a brownie within a thin crust that's quite exquisite.  The key is taking them out of the oven before they seem done: They should still be squishy when you give them a gentle poke.  This way, they end up with a supersoft center when they cool.  If you overbake them they'll still be good, just not extraordinary.

Categories    : Dairy Free                      Egg Free

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  tempeh - (8 oz ea) -- cut crosswise
                        into 12 thin strips
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced fresh ginger - (1 oz)
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  fresh basil - (loosely packed) -- coarsely chopped
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4             pieces  star anise
  1                can  lite coconut milk - (14 oz)
  1                cup  low-sodium vegetable broth
  1                cup  unsweetened coconut flakes
  1                cup  plain dry bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  sesame seeds
  1         tablespoon  kudzu -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  cold water

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line baking sheet with parchment paper.

In large Dutch oven, arrange tempeh slices with ginger, garlic, basil, 3/4 teaspoon salt and star anise.

In small bowl, combine coconut milk and broth and pour over tempeh.  Cover and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes (lower heat if cooking too rapidly).

Meanwhile, prepare coconut breading:  In medium bowl, combine coconut flakes, bread crumbs, sesame seeds and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt; toss to mix.

With slotted spoon, transfer tempeh to plate.  (There should be at least 1 cup cooking liquid left in pot.  If not, add more broth or water to equal 1 cup liquid.)  Strain tempeh cooking liquid, discard solids and return to pan.

Dissolve kudzu completely in water.  Whisk kudzu mixture into strained cooking liquid and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.  Pour thickened liquid into shallow bowl.

Dip tempeh slices first in kudzu mixture and then in coconut breading, turning to coat.  Arrange breaded tempeh on prepared baking sheet and bake 15 minutes.  Turn and bake another 10 minutes.  Let sit 5 minutes, then serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 498 Cal; 28g Prot; 22g Total Fat (8 Sat. Fat); 52g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 1493mg Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  It's always a challenge to find an ingredient that's hearty enough to cover with a crust and then develop a method of breading it without eggs or dairy.  This recipe tackles both issues.  Serve hot over a sautÈ of bok choy accompanied by a spicy peanut dipping sauce.

When cutting tempeh, hold your knife at a 45∞ angle to get more surface area per slice.

                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  almonds -- blanched, slivered
  1              pound  collard greens -- rinsed, and
  1                     thick stems removed
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  umeboshi vinegar
  1         tablespoon  apple cider vinegar
  1              small  garlic clove -- minced

In small skillet, toast almonds over medium heat until golden in color, 1 to 2 minutes; set aside.

Layer 3 collard leaves.  Roll into cylinder and slice crosswise into thin strips.  Repeat until all leaves are sliced.  In large saucepan fitted with steamer basket, bring 2 inches water to a boil over high heat.  Add greens, cover and steam 4 minutes.

In small bowl, whisk sesame oil, both vinegars and garlic until blended.  Toss greens with dressing and garnish with toasted almonds.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 97 Cal; 2g Prot; 7g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 7g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 19mg Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  Southerners tend to simmer greens for a long time with onions and garlic, and the results are quite delicious.  But here the collards are steamed for a short time to retain their color and texture.  They're tossed with a simple, full-flavored, tangy dressing and topped with toasted almonds, which add a nice crunch.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dairy Free                      Egg Free
                Soups/Stews                     Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  asparagus spears -- trimmed
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  finely-chopped shallots - (abt 10)
     1/2         pound  boiling potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  2                     vegetable bouillon cubes
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- for garnish

Reserve 8 spears of asparagus for garnish.  Cut remaining asparagus stalks into 1-inch pieces.

In medium saucepan, heat oil over medium heat.  Add shallots and cook, stirring often, until beginning to brown, 8 to 10 minutes.  Add potatoes, cut-up asparagus and 4 cups water.  Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.  Add bouillon and 1 teaspoon salt.  Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, in wide, deep pot of lightly salted boiling water, blanch reserved asparagus spears until just tender, about 3 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, remove spears to colander and rinse under cold running water, drain well and set aside.

In food processor or blender, process soup in batches until smooth and creamy.  Return to pot and add freshly ground pepper to taste and lemon juice.  Adjust salt to taste.  Garnish with asparagus spears and ground black pepper.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 189 Cal; 7g Prot; 6g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 32g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 15mg Sod.; 5g Fiber.

Comments:  This soup is sure to become a family favorite.  The ingredients are few, but the flavor is big.  Potato makes the texture super creamy.  Make this soup as soon as the new crop of asparagus makes its way to market, a sure sign of spring.

While the soup is simmering, make a tossed green salad topped with marinated baked tofu or sprinkles of goat cheese.  Serve with toasted slices of baguette rubbed with garlic.

     1/4           cup  finely-chopped red onion
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley

Make spice mixture:  In small bowl, mix cumin, paprika, cinnamon, coriander, cloves, salt and pepper.

In large skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Add spice mixture and cook, stirring constantly, 15 seconds.  Stir in 3 tablespoons water.  Cook briefly, stirring, then stir in chickpeas.

Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and cook 2 minutes, stirring once.  Stir in brown sugar, then carrots and onion.  Cover and cook 1 minute more.  Remove from heat and mix in lemon juice.

Transfer chickpeas to serving bowl, sprinkle with parsley and serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 193 Cal; 6g Prot; 5g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 32g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 368mg  Sod.; 5g Fiber.

Comments:  Don't be intimidated by this long ingredient list: Much of it is a spice mix you can put together in a couple of minutes.  Canned chickpeas work fine here, but remember they just need to heat through, not cook; two to three minutes in the pot is plenty.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
     1/4           cup  whole flaxseeds
  1                cup  whole-wheat flour
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  low-fat plain yogurt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed
                        Semolina or cornmeal -- for dusting
                        === GLAZE AND TOPPING ===
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  water
  2          teaspoons  whole flaxseeds

In large mixing bowl, mix 1 cup lukewarm water and sugar.  Sprinkle in yeast and let stand until foamy, 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, in spice grinder or blender, coarsely grind 1/4 cup flaxseeds.

With wooden spoon, gradually beat whole wheat flour into yeast mixture; beat about 2 minutes.  Stir in ground flaxseeds, oil, yogurt and salt.  Gradually beat in just enough all-purpose flour until dough is too stiff to stir.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead, adding just enough flour to prevent sticking, until smooth and elastic, 5 to 10 minutes.  (You can mix and knead dough in stand-up mixer fitted with paddle attachment, then dough hook.)

Place dough in lightly oiled large bowl and turn to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Place baking stone or inverted baking sheet in oven to heat.  Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  (Heat baking stone for 25 minutes before baking; heat baking sheet for 10 minutes.)

Punch dough down.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead a few times.  Divide dough into 2 pieces.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rest about 20 minutes.

Dust pizza peel or large metal spatula with cornmeal.  In small bowl, combine egg and 1 tablespoon water; stir briskly with fork.  Use your hands to press one piece of dough into an oval, then continue to stretch and press it into 10- by 7-inch oval, slightly less than 1/2-inch thick.  Place oval on pizza peel.  Brush top with egg glaze.  Dip your fingertips in egg glaze and press them into dough to form dimples all over flatbread.  Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons whole flaxseeds.

Working quickly, open oven door, hold pizza peel at slight angle and tip end toward back of the baking stone.  Give pizza peel a quick jerk, letting flatbread slide onto baking stone.  Quickly close oven door and bake flatbread until lightly browned and puffed, 11 to 12 minutes.  Immediately wrap baked flatbread in kitchen towel to keep it soft and warm.  Repeat with remaining dough and flaxseed topping.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 190 Cal; 6g Prot; 7g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 28g Carb.; 27mg Chol; 414mg Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Comments:  Nutty flavored flaxseeds provide the nutritional benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, lignans (a type of phytoestrogen) and fiber.  One of the easiest and most appealing ways to incorporate flaxseeds into your diet is to use them in yeast breads.  Since flaxseeds must be ground to release their benefits, we use ground flaxseeds to replace part of the flour in the dough.  A sprinkling of whole flaxseeds creates an appealing topping on this Turkish-style bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  smoked or baked tofu - (6 oz)
     1/4           cup  peanut oil
     1/4           cup  unsalted peanuts
  4               cups  mung bean sprouts
  1             medium  cucumber -- halved, and
                        thinly sliced
  1             medium  carrot -- peeled, julienned
                        Cilantro - (optional) -- for garnish
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  fresh lime juice
  2              small  garlic cloves -- minced
  4        tablespoons  teriyaki sauce
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
                        = (or 1/4 tspn chili sauce)

Cut tofu into 1 1/2- by 1/2-inch pieces.  Bring medium pot of water to a boil.  Fill medium bowl with ice water.

In wok or large, heavy skillet, heat oil over high heat.  Add peanuts and stir-fry until fragrant and pale brown, about 30 seconds.  Using slotted spoon, remove peanuts and drain on paper towels.  Set aside.

Add tofu and stir-fry until crisp around edges, 2 to 3 minutes (it will spatter).  Drain on paper towels.  Discard remaining oil.

Add sprouts to boiling water and boil 1 minute.  Drain in colander, then immediately immerse in ice water.  Drain again and set aside.

Make dressing:  In blender or food processor, combine all dressing ingredients and reserved peanuts.  Process until nuts are finely ground.

Arrange bean sprouts in center of serving platter.  Top with fried tofu.  Arrange cucumbers around sprouts.  On top of cucumber, lay carrot strips in thin band around sprouts.  Pour dressing over tofu.  Garnish with cilantro leaves if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This Asian-accented salad is pretty enough to make for dinner guests. Also think of it for office parties and potluck dinners.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  egg
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
                        Milk -- for glaze
  3        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut 1/4" pieces
  1                cup  golden raisins
     3/4           cup  chopped dates
     1/2           cup  chopped prunes
  1                cup  ruby port - (to 1 1/2)
                        Fine yellow cornmeal -- for dusting
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
                        extra for sprinkling
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves

In shallow bowl, combine raisins, dates, prunes and enough port to just cover.  Let stand 30 to 60 minutes.  Lightly oil large baking sheet and dust with cornmeal; set aside.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In large bowl, mix flour, 1/2 cup sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and cloves.  Cut butter into dry ingredients with a pastry blender or rub it in with your fingers until mixture resembles fine crumbs; set aside.  In small bowl, whisk egg then whisk in buttermilk, vanilla and lemon peel.

Drain fruit; discard port.  Add fruit to flour mixture and toss well.  Make a well in flour mixture, add buttermilk mixture and stir briskly with wooden spoon just until dough pulls together in a mass.  Let stand 3 minutes.

Lightly dust work surface and hands with flour.  Turn dough out onto surface and divide in half.  Knead each half 30 seconds then pat into 1-inch-thick circles.  Brush off any flour on dough, then fold each circle in half (but not perfectly, the top should be set back from bottom by about 1 inch.)  Lightly brush loaves with milk and sprinkle generously with sugar (about 1/2 tablespoon).  Transfer loaves to baking sheet.

Bake 25 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Continue baking until loaves are golden brown and crusty, 20 to 25 minutes.  Transfer loaves to wire rack and cool completely before slicing.  To store, wrap cooled loaves in foil and refrigerate.

This recipe yields 2 loaves.

Per Serving: 124 Cal; 3g Prot; 2g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 25g Carb.; 10mg  Chol; 156mg  Sod.; 1g Fiber.

Comments:  These lovely loaves are shaped like stollen, the traditional German holiday bread.  But it's a quick bread, not a yeasted one as stollen is, so you can make it in just a fraction of the time.  If you'd rather not use the port to soak the fruit, simply use apple, orange or apricot juice.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  walnuts - (6 oz)
  2               cups  old-fashioned rolled oats
     1/2           cup  rice flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
     1/3           cup  brown rice syrup
     1/3           cup  pure maple syrup
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  3        tablespoons  all-fruit preserves

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place walnuts on baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, 8 to 10 minutes.  Lightly brush 3 baking sheets with oil or line with parchment paper; set aside.

Meanwhile, put oats in food processor and pulse on/off 6 times.  Add rice flour, salt, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg and process to blend.  Scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula, pulse 2 more times to thoroughly combine.  Transfer mixture to large bowl.

While walnuts are still warm, grind them to a paste in food processor.  Add oil, rice syrup, maple syrup and vanilla and process until blended and smooth.  Add mixture to dry ingredients and mix until just blended.  (Dough will be sticky.)

Scoop out heaping teaspoonfuls of dough.  Roll into balls and flatten to form cookies about 1 3/4 inches in diameter.  (It's helpful to dip hands and utensils in water when working with this sticky dough.)  With your thumb, make a deep indentation in center of each cookie.  Fill each indentation with about 1/4 teaspoon fruit preserves.

Place cookies on prepared baking sheets, spacing about 2 inches apart.  Bake until bottoms are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.  Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool.

This recipe yields 3 dozen.

Per Cookie: 90 Cal; 2g Prot; 5g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 11g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 20mg  Sod.; 1g Fiber.

Comments:  The dough for these cookies is a basic one and can be adapted in several ways.  Different fillings can be used for the cookie: The raisin puree from the Raisin Newtons (see recipe) is an excellent choice.  You may also use slivered almond or finely chopped nuts.  This dough can also be rolled out to make shaped cookies.  Roll dough between two sheets of parchment paper to 1/8-inch thick, cut with cookie cutters and bake about 8 minutes.

  1                     vegetable bouillon cube
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Add leeks, potatoes, carrots, bell pepper, chile pepper if using and 4 cups water and bring to a simmer.  Add bouillon cube, bay leaves, thyme, red pepper flakes and black pepper.

Comments:  In its native land, this stew is chock-full of herbs, spices and, well, you really don't want to know.  Our version replaces these "mystery ingredients" with tofu and soy "pepperoni."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SEASONING MIX ===
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  dried sage
     1/2      teaspoon  celery seed
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === JAMBALAYA ===
  1                cup  canned whole peeled tomatoes
  12            ounces  seitan -- drained
  2 3/4           cups  low-sodium vegetable broth
  1                cup  uncooked brown rice
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2         large  red bell pepper -- chopped - (1/2 cup)
  1                     medium stalk celery -- chopped - (1/2 cup)
  4             sprigs  fresh flat-leaf parsley

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  In small bowl, combine seasoning mix ingredients; set aside.  Drain tomatoes, reserving liquid, and coarsely chop.  Set aside.  Place seitan in food processor and pulse on/off 12 times or until seitan is shredded.  Set aside.

In 4-quart Dutch oven or flame-proof casserole dish with lid, combine reserved tomato liquid and broth and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Add rice and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Return to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, in deep skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring, until slightly softened, about 2 minutes.  Add garlic, red pepper, celery and seasoning mix and stir well.  Add tomatoes, then seitan and cook, stirring, about 3 minutes.

Add vegetable-seitan mixture to rice.  Stir just to combine ingredients.  Bake, covered, until water is completely absorbed, 30 to 45 minutes.  Remove from oven and keep jambalaya covered for 5 minutes; stir and then serve.

Note:  For an easy and elegant presentation, mold jambalya mixture in a lightly greased 8-ounces cup and turn onto dinner plate; garnish with sprigs of parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 379 Cal; 26g Prot; 3g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 50g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 28mg Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Comments:  Seitan has the ideal texture and flavor for this dish.  The recipe also includes onion, garlic, celery and green bell pepper, a combination frequently used in Cajun cooking.  The recipe can easily be doubled to accommodate more diners.

  3 1/4           cups  unsweetened shredded coconut
  1 1/2           cups  walnuts - (9 oz)
  1 1/3           cups  rolled oats
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/3           cup  barley malt
     2/3           cup  pure maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread 2 1/2 cups coconut and walnuts on separate baking sheets.  Bake coconut until lightly toasted, stirring occasionally 5 to 7 minutes.  Bake walnuts until lightly toasted, 8 to 10 minutes.  Set toasted coconut and walnuts aside; keep separate.

Place remaining 3/4 cup raw coconut in shallow bowl; set aside.  Lightly brush two baking sheets with oil or line with parchment paper; set aside.

Put oats in a food processor and pulse on/off 6 times.  Transfer oats to large bowl and add toasted coconut and salt.  In food processor, process walnuts to a paste.  Add oil, barley malt, maple syrup and vanilla and process until blended and smooth.  Add wet ingredients to dry and mix well.

Scoop dough with 1/8 cup dry measure and roll into balls, then roll each ball in raw coconut.  Place cookies on prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.  Bake until bottoms are lightly browned, about 15 minutes.  (Don't overcook; macaroons should be moist and chewy.)  Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 dozen.

In food processor, finely grind toasted pecans.  Add oats, flour, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Pulse on/off several times to combine ingredients.  Scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula and pulse on/off 2 more times to thoroughly combine.  Transfer mixture to large bowl.

In medium bowl, mix maple syrup, oil and vanilla.  Add oil mixture to flour mixture and stir until well blended.

Roll 1 tablespoon dough into a ball and flatten to form cookie about 1 3/4 inches in diameter.  Press a pecan half in center of each cookie.  Place cookies on prepared baking sheets, spacing about 1 inch apart.  Bake until undersides are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.  Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 dozen.

Per Cookie: 160 Cal; 2g Prot; 9g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 19g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 31mg  Sod.; 1g Fiber.

Comments:  To judge doneness for these nut-based cookies, go by the color of the underside, which should be light golden brown.  Don't wait for cookies to brown on top.  Also, expect them to be somewhat softñthey will firm up as they cool.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves - (to 3) -- minced
  4             medium  potatoes -- peeled, diced
  4             medium  carrots -- sliced
     1/2        medium  cauliflower head -- cut bite size
  2               cups  frozen cut green beans
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger - (to 2)
  2                     fresh mild chile peppers -- seeded, minced
  2          teaspoons  garam masala -- or to taste
                        = (or good-quality curry powder)
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  turmeric
  1                can  lite coconut milk - (15 oz)
  1                cup  frozen green peas
     1/4      teaspoon  chopped cilantro

In large soup pot, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring often, until onions are golden.  Add potatoes, carrots and 2 cups water and bring to a simmer.  Cover and simmer gently until potatoes are about halfway tender, 10 to 15 minutes.  Add cauliflower, green beans, ginger, chiles, garam masala, coriander and turmeric.  Continue to simmer gently, covered, until vegetables are tender, 20 minutes.

Mash some potatoes against side of pot with wooden spoon (this helps to thicken stew).  Stir in coconut milk and season to taste with salt.  If time allows, let stew stand an hour or so before serving.

Just before serving, heat stew and taste and correct seasonings.  Stir in peas and cilantro and cook just until peas are heated through, then serve in shallow bowls.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2              large  onions -- chopped
  2             medium  potatoes -- scrubbed, and
                        cut into 1/2" chunks
  2               cups  chunks (1/2") peeled butternut squash - -- (heaping)
  2              large  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 to 16 oz) -- undrained
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground turmeric
  1                can  chickpeas - (15 1/2 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  1                cup  couscous, preferably whole wheat
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  4                     scallions, white and light green parts -- chopped

In soup pot, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onions and cook, stirring until softened, about 5 minutes.  Add potatoes, squash, carrots, tomatoes and barely enough water to cover.  Bring to a simmer, then add cumin and turmeric and simmer gently, covered, until vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes.  Add chickpeas and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Simmer over low heat another 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, put couscous into an ovenproof bowl and cover with 2 cups boiling water.  Cover bowl and let stand 5 to 10 minutes, then fluff couscous with fork.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Per Serving: 301 Cal; 9g Prot; 5g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 51g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 82mg Sod.; 5g Fiber.

Comments:  There's loads of flavor in this easy-to-make stew.  To save time, look for chopped, peeled butternut squash sold in bags in the produce section of large supermarkets.

Add a crunchy, cabbage-based salad and some warmed flatbread for a simple, hearty meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  chopped walnuts - (4 oz)
  3             medium  portobello mushrooms -- stems, and
                        gills removed
  8             ounces  tempeh
  1                cup  uncooked millet
  2        tablespoons  tamari or soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  umeboshi vinegar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  5                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     celery stalks -- finely chopped
  1             medium  green bell pepper -- finely chopped
  2             medium  carrots -- grated
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  dried rosemary
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  dried marjoram
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2           cup  cornmeal or bread crumbs
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
                        Vegetable oil -- if pan-frying

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spread walnuts on baking sheet; toast 10 minutes and set aside.  Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees.

Brush mushrooms with a little oil.  On baking sheet, arrange mushrooms with caps up.  Roast 30 minutes.  Let mushrooms cool, then chop.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Meanwhile, in large saucepan fitted with steamer, bring 2 inches water to a boil.  Add tempeh, cover and steam 20 minutes.  Break tempeh into small chunks and add to food processor.

In medium saucepan, combine millet, 2 1/2 cups water and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Cover and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until all water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.  Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes.  Fluff millet with fork.

Add millet to tempeh in food processor and process to combine.  Add 1 tablespoon tamari and 1 tablespoon vinegar and process until smooth.  Transfer millet-tempeh mixture to medium bowl.

In large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, 2 minutes.  Stir in garlic, celery, bell pepper, carrots, cumin, rosemary, thyme, marjoram, 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper and 1 teaspoon salt.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften, 4 minutes.

Add vegetables to bowl with millet-tempeh mixture.  Stir in walnuts, mushrooms, mustard, remaining tablespoon tamari, remaining tablespoon vinegar and salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.  Form into oblong patties, using 1/3 cup of mixture for each.

In shallow bowl, mix cornmeal or bread crumbs and chili powder.  Lightly dredge croquettes in breading so both sides are evenly coated.

To bake:  Lightly coat baking sheet with cooking spay.  Arrange croquettes on prepared sheet.  Bake until lightly browned, about 15 minutes per side.

To pan-fry:  In large skillet, heat 1/4 inch vegetable oil over medium-high heat.  When oil is hot but not smoking, add croquettes in batches.  Cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to plate lined with paper towels to remove excess oil.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 24 croquettes.

Comments:  Portobello mushrooms and walnuts enhance these richly flavored croquettes.  They're great served with the "Fresh Mango Chutney" (see recipe).

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12              cups  mixed salad greens
  1                     ripe pear -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
     1/2         small  red onion -- very thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  toasted pecans* -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  crumbled blue cheese
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
                        === CRANBERRY VINAIGRETTE ===
     2/3           cup  canned whole-berry cranberry sauce
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  fresh orange juice
  2          teaspoons  pure maple syrup

* To toast pecans, preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Spread pecans on baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, 6 minutes.  Transfer pecans to plate to cool, then chop.

Make vinaigrette:  In food processor or blender, combine half the cranberry sauce with vinegar and process until smooth.  Scrape mixture into salad bowl and whisk in remaining cranberry sauce and orange juice, maple syrup, oil and salt to taste; set aside.

When ready to serve, put greens in bowl with dressing.  Add pear and onion slices and toss well to coat with dressing.  Sprinkle pecans and cheese over salad.  Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste and serve.

Comments:  Use any combination of greens hereñromaine hearts, Boston lettuce, baby spinach or mesclun mix.  A few bitter greens would be fine too, since the sweetness of the cranberry vinaigrette will soften their bite.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  semolina -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1            package  quick-rising yeast - (1/4 oz)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated sugar
     2/3           cup  hot water
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
                        === TOPPING ===
                        Olives -- as needed
  4          teaspoons  rosemary -- divided
  1         tablespoon  oil
  1         tablespoon  water

In food processor fitted with metal blade, combine flour, semolina, yeast, salt and sugar; pulse on/off to mix.  In measuring cup, combine 2/3 cup hot water (120 to 130 degrees) and oil.  With motor running, gradually pour hot liquid through food processor feed tube.  Process until dough forms a ball, then process 1 minute to knead.  The dough should be quite soft.  If it seems dry, add 1 to 2 tablespoons warm water; if too sticky, add 1 to 2 tablespoons flour.  Transfer dough to lightly floured surface and knead a few times.  Coat sheet of plastic wrap with cooking spray and place, sprayed-side down, over dough.  Let dough rest 20 to 30 minutes.

Place baking stone or inverted baking sheet on bottom rack of oven to heat.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  (Heat baking stone 25 minutes before baking; heat baking sheet for 10 minutes.)

Coat another baking sheet with cooking spray and dust with semolina.  On lightly floured surface, roll dough into 16- by 12-inch rectangle.  Sprinkle olives and 2 teaspoons rosemary over half of rectangle.  Fold dough in half to enclose olives and form a 12- by 8-inch rectangle.  Press edges together to seal.  Roll dough into 15- by 11-inch rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick.  Transfer dough to prepared baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and let rise 20 minutes.

In small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon water.  Brush oil mixture over top of focaccia.  Sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons rosemary.  Dip your fingertips in any remaining oil mixture and press dough to form dimples in focaccia.  Pinch and pleat rim to finish edges.  Place baking sheet on heated baking stone and bake until bottom of crust is golden and crisp, 10 to 20 minutes.  Transfer to cutting board and use pizza cutter to cut into 8 rectangles.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Focaccia makes a great snack or party food.  In this recipe, the olive topping is sandwiched between layers of dough so that just a few olives peek out on the surface.  Semolina in the dough contributes to an appealing, crisp texture.

Roll dough into 15- by 11-inch rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick.  Transfer dough to prepared baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and let rise 20 minutes.

In small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon water.  Brush oil mixture over top of focaccia.  Sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons rosemary.  Dip your fingertips in any remaining oil mixture and press dough to form dimples in focaccia.  Pinch and pleat rim to finish edges.  Place baking sheet on heated baking stone and bake until bottom of crust is golden and crisp, 10 to 20 minutes.  Transfer to cutting board and use pizza cutter to cut into 8 rectangles.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

Comments:  Focaccia makes a great snack or party food.  In this recipe, the olive topping is sandwiched between layers of dough so that just a few olives peek out on the surface.  Semolina in the dough contributes to an appealing, crisp texture.

                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  sun-dried tomatoes - (abt 8)
  1              pound  broccoli rabe -- tough stems removed
     1/2         pound  rotini pasta
  2               cups  low-sodium vegetable broth
  3               cans  cannellini beans - (15 oz ea) -- rinsed, drained
                        = (or other white beans)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4             medium  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
                        = (or 2 tspns dried rosemary)
     1/4           cup  grated Romano cheese -- (optional)

In large pot, bring 3 quarts water to a boil.  Place sun-dried tomatoes in small bowl.  When water begins to warm, ladle 1 cup over tomatoes.  Let sit about 10 minutes to soften.  Drain and slice tomatoes into thin strips.

Add broccoli rabe to pot of boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 2 minutes.  Remove with slotted spoon to drain.  Cut broccoli rabe into bite-size pieces.

Return water to a boil.  Add pasta and stir to prevent sticking.  Cook until just tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain; rinse under cold running water and drain well.

In medium skillet, heat broth over medium heat.  Pour 2 cans beans into blender and slowly add hot broth.  Puree until smooth.

In skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-low heat; add garlic.  As soon as garlic begins to color, add red pepper flakes and pureed beans and stir to combine.  Add remaining can of beans to puree along with 2 teaspoons salt.  Add rosemary, then increase heat and bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer 5 minutes.  Adjust salt to taste and add sprinkling of freshly ground pepper.

In another medium skillet, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat.  Add broccoli rabe and pinch of salt and toss until broccoli rabe is heated through.  Stir in sun-dried tomatoes.

To serve:  Ladle bean sauce over pasta and top with mound of broccoli rabe and tomato mixture.  Sprinkle each serving with cheese if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 515 Cal; 25g Prot; 7g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 86g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 143mg Sod.; 15g Fiber.

Comments:  For a change of pace (or for the gluten-sensitive) try using quinoa or spelt spirals in this rich pasta dish.  Blanching the broccoli rabe before sauteing cuts the bitter edge.

Buy a crusty loaf of bread and cut it into thin crostini.  Spread it with olive tapenade.  Have a scoop of lemon sorbet for dessert.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  penne or ziti
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2                     shallots -- finely chopped
  2               cups  prepared tomato sauce
     2/3           cup  half-and-half
                        = (or plain soy milk)
  2             pounds  thin asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
     1/2      teaspoon  dried tarragon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Bring large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add pasta; stir to prevent sticking.  Cook pasta until just tender according to package directions, about 10 minutes.  Drain well.

Meanwhile, in large skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Add shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6 to 7 minutes.

Stir in tomato sauce and half-and-half, increase heat to high and bring to a boil.  Add asparagus and tarragon and reduce heat to low.  Partially cover and cook until asparagus are tender and sauce is slightly thickened, 10 to 12 minutes.

Add pasta to asparagus mixture along with salt and pepper.  Toss until well coated.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This lovely pasta recipe reminds us that spring is just around the corner, when local asparagus becomes available.  For the freshest flavor, choose a simple tomato sauce -- one flavored with onion and garlic and not too much else.  If you prefer a nondairy dish, replace the half-and-half with soy milk.

Serve with crusty Italian or French bread to mop up the sauce.  Also make a simple salad, pairing a mild lettuce with a spicy green like arugula.

Comments:  This lovely pasta recipe reminds us that spring is just around the corner, when local asparagus becomes available.  For the freshest flavor, choose a simple tomato sauce -- one flavored with onion and garlic and not too much else.  If you prefer a nondairy dish, replace the half-and-half with soy milk.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve with crusty Italian or French bread to mop up the sauce.  Also make a simple salad, pairing a mild lettuce with a spicy green like arugula.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2            cup  raisins
     2/3           cup  orange juice
  2        tablespoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/4           cups  whole or half pecans - (8 oz)
     1/2           cup  rice flour
     1/2           cup  oat flour
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  salt
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  pure maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  grated orange peel

In small bowl, combine raisins, orange juice and 1 tablespoon vanilla; let stand 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spread 1 1/4 cups pecans on baking sheet and bake until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from oven, chop 3/4 cup pecans; set aside.  Place remaining 1/2 cup pecans in food processor and finely grind.  Add rice flour, oat flour, cinnamon and salt and process until well blended, occasionally scraping sides of bowl with rubber spatula.  Transfer mixture to large bowl.

In medium bowl, mix oil, maple syrup and remaining 1 tablespoon vanilla.  Add to flour mixture and mix just until blended.

Drain raisins and puree in food processor or blender.  Transfer to small bowl and stir in chopped pecans and orange peel.  Divide raisin filling into three parts; set aside.

Place 13- by 12-inch sheet of parchment paper on flat surface; sprinkle lightly with oat or rice flour.  Roll dough into 12-inch square.  (To prevent the roller from sticking to the dough, use a second sheet of parchment or dust dough with flour.)

Leave 1-inch space at the edge of dough closer to you.  Working from left to right, form 1/3 of the raisin puree into 10-inch strip, 1/2-inch thick and 1-inch wide.  Fold dough over filling to form long bar.  Gently peel parchment from dough, seal edge where dough meets, and cut along that edge with sharp knife.  Cut bar into 10 1-inch pieces; place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Repeat this method to use remaining ingredients; bake 15 to 17 minutes.  Remove to wire rack to cool.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === WHOLE-GRAIN MUSTARD DRESSING ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  French whole-grain mustard
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-strong Dijon mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  sea salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  raspberry vinegar
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  grape seed or canola oil
  1         tablespoon  water
                        === FOR ASSEMBLY ===
  3              large  beets -- peeled, and
                        sliced into 1/4" thick rounds
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable stock
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped red onion
  1              large  heirloom tomato -- seeded, diced
     1/2        medium  avocado -- peeled, pitted,
                        and diced small
                        Whole-Grain Mustard Dressing -- (listed above)
  1               dash  cumin
                        Salt -- to taste

In a bowl, combine the mustards, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper and the vinegars.

In a measuring cup with a lip, combine the grape seed oil and the water.  Whisk the mustard-vinegar mixture until smooth, and then, while adding the oil-water mixture in a thin stream, continue to whisk.  Continue whisking and pouring slowly until all the oil has been emulsified into the dressing.  Use the dressing as needed.  Keep it in a squeeze bottle, or small water bottle fitted with a squirt top, in your refrigerator.  (Makes about 3/4 cup)

Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Place sliced beets in one layer in a 13- by 9-inch baking dish.  Pour the vegetable stock and the oil evenly on top.  Cover the pan and roast until the beets are tender, about 40 to 45 minutes.  Remove the beets from the pan and let them cool for 20 minutes.  Reserve the pan juices.

Mix the red onion, diced tomato and avocado together with 1 tablespoon of the Whole-Grain Mustard Dressing.  Add the cumin and salt, then stir.

Place one slice of beet on each plate and add 1/2 tablespoon of the tomato-avocado mixture, then another beet, then mixture, then beet, creating layers.  Spoon 1/2 tablespoon of the reserved beet juice over each stack.  Drizzle additional dressing over the top and around each napoleon.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  all-purpose potatoes - (4 to 5 potatoes) -- peeled, and
                        cut in half
  2             medium  onions -- halved, peeled
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1             medium  garlic head
  2 1/2    tablespoons  butter or soy margarine
  6               cups  low-sodium vegetable broth
  1 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  milk, half-and-half or soy milk

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place potatoes in large bowl.  Snip root end off each onion and cut each half into 3 sections.  Add onions to potatoes, breaking up onions with your fingers to separate.

Drizzle vegetables with oil, add thyme and toss well.  Spread vegetables on baking sheet.  Season with salt and pepper.

Slice top third off head of garlic and place it on a piece of foil.  Put 1/2 tablespoon butter on top of garlic and drizzle 2 teaspoons water onto foil.  Fold sides of foil to enclose; place on pan with vegetables. Roast vegetables 45 minutes, then remove garlic.  Continue roasting vegetables until tender, about 15 minutes more.

In large saucepan, bring broth to a simmer over medium-low heat.  Transfer half the roasted vegetables to food processor and add 1/2 cup hot broth.  Process mixture until fairly smooth, then transfer to bowl.  Repeat with remaining vegetables and a little more hot broth, squeezing garlic pulp out of husks into last batch.  Stir all pureed mixture into broth in pan; keep pan over low heat.

In small saucepan, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter over medium-low heat.  Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, 1 1/2 minutes.  Stir in milk and cook, stirring often, until thickened, about 3 minutes.  Stir in ladleful of soup and cook 1 minute.

Add mixture back to soup.  Cook over medium-low heat until heated through, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Serve right away, or cool, refrigerate and reheat when needed.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 257 Cal; 5g Prot; 8g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 30g Carb.; 12mg  Chol; 191mg  Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Comments:  Roasting vegetables adds a satisfying, bold flavor dimension to soup.  Be sure to roast the vegetables long enough for the onions to get well done, as undercooking them will give the soup a raw flavor.  Because roasting leaves a brown skin on the potatoes, the soup won't be perfectly smooth when you puree it.  But don't worry: A few chunks in the soup contribute to the texture.

                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  low-sodium vegetable broth
  4                     scallions, white and light green parts -- cut 1" pieces
  1             medium  ripe avocado -- chopped
  8             ounces  nonfat plain yogurt
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeds removed
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
  4                     whole-wheat tortillas
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2         pound  seitan
  3          teaspoons  olive oil
  2             medium  onions -- thinly sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2             medium  red bell peppers -- cut 1" squares

Cut seitan into 1/2-inch pieces.  (You should have 1 1/2 cups.)  In large, nonstick skillet, heat 2 teaspoons oil over medium heat.  Add seitan and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 6 minutes.  Remove from pan and set aside.

Wipe out skillet.  Heat remaining teaspoon oil over medium heat.  Add onions and cook, stirring often, until beginning to brown, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add garlic, red peppers and oregano and cook, stirring often, 5 minutes.  Stir in broth and seitan and simmer until red pepper is tender, 3 minutes.  Add scallions and salt and black pepper to taste.  Stir 1 to 2 minutes more.

In food processor, make sauce by combining avocado, yogurt, jalapeÒo, lime juice and 3/4 teaspoon salt.  Process until smooth and creamy.  Add cilantro and pulse to combine.  Taste for salt and add more if necessary.

Warm tortillas briefly in heated skillet.  Serve tortillas mounded with seitan mixture and generous dollop of Avocado-Yogurt sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 386 Cal; 23g Prot; 10g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 50g Carb.; 1mg Chol; 822mg Sod.; 9g Fiber.

Comments:  The creamy avocado and yogurt sauce gives this simple south-of-the-border meal extra flair.  Look for whole wheat tortillas in natural food shops or gourmet stores.

Serve with shredded romaine lettuce topped with spoonfuls of salsa.  For a light dessert, serve wedges of mango sprinkled with lime.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  lukewarm water
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  2 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 2 1/2)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  semolina -- plus
                        more for dusting
                        === GLAZE ===
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  water
                        === TOPPING ===
  4          teaspoons  sesame seeds
  4          teaspoons  caraway seeds
  4          teaspoons  fennel seeds
                        Salt -- to taste

In large mixing bowl, stir together 1 1/4 cups lukewarm water (120 to 130 degrees) and sugar.  Sprinkle in yeast and let stand until dissolved and foamy, 8 to 10 minutes.  Gradually whisk in 1 cup all-purpose flour.  Beat about 1 minute.  Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature until bubbly and sponge-like, about 1 hour.

Stir down sponge.  Stir in oil and salt.  Gradually beat in semolina.  Add just enough of remaining 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour until dough is too stiff to stir.  (The dough should be soft.)  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead, adding just enough flour to prevent sticking, until dough is smooth and elastic, 5 to 10 minutes.  (You can mix and knead dough in stand-up mixer fitted with paddle attachment, then dough hook.)

Place dough in lightly oiled large bowl and turn to coat.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Place baking stone or inverted baking sheet on bottom rack of oven to heat.  Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  (Heat baking stone for 25 minutes before baking; heat baking sheet for 10 minutes.)

Punch dough down.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead several times.  Divide dough into 8 pieces.  Form each piece into ball.  Cover and let rest 10 minutes.

Dust pizza peel or large spatula with semolina.  In small bowl, combine egg and 1 tablespoon water; stir briskly with fork.  In another small bowl, mix sesame, caraway, fennel seeds and salt.  Working with two pieces dough at a time, on lightly floured surface, use rolling pin to roll dough into 7- to 7 1/2-inch circle, slightly less than 1/4-inch thick.  (Keep remaining dough pieces covered while you are working.)  Place dough circles on pizza peel.  Brush with egg glaze.  Sprinkle each with 1 1/2 teaspoons seed mixture.  Using your hands, gently press seeds into dough.  Prick dough all over with fork.

Working quickly, open oven door, hold pizza peel at slight angle and tip end toward back of baking stone.  Give pizza peel a quick jerk, letting one flatbread slide onto baking stone.  Immediately, give peel another jerk and let second flatbread slide onto baking stone.  Quickly close oven door and bake flatbreads until puffed in places and bottoms are lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes.  Immediately wrap baked flatbreads in kitchen towel to keep soft and warm.  While first batch bakes, roll out 2 more dough circles.  Continue baking and shaping flatbreads until all dough and seed topping is used.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

In large mixing bowl, stir together 1 1/4 cups lukewarm water (120 to 130 degrees) and sugar.  Sprinkle in yeast and let stand until dissolved and foamy, 8 to 10 minutes.  Gradually whisk in 1 cup all-purpose flour.  Beat about 1 minute.  Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature until bubbly and sponge-like, about 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir down sponge.  Stir in oil and salt.  Gradually beat in semolina.  Add just enough of remaining 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour until dough is too stiff to stir.  (The dough should be soft.)  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead, adding just enough flour to prevent sticking, until dough is smooth and elastic, 5 to 10 minutes.  (You can mix and knead dough in stand-up mixer fitted with paddle attachment, then dough hook.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place dough in lightly oiled large bowl and turn to coat.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place baking stone or inverted baking sheet on bottom rack of oven to heat.  Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  (Heat baking stone for 25 minutes before baking; heat baking sheet for 10 minutes.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Punch dough down.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead several times.  Divide dough into 8 pieces.  Form each piece into ball.  Cover and let rest 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dust pizza peel or large spatula with semolina.  In small bowl, combine egg and 1 tablespoon water; stir briskly with fork.  In another small bowl, mix sesame, caraway, fennel seeds and salt.  Working with two pieces dough at a time, on lightly floured surface, use rolling pin to roll dough into 7- to 7 1/2-inch circle, slightly less than 1/4-inch thick.  (Keep remaining dough pieces covered while you are working.)  Place dough circles on pizza peel.  Brush with egg glaze.  Sprinkle each with 1 1/2 teaspoons seed mixture.  Using your hands, gently press seeds into dough.  Prick dough all over with fork.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Working quickly, open oven door, hold pizza peel at slight angle and tip end toward back of baking stone.  Give pizza peel a quick jerk, letting one flatbread slide onto baking stone.  Immediately, give peel another jerk and let second flatbread slide onto baking stone.  Quickly close oven door and bake flatbreads until puffed in places and bottoms are lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes.  Immediately wrap baked flatbreads in kitchen towel to keep soft and warm.  While first batch bakes, roll out 2 more dough circles.  Continue baking and shaping flatbreads until all dough and seed topping is used.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  dried chipotle chile
                        = (or 1/8 tspn ground chile)
  1 1/2         ounces  smoked dulse
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground coriander
  1 1/2      teaspoons  paprika
  2              small  bay leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  caraway seeds
     1/4           cup  maple sugar
  2          teaspoons  dried thyme
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  blackstrap molasses
  1 1/2           cups  apple cider
  2           packages  tempeh - (8 oz ea) -- each cut cross-wise
                        into 12 thin strips

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place chipotle and dulse on baking sheet and toast in oven until crisp, about 10 minutes.  Let cool.

In food processor, blender or with mortar and pestle, combine chipotle pepper, dulse, garlic powder, coriander, paprika, bay leaves, caraway seeds, maple sugar, thyme and salt and pepper to taste.  Process to fine powder (you may have to do this in two batches).

In medium bowl, combine oil, vinegar, molasses and cider.  Whisk in spice mixture.  Add tempeh to marinade and toss to coat.  Let stand 15 minutes.

In large, shallow baking dish, place marinated tempeh in single layer.  Bake until marinade is almost completely absorbed, about 40 minutes.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 288 Cal; 14g Prot; 15g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 27g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 1091mg Sod.; 0g Fiber.

Comments:  This recipe has a wonderful smoky flavor that comes from using smoked dulse and chipotle peppers.  The wedges can be served hot or cold, but the ultimate way is to make them into a sandwich on slices of toasted sourdough spelt bread with soy mayonnaise, sliced tomato and crisp romaine lettuce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  frozen baby lima beans - (10 oz)
  1                cup  quick-cooking barley
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- thinly sliced
     1/3           cup  tomato juice
  3         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce

Cook lima beans according to package directions; drain and cool.

In medium saucepan, bring 3 cups water to a boil.  Add barley and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain, rinse under cold water and drain again, pressing to remove excess moisture.

Transfer barley to medium bowl.  Add lima beans and red pepper.

In small bowl, whisk together tomato juice, lime juice, oil, cilantro, garlic, cumin, oregano and hot sauce.  Add salt to taste.  Pour dressing over barley mixture and toss to blend.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 252 Cal; 7g Prot; 7g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 41g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 88mg Sod.; 8g Fiber.

Comments:  Quick-cooking barley is available in most supermarkets.  It cooks in 10 minutes, as opposed to regular pearled barley, which takes at least 40.

Serve this spicy salad with baked marinated tofu and a fresh tomato and cucumber salad.

  2          teaspoons  olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled, halved
     1/4           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  2              large  red or white potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" cubes - (2 cups)
  1                cup  seasoned soy "sausage" meat - (4 1/4 oz)
  4              large  eggs

In 10-inch skillet, heat 2 teaspoons oil over medium-high heat.  Add garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Remove garlic.  Add crumbs and stir until brown, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove to plate and let cool.  Wipe out pan well with paper towel.

Return skillet to medium-high heat.  Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil.  Add potatoes, spreading in single layer.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 4 to 5 minutes.  Stir in soy sausage and cook until potatoes are coated and mixture is hot, 1 minute.

Using the back of wooden spoon, make four indentations in potato mixture.  Carefully break an egg into each "nest."  Cover and cook until eggs are done the way you like them -- about 3 minutes for soft yolks, 4 for firm yolks.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 309 Cal; 18g Prot; 13g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 34g Carb.; 213mg Chol; 396mg Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  "Migas" means crumbs in Spanish.  In Spain, this rustic dish is made by pounding the bread while it toasts in a pan, until it falls into crumbs.  Our version takes far less time.

  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- quartered, and
                        thinly sliced
  2                     garlic cloves - (to 3) -- minced
  2              large  potatoes -- peeled, diced
  3             medium  carrots -- peeled, sliced
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  8             ounces  white or cremini mushrooms -- stemmed, sliced
  1 1/2       teaspoon  sweet paprika
  8                     asparagus spears -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  1                can  artichoke hearts - (15 oz) -- drained, quartered
  1                cup  frozen green peas

In soup pot, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, 4 minutes.  Add garlic and continue to stir until onion is golden, another 8 minutes.

Add potatoes, carrots, 2 cups water, wine, mushrooms and paprika.  Increase heat slightly to bring to a simmer, then reduce heat, cover and simmer until potatoes and carrots are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.  Add asparagus and cook over low heat until tender but still crisp, 4 to 6 minutes.

Stir in artichoke hearts, peas and parsley.  Add lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste.  Cook over low heat 5 minutes longer.  If time allows, let stew stand for an hour or so before serving.  Reheat gently as needed; taste and correct seasonings and add just a bit more water if needed.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 275 Cal; 6g Prot; 3g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 29g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 91mg Sod.; 9g Fiber.

Comments:  This classic stew has many regional variations, and it can be made with different vegetables according to season.  Fresh artichokes are called for in traditional recipes, but using the canned variety simplifies the process.  Be sure to enjoy the wonderful aroma of the stew as it cooks.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1                cup  diced peeled seeded tomatoes
  1                cup  finely-chopped mushrooms
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR PICKLED EGGPLANT ===
  1                cup  rice vinegar
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1              piece  ginger - (abt 2") -- thinly sliced
  1              piece  kombu (dried seaweed), 2" square
  2                     Japanese eggplants
                        === FOR BLACK OLIVE SOY SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  Kalamata olives -- pitted
  1              small  garlic clove
     1/2           cup  low-sodium soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
                        === FOR SUSHI-RICE RISOTTO ===
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              piece  kombu seaweed, 2" square
     1/2           cup  rice vinegar
     1/3           cup  sushi rice or short-grained rice
  16                    snow peas
     1/4           cup  fresh yellow corn kernels
     1/2        medium  avocado -- peeled, pitted,
                        and diced small
  4             medium  red ripe tomatoes
  8                     oba leaves
  1                     Japanese cucumber -- peeled, and
                        cut into very fine strips
  8             pieces  pickled Japanese eggplant
                        Black Olive Soy Sauce -- (listed above)
                        Italian parsley -- for garnish
  1                     Tokyo green onion -- cut very fine strips

For Pickled Eggplant:  In a nonreactive bowl, combine the vinegar, sugar, ginger and kombu.  Stir to dissolve the sugar.  Cut the eggplant into 2-inch rounds, then cut the rounds in half and add to the vinegar mixture.  Marinate at least overnight for a sweet taste and up to 24 hours for more of a sour flavor.

For Olive Soy Sauce:  Place the olives, garlic, soy sauce and balsamic vinegar in food processor.  Puree until thoroughly combined.  Set aside.

For Sushi-Rice Risotto:  Combine the sugar, seaweed and vinegar and stir to dissolve sugar.  Place the rice in a small saucepan with 2/3 cup water.  Bring to a boil, then turn down heat and simmer for 10 minutes to make 1 cup of cooked rice.  Stir 3 tablespoons of the sugar-seaweed-vinegar mixture into the rice and set aside.

Cut both ends of each snow pea to make decorative V-shaped notches.  Blanch the peas for 2 minutes in boiling water, remove and place in an ice-water bath, then drain.  Blanch the corn kernels in boiling water for 2 minutes, remove and place in an ice-water bath, then drain.

Combine the rice, corn and avocado and set aside.  Peel the tomatoes by cutting an X in the bottom of each and then plunging them into boiling water for 30 seconds and then into an ice bath before peeling.  Cut off the top of each tomato and dice for garnish.  Carefully scoop out the seeds to form a cup.

To assemble, place 2 oba leaves on each of four plates.  Pile a small handful of Japanese cucumber strips in the center of plate and place a tomato on top.  Divide the risotto-corn mixture between the 4 tomato cups and fill.  Place 4 snow peas into each cup fanning out like a flower.  Put 2 pickled eggplant pieces on top of each tomato.  Drizzle black olive soy sauce over the filled tomatoes and around the plate.  Garnish the top of the tomato with Italian parsley.  Sprinkle the diced tomato and Tokyo green onion strips around the plate.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 228 Calories, 6g Protein, 42g Carbohydrates, 6g Fat, 0 Cholesterol, 1,162mg Sodium, 6g Fiber.

Comments:  Look for ingredients in Asian markets and food sections of well-stocked groceries.  Tokyo green onions are larger than regular green onions but smaller than leeks.  Oba leaves are large shiso leaves.  Both are available in Japanese markets.  Start the pickled eggplant the day before.

For Pickled Eggplant:  In a nonreactive bowl, combine the vinegar, sugar, ginger and kombu.  Stir to dissolve the sugar.  Cut the eggplant into 2-inch rounds, then cut the rounds in half and add to the vinegar mixture.  Marinate at least overnight for a sweet taste and up to 24 hours for more of a sour flavor.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Olive Soy Sauce:  Place the olives, garlic, soy sauce and balsamic vinegar in food processor.  Puree until thoroughly combined.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Sushi-Rice Risotto:  Combine the sugar, seaweed and vinegar and stir to dissolve sugar.  Place the rice in a small saucepan with 2/3 cup water.  Bring to a boil, then turn down heat and simmer for 10 minutes to make 1 cup of cooked rice.  Stir 3 tablespoons of the sugar-seaweed-vinegar mixture into the rice and set aside.

Cut both ends of each snow pea to make decorative V-shaped notches.  Blanch the peas for 2 minutes in boiling water, remove and place in an ice-water bath, then drain.  Blanch the corn kernels in boiling water for 2 minutes, remove and place in an ice-water bath, then drain.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the rice, corn and avocado and set aside.  Peel the tomatoes by cutting an X in the bottom of each and then plunging them into boiling water for 30 seconds and then into an ice bath before peeling.  Cut off the top of each tomato and dice for garnish.  Carefully scoop out the seeds to form a cup.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble, place 2 oba leaves on each of four plates.  Pile a small handful of Japanese cucumber strips in the center of plate and place a tomato on top.  Divide the risotto-corn mixture between the 4 tomato cups and fill.  Place 4 snow peas into each cup fanning out like a flower.  Put 2 pickled eggplant pieces on top of each tomato.  Drizzle black olive soy sauce over the filled tomatoes and around the plate.  Garnish the top of the tomato with Italian parsley.  Sprinkle the diced tomato and Tokyo green onion strips around the plate.

Comments:  Look for ingredients in Asian markets and food sections of well-stocked groceries.  Tokyo green onions are larger than regular green onions but smaller than leeks.  Oba leaves are large shiso leaves.  Both are available in Japanese markets.  Start the pickled eggplant the day before.

  1           teaspoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin

  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1              pinch  cayenne
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped scallions -- white and light
                        green parts
     1/2           cup  unbleached white flour
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1         tablespoon  kudzu
                        Fresh Mango Chutney -- (see recipe)

In medium saucepan, combine black beans, chili powder, cumin, coriander, 1 teaspoon of the salt, tamari, umeboshi vinegar, hot pepper sauce and cilantro.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 2 minutes.  Stir in lime juice, cover and remove from heat.

In large saucepan fitted with steamer basket, bring 2 inches water to a boil over high heat.  Add sweet potatoes, cover and steam until tender, about 15 minutes.

Transfer sweet potatoes to large bowl and mash.  Add cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, 1/4 teaspoon salt, cayenne and scallions and mix well.  Drain beans and gently stir beans into sweet potato mixture.

In shallow bowl, combine flour, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and white pepper.  In small food processor or using a mortar and pestle, grind kudzu to fine powder.  Add to flour mixture.

Form sweet potato mixture into balls, using 1/4 cup mixture for each.  Roll in flour mixture, then press into round patty.  Be sure both sides are evenly coated with flour.

In large skillet, heat 1/8 inch vegetable oil over medium-high heat.  When oil is hot but not smoking, add croquettes in batches.  Cook until croquettes are browned, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer to plate lined with paper towels to remove excess oil.

Serve croquettes topped with 1 to 2 tablespoons Fresh Mango Chutney.  Garnish with sprigs of mint or cilantro.

This recipe yields 16 croquettes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  tempeh - (8 oz ea) -- cut 1/2" dice
  8                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- cut medium dice
  2        tablespoons  drained capers -- coarsely chopped
  8        tablespoons  chopped kalamata olives
  4               cups  low-sodium vegetable broth
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 oz) -- undrained
  2              large  bay leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  saffron -- (optional)
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  dried tarragon
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  fennel seed
     1/2      teaspoon  celery seed
  1                cup  flat-leaf parsley - (loosely packed) -- chopped

In large, heavy saucepan, place all ingredients except parsley.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Bring to a simmer, cover and cook over medium heat, 45 minutes.  Remove bay leaves.  Stir in parsley just before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 275 Cal; 17g Prot; 7g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 21g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 343mg Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Comments:  The word bouillabaisse actually means to boil and reduce, and this is exactly what we do here.  Simmering infuses the flavors into the tempeh, and as the liquid reduces, it further intensifies the bouquet of herbs, saffron, wine and tomatoes.  Made a day ahead, the bouillabaisse tastes even better.  Serve this dish in deep bowls with some of its broth and some fresh, crusty French bread and slices of roasted red pepper.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  low-sodium vegetable broth
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar
  1                cup  apple cider
  1         tablespoon  hot Hungarian paprika -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  hot Hungarian paprika
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  caraway seeds
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2           packages  tempeh - (8 oz ea) -- cut 1" dice
  3              large  Spanish onions -- thinly sliced
  1                can  tomato paste - (6 oz)
  3        tablespoons  kudzu -- dissolved in
  4        tablespoons  cold water

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  In large saucepan, bring broth to a simmer.  Turn off heat; cover to keep warm.

Add broth to pan with onions and stir until mixture is well blended.  Remove tempeh from oven and add to pan, along with remainng cooking liquid; stir well.

Cover pan and bake, stirring occasionally, 45 minutes.  Serve hot.

  1              piece  ginger - (2" long) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3 pieces
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  2         tablespoon  maple syrup
  1              pound  extra-firm tofu
  2             medium  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  1             medium  parsnip -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  1                     chunk daikon -- (5 inch) peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces

  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds
  2         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro

Bring large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

In medium saucepan, combine apple juice, tamari, ginger, garlic and maple syrup.  Place tofu on its side and cut into 4 even slabs.  Cut each slab on diagonal into triangles.  You should have 8 triangles.  Add tofu to saucepan and bring liquid to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.  Remove tofu, set on plate and pat dry.  Reserve marinade.

Add carrots, parsnip and daikon pieces to boiling water.  Cook until vegetables are just tender, about 8 minutes.  Drain and set aside.

In large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add tofu and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.  Remove to plate.

Pour reserved marinade into skillet and bring to a boil.  Add dissolved arrowroot and stir continuously until mixture thickens, about 1 minute.  Stir vegetables and tofu into glaze and toss to coat.

Transfer mixture to serving platter or 4 individual plates.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds and cilantro and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 244 Cal; 8g Prot; 8g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 34g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 876mg Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Comments:  The recipe uses carrots, parsnips and daikon, but feel free to substitute your favorite roots.  You will need a total of about 1 pound of vegetables.

While the tofu is simmering, cook up some quick brown rice and make a simple watercress, cucumber and orange salad tossed with brown rice vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil.

                      Tofu Scramble With Fresh Herbs

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Dairy Free

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  soft tofu
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  2              large  scallions, white and light green parts -- finely chopped
     1/8      teaspoon  ground turmeric
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6             medium  basil leaves - (to 8) -- cut crosswise
                        into fine shreds - (1 tbspn)
  1         tablespoon  snipped chives
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh dill
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Cut tofu block in half horizontally, then cut in half lengthwise, keeping block intact.  One at a time, take a piece of tofu in your hand.  Holding it over sink, squeeze tofu gently but firmly until it crumbles slightly and water drips out.  When about half the moisture has been removed, place tofu in bowl.  Repeat until all tofu has been squeezed.

In nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add scallions.  Stir just until they sizzle, 30 seconds.  Add turmeric, salt and tofu.  Stir with wooden spoon, breaking up tofu, until it is evenly golden and moist, about 1 minute.  Mix in basil, chives, dill and parsley.  Stir gently until tofu looks like well-set scrambled eggs, about 1 minute.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Per Serving: 122 Cal; 14g Prot; 5g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 4g Carb.;mg Chol; 724mg Sod.; 0g Fiber.

Comments:  Served piping hot, this golden tofu is remarkably like freshly scrambled eggs, flavored with basil, dill and chives.  Squeezing the tofu will extract about 3 tablespoons of liquid and will keep the dish from becoming watery.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2        medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1              small  carrot -- thinly sliced
  1              small  celery stalk -- thinly sliced
     1/2        medium  green bell pepper -- finely chopped
  1 1/2           cups  tomato sauce
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (1" long) -- cut into 4 slices
  1                can  yellow soybeans - (15 oz) -- with liquid
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

In medium skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add onion, garlic, carrot, celery and green pepper and cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften, 3 minutes.  Add tomato sauce, ginger and soybeans with liquid and stir well.  Stir in basil and parsley.

Reduce heat to medium-low.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Simmer, uncovered, until vegetables are just tender, 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove and discard ginger.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 239 Cal; 16g Prot; 11g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 240g Carb.; 0mg Chol; 607mg Sod.; 7g Fiber.

Comments:  Once you've done the chopping, this simple sauce practically makes itself.  Serve it over noodles, rice or roasted eggplant.  Since it improves with age, consider making it a day or two ahead, then reheating just before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  rice milk - (32 oz)
  2               cans  tomato paste - (6 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2 1/2       teaspoon  olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              large  onion -- diced - (2 cups)
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  celery seed
     1/2      teaspoon  anise seed
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (28 oz)
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper

In medium saucepan, combine rice milk and tomato paste and bring to a simmer over medium heat, about 10 minutes.  Whisk in mustard; cover and keep warm.

In large, heavy pot, heat oil over low heat.  Add garlic, onion, coriander, celery seed, anise seed and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring often, 2 minutes.

Add diced tomatoes and capers, increase heat to medium and cook 10 minutes.  Stir in pepper and remaining 1 teaspoon salt.  Stir in warm rice milk mixture and lower heat slightly to maintain simmer, 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool slightly.

In blender or food processor, carefully puree bisque in batches until smooth.  If desired, strain mixture through fine sieve, using rubber spatula to press mixture.  Return mixture to pan and warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 187 Cal; 9g Prot; 5g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 30g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 530mg  Sod.; 6g Fiber.

Comments:  Original bisques were thickened with cooked rice; here the rice milk is a nod to tradition.  The rice milk, however, does not thicken the soup; the tomato paste does that job.  The capers give the soup a tangy, salty twist that sets it apart from the ordinary.

Comments:  Original bisques were thickened with cooked rice; here the rice milk is a nod to tradition.  The rice milk, however, does not thicken the soup; the tomato paste does that job.  The capers give the soup a tangy, salty twist that sets it apart from the ordinary.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  whole wheat flour
  1            package  quick-rising dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     3/4           cup  hot water
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
                        === FILLING ===
  1                     egg
                        Cottage cheese -- as needed
                        Feta cheese -- as needed
                        Scallions -- to taste
                        Dill -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GLAZE ===
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  water
                        Sesame seeds -- as needed

In food processor fitted with metal blade, combine flours, yeast, salt and sugar; pulse on/off to mix.  In measuring cup, combine 3/4 cup hot water (120 to 130 degrees) and oil.  With motor running, gradually pour hot liquid through food processor feed tube.  Process until dough forms ball, then process 1 minute to knead.  The dough should be quite soft.  If it seems dry, add 1 to 2 tablespoons warm water; if too sticky, add 1 to 2 tablespoons flour.  Transfer dough to lightly floured surface and knead a few times.  Spray sheet of plastic wrap with cooking spray and place, sprayed-side down, over dough.  Let dough rest 20 to 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, place baking stone or inverted baking sheet on bottom rack of oven to heat.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  (Heat baking stone for 25 minutes before baking; heat baking sheet for 10 minutes.)

Make Filling:  In medium bowl, whisk 1 egg.  Add cottage cheese, feta, scallions, dill and pepper; mix well.

Make Glaze:  In small bowl, combine 1 egg and 1 tablespoon water; stir briskly with fork.

Assemble pide:  Coat another baking sheet with cooking spray.  Divide dough into 4 pieces.  On lightly floured surface, use rolling pin to roll 1 piece of dough into 8 1/2- by 6 1/2-inch oval, slightly less than 1/4-inch thick.  (Keep remaining pieces of dough covered while you work.)  Brush a little egg glaze around border of oval.  Place about 1/3 cup cheese filling in center of oval, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border all around.  Bring edges of long sides of the oval together and pinch to seal from end to end.  Fold over tips at narrow ends and pinch to seal.  Use wide metal spatula to transfer pide to prepared baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.

Brush tops of pide with egg glaze and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Place baking sheet on heated baking stone or inverted baking sheet and bake pide until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.  Transfer to rack and let cool at least 10 minutes before serving hot or warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 401 Cal; 20g Prot; 14g Total Fat (6 Sat. Fat); 51g Carb.; 135mg Chol; 26mg Sod.; 6g Fiber.

Comments:  Small stuffed breads called pide are popular snacks in Turkey.  Accompanied by a crisp shepherd's salad of chopped tomato, onion, cucumber and bell pepper dressed with parsley, olive oil and lemon juice, they make a light yet satisfying meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  2               cups  whole-wheat flour
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed

In large bowl, mix 1 1/4 cups lukewarm water and sugar.  Sprinkle in yeast and let stand until foamy, 10 minutes.  With wooden spoon, gradually beat in whole wheat flour.  Beat about 2 minutes.  Stir in oil and salt.  Gradually beat in just enough all-purpose flour until dough is too stiff to stir.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead, adding just enough flour to prevent sticking, until smooth and elastic, 5 to 10 minutes.  (You can mix and knead dough in stand-up mixer fitted with paddle attachment, then dough hook.)

Place dough in lightly oiled large bowl and turn to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Place baking stone or inverted baking sheet on bottom rack of oven to heat.  Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  (Heat baking stone for 25 minutes before baking; heat baking sheet for 10 minutes.)

Punch dough down.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead a few times.  Divide dough into 8 pieces.  Form each piece into a ball.  Cover with kitchen towel and let rest 20 minutes.

On lightly floured surface, use rolling pin to roll 2 pieces of dough into 7- to 7 1/2-inch circles, slightly less than 1/4-inch thick.  (Keep remaining dough pieces covered while you are working.)  Place dough circles on another baking sheet.

Working quickly, use wide metal spatula to transfer dough circles to heated baking stone.  Bake pitas until puffed and lightly browned around the edges, 5 to 6 minutes.

Immediately wrap baked pitas in kitchen towel to keep them warm and soft.  While the first batch of pitas bakes, roll out 2 more dough circles.  Continue baking and rolling pitas until all dough is used.

This recipe yields 8 servings.
